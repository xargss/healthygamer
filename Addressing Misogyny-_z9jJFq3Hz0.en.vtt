00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
so that's one way that we address it um
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.230 align:start position:0%
so that's one way that we address it um

okay there
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.389 align:start position:0%
okay there
um<00:02:00.479><c> the</c><00:02:00.640><c> other</c><00:02:00.799><c> thing</c><00:02:01.040><c> is</c><00:02:01.119><c> that</c><00:02:01.280><c> i</c><00:02:01.520><c> i</c><00:02:01.759><c> tend</c><00:02:02.000><c> to</c>

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that i i tend to
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.630 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that i i tend to
not

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
sometimes<00:02:05.200><c> address</c><00:02:05.520><c> it</c><00:02:05.680><c> directly</c><00:02:06.240><c> because</c>

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes address it directly because
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.669 align:start position:0%
sometimes address it directly because
i<00:02:08.319><c> think</c><00:02:08.479><c> that</c><00:02:08.640><c> the</c><00:02:08.800><c> real</c><00:02:09.039><c> way</c><00:02:09.200><c> to</c><00:02:09.360><c> address</c>

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
i think that the real way to address
 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
i think that the real way to address
misogyny<00:02:10.319><c> is</c><00:02:10.479><c> by</c><00:02:10.640><c> like</c><00:02:10.879><c> addressing</c><00:02:11.280><c> the</c><00:02:11.440><c> human</c>

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
misogyny is by like addressing the human
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.589 align:start position:0%
misogyny is by like addressing the human
being<00:02:12.080><c> underneath</c><00:02:12.640><c> and</c><00:02:12.879><c> understanding</c><00:02:13.360><c> where</c>

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
being underneath and understanding where
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
being underneath and understanding where
it<00:02:13.680><c> comes</c><00:02:13.920><c> from</c><00:02:14.160><c> and</c><00:02:14.239><c> sort</c><00:02:14.400><c> of</c><00:02:14.480><c> helping</c><00:02:14.879><c> people</c>

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
it comes from and sort of helping people
 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
it comes from and sort of helping people
so<00:02:15.680><c> for</c><00:02:15.760><c> example</c><00:02:16.160><c> shunya</c><00:02:16.560><c> meditations</c><00:02:17.120><c> i</c>

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
so for example shunya meditations i
 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.710 align:start position:0%
so for example shunya meditations i
think<00:02:17.440><c> are</c><00:02:17.520><c> actually</c><00:02:17.840><c> my</c><00:02:18.000><c> way</c><00:02:18.160><c> of</c><00:02:18.319><c> addressing</c>

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
think are actually my way of addressing
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.430 align:start position:0%
think are actually my way of addressing
misogyny<00:02:19.680><c> because</c><00:02:20.319><c> the</c><00:02:20.560><c> more</c><00:02:20.800><c> that</c><00:02:21.120><c> you</c>

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
misogyny because the more that you
 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
misogyny because the more that you
practice<00:02:21.840><c> shunya</c><00:02:22.160><c> meditation</c><00:02:22.959><c> the</c><00:02:23.120><c> less</c>

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
practice shunya meditation the less
 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
practice shunya meditation the less
misogynistic<00:02:24.400><c> or</c><00:02:24.480><c> misandristic</c><00:02:25.599><c> you</c><00:02:25.680><c> will</c>

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
misogynistic or misandristic you will
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.190 align:start position:0%
misogynistic or misandristic you will
become

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
become
 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.710 align:start position:0%
become
so<00:02:27.440><c> i</c><00:02:27.599><c> think</c><00:02:27.760><c> there's</c><00:02:27.920><c> a</c><00:02:28.000><c> lot</c><00:02:28.160><c> of</c><00:02:28.239><c> stuff</c><00:02:28.400><c> that</c><00:02:28.560><c> i</c>

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a lot of stuff that i
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.550 align:start position:0%
so i think there's a lot of stuff that i
try<00:02:28.959><c> to</c><00:02:29.120><c> do</c>

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
because i was like looking at that and i
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.710 align:start position:0%
because i was like looking at that and i
was<00:02:44.480><c> like</c><00:02:44.720><c> oh</c><00:02:45.360><c> it's</c><00:02:46.080><c> people</c><00:02:46.319><c> are</c><00:02:46.400><c> actually</c>

responding really well and i was
 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.750 align:start position:0%
responding really well and i was

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
the red pill subreddit for example like
 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.030 align:start position:0%
the red pill subreddit for example like
that<00:02:52.080><c> would</c><00:02:52.239><c> get</c><00:02:52.400><c> down</c><00:02:52.640><c> voted</c><00:02:52.959><c> into</c><00:02:53.200><c> oblivion</c>

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
that would get down voted into oblivion
 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
that would get down voted into oblivion
and<00:02:55.120><c> then</c><00:02:55.280><c> i</c><00:02:55.519><c> also</c><00:02:55.760><c> kind</c><00:02:55.920><c> of</c><00:02:56.000><c> thought</c><00:02:56.160><c> about</c><00:02:56.400><c> it</c>

all address things somewhat indirectly
 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.070 align:start position:0%

and<00:03:07.200><c> the</c><00:03:07.360><c> reason</c><00:03:07.760><c> for</c><00:03:07.920><c> that</c><00:03:08.319><c> is</c><00:03:09.040><c> um</c>

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is um
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.229 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is um
i<00:03:10.239><c> just</c><00:03:10.400><c> think</c><00:03:10.640><c> it's</c><00:03:10.800><c> more</c><00:03:11.040><c> effective</c>

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
i just think it's more effective
 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.470 align:start position:0%
i just think it's more effective
so<00:03:12.720><c> this</c><00:03:12.959><c> is</c><00:03:13.040><c> where</c><00:03:13.280><c> i</c><00:03:13.440><c> get</c><00:03:13.680><c> concerned</c><00:03:14.319><c> about</c>

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
so this is where i get concerned about
 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.070 align:start position:0%
so this is where i get concerned about
things<00:03:14.720><c> like</c><00:03:14.879><c> virtue</c><00:03:15.280><c> signaling</c><00:03:15.680><c> so</c><00:03:15.840><c> if</c><00:03:16.000><c> i</c>
