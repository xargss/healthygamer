it's that simple right so if we look at
 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.749 align:start position:0%
it's that simple right so if we look at

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
it comes from like hurt
 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.870 align:start position:0%
it comes from like hurt
so<00:01:41.040><c> like</c><00:01:41.280><c> we</c><00:01:41.439><c> have</c><00:01:41.680><c> this</c><00:01:41.920><c> circuit</c><00:01:42.399><c> in</c><00:01:42.560><c> our</c>

it<00:01:45.520><c> is</c><00:01:45.680><c> but</c><00:01:45.840><c> i'm</c><00:01:46.000><c> sure</c><00:01:46.159><c> it's</c><00:01:46.320><c> there</c><00:01:46.560><c> because</c>

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
it is but i'm sure it's there because
 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.630 align:start position:0%
it is but i'm sure it's there because

really upset that he does treat you like

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
because that certainly sounds unfair
 

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
because that certainly sounds unfair
right<00:09:01.600><c> because</c><00:09:01.839><c> you're</c><00:09:02.160><c> treating</c><00:09:02.560><c> him</c><00:09:02.720><c> a</c>

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
right because you're treating him a
 

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.269 align:start position:0%
right because you're treating him a
certain<00:09:03.120><c> way</c><00:09:03.519><c> in</c><00:09:03.680><c> your</c><00:09:03.839><c> mind</c>

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
certain way in your mind
 

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.870 align:start position:0%
certain way in your mind
but<00:09:05.440><c> he's</c><00:09:05.680><c> not</c><00:09:05.920><c> treating</c><00:09:06.160><c> you</c><00:09:06.399><c> the</c><00:09:06.480><c> same</c><00:09:06.720><c> way</c>

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
but he's not treating you the same way
 

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.190 align:start position:0%
but he's not treating you the same way
so<00:09:07.040><c> there's</c><00:09:07.279><c> like</c><00:09:07.600><c> an</c><00:09:07.760><c> imbalance</c><00:09:08.399><c> there</c>

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
so there's like an imbalance there
 

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.389 align:start position:0%
so there's like an imbalance there
and<00:09:09.360><c> this</c><00:09:09.519><c> is</c><00:09:09.600><c> where</c><00:09:09.839><c> it</c><00:09:09.920><c> gets</c><00:09:10.080><c> further</c>

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
and this is where it gets further
 

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:11.590 align:start position:0%
and this is where it gets further
complicated<00:09:10.959><c> because</c><00:09:11.040><c> you</c><00:09:11.200><c> can't</c><00:09:11.360><c> really</c>

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
complicated because you can't really
 

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.030 align:start position:0%
complicated because you can't really

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
blame him for that stuff
 

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.790 align:start position:0%
blame him for that stuff
if<00:09:13.200><c> you</c><00:09:13.279><c> can't</c><00:09:13.519><c> blame</c><00:09:13.920><c> him</c><00:09:14.080><c> then</c><00:09:14.320><c> you</c><00:09:14.560><c> feel</c>

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
if you can't blame him then you feel
 

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
if you can't blame him then you feel

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
if i can't blame him i shouldn't feel
 

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.310 align:start position:0%
if i can't blame him i shouldn't feel
