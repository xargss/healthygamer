00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:01.310 align:start position:0%
I think both sides should put in the
 

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.329 align:start position:0%
I think both sides should put in the
effort<00:11:01.400><c> you</c><00:11:01.820><c> know</c><00:11:01.940><c> I</c><00:11:02.180><c> mean</c><00:11:02.720><c> I</c><00:11:02.930><c> said</c><00:11:03.650><c> think</c><00:11:03.980><c> you</c>

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:04.339 align:start position:0%
effort you know I mean I said think you
 

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
effort you know I mean I said think you
know<00:11:04.430><c> it</c><00:11:04.550><c> doesn't</c><00:11:04.700><c> just</c><00:11:04.790><c> apply</c><00:11:04.940><c> like</c><00:11:05.350><c> guy</c><00:11:06.350><c> to</c>

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:06.410 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't just apply like guy to
 

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.900 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't just apply like guy to
girl<00:11:06.740><c> relationship</c><00:11:07.160><c> you</c><00:11:07.280><c> know</c><00:11:07.370><c> really</c><00:11:07.670><c> real</c>

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:09.580 align:start position:0%
guy whatever so I think both sides
 

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.810 align:start position:0%
guy whatever so I think both sides
should<00:11:10.580><c> put</c><00:11:10.760><c> in</c><00:11:11.080><c> effort</c><00:11:12.080><c> equally</c><00:11:12.800><c> on</c><00:11:13.010><c> how</c><00:11:13.670><c> they</c>

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:57.770 align:start position:0%
kids at the same time and like that's
 

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.380 align:start position:0%
kids at the same time and like that's
not<00:11:57.980><c> having</c><00:11:58.399><c> someone</c><00:11:58.580><c> who</c><00:11:58.790><c> wouldn't</c><00:11:59.089><c> want</c><00:11:59.300><c> to</c>

00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.390 align:start position:0%
not having someone who wouldn't want to
 

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.690 align:start position:0%
not having someone who wouldn't want to

contribute in any way I just think yeah
 

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.449 align:start position:0%
contribute in any way I just think yeah
so<00:12:02.649><c> that</c><00:12:03.649><c> would</c><00:12:03.770><c> just</c><00:12:03.800><c> be</c><00:12:03.980><c> a</c><00:12:04.010><c> personal</c><00:12:04.339><c> issue</c>

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:04.459 align:start position:0%
so that would just be a personal issue

00:32:14.469 --> 00:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
and kind of moving on but um I I thought
 

00:32:14.479 --> 00:32:15.969 align:start position:0%
and kind of moving on but um I I thought
he<00:32:14.599><c> was</c><00:32:14.719><c> more</c><00:32:14.899><c> of</c><00:32:14.989><c> a</c><00:32:15.080><c> I</c><00:32:15.109><c> felt</c><00:32:15.589><c> like</c><00:32:15.739><c> I</c><00:32:15.799><c> had</c><00:32:15.919><c> to</c>

00:32:15.969 --> 00:32:15.979 align:start position:0%
he was more of a I felt like I had to
 

00:32:15.979 --> 00:32:17.379 align:start position:0%
he was more of a I felt like I had to
stand<00:32:16.099><c> up</c><00:32:16.249><c> for</c><00:32:16.369><c> myself</c><00:32:16.519><c> sort</c><00:32:16.849><c> of</c><00:32:16.879><c> thing</c><00:32:17.029><c> so</c><00:32:17.239><c> I'm</c>

00:32:17.379 --> 00:32:17.389 align:start position:0%
stand up for myself sort of thing so I'm
 

00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:18.430 align:start position:0%
stand up for myself sort of thing so I'm
not<00:32:17.599><c> sure</c><00:32:17.719><c> if</c><00:32:17.779><c> that's</c><00:32:17.929><c> what</c><00:32:18.080><c> they're</c><00:32:18.229><c> feeling</c>

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's what they're feeling
 

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.709 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's what they're feeling
but<00:32:18.710><c> it</c><00:32:18.799><c> might</c><00:32:18.950><c> be</c><00:32:19.099><c> so</c><00:32:19.820><c> my</c><00:32:19.969><c> guess</c><00:32:20.210><c> is</c><00:32:20.239><c> that</c><00:32:20.570><c> they</c>

00:32:20.709 --> 00:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
but it might be so my guess is that they
 

00:32:20.719 --> 00:32:24.489 align:start position:0%
but it might be so my guess is that they
would<00:32:20.869><c> feel</c><00:32:21.109><c> righteous</c><00:32:22.509><c> yeah</c><00:32:23.509><c> any</c><00:32:23.989><c> sense</c><00:32:24.229><c> I</c>

00:32:24.489 --> 00:32:24.499 align:start position:0%
would feel righteous yeah any sense I
 

00:32:24.499 --> 00:32:26.349 align:start position:0%
would feel righteous yeah any sense I
think<00:32:24.830><c> I</c><00:32:25.009><c> can</c><00:32:25.219><c> describe</c><00:32:25.549><c> both</c><00:32:25.789><c> sides</c><00:32:25.999><c> for</c><00:32:26.239><c> sure</c>

00:32:26.349 --> 00:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
think I can describe both sides for sure
 

00:32:26.359 --> 00:32:29.019 align:start position:0%
think I can describe both sides for sure
yeah<00:32:27.320><c> I</c><00:32:27.589><c> mean</c><00:32:27.769><c> I</c><00:32:27.830><c> I</c><00:32:27.919><c> think</c><00:32:28.309><c> that</c><00:32:28.669><c> like</c><00:32:28.849><c> when</c>

00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:29.029 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I think that like when
 

00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I think that like when
people<00:32:29.239><c> you</c><00:32:29.659><c> know</c><00:32:29.779><c> they</c><00:32:29.899><c> feel</c><00:32:30.049><c> like</c><00:32:30.259><c> they're</c>

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:30.529 align:start position:0%
people you know they feel like they're
 

00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:32.469 align:start position:0%

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.260 align:start position:0%
explanation makes sense but at the same
time<00:32:45.320><c> I</c><00:32:45.380><c> think</c><00:32:45.530><c> taken</c><00:32:45.980><c> on</c><00:32:46.100><c> face</c><00:32:46.310><c> value</c><00:32:46.460><c> it</c><00:32:46.940><c> I</c>

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
time I think taken on face value it I
 

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:48.460 align:start position:0%

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:25.250 align:start position:0%
that discrimination is like a seesaw and
 

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.310 align:start position:0%
that discrimination is like a seesaw and

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
so that if you discriminate towards a

anything like that but I think if you
 

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
anything like that but I think if you
look<00:36:39.160><c> at</c><00:36:39.250><c> data</c><00:36:39.460><c> you</c><00:36:40.240><c> can</c><00:36:40.390><c> understand</c><00:36:40.870><c> that</c>

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:40.990 align:start position:0%
look at data you can understand that
 

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:43.770 align:start position:0%
look at data you can understand that
it's<00:36:41.890><c> possible</c><00:36:42.460><c> for</c><00:36:42.520><c> like</c><00:36:42.850><c> multiple</c><00:36:43.330><c> classes</c>

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:43.780 align:start position:0%
it's possible for like multiple classes
