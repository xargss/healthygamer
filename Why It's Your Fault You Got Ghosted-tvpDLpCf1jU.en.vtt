get out of this right so how do we stop
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.949 align:start position:0%
get out of this right so how do we stop
being<00:03:33.519><c> creepy</c><00:03:33.920><c> people</c><00:03:34.239><c> that</c><00:03:34.400><c> women</c><00:03:34.720><c> have</c><00:03:34.879><c> to</c>

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
then you separate from her right so
 

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.470 align:start position:0%
then you separate from her right so
she's<00:14:44.800><c> over</c><00:14:45.040><c> here</c><00:14:45.440><c> you</c><00:14:45.519><c> guys</c><00:14:45.760><c> are</c><00:14:45.839><c> together</c>

and then you start getting in your own
head<00:14:47.839><c> but</c><00:14:48.000><c> like</c><00:14:48.160><c> she</c><00:14:48.320><c> doesn't</c><00:14:48.560><c> understand</c>

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
head but like she doesn't understand
 

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.870 align:start position:0%

what's<00:14:49.120><c> going</c><00:14:49.279><c> on</c><00:14:49.440><c> here</c><00:14:50.079><c> so</c><00:14:50.399><c> like</c><00:14:50.560><c> you</c><00:14:50.720><c> start</c>

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on here so like you start
 

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.310 align:start position:0%
what's going on here so like you start
to<00:14:51.040><c> deviate</c><00:14:51.440><c> off</c><00:14:51.600><c> this</c><00:14:51.760><c> way</c><00:14:51.920><c> and</c><00:14:52.000><c> then</c><00:14:52.160><c> she's</c>

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
to deviate off this way and then she's
 

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.430 align:start position:0%
to deviate off this way and then she's
kind<00:14:52.480><c> of</c><00:14:52.560><c> going</c><00:14:52.800><c> this</c><00:14:52.880><c> way</c><00:14:53.040><c> and</c><00:14:53.199><c> then</c><00:14:53.279><c> it's</c>

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
kind of going this way and then it's
 

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.030 align:start position:0%
kind of going this way and then it's
like<00:14:54.079><c> then</c><00:14:54.320><c> the</c><00:14:54.399><c> relationship</c><00:14:54.959><c> falls</c><00:14:55.279><c> apart</c>

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
like then the relationship falls apart
 

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.710 align:start position:0%
like then the relationship falls apart
so<00:14:57.279><c> if</c><00:14:57.519><c> you</c><00:14:57.600><c> want</c><00:14:57.760><c> to</c><00:14:57.839><c> be</c><00:14:58.000><c> successful</c><00:14:58.560><c> in</c><00:14:58.639><c> a</c>

and<00:22:40.799><c> so</c><00:22:40.960><c> you're</c><00:22:41.200><c> kind</c><00:22:41.280><c> of</c><00:22:41.440><c> stuck</c><00:22:42.159><c> in</c><00:22:42.320><c> this</c><00:22:42.559><c> loop</c>

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so you're kind of stuck in this loop
 

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.270 align:start position:0%
and so you're kind of stuck in this loop
of<00:22:43.360><c> like</c><00:22:43.840><c> i</c><00:22:44.080><c> have</c><00:22:44.240><c> no</c><00:22:44.400><c> friends</c><00:22:44.720><c> and</c><00:22:44.799><c> therefore</c>

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
of like i have no friends and therefore
 

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.630 align:start position:0%
of like i have no friends and therefore
anytime<00:22:45.600><c> i</c><00:22:45.679><c> have</c><00:22:45.760><c> the</c><00:22:45.919><c> possibility</c><00:22:46.400><c> of</c><00:22:46.559><c> a</c>

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
anytime i have the possibility of a

anytime i have the possibility of a

00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
friend i put too much on them because
 

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:51.350 align:start position:0%
friend i put too much on them because
you<00:22:48.960><c> take</c><00:22:49.280><c> all</c><00:22:49.520><c> that</c><00:22:49.760><c> luggage</c><00:22:50.159><c> from</c><00:22:50.400><c> the</c><00:22:50.480><c> past</c>

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
you take all that luggage from the past
 

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.909 align:start position:0%
you take all that luggage from the past
and<00:22:51.520><c> you</c><00:22:51.760><c> dump</c><00:22:52.000><c> it</c><00:22:52.159><c> into</c><00:22:52.400><c> this</c><00:22:52.840><c> relationship</c>

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
and you dump it into this relationship
 

00:22:53.919 --> 00:22:55.190 align:start position:0%
and you dump it into this relationship
and<00:22:54.080><c> when</c><00:22:54.240><c> you</c><00:22:54.320><c> dump</c><00:22:54.559><c> it</c><00:22:54.640><c> on</c><00:22:54.720><c> then</c><00:22:54.960><c> it's</c><00:22:55.120><c> too</c>

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
and when you dump it on then it's too
 

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.390 align:start position:0%
and when you dump it on then it's too
much<00:22:55.360><c> for</c><00:22:55.440><c> them</c><00:22:55.600><c> to</c><00:22:55.679><c> handle</c><00:22:55.919><c> so</c><00:22:56.080><c> then</c><00:22:56.240><c> they</c>

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
much for them to handle so then they
 

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.830 align:start position:0%
much for them to handle so then they
leave<00:22:56.640><c> and</c><00:22:56.720><c> then</c><00:22:56.799><c> they</c><00:22:57.120><c> when</c><00:22:57.280><c> they</c><00:22:57.440><c> leave</c><00:22:57.679><c> they</c>

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
leave and then they when they leave they

00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
leave you a piece of luggage too so now
 

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.870 align:start position:0%
leave you a piece of luggage too so now
you've<00:22:59.679><c> got</c><00:22:59.840><c> one</c><00:23:00.000><c> more</c><00:23:00.159><c> piece</c><00:23:00.400><c> of</c><00:23:00.480><c> luggage</c><00:23:00.799><c> and</c>

you've got one more piece of luggage and
 

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.549 align:start position:0%
you've got one more piece of luggage and
then<00:23:01.039><c> the</c><00:23:01.120><c> next</c><00:23:01.280><c> person</c><00:23:01.600><c> comes</c><00:23:01.760><c> along</c><00:23:02.240><c> and</c><00:23:02.320><c> you</c>

00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
then the next person comes along and you
 

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:04.470 align:start position:0%
then the next person comes along and you
dump<00:23:02.960><c> 10</c><00:23:03.200><c> pieces</c><00:23:03.440><c> of</c><00:23:03.520><c> luggage</c><00:23:03.919><c> on</c><00:23:04.080><c> them</c><00:23:04.320><c> and</c>

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
dump 10 pieces of luggage on them and
 

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.590 align:start position:0%
dump 10 pieces of luggage on them and
it's<00:23:04.559><c> like</c><00:23:04.720><c> too</c><00:23:04.880><c> much</c><00:23:05.039><c> for</c><00:23:05.120><c> them</c><00:23:05.280><c> to</c><00:23:05.360><c> handle</c>

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's like too much for them to handle
 

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
it's like too much for them to handle
they're<00:23:05.679><c> like</c><00:23:05.840><c> i</c><00:23:06.159><c> can't</c><00:23:06.400><c> carry</c><00:23:06.640><c> all</c><00:23:06.799><c> this</c>

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're like i can't carry all this
 

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.870 align:start position:0%
they're like i can't carry all this
stuff<00:23:07.919><c> and</c><00:23:08.000><c> then</c><00:23:08.159><c> they</c><00:23:08.320><c> leave</c><00:23:08.559><c> and</c><00:23:08.720><c> then</c><00:23:08.799><c> you</c>

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
stuff and then they leave and then you
 

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.029 align:start position:0%
stuff and then they leave and then you
have<00:23:08.960><c> 11</c><00:23:09.280><c> pieces</c><00:23:09.600><c> of</c><00:23:09.679><c> luggage</c>

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
have 11 pieces of luggage
 

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
have 11 pieces of luggage
so<00:23:11.200><c> it's</c><00:23:11.360><c> really</c><00:23:11.600><c> hard</c><00:23:12.240><c> don't</c><00:23:12.400><c> get</c><00:23:12.559><c> me</c><00:23:12.720><c> wrong</c>

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
so it's really hard don't get me wrong
 

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.630 align:start position:0%
so it's really hard don't get me wrong
it's<00:23:13.200><c> very</c><00:23:13.440><c> hard</c>

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's very hard
 

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.470 align:start position:0%
it's very hard
and<00:23:14.799><c> so</c><00:23:14.960><c> that's</c><00:23:15.120><c> where</c><00:23:15.280><c> i</c><00:23:15.360><c> think</c><00:23:15.760><c> the</c><00:23:15.919><c> solution</c>

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
and so that's where i think the solution
 

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.430 align:start position:0%
and so that's where i think the solution
is<00:23:16.559><c> to</c><00:23:16.720><c> like</c><00:23:16.960><c> on</c><00:23:17.360><c> like</c><00:23:17.600><c> let</c><00:23:17.840><c> go</c><00:23:18.000><c> of</c><00:23:18.080><c> the</c><00:23:18.240><c> luggage</c>

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
is to like on like let go of the luggage
 

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.029 align:start position:0%
is to like on like let go of the luggage
right<00:23:19.760><c> like</c><00:23:19.919><c> you</c><00:23:20.000><c> have</c><00:23:20.080><c> to</c><00:23:20.240><c> work</c><00:23:20.559><c> through</c><00:23:20.799><c> that</c>

00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
right like you have to work through that
 

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:22.710 align:start position:0%
right like you have to work through that
stuff<00:23:21.200><c> you</c><00:23:21.360><c> have</c><00:23:21.440><c> to</c><00:23:21.520><c> work</c><00:23:21.679><c> through</c><00:23:22.240><c> what's</c><00:23:22.559><c> it</c>

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
stuff you have to work through what's it
 

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.789 align:start position:0%
stuff you have to work through what's it
like<00:23:23.039><c> being</c><00:23:23.360><c> alone</c>

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
like being alone
 

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.470 align:start position:0%
like being alone
year<00:23:25.039><c> after</c><00:23:25.280><c> year</c><00:23:25.600><c> after</c><00:23:25.840><c> year</c><00:23:26.080><c> what's</c><00:23:26.320><c> it</c>

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
year after year after year what's it
 

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.990 align:start position:0%
year after year after year what's it
like<00:23:26.720><c> engaging</c><00:23:27.120><c> in</c><00:23:27.280><c> relationship</c><00:23:27.760><c> after</c>

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
like engaging in relationship after
 

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
like engaging in relationship after
relationship<00:23:28.480><c> after</c><00:23:28.720><c> a</c><00:23:28.799><c> relationship</c>

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
relationship after a relationship
 

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.430 align:start position:0%
relationship after a relationship
so<00:23:31.120><c> it's</c><00:23:31.280><c> an</c><00:23:31.520><c> infinite</c><00:23:32.000><c> loop</c><00:23:32.480><c> only</c><00:23:32.880><c> if</c><00:23:33.120><c> that's</c>

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
so it's an infinite loop only if that's
 

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
so it's an infinite loop only if that's
the<00:23:33.600><c> loop</c><00:23:33.840><c> that</c><00:23:34.000><c> you</c><00:23:34.159><c> keep</c>

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
the loop that you keep
 

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.110 align:start position:0%
the loop that you keep
doing<00:23:35.919><c> remember</c><00:23:36.320><c> there</c><00:23:36.400><c> are</c><00:23:36.559><c> other</c><00:23:36.799><c> things</c>

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
doing remember there are other things
 

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.470 align:start position:0%
doing remember there are other things
that<00:23:37.200><c> you</c><00:23:37.360><c> can</c><00:23:37.520><c> do</c><00:23:37.679><c> you</c><00:23:37.840><c> can</c><00:23:38.000><c> offload</c><00:23:38.400><c> the</c>
