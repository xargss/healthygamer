predict anything in the world and
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.570 align:start position:0%
predict anything in the world and
doesn't<00:00:28.080><c> map</c><00:00:28.230><c> anything</c><00:00:29.160><c> and</c><00:00:29.310><c> certainly</c>

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't map anything and certainly
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.720 align:start position:0%

doesn't<00:00:29.849><c> define</c><00:00:30.240><c> intelligence</c><00:00:30.980><c> so</c><00:00:31.980><c> the</c><00:00:32.520><c> first</c>

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 align:start position:0%
doesn't define intelligence so the first
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't define intelligence so the first
question<00:00:33.030><c> is</c><00:00:33.360><c> like</c><00:00:33.480><c> is</c><00:00:34.110><c> IQ</c><00:00:34.710><c> and</c><00:00:34.829><c> empty</c>

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 align:start position:0%
question is like is IQ and empty
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 align:start position:0%
question is like is IQ and empty

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
statistic that doesn't predict anything
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.040 align:start position:0%

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 align:start position:0%
in the world the answer to that is no so
 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.660 align:start position:0%
in the world the answer to that is no so
IQ<00:00:40.050><c> is</c><00:00:40.260><c> a</c><00:00:40.290><c> predictor</c><00:00:40.829><c> of</c><00:00:40.980><c> many</c><00:00:41.160><c> things</c><00:00:41.370><c> in</c><00:00:41.579><c> the</c>

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 align:start position:0%
IQ is a predictor of many things in the
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.930 align:start position:0%
IQ is a predictor of many things in the
world<00:00:41.930><c> and</c><00:00:43.129><c> the</c><00:00:44.129><c> next</c><00:00:44.280><c> question</c><00:00:44.430><c> is</c><00:00:44.700><c> doesn't</c>

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
world and the next question is doesn't
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.410 align:start position:0%
world and the next question is doesn't
in<00:00:45.800><c> this</c><00:00:46.800><c> IQ</c><00:00:47.010><c> define</c><00:00:47.610><c> intelligence</c><00:00:47.969><c> the</c>

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
in this IQ define intelligence the
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380 align:start position:0%
in this IQ define intelligence the
answer<00:00:48.660><c> to</c><00:00:48.719><c> that</c><00:00:48.750><c> question</c><00:00:49.050><c> is</c><00:00:49.379><c> also</c><00:00:49.590><c> no</c><00:00:49.980><c> so</c><00:00:50.760><c> IQ</c>

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is also no so IQ
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.389 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is also no so IQ
does<00:00:51.770><c> predict</c><00:00:52.770><c> to</c><00:00:53.160><c> some</c><00:00:53.430><c> degree</c><00:00:53.910><c> success</c><00:00:54.600><c> or</c>

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 align:start position:0%
does predict to some degree success or
 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.630 align:start position:0%
does predict to some degree success or
does<00:00:56.399><c> predict</c><00:00:56.789><c> to</c><00:00:56.910><c> some</c><00:00:57.120><c> degree</c><00:00:57.449><c> like</c>

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
does predict to some degree like
 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.029 align:start position:0%
does predict to some degree like
correlates<00:00:59.640><c> with</c><00:00:59.789><c> like</c><00:00:59.969><c> real</c><00:01:00.180><c> world</c><00:01:01.039><c> stuff</c>

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
correlates with like real world stuff
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 align:start position:0%
correlates with like real world stuff
but<00:01:02.789><c> I</c><00:01:02.820><c> think</c><00:01:02.969><c> the</c><00:01:03.239><c> real</c><00:01:03.449><c> problem</c><00:01:03.660><c> with</c><00:01:04.049><c> IQ</c><00:01:04.500><c> is</c>

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
but I think the real problem with IQ is
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.190 align:start position:0%
but I think the real problem with IQ is
that<00:01:04.799><c> we</c><00:01:04.920><c> we</c><00:01:05.250><c> think</c><00:01:05.489><c> about</c><00:01:05.670><c> IQ</c><00:01:06.060><c> in</c><00:01:06.420><c> a</c><00:01:06.479><c> vacuum</c><00:01:06.990><c> as</c>

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
that we we think about IQ in a vacuum as
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020 align:start position:0%
that we we think about IQ in a vacuum as
being<00:01:07.439><c> like</c><00:01:07.650><c> the</c><00:01:07.799><c> most</c><00:01:07.830><c> important</c><00:01:08.610><c> factor</c><00:01:09.000><c> for</c>

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 align:start position:0%
being like the most important factor for
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.140 align:start position:0%
being like the most important factor for
success<00:01:09.439><c> so</c><00:01:10.439><c> IQ</c><00:01:10.920><c> is</c><00:01:11.010><c> absolutely</c><00:01:11.640><c> a</c><00:01:11.670><c> real</c><00:01:11.820><c> thing</c>

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 align:start position:0%
success so IQ is absolutely a real thing
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
success so IQ is absolutely a real thing
so<00:01:12.360><c> for</c><00:01:12.479><c> example</c><00:01:12.869><c> if</c><00:01:12.990><c> you</c><00:01:13.140><c> test</c><00:01:13.890><c> someone</c><00:01:14.310><c> a</c>

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 align:start position:0%
so for example if you test someone a
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 align:start position:0%
so for example if you test someone a
test<00:01:15.180><c> someone</c><00:01:15.420><c> with</c><00:01:15.570><c> Down</c><00:01:15.750><c> syndrome</c><00:01:15.810><c> and</c><00:01:16.590><c> you</c>

test someone with Down syndrome and you

test someone with Down syndrome and you

is gonna be very difficult and that's
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.010 align:start position:0%
is gonna be very difficult and that's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
gonna correlate with IQ so if you look
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.109 align:start position:0%

if it's intellectually unsatisfying and
 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
if it's intellectually unsatisfying and

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030 align:start position:0%
then you have the option to play a video

then you have the option to play a video
