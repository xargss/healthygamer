00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 align:start position:0%
start by actually disputing the premise
 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
start by actually disputing the premise
of<00:00:44.100><c> the</c><00:00:44.159><c> question</c><00:00:44.870><c> so</c><00:00:45.870><c> I</c><00:00:45.900><c> believe</c><00:00:46.379><c> that</c>

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 align:start position:0%
of the question so I believe that
 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.350 align:start position:0%
of the question so I believe that
generally<00:00:47.100><c> speaking</c><00:00:47.129><c> when</c><00:00:47.670><c> you</c><00:00:47.820><c> truly</c>

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when you truly
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.329 align:start position:0%
generally speaking when you truly
believe<00:00:48.809><c> that</c><00:00:48.839><c> you've</c><00:00:49.290><c> done</c><00:00:49.530><c> everything</c><00:00:50.010><c> that</c>

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
believe that you've done everything that
 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.299 align:start position:0%
believe that you've done everything that
you<00:00:50.489><c> can</c><00:00:50.760><c> it</c><00:00:51.479><c> becomes</c><00:00:51.989><c> easier</c><00:00:52.650><c> and</c><00:00:52.830><c> easier</c><00:00:53.100><c> to</c>

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 align:start position:0%
you can it becomes easier and easier to
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.390 align:start position:0%
you can it becomes easier and easier to
accept<00:00:53.790><c> failure</c><00:00:54.229><c> failure</c><00:00:55.229><c> becomes</c><00:00:55.799><c> hard</c><00:00:56.159><c> to</c>

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
accept failure failure becomes hard to
 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.189 align:start position:0%
accept failure failure becomes hard to
accept<00:00:56.760><c> when</c><00:00:57.119><c> you</c><00:00:57.269><c> don't</c><00:00:57.629><c> believe</c><00:00:58.170><c> that</c>

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
accept when you don't believe that
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 align:start position:0%
accept when you don't believe that
you've<00:00:58.710><c> done</c><00:00:58.890><c> everything</c><00:00:59.280><c> that</c><00:00:59.309><c> you</c><00:00:59.489><c> can</c><00:00:59.600><c> so</c><00:01:00.600><c> I</c>

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 align:start position:0%
you've done everything that you can so I
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.810 align:start position:0%
you've done everything that you can so I
wonder<00:01:01.260><c> whether</c><00:01:01.619><c> you</c><00:01:01.920><c> truly</c><00:01:02.460><c> believe</c><00:01:02.790><c> that</c>

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 align:start position:0%
wonder whether you truly believe that
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460 align:start position:0%
wonder whether you truly believe that
you've<00:01:03.180><c> done</c><00:01:03.390><c> everything</c><00:01:03.449><c> that</c><00:01:04.110><c> you</c><00:01:04.229><c> can</c>

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 align:start position:0%
you've done everything that you can
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
you've done everything that you can
because<00:01:04.890><c> at</c><00:01:05.010><c> that</c><00:01:05.309><c> point</c><00:01:05.580><c> it</c><00:01:05.760><c> sort</c><00:01:05.970><c> of</c><00:01:06.030><c> becomes</c>

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 align:start position:0%
because at that point it sort of becomes
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.660 align:start position:0%
because at that point it sort of becomes
like<00:01:06.630><c> it</c><00:01:07.320><c> becomes</c><00:01:07.560><c> common</c><00:01:08.010><c> sense</c><00:01:08.220><c> right</c><00:01:08.490><c> like</c>

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 align:start position:0%
like it becomes common sense right like
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
like it becomes common sense right like
if<00:01:09.330><c> I</c><00:01:09.510><c> you</c><00:01:10.380><c> know</c><00:01:10.470><c> if</c><00:01:10.560><c> I</c><00:01:10.680><c> if</c><00:01:10.950><c> I</c><00:01:11.189><c> like</c><00:01:11.430><c> buy</c><00:01:12.299><c> a</c>

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 align:start position:0%
it can be hard to accept failure yeah
 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.190 align:start position:0%
it can be hard to accept failure yeah
that's<00:03:20.639><c> true</c><00:03:20.909><c> I</c><00:03:21.030><c> mean</c><00:03:21.209><c> I</c><00:03:21.389><c> think</c><00:03:21.450><c> sometimes</c><00:03:21.810><c> it</c>

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's true I mean I think sometimes it

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
can be hard to accept failure and I
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.089 align:start position:0%
can be hard to accept failure and I

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:37.530 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:03:30.760><c> it's</c><00:03:30.969><c> there's</c><00:03:31.749><c> a</c><00:03:31.840><c> difference</c><00:03:32.290><c> between</c>

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.580 align:start position:0%
 
let<00:03:37.989><c> me</c><00:03:38.050><c> just</c><00:03:38.230><c> think</c>

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 align:start position:0%
let me just think
 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.830 align:start position:0%
let me just think
so<00:03:40.160><c> we</c><00:03:40.280><c> talked</c><00:03:40.580><c> about</c><00:03:40.730><c> this</c><00:03:40.970><c> a</c><00:03:41.030><c> little</c><00:03:41.540><c> bit</c><00:03:41.720><c> I</c>

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
so we talked about this a little bit I
 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.140 align:start position:0%
so we talked about this a little bit I
think<00:03:41.959><c> on</c><00:03:42.290><c> our</c><00:03:42.560><c> last</c><00:03:42.860><c> stream</c><00:03:43.160><c> so</c><00:03:43.340><c> I</c><00:03:43.520><c> introduced</c>

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 align:start position:0%
think on our last stream so I introduced
 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
think on our last stream so I introduced
this<00:03:44.300><c> concept</c><00:03:44.360><c> of</c><00:03:44.959><c> gamma</c><00:03:45.470><c> Faridah</c><00:03:45.770><c> so</c><00:03:46.580><c> karma</c>

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 align:start position:0%
this concept of gamma Faridah so karma
 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
this concept of gamma Faridah so karma
means<00:03:47.300><c> action</c><00:03:47.450><c> and</c><00:03:48.140><c> Faridah</c><00:03:48.530><c> means</c><00:03:48.800><c> root</c><00:03:49.760><c> and</c>

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 align:start position:0%
means action and Faridah means root and
 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
means action and Faridah means root and
so<00:03:51.650><c> a</c><00:03:52.010><c> couple</c><00:03:52.400><c> thousand</c><00:03:53.000><c> years</c><00:03:53.150><c> ago</c><00:03:53.420><c> there's</c>

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 align:start position:0%
so a couple thousand years ago there's
 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.530 align:start position:0%
so a couple thousand years ago there's
this<00:03:54.200><c> there</c><00:03:55.190><c> was</c><00:03:55.310><c> this</c><00:03:55.459><c> conversation</c><00:03:56.330><c> between</c>

you reconcile with failure when you know
you<00:07:40.219><c> could</c><00:07:40.609><c> have</c><00:07:40.729><c> done</c><00:07:40.879><c> more</c><00:07:41.119><c> but</c><00:07:41.329><c> you</c><00:07:41.449><c> didn't</c>

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:46.219 align:start position:0%
that's the problem right so a lot of

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:49.269 align:start position:0%
what's difficult to accept about failure

00:07:49.269 --> 00:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
is you feel like you could have done
 

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.609 align:start position:0%
is you feel like you could have done

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:51.619 align:start position:0%
more and that in a sense is a true
 

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:53.409 align:start position:0%
more and that in a sense is a true
failure<00:07:51.889><c> because</c><00:07:52.429><c> it's</c><00:07:52.669><c> sort</c><00:07:52.879><c> of</c><00:07:52.909><c> like</c><00:07:53.029><c> you</c>

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:53.419 align:start position:0%
failure because it's sort of like you
 

00:07:53.419 --> 00:07:54.759 align:start position:0%
failure because it's sort of like you

didn't and I think the biggest way to
 

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:00.429 align:start position:0%
didn't and I think the biggest way to
overcome<00:07:58.329><c> let's</c><00:07:59.329><c> just</c><00:07:59.479><c> like</c><00:07:59.689><c> understand</c><00:08:00.289><c> what</c>

00:08:00.429 --> 00:08:00.439 align:start position:0%
overcome let's just like understand what
 

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.409 align:start position:0%
overcome let's just like understand what
that<00:08:00.589><c> means</c><00:08:00.799><c> right</c><00:08:00.979><c> so</c><00:08:01.159><c> when</c><00:08:01.309><c> you</c><00:08:01.459><c> how</c><00:08:02.179><c> do</c><00:08:02.239><c> you</c>

00:08:02.409 --> 00:08:02.419 align:start position:0%
that means right so when you how do you
 

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
that means right so when you how do you
reconcile<00:08:03.019><c> with</c><00:08:03.319><c> failure</c><00:08:03.769><c> when</c><00:08:03.919><c> you</c><00:08:04.009><c> know</c><00:08:04.309><c> you</c>

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:04.369 align:start position:0%
reconcile with failure when you know you
 

00:08:04.369 --> 00:08:06.099 align:start position:0%
