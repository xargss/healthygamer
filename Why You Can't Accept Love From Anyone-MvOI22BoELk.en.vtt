00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%

their parents make fun of them or nasty
 

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.710 align:start position:0%
their parents make fun of them or nasty
to<00:13:37.519><c> them</c><00:13:37.680><c> so</c><00:13:37.839><c> they</c><00:13:38.000><c> just</c><00:13:38.160><c> like</c><00:13:38.320><c> learn</c><00:13:38.560><c> that</c>

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
to them so they just like learn that
 

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.829 align:start position:0%
to them so they just like learn that
behavior<00:13:39.120><c> and</c><00:13:39.199><c> then</c><00:13:39.279><c> they</c><00:13:39.440><c> mimic</c><00:13:39.760><c> it</c>

00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
behavior and then they mimic it
 

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:40.870 align:start position:0%

so<00:13:41.040><c> we</c><00:13:41.120><c> can</c><00:13:41.199><c> see</c><00:13:41.360><c> like</c><00:13:41.600><c> mastery</c><00:13:42.079><c> of</c><00:13:42.160><c> the</c><00:13:42.240><c> trauma</c>

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
so we can see like mastery of the trauma
 

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.150 align:start position:0%
so we can see like mastery of the trauma
by<00:13:42.880><c> like</c><00:13:43.040><c> role</c><00:13:43.360><c> reversal</c><00:13:43.760><c> like</c><00:13:43.920><c> that</c><00:13:44.000><c> can</c>

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
by like role reversal like that can
 

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.430 align:start position:0%
by like role reversal like that can
happen<00:13:44.399><c> too</c><00:13:44.560><c> it's</c><00:13:44.720><c> not</c><00:13:44.880><c> happening</c><00:13:45.199><c> in</c><00:13:45.279><c> this</c>

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
happen too it's not happening in this
 

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.509 align:start position:0%
happen too it's not happening in this

so<00:19:10.720><c> this</c><00:19:10.880><c> is</c><00:19:10.960><c> gonna</c><00:19:11.200><c> like</c><00:19:11.360><c> not</c><00:19:11.600><c> make</c><00:19:11.919><c> sense</c>

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this is gonna like not make sense
 

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.230 align:start position:0%
so this is gonna like not make sense
and<00:19:13.120><c> so</c><00:19:13.280><c> this</c><00:19:13.440><c> is</c><00:19:13.520><c> the</c><00:19:13.600><c> last</c><00:19:13.840><c> thing</c><00:19:14.000><c> that</c><00:19:14.080><c> i'll</c>

kind of leave you all with objectively i
 

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
kind of leave you all with objectively i

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
know there are a bunch of discrepancies
 

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.669 align:start position:0%

that's<00:19:19.919><c> because</c>

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's because
 

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.870 align:start position:0%
that's because
you<00:19:21.280><c> were</c><00:19:21.520><c> told</c><00:19:21.840><c> in</c><00:19:21.919><c> the</c><00:19:22.000><c> first</c><00:19:22.320><c> half</c><00:19:22.559><c> of</c><00:19:22.640><c> your</c>

you're being told that you are lovable

and so that's going to feel like a
 

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.870 align:start position:0%
and so that's going to feel like a

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%

and so then i think this person did the

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
right thing which is they looked up love
 

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.789 align:start position:0%

bombing and they realized that like
that's<00:20:07.039><c> not</c><00:20:07.280><c> what</c><00:20:07.440><c> love</c><00:20:07.679><c> bombing</c><00:20:08.080><c> is</c>

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what love bombing is

really really quickly and like here's

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick aside so gas lighting is a
 

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.830 align:start position:0%
just a quick aside so gas lighting is a

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
good example of this
 

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.669 align:start position:0%
good example of this
so<00:20:18.080><c> gas</c><00:20:18.400><c> lighting</c><00:20:18.799><c> is</c><00:20:18.880><c> something</c><00:20:19.200><c> that</c><00:20:19.440><c> is</c>

00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
so gas lighting is something that is
 

00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:22.070 align:start position:0%

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
with that i'm not saying that there's
 

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.029 align:start position:0%
with that i'm not saying that there's
anything<00:22:15.520><c> wrong</c><00:22:15.679><c> with</c><00:22:15.840><c> being</c><00:22:16.000><c> asexual</c><00:22:16.880><c> the</c>

00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with being asexual the
 

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.149 align:start position:0%
anything wrong with being asexual the
problem<00:22:17.360><c> is</c><00:22:17.520><c> that</c><00:22:17.600><c> sometimes</c><00:22:17.919><c> we</c>

00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
problem is that sometimes we
 

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:20.390 align:start position:0%
problem is that sometimes we
inappropriately<00:22:18.799><c> label</c><00:22:19.120><c> ourselves</c>

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
inappropriately label ourselves
 

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.990 align:start position:0%
inappropriately label ourselves
so<00:22:20.559><c> i've</c><00:22:20.720><c> had</c><00:22:20.960><c> patients</c><00:22:21.360><c> for</c><00:22:21.520><c> example</c><00:22:21.840><c> who</c>

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
so i've had patients for example who
 

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
so i've had patients for example who
have<00:22:22.159><c> vaginismus</c><00:22:23.360><c> who</c><00:22:23.600><c> describe</c><00:22:24.000><c> themselves</c>

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
have vaginismus who describe themselves
 

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.270 align:start position:0%
have vaginismus who describe themselves

as
 

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
as

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
