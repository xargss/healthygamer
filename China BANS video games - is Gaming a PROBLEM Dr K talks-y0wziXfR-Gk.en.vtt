00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
and when we do that it works out really
 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
and when we do that it works out really
really<00:10:55.040><c> well</c><00:10:55.760><c> so</c><00:10:55.920><c> i</c><00:10:56.000><c> think</c><00:10:56.160><c> what's</c><00:10:56.399><c> happening</c>

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
ninety-seven 97 comes from non-minor so
 

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.470 align:start position:0%

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
it may not affect their bottom line but
 

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.590 align:start position:0%
it may not affect their bottom line but
i<00:15:14.560><c> think</c><00:15:14.720><c> it's</c><00:15:14.880><c> like</c><00:15:15.120><c> it's</c><00:15:15.279><c> just</c><00:15:15.519><c> the</c>
