00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.189 align:start position:0%
something like that okay
the<00:04:45.120><c> third</c><00:04:45.440><c> thing</c><00:04:45.759><c> is</c><00:04:45.919><c> that</c><00:04:46.160><c> social</c><00:04:46.639><c> media</c>

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.189 align:start position:0%
makes fomo worse
right<00:04:49.280><c> so</c><00:04:49.440><c> like</c><00:04:49.600><c> social</c><00:04:50.000><c> media</c><00:04:50.560><c> creates</c><00:04:51.040><c> a</c>
