00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0%
a typical answer that is probably a

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:35.980 align:start position:0%

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:42.690 align:start position:0%
lack of confidence is the origin and it
 

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
lack of confidence is the origin and it
kind<00:13:42.960><c> of</c><00:13:43.080><c> it's</c><00:13:43.320><c> almost</c><00:13:43.440><c> like</c><00:13:43.800><c> a</c><00:13:43.830><c> monster</c><00:13:44.490><c> that</c>

right

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
right
 

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
right
case<00:15:21.820><c> in</c><00:15:22.000><c> point</c><00:15:22.029><c> yeah</c><00:15:22.480><c> so</c><00:15:23.110><c> this</c><00:15:23.290><c> is</c><00:15:23.440><c> where</c><00:15:23.560><c> the</c>

00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:23.709 align:start position:0%
case in point yeah so this is where the
 

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:24.870 align:start position:0%
case in point yeah so this is where the
tricky<00:15:23.980><c> thing</c><00:15:24.160><c> is</c><00:15:24.190><c> that</c><00:15:24.520><c> you</c><00:15:24.640><c> know</c><00:15:24.730><c> we've</c>

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
tricky thing is that you know we've
 

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
tricky thing is that you know we've
talked<00:15:25.120><c> a</c><00:15:25.209><c> little</c><00:15:25.300><c> bit</c><00:15:25.480><c> about</c><00:15:25.660><c> like</c><00:15:25.870><c> rational</c>

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:26.290 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about like rational
 

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.910 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about like rational
versus<00:15:26.680><c> emotional</c><00:15:27.360><c> so</c><00:15:28.360><c> now</c><00:15:28.600><c> I</c><00:15:29.230><c> think</c><00:15:29.649><c> we're</c>

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
versus emotional so now I think we're
 

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.290 align:start position:0%
versus emotional so now I think we're
going<00:15:30.040><c> a</c><00:15:30.220><c> little</c><00:15:30.490><c> bit</c><00:15:30.730><c> off</c><00:15:30.850><c> topic</c><00:15:31.060><c> but</c>

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:31.300 align:start position:0%
going a little bit off topic but
 

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
going a little bit off topic but
hopefully<00:15:31.839><c> this</c><00:15:31.959><c> is</c><00:15:32.110><c> okay</c><00:15:32.380><c> so</c><00:15:32.440><c> now</c><00:15:33.010><c> the</c>

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.070 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is okay so now the
 

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is okay so now the
question<00:15:33.250><c> becomes</c><00:15:33.790><c> okay</c><00:15:34.120><c> so</c><00:15:34.300><c> like</c><00:15:34.720><c> you</c><00:15:34.870><c> don't</c>

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.050 align:start position:0%
question becomes okay so like you don't
 

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.430 align:start position:0%
question becomes okay so like you don't

part<00:15:40.660><c> of</c><00:15:40.750><c> the</c><00:15:40.810><c> reason</c><00:15:41.140><c> that</c><00:15:41.170><c> you</c><00:15:41.500><c> have</c><00:15:41.740><c> not</c>

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:58.510 align:start position:0%
you know I listen used to look better
 

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.970 align:start position:0%
you know I listen used to look better
but<00:15:58.690><c> I</c><00:15:58.870><c> would</c><00:15:59.050><c> guess</c><00:15:59.230><c> that</c><00:15:59.260><c> even</c><00:15:59.709><c> if</c><00:15:59.800><c> I</c><00:15:59.890><c> had</c>

00:15:59.970 --> 00:15:59.980 align:start position:0%
but I would guess that even if I had
 

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.050 align:start position:0%
but I would guess that even if I had
talked<00:16:00.160><c> to</c><00:16:00.190><c> you</c><00:16:00.399><c> when</c><00:16:00.520><c> you</c><00:16:00.610><c> cornered</c><00:16:00.910><c> what</c>

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.060 align:start position:0%
talked to you when you cornered what
 

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.910 align:start position:0%
talked to you when you cornered what
looked<00:16:01.300><c> better</c><00:16:01.480><c> that</c><00:16:02.110><c> you</c><00:16:02.230><c> probably</c><00:16:02.470><c> felt</c><00:16:02.770><c> the</c>

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
looked better that you probably felt the
 

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.370 align:start position:0%
looked better that you probably felt the
same<00:16:03.010><c> way</c><00:16:03.310><c> that</c><00:16:03.459><c> you</c><00:16:03.610><c> do</c><00:16:03.730><c> now</c><00:16:03.990><c> that</c><00:16:04.990><c> material</c>

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:05.380 align:start position:0%
same way that you do now that material
 

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
same way that you do now that material
yeah<00:16:05.589><c> so</c><00:16:06.459><c> the</c><00:16:06.790><c> interesting</c><00:16:07.000><c> thing</c><00:16:07.209><c> is</c><00:16:07.450><c> that</c><00:16:07.630><c> if</c>

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:07.990 align:start position:0%
yeah so the interesting thing is that if
 

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.930 align:start position:0%
yeah so the interesting thing is that if
we<00:16:08.050><c> really</c><00:16:08.350><c> pause</c><00:16:08.620><c> and</c><00:16:08.860><c> look</c><00:16:08.980><c> at</c><00:16:09.130><c> that</c><00:16:09.279><c> even</c>

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:09.940 align:start position:0%
we really pause and look at that even
 

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.970 align:start position:0%
we really pause and look at that even
though<00:16:10.060><c> there</c><00:16:10.240><c> was</c><00:16:10.600><c> an</c><00:16:10.839><c> objective</c><00:16:11.380><c> difference</c>

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:11.980 align:start position:0%
though there was an objective difference
 

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
though there was an objective difference
in<00:16:12.130><c> the</c><00:16:12.250><c> way</c><00:16:12.370><c> that</c><00:16:12.550><c> you</c><00:16:12.700><c> look</c><00:16:12.940><c> you're</c><00:16:13.209><c> feeling</c>

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:13.690 align:start position:0%
in the way that you look you're feeling
 

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the way that you look you're feeling
about<00:16:13.899><c> the</c><00:16:14.020><c> way</c><00:16:14.110><c> you</c><00:16:14.170><c> look</c><00:16:14.380><c> is</c><00:16:14.529><c> exactly</c><00:16:14.950><c> the</c>

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.130 align:start position:0%
about the way you look is exactly the
 

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.050 align:start position:0%
about the way you look is exactly the
same<00:16:15.310><c> okay</c>

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:16.060 align:start position:0%
same okay
 

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
same okay
so<00:16:16.779><c> now</c><00:16:16.930><c> we</c><00:16:16.990><c> come</c><00:16:17.290><c> to</c><00:16:17.320><c> another</c><00:16:17.470><c> problem</c><00:16:18.160><c> that</c><00:16:18.190><c> a</c>

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:18.310 align:start position:0%
so now we come to another problem that a
 

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.269 align:start position:0%
so now we come to another problem that a
lot<00:16:18.399><c> of</c><00:16:18.550><c> gamers</c><00:16:19.089><c> add</c><00:16:19.450><c> which</c><00:16:19.990><c> is</c><00:16:20.170><c> that</c><00:16:20.350><c> you</c><00:16:21.160><c> know</c>

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
lot of gamers add which is that you know
 

00:16:21.279 --> 00:16:22.710 align:start position:0%
lot of gamers add which is that you know
you<00:16:21.339><c> think</c><00:16:21.730><c> that</c><00:16:21.910><c> there's</c><00:16:22.089><c> a</c><00:16:22.149><c> problem</c><00:16:22.330><c> which</c>

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
you think that there's a problem which
 

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.150 align:start position:0%
you think that there's a problem which
is<00:16:22.839><c> that</c><00:16:22.870><c> you</c><00:16:23.080><c> don't</c><00:16:23.290><c> look</c><00:16:23.500><c> good</c><00:16:23.680><c> enough</c><00:16:23.920><c> and</c>

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
is that you don't look good enough and
 

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.350 align:start position:0%
is that you don't look good enough and
so<00:16:24.190><c> you</c><00:16:24.339><c> try</c><00:16:24.580><c> to</c><00:16:24.670><c> improve</c><00:16:25.060><c> your</c><00:16:25.240><c> appearance</c>

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
so you try to improve your appearance
 

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.889 align:start position:0%
so you try to improve your appearance
and<00:16:25.870><c> there's</c><00:16:26.380><c> definitely</c><00:16:26.800><c> value</c><00:16:26.829><c> to</c><00:16:27.899><c> working</c>

00:16:28.889 --> 00:16:28.899 align:start position:0%
and there's definitely value to working
 

00:16:28.899 --> 00:16:30.569 align:start position:0%
and there's definitely value to working
out<00:16:29.079><c> and</c><00:16:29.380><c> taking</c><00:16:29.560><c> care</c><00:16:29.860><c> of</c><00:16:29.920><c> yourself</c><00:16:30.339><c> as</c><00:16:30.550><c> a</c>

00:16:30.569 --> 00:16:30.579 align:start position:0%
out and taking care of yourself as a
 

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.730 align:start position:0%
out and taking care of yourself as a
confidence<00:16:31.120><c> booster</c><00:16:31.510><c> but</c><00:16:32.350><c> I</c><00:16:32.560><c> would</c><00:16:32.709><c> argue</c>

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:32.740 align:start position:0%
confidence booster but I would argue
 

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
confidence booster but I would argue
that<00:16:33.070><c> the</c><00:16:33.370><c> root</c><00:16:33.610><c> of</c><00:16:33.850><c> the</c><00:16:33.970><c> problem</c><00:16:34.329><c> actually</c>

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:34.690 align:start position:0%
that the root of the problem actually
 

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:36.930 align:start position:0%
that the root of the problem actually
has<00:16:34.839><c> nothing</c><00:16:35.290><c> to</c><00:16:35.500><c> do</c><00:16:35.740><c> with</c><00:16:35.770><c> the</c><00:16:36.310><c> way</c><00:16:36.459><c> you</c><00:16:36.490><c> look</c>

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:36.940 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the way you look
 

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.050 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the way you look
but<00:16:37.180><c> has</c><00:16:37.660><c> more</c><00:16:38.170><c> to</c><00:16:38.350><c> do</c><00:16:38.500><c> with</c><00:16:38.579><c> the</c><00:16:39.579><c> way</c><00:16:39.730><c> you</c><00:16:39.790><c> feel</c>

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:40.060 align:start position:0%
but has more to do with the way you feel
 

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
but has more to do with the way you feel
you<00:16:41.020><c> look</c>

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:43.050 align:start position:0%
you look
 

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
you look
yeah

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:44.850 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.969 align:start position:0%
yeah
and<00:16:44.939><c> so</c><00:16:45.539><c> then</c><00:16:45.689><c> the</c><00:16:45.809><c> question</c><00:16:45.899><c> becomes</c><00:16:46.229><c> okay</c><00:16:46.739><c> so</c>

00:16:46.969 --> 00:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
and so then the question becomes okay so
 

00:16:46.979 --> 00:16:49.489 align:start position:0%
and so then the question becomes okay so
like<00:16:47.279><c> if</c><00:16:47.459><c> we</c><00:16:47.789><c> can</c><00:16:47.939><c> see</c><00:16:48.119><c> that</c><00:16:48.329><c> what</c><00:16:49.229><c> do</c><00:16:49.289><c> we</c><00:16:49.379><c> do</c>

00:16:49.489 --> 00:16:49.499 align:start position:0%
like if we can see that what do we do
 

00:16:49.499 --> 00:16:52.820 align:start position:0%
like if we can see that what do we do
about

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:52.830 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
I've<00:16:53.220><c> been</c><00:16:53.459><c> pretty</c><00:16:53.820><c> much</c><00:16:53.970><c> telling</c><00:16:54.180><c> myself</c>

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:54.330 align:start position:0%
I've been pretty much telling myself
 

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.329 align:start position:0%
I've been pretty much telling myself
it's<00:16:54.630><c> not</c><00:16:54.660><c> true</c><00:16:54.959><c> over</c><00:16:55.440><c> and</c><00:16:55.560><c> over</c><00:16:55.589><c> again</c><00:16:55.740><c> how's</c>

00:16:56.329 --> 00:16:56.339 align:start position:0%
it's not true over and over again how's
 

00:16:56.339 --> 00:16:58.009 align:start position:0%
it's not true over and over again how's
that<00:16:56.490><c> working</c><00:16:56.850><c> for</c><00:16:56.880><c> you</c><00:16:57.149><c> it's</c><00:16:57.720><c> hopping</c><00:16:57.959><c> a</c>

00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
that working for you it's hopping a
 

00:16:58.019 --> 00:16:59.990 align:start position:0%
that working for you it's hopping a
little<00:16:58.200><c> bit</c><00:16:58.320><c> okay</c><00:16:58.950><c> hopping</c><00:16:59.250><c> that's</c><00:16:59.760><c> why</c><00:16:59.880><c> I've</c>

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
little bit okay hopping that's why I've
 

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.860 align:start position:0%
little bit okay hopping that's why I've
been<00:17:00.060><c> able</c><00:17:00.180><c> to</c><00:17:00.269><c> ask</c><00:17:00.450><c> more</c><00:17:00.600><c> people</c><00:17:00.690><c> at</c>

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:00.870 align:start position:0%
been able to ask more people at
 

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
been able to ask more people at
essentially<00:17:01.380><c> the</c><00:17:01.980><c> more</c><00:17:02.130><c> times</c><00:17:02.310><c> I'm</c><00:17:02.430><c> like</c><00:17:02.459><c> up</c>

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:02.970 align:start position:0%
essentially the more times I'm like up
 

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:04.069 align:start position:0%
essentially the more times I'm like up
stopping<00:17:03.209><c> you're</c><00:17:03.450><c> being</c><00:17:03.600><c> dumb</c><00:17:03.750><c> like</c><00:17:03.930><c> every</c>

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
stopping you're being dumb like every
 

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.630 align:start position:0%
stopping you're being dumb like every
time<00:17:04.199><c> that</c><00:17:04.290><c> thought</c><00:17:04.500><c> entered</c><00:17:04.770><c> my</c><00:17:04.800><c> head</c>

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.610 align:start position:0%
 
I<00:17:07.670><c> think</c><00:17:08.240><c> it's</c><00:17:09.170><c> weird</c><00:17:09.350><c> because</c><00:17:09.500><c> sometimes</c>

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:09.620 align:start position:0%
I think it's weird because sometimes
 

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.060 align:start position:0%
I think it's weird because sometimes
it's<00:17:10.190><c> like</c><00:17:10.310><c> yeah</c><00:17:11.030><c> that</c><00:17:11.390><c> is</c><00:17:11.660><c> like</c><00:17:12.080><c> you</c><00:17:12.320><c> know</c><00:17:12.410><c> I'm</c>

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.070 align:start position:0%
it's like yeah that is like you know I'm
 

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's like yeah that is like you know I'm
a<00:17:13.130><c> lot</c><00:17:13.340><c> flatter</c><00:17:13.550><c> than</c><00:17:13.850><c> easy</c><00:17:14.090><c> but</c><00:17:14.210><c> yeah</c><00:17:14.330><c> that</c><00:17:14.570><c> is</c>

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:14.690 align:start position:0%
a lot flatter than easy but yeah that is
 

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:19.270 align:start position:0%
a lot flatter than easy but yeah that is
true<00:17:14.930><c> but</c><00:17:15.500><c> doesn't</c><00:17:15.770><c> really</c><00:17:15.860><c> matter</c><00:17:16.990><c> okay</c><00:17:18.280><c> so</c>

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
true but doesn't really matter okay so
 

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
true but doesn't really matter okay so
now<00:17:19.730><c> there's</c><00:17:20.420><c> a</c><00:17:20.480><c> subtle</c><00:17:20.930><c> difference</c><00:17:21.410><c> in</c><00:17:21.590><c> that</c>

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:21.890 align:start position:0%
now there's a subtle difference in that
 

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
now there's a subtle difference in that
state<00:17:22.220><c> right</c><00:17:22.610><c> there's</c><00:17:23.510><c> a</c><00:17:23.570><c> subtle</c><00:17:23.930><c> difference</c>

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:24.050 align:start position:0%
state right there's a subtle difference
 

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.770 align:start position:0%
state right there's a subtle difference
between<00:17:24.620><c> arguing</c><00:17:25.340><c> with</c><00:17:25.520><c> yourself</c><00:17:25.700><c> in</c><00:17:26.270><c> terms</c>

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:26.780 align:start position:0%
between arguing with yourself in terms
 

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.620 align:start position:0%
between arguing with yourself in terms
of<00:17:27.020><c> invalidating</c><00:17:27.860><c> the</c><00:17:28.040><c> way</c><00:17:28.160><c> that</c><00:17:28.340><c> you</c><00:17:28.460><c> feel</c><00:17:28.700><c> so</c>

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:29.630 align:start position:0%
of invalidating the way that you feel so
 

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.790 align:start position:0%
of invalidating the way that you feel so
if<00:17:29.690><c> we</c><00:17:29.780><c> think</c><00:17:29.900><c> about</c><00:17:30.020><c> this</c><00:17:30.290><c> like</c><00:17:30.500><c> let</c><00:17:30.680><c> me</c><00:17:30.770><c> just</c>

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
if we think about this like let me just
 

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.590 align:start position:0%
if we think about this like let me just
