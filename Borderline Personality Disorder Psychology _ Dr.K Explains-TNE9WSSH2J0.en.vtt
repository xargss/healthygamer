so if I don't feel like I'm a valuable
 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
so if I don't feel like I'm a valuable

that actually has to do with gaming so
 

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.170 align:start position:0%
that actually has to do with gaming so
when<00:27:25.350><c> we</c><00:27:25.530><c> like</c><00:27:25.830><c> when</c><00:27:26.220><c> we</c><00:27:26.310><c> play</c><00:27:26.550><c> video</c><00:27:26.730><c> games</c>

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
when we like when we play video games
 

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:29.270 align:start position:0%
when we like when we play video games
it's<00:27:27.450><c> sort</c><00:27:27.660><c> of</c><00:27:27.720><c> suppresses</c><00:27:28.470><c> our</c><00:27:28.740><c> emotional</c>

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's sort of suppresses our emotional
 

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.610 align:start position:0%
it's sort of suppresses our emotional
circuitry<00:27:29.850><c> and</c><00:27:30.030><c> those</c><00:27:30.600><c> emotions</c><00:27:30.900><c> are</c><00:27:31.290><c> kind</c><00:27:31.530><c> of</c>

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
circuitry and those emotions are kind of
 

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.250 align:start position:0%
circuitry and those emotions are kind of
like<00:27:31.770><c> floating</c><00:27:32.280><c> right</c><00:27:32.430><c> beneath</c><00:27:32.760><c> the</c><00:27:32.910><c> surface</c>

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:33.260 align:start position:0%
like floating right beneath the surface
 

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.690 align:start position:0%
like floating right beneath the surface
so<00:27:34.260><c> what</c><00:27:34.410><c> happens</c><00:27:34.800><c> is</c><00:27:34.950><c> like</c><00:27:35.130><c> when</c><00:27:35.400><c> you</c><00:27:35.520><c> have</c>

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%

stuff that's right beneath the surface
 

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.350 align:start position:0%

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:44.550 align:start position:0%
those kinds of mood swings is because
 

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.490 align:start position:0%
those kinds of mood swings is because
