having an early life crisis is way
better<00:07:39.199><c> than</c><00:07:39.360><c> having</c><00:07:39.599><c> a</c><00:07:39.759><c> mid-life</c><00:07:40.160><c> crisis</c><00:07:41.039><c> so</c>

time i was 28
 

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:10.230 align:start position:0%
time i was 28
and<00:08:08.800><c> then</c><00:08:09.199><c> it</c><00:08:09.280><c> was</c><00:08:09.440><c> fine</c><00:08:09.759><c> because</c><00:08:09.919><c> i</c><00:08:10.000><c> had</c><00:08:10.080><c> sort</c>

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
pretty good so i don't think i'm gonna
 

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.589 align:start position:0%
pretty good so i don't think i'm gonna
wake<00:08:19.840><c> up</c><00:08:19.919><c> in</c><00:08:20.080><c> three</c><00:08:20.240><c> years</c><00:08:20.479><c> and</c><00:08:20.560><c> be</c><00:08:20.720><c> like</c>

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
i made a mistake where did my life go
 

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.629 align:start position:0%
i made a mistake where did my life go
i'm<00:08:23.360><c> pretty</c><00:08:23.599><c> happy</c><00:08:23.840><c> with</c><00:08:24.160><c> how</c><00:08:24.319><c> things</c><00:08:24.560><c> have</c>

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty happy with how things have
 

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty happy with how things have
gone<00:08:25.360><c> and</c><00:08:25.520><c> i</c><00:08:25.680><c> do</c><00:08:25.919><c> think</c><00:08:26.080><c> that</c><00:08:26.240><c> i</c><00:08:26.319><c> would</c><00:08:26.479><c> have</c>

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
gone and i do think that i would have
 

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
gone and i do think that i would have
been<00:08:26.800><c> very</c><00:08:27.199><c> unhappy</c><00:08:27.759><c> if</c><00:08:27.919><c> i</c><00:08:28.000><c> hadn't</c><00:08:28.319><c> gone</c>

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
been very unhappy if i hadn't gone
 

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.550 align:start position:0%
been very unhappy if i hadn't gone
through<00:08:28.720><c> that</c><00:08:28.960><c> process</c>

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
through that process
 

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.830 align:start position:0%
through that process
so<00:08:30.800><c> this</c><00:08:30.960><c> is</c><00:08:31.039><c> the</c><00:08:31.120><c> thing</c><00:08:31.360><c> if</c><00:08:31.440><c> you</c><00:08:31.520><c> all</c><00:08:31.680><c> are</c><00:08:31.759><c> in</c>

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
so this is the thing if you all are in
 

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.430 align:start position:0%
so this is the thing if you all are in
an<00:08:32.080><c> early</c><00:08:32.320><c> life</c><00:08:32.560><c> crisis</c><00:08:32.959><c> i</c><00:08:33.039><c> think</c><00:08:33.200><c> there</c><00:08:33.279><c> are</c><00:08:33.360><c> a</c>

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
an early life crisis i think there are a
 

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
an early life crisis i think there are a
couple<00:08:33.680><c> of</c><00:08:33.839><c> really</c><00:08:34.080><c> important</c><00:08:34.320><c> things</c><00:08:34.560><c> to</c>

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
couple of really important things to
 

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.949 align:start position:0%
couple of really important things to

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
recognize the first is to recognize that
 

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:38.310 align:start position:0%
recognize the first is to recognize that
what<00:08:37.120><c> you're</c><00:08:37.279><c> going</c><00:08:37.519><c> through</c><00:08:37.839><c> is</c><00:08:37.919><c> actually</c>

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
important that the early life crisis is
 

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.190 align:start position:0%
important that the early life crisis is
a<00:08:43.120><c> voice</c><00:08:43.519><c> within</c><00:08:43.919><c> you</c><00:08:44.480><c> that's</c><00:08:44.800><c> actually</c>
