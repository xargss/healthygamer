and then what happens is when you enter
 

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.750 align:start position:0%
and then what happens is when you enter
the<00:09:34.399><c> game</c><00:09:34.640><c> and</c><00:09:34.720><c> like</c><00:09:34.880><c> you</c><00:09:34.959><c> have</c><00:09:35.040><c> an</c><00:09:35.120><c> 80</c><00:09:35.519><c> chance</c>

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
the game and like you have an 80 chance

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
of losing like you start to lose and
 

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
of losing like you start to lose and
then<00:09:38.080><c> that</c><00:09:38.320><c> false</c><00:09:38.640><c> confidence</c><00:09:39.279><c> comes</c>

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
then that false confidence comes
 

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.430 align:start position:0%
then that false confidence comes
crumbling<00:09:40.080><c> down</c>

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
crumbling down
 

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
crumbling down
so<00:09:41.600><c> one</c><00:09:41.680><c> of</c><00:09:41.760><c> the</c><00:09:41.839><c> key</c><00:09:42.080><c> things</c><00:09:42.320><c> i</c><00:09:42.399><c> learned</c><00:09:42.640><c> from</c>

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
so one of the key things i learned from
 

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
so one of the key things i learned from
ti<00:09:43.279><c> is</c><00:09:43.440><c> having</c><00:09:43.760><c> authentic</c><00:09:44.399><c> doubt</c><00:09:44.720><c> is</c><00:09:44.880><c> better</c>

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
ti is having authentic doubt is better
 

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.190 align:start position:0%
ti is having authentic doubt is better
than<00:09:45.279><c> having</c><00:09:45.519><c> false</c><00:09:45.760><c> confidence</c>

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
than having false confidence
 

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.710 align:start position:0%
than having false confidence
so<00:09:47.360><c> if</c><00:09:47.519><c> you</c><00:09:47.600><c> really</c><00:09:47.839><c> want</c><00:09:48.000><c> to</c><00:09:48.080><c> win</c><00:09:48.240><c> that</c><00:09:48.480><c> game</c>

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
