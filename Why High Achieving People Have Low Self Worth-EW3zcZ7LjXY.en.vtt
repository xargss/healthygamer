00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
well that's a great question so I think
 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.510 align:start position:0%
well that's a great question so I think
the<00:02:14.570><c> best</c><00:02:14.780><c> thing</c><00:02:15.020><c> to</c><00:02:15.050><c> do</c><00:02:15.320><c> a</c><00:02:15.590><c> couple</c><00:02:16.400><c> of</c><00:02:16.460><c> things</c>

the best thing to do a couple of things
 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.850 align:start position:0%
the best thing to do a couple of things
one<00:02:16.940><c> is</c><00:02:17.120><c> to</c><00:02:17.440><c> understand</c><00:02:18.440><c> that</c><00:02:18.500><c> a</c><00:02:18.590><c> lot</c><00:02:18.800><c> of</c>

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 align:start position:0%
one is to understand that a lot of
 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.150 align:start position:0%
one is to understand that a lot of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
people's identity is based on comparison
 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
people's identity is based on comparison
so<00:02:22.160><c> your</c><00:02:22.310><c> sense</c><00:02:22.670><c> of</c><00:02:22.940><c> self</c><00:02:23.240><c> worth</c><00:02:23.540><c> is</c><00:02:23.870><c> in</c>
