none of those really work and what do i
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.990 align:start position:0%
none of those really work and what do i

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
mean by that i mean if we just think
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
mean by that i mean if we just think
about<00:02:52.239><c> that</c><00:02:52.400><c> for</c><00:02:52.480><c> a</c><00:02:52.560><c> second</c>

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
about that for a second
 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.750 align:start position:0%
about that for a second
if<00:02:53.680><c> these</c><00:02:53.920><c> solutions</c><00:02:54.640><c> actually</c><00:02:55.200><c> worked</c><00:02:55.599><c> then</c>

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
if these solutions actually worked then
 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.270 align:start position:0%
if these solutions actually worked then
the<00:02:56.000><c> industry</c><00:02:56.400><c> wouldn't</c><00:02:56.640><c> be</c><00:02:56.800><c> there</c><00:02:57.040><c> right</c>

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
the industry wouldn't be there right
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.710 align:start position:0%
the industry wouldn't be there right
everyone<00:02:57.599><c> would</c><00:02:57.760><c> be</c><00:02:58.000><c> in</c><00:02:58.159><c> shape</c>

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
everyone would be in shape
 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.149 align:start position:0%
everyone would be in shape
and<00:02:58.879><c> so</c><00:02:59.040><c> if</c><00:02:59.120><c> the</c><00:02:59.280><c> industry</c><00:02:59.680><c> is</c><00:02:59.760><c> actually</c>

and so if the industry is actually

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that their their methods
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that their their methods

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
are effective it actually means the
 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.070 align:start position:0%
are effective it actually means the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
that their methods i know this sounds
 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.910 align:start position:0%
that their methods i know this sounds

really bizarre but the more that people
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.430 align:start position:0%
really bizarre but the more that people
invest<00:03:10.239><c> in</c><00:03:10.319><c> the</c><00:03:10.400><c> diet</c><00:03:10.720><c> industry</c><00:03:11.040><c> the</c><00:03:11.200><c> more</c>

weight<00:03:39.680><c> that</c><00:03:39.840><c> it</c><00:03:40.000><c> is</c><00:03:40.080><c> going</c><00:03:40.239><c> to</c><00:03:40.400><c> try</c><00:03:40.640><c> to</c>

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
weight that it is going to try to
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.869 align:start position:0%
weight that it is going to try to
maintain<00:03:41.200><c> and</c><00:03:41.280><c> if</c><00:03:41.440><c> you</c><00:03:41.519><c> try</c><00:03:41.760><c> to</c><00:03:41.920><c> lose</c><00:03:42.239><c> weight</c>

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
maintain and if you try to lose weight
 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.949 align:start position:0%
maintain and if you try to lose weight
it'll<00:03:43.200><c> actually</c><00:03:43.599><c> fight</c><00:03:43.840><c> against</c><00:03:44.239><c> you</c><00:03:44.640><c> and</c><00:03:44.799><c> if</c>

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
it'll actually fight against you and if
 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.390 align:start position:0%
it'll actually fight against you and if
you<00:03:45.120><c> go</c><00:03:45.440><c> over</c><00:03:45.920><c> your</c>

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
you go over your
 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.470 align:start position:0%
you go over your

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
set weight it'll actually start to lose
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.550 align:start position:0%
set weight it'll actually start to lose

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.910 align:start position:0%
weight and i know it sounds really weird
but<00:03:50.799><c> let's</c><00:03:50.959><c> just</c><00:03:51.120><c> think</c><00:03:51.360><c> about</c><00:03:51.519><c> this</c><00:03:51.760><c> for</c><00:03:51.840><c> a</c>

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.589 align:start position:0%
but let's just think about this for a

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.270 align:start position:0%

may<00:03:53.760><c> not</c><00:03:53.920><c> be</c><00:03:54.080><c> the</c><00:03:54.239><c> same</c><00:03:54.560><c> weight</c>

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
may not be the same weight

even though you guys eat roughly the

even though you guys eat roughly the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.270 align:start position:0%

around<00:03:59.360><c> 2000</c><00:03:59.840><c> calories</c><00:04:00.319><c> a</c><00:04:00.400><c> day</c>

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
around 2000 calories a day
 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
around 2000 calories a day
and<00:04:01.680><c> it's</c><00:04:01.920><c> not</c><00:04:02.080><c> like</c><00:04:02.319><c> people</c><00:04:02.560><c> who</c><00:04:02.720><c> weigh</c><00:04:03.040><c> 300</c>

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
and it's not like people who weigh 300
 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.390 align:start position:0%
and it's not like people who weigh 300

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.470 align:start position:0%

eat<00:04:04.720><c> twice</c><00:04:05.040><c> as</c><00:04:05.200><c> many</c><00:04:05.439><c> calories</c><00:04:05.920><c> as</c><00:04:06.080><c> people</c><00:04:06.319><c> who</c>

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
eat twice as many calories as people who
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.070 align:start position:0%
eat twice as many calories as people who
weigh<00:04:06.640><c> 150</c><00:04:07.360><c> pounds</c>

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
weigh 150 pounds
 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.830 align:start position:0%
weigh 150 pounds
and<00:04:08.239><c> so</c><00:04:08.319><c> if</c><00:04:08.480><c> we</c><00:04:08.560><c> look</c><00:04:08.799><c> at</c><00:04:08.879><c> a</c><00:04:08.959><c> population</c><00:04:09.599><c> that's</c>

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so if we look at a population that's
 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.190 align:start position:0%
and so if we look at a population that's
roughly<00:04:10.319><c> eating</c><00:04:10.560><c> the</c><00:04:10.640><c> same</c><00:04:10.879><c> amount</c><00:04:11.120><c> of</c>

how<00:04:12.000><c> do</c><00:04:12.159><c> we</c><00:04:12.400><c> explain</c><00:04:13.280><c> some</c><00:04:13.599><c> people</c><00:04:13.920><c> being</c><00:04:14.239><c> way</c>

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
how do we explain some people being way
 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.110 align:start position:0%
how do we explain some people being way
heavier<00:04:15.040><c> in</c><00:04:15.200><c> some</c><00:04:15.439><c> people</c><00:04:15.760><c> being</c><00:04:16.160><c> way</c><00:04:16.400><c> lighter</c>

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
heavier in some people being way lighter
 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.870 align:start position:0%
heavier in some people being way lighter
well<00:04:17.359><c> it</c><00:04:17.440><c> turns</c><00:04:17.759><c> out</c><00:04:17.840><c> that</c><00:04:18.079><c> set</c><00:04:18.320><c> point</c><00:04:18.560><c> theory</c>

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
well it turns out that set point theory
 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.469 align:start position:0%
well it turns out that set point theory
perfectly<00:04:19.359><c> explains</c><00:04:19.840><c> that</c>

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
perfectly explains that
 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.950 align:start position:0%
perfectly explains that
each<00:04:20.799><c> of</c><00:04:20.880><c> these</c><00:04:21.199><c> people</c><00:04:21.759><c> all</c><00:04:22.000><c> of</c><00:04:22.160><c> us</c><00:04:22.400><c> have</c><00:04:22.560><c> this</c>

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
each of these people all of us have this
 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.469 align:start position:0%
each of these people all of us have this
internal<00:04:23.520><c> calculator</c>

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
internal calculator
 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.510 align:start position:0%
internal calculator
that<00:04:24.880><c> tells</c><00:04:25.280><c> us</c><00:04:25.840><c> how</c><00:04:26.000><c> much</c><00:04:26.240><c> we</c><00:04:26.400><c> should</c><00:04:26.639><c> weigh</c>

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
that tells us how much we should weigh
 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.189 align:start position:0%
that tells us how much we should weigh
and<00:04:27.680><c> so</c><00:04:27.840><c> that's</c><00:04:28.000><c> the</c><00:04:28.160><c> idea</c><00:04:28.479><c> behind</c><00:04:28.720><c> set</c><00:04:28.960><c> point</c>

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
and so that's the idea behind set point
 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.870 align:start position:0%
and so that's the idea behind set point
theory<00:04:29.680><c> so</c><00:04:29.840><c> the</c><00:04:30.000><c> first</c><00:04:30.160><c> study</c><00:04:30.479><c> that</c><00:04:30.560><c> i</c><00:04:30.639><c> want</c><00:04:30.800><c> to</c>

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
theory so the first study that i want to
 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.150 align:start position:0%
theory so the first study that i want to
talk<00:04:31.040><c> to</c><00:04:31.120><c> you</c><00:04:31.199><c> guys</c><00:04:31.440><c> a</c><00:04:31.520><c> little</c><00:04:31.680><c> bit</c><00:04:31.840><c> about</c><00:04:32.000><c> is</c>

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
talk to you guys a little bit about is
 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.749 align:start position:0%
talk to you guys a little bit about is
from<00:04:32.320><c> the</c><00:04:32.400><c> journal</c><00:04:32.800><c> of</c><00:04:32.880><c> nutrition</c>

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.070 align:start position:0%
from the journal of nutrition
and<00:04:33.919><c> it</c><00:04:34.080><c> basically</c><00:04:34.560><c> explains</c><00:04:34.960><c> the</c><00:04:35.120><c> concept</c><00:04:35.680><c> of</c>

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
and it basically explains the concept of
 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
and it basically explains the concept of

a particular
weight<00:04:42.560><c> so</c><00:04:42.800><c> let's</c><00:04:43.040><c> try</c><00:04:43.199><c> to</c><00:04:43.280><c> look</c><00:04:43.520><c> at</c><00:04:43.600><c> what</c>

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
weight so let's try to look at what
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
weight so let's try to look at what
happens<00:04:44.639><c> when</c><00:04:44.880><c> people</c><00:04:45.280><c> actually</c><00:04:45.680><c> go</c><00:04:45.919><c> on</c><00:04:46.000><c> a</c>

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
happens when people actually go on a
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.950 align:start position:0%
happens when people actually go on a
crash<00:04:46.400><c> diet</c>

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
crash diet
 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.270 align:start position:0%
crash diet
so<00:04:47.120><c> when</c><00:04:47.280><c> we</c><00:04:47.520><c> lose</c><00:04:47.840><c> a</c><00:04:47.919><c> lot</c><00:04:48.160><c> of</c><00:04:48.240><c> weight</c><00:04:48.960><c> our</c>

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
so when we lose a lot of weight our
 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.270 align:start position:0%
so when we lose a lot of weight our
internal<00:04:49.680><c> body</c><00:04:50.000><c> is</c><00:04:50.080><c> like</c><00:04:50.320><c> oh</c><00:04:50.479><c> my</c><00:04:50.720><c> god</c><00:04:51.040><c> we're</c>

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
losing a bunch of weight we better
 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.550 align:start position:0%
losing a bunch of weight we better
compensate<00:04:53.520><c> for</c><00:04:53.680><c> all</c><00:04:53.759><c> this</c><00:04:54.000><c> weight</c><00:04:54.240><c> loss</c>

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
compensate for all this weight loss
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.909 align:start position:0%
compensate for all this weight loss
because<00:04:54.880><c> otherwise</c><00:04:55.280><c> we're</c><00:04:55.440><c> going</c><00:04:55.520><c> to</c><00:04:55.680><c> end</c><00:04:55.840><c> up</c>

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're going to end up
 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.110 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're going to end up
in<00:04:56.000><c> starvation</c>

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
in starvation
 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.629 align:start position:0%
in starvation
and<00:04:57.280><c> so</c><00:04:57.440><c> one</c><00:04:57.600><c> of</c><00:04:57.680><c> the</c><00:04:57.759><c> things</c><00:04:58.000><c> that</c><00:04:58.160><c> it</c><00:04:58.240><c> does</c><00:04:58.479><c> is</c>

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that it does is
 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.310 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things that it does is
it<00:04:58.800><c> changes</c><00:04:59.280><c> something</c><00:04:59.600><c> called</c><00:04:59.759><c> your</c><00:05:00.000><c> basic</c>

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
it changes something called your basic
 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.590 align:start position:0%
it changes something called your basic
metabolic<00:05:01.039><c> rate</c>

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
metabolic rate
 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.189 align:start position:0%
metabolic rate
it<00:05:01.759><c> changes</c><00:05:02.160><c> the</c><00:05:02.240><c> way</c><00:05:02.479><c> that</c><00:05:02.639><c> you</c><00:05:02.800><c> expend</c>

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
it changes the way that you expend
 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.270 align:start position:0%
it changes the way that you expend
energy<00:05:03.680><c> and</c><00:05:03.759><c> it</c><00:05:03.919><c> tries</c><00:05:04.240><c> to</c><00:05:04.400><c> conserve</c><00:05:05.039><c> that</c>

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
energy and it tries to conserve that
 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.070 align:start position:0%
energy and it tries to conserve that
energy

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
energy
 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.990 align:start position:0%
energy
so<00:05:06.240><c> basically</c><00:05:06.639><c> in</c><00:05:07.039><c> a</c><00:05:07.120><c> gaming</c><00:05:07.440><c> analogy</c><00:05:07.840><c> what</c>

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
so basically in a gaming analogy what
 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.590 align:start position:0%
so basically in a gaming analogy what
this<00:05:08.160><c> means</c><00:05:08.479><c> is</c><00:05:08.560><c> that</c><00:05:08.720><c> like</c><00:05:08.960><c> we're</c><00:05:09.199><c> losing</c><00:05:09.520><c> a</c>

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
this means is that like we're losing a
 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.110 align:start position:0%
this means is that like we're losing a
bunch<00:05:09.840><c> of</c><00:05:10.000><c> weight</c><00:05:10.320><c> and</c><00:05:10.400><c> then</c><00:05:10.560><c> our</c><00:05:10.720><c> body</c><00:05:11.039><c> is</c>

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
bunch of weight and then our body is
 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
bunch of weight and then our body is
saying<00:05:11.360><c> oh</c><00:05:11.520><c> my</c><00:05:11.680><c> god</c><00:05:11.919><c> weight</c><00:05:12.160><c> loss</c><00:05:12.479><c> is</c><00:05:12.560><c> op</c>

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
saying oh my god weight loss is op
 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.749 align:start position:0%
saying oh my god weight loss is op
so<00:05:13.520><c> let's</c><00:05:13.919><c> nerf</c><00:05:14.320><c> weight</c><00:05:14.560><c> loss</c><00:05:15.199><c> and</c><00:05:15.360><c> let's</c>

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
so let's nerf weight loss and let's
 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
so let's nerf weight loss and let's
change<00:05:16.240><c> the</c><00:05:16.400><c> way</c><00:05:16.560><c> that</c><00:05:16.800><c> our</c><00:05:16.960><c> body</c>

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
change the way that our body
 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.150 align:start position:0%
change the way that our body
holds<00:05:18.000><c> on</c><00:05:18.320><c> to</c><00:05:18.560><c> energy</c><00:05:19.520><c> and</c><00:05:19.759><c> i</c><00:05:19.840><c> know</c><00:05:20.000><c> this</c>

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
holds on to energy and i know this
 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.670 align:start position:0%
holds on to energy and i know this
sounds<00:05:20.479><c> absolutely</c><00:05:20.960><c> crazy</c><00:05:21.199><c> but</c><00:05:21.360><c> that's</c>

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
sounds absolutely crazy but that's
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.950 align:start position:0%
sounds absolutely crazy but that's
exactly<00:05:22.080><c> what</c><00:05:22.320><c> happens</c>

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens
 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.310 align:start position:0%
exactly what happens
so<00:05:23.199><c> there's</c><00:05:23.360><c> a</c><00:05:23.440><c> great</c><00:05:23.680><c> study</c><00:05:23.919><c> from</c><00:05:24.080><c> the</c><00:05:24.160><c> new</c>

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
so there's a great study from the new
 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.310 align:start position:0%
so there's a great study from the new

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.749 align:start position:0%
well-respected journals in the world
that<00:05:30.080><c> basically</c><00:05:30.639><c> talks</c><00:05:30.960><c> a</c><00:05:31.120><c> little</c><00:05:31.280><c> bit</c><00:05:31.440><c> about</c>

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
that basically talks a little bit about
 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.270 align:start position:0%
that basically talks a little bit about
how<00:05:31.919><c> when</c><00:05:32.160><c> you</c><00:05:32.320><c> lose</c><00:05:32.639><c> weight</c>

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
how when you lose weight
 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.830 align:start position:0%
how when you lose weight
your<00:05:33.520><c> body</c><00:05:34.000><c> compensates</c><00:05:34.800><c> by</c><00:05:35.039><c> slowing</c><00:05:35.600><c> down</c>

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
your body compensates by slowing down
 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
your body compensates by slowing down
its<00:05:36.000><c> metabolism</c>

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
its metabolism
 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.950 align:start position:0%
its metabolism
and<00:05:37.600><c> so</c><00:05:37.840><c> basically</c><00:05:38.240><c> what</c><00:05:38.400><c> it</c><00:05:38.479><c> says</c><00:05:38.720><c> is</c><00:05:38.880><c> that</c>

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so basically what it says is that
 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.870 align:start position:0%
and so basically what it says is that
this<00:05:39.120><c> weight</c><00:05:39.360><c> loss</c><00:05:39.680><c> is</c><00:05:39.759><c> too</c><00:05:40.000><c> drastic</c>

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
this weight loss is too drastic
 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.909 align:start position:0%
this weight loss is too drastic
let's<00:05:41.680><c> conserve</c><00:05:42.479><c> our</c><00:05:42.720><c> calories</c><00:05:43.360><c> let's</c><00:05:43.600><c> hold</c>

let's conserve our calories let's hold
 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.310 align:start position:0%
let's conserve our calories let's hold

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
scary about this is that
 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.710 align:start position:0%
scary about this is that

through a drastic period of weight loss
 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.029 align:start position:0%
through a drastic period of weight loss
actually<00:06:01.360><c> lasts</c><00:06:02.160><c> even</c><00:06:02.479><c> if</c><00:06:02.560><c> you</c><00:06:02.720><c> gain</c><00:06:02.960><c> the</c>

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
actually lasts even if you gain the
 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:03.830 align:start position:0%
actually lasts even if you gain the
weight<00:06:03.280><c> back</c>

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
weight back
 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.189 align:start position:0%
weight back
so<00:06:04.000><c> what</c><00:06:04.160><c> that</c><00:06:04.319><c> means</c><00:06:04.560><c> is</c><00:06:04.800><c> that</c><00:06:04.880><c> if</c><00:06:05.039><c> you</c><00:06:05.120><c> go</c>

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that if you go
 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.350 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that if you go
through<00:06:05.360><c> a</c><00:06:05.440><c> drastic</c><00:06:05.919><c> period</c><00:06:06.319><c> of</c><00:06:06.400><c> weight</c><00:06:06.639><c> loss</c>

through a drastic period of weight loss

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
and you'll actually start to be
 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.990 align:start position:0%
and you'll actually start to be

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.990 align:start position:0%
potentially even go above your set point

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
higher than your old weight and so what
 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.189 align:start position:0%
higher than your old weight and so what
this<00:06:34.400><c> really</c><00:06:34.639><c> means</c>

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
this really means
 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.309 align:start position:0%
this really means

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
it sounds absolutely crazy is that
 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.950 align:start position:0%
it sounds absolutely crazy is that
if<00:06:38.560><c> you</c><00:06:38.720><c> do</c><00:06:38.960><c> drastic</c><00:06:39.600><c> weight</c><00:06:39.840><c> loss</c><00:06:40.400><c> your</c><00:06:40.639><c> body</c>

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
if you do drastic weight loss your body
 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
if you do drastic weight loss your body
will<00:06:41.280><c> try</c><00:06:41.520><c> to</c>

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
will try to
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
will try to
keep<00:06:42.560><c> you</c><00:06:42.800><c> conserving</c><00:06:43.440><c> more</c><00:06:43.759><c> calories</c><00:06:44.319><c> and</c>

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
keep you conserving more calories and
 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.150 align:start position:0%
keep you conserving more calories and
you<00:06:44.639><c> could</c><00:06:44.880><c> actually</c><00:06:45.360><c> wind</c><00:06:45.759><c> up</c>

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
you could actually wind up
 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.390 align:start position:0%
you could actually wind up
at<00:06:46.319><c> a</c><00:06:46.400><c> higher</c><00:06:46.800><c> weight</c><00:06:47.199><c> than</c><00:06:47.360><c> you</c><00:06:47.520><c> used</c><00:06:47.759><c> to</c><00:06:48.240><c> and</c>

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
at a higher weight than you used to and
 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.909 align:start position:0%
at a higher weight than you used to and
that's<00:06:48.720><c> actually</c><00:06:48.960><c> what</c><00:06:49.199><c> setpoint</c><00:06:49.599><c> theory</c>

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
that's actually what setpoint theory
 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:51.189 align:start position:0%
that's actually what setpoint theory
tells<00:06:50.240><c> us</c>

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
tells us
 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.629 align:start position:0%
tells us
so<00:06:51.360><c> let's</c><00:06:51.599><c> think</c><00:06:51.840><c> about</c><00:06:52.000><c> that</c><00:06:52.160><c> for</c><00:06:52.319><c> just</c><00:06:52.560><c> a</c>

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
so let's think about that for just a
 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.550 align:start position:0%
so let's think about that for just a
second<00:06:53.280><c> so</c><00:06:53.440><c> why</c><00:06:53.599><c> does</c><00:06:53.840><c> our</c><00:06:53.919><c> body</c><00:06:54.160><c> do</c><00:06:54.319><c> that</c><00:06:54.479><c> and</c>

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
second so why does our body do that and
 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.749 align:start position:0%
second so why does our body do that and
it<00:06:54.639><c> turns</c><00:06:54.960><c> out</c><00:06:55.039><c> that</c><00:06:55.199><c> it's</c><00:06:55.360><c> actually</c>

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
it turns out that it's actually
 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.870 align:start position:0%
it turns out that it's actually
evolutionary

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
evolutionary
 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.469 align:start position:0%
evolutionary
so<00:06:57.120><c> if</c><00:06:57.360><c> we</c><00:06:57.440><c> go</c><00:06:57.599><c> through</c><00:06:57.840><c> a</c><00:06:57.919><c> period</c><00:06:58.240><c> of</c>

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
so if we go through a period of
 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.309 align:start position:0%
so if we go through a period of
starvation<00:06:59.680><c> you</c><00:06:59.840><c> know</c>

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
starvation you know
 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
starvation you know
the<00:07:00.720><c> organisms</c><00:07:01.440><c> that</c><00:07:01.520><c> were</c><00:07:01.840><c> able</c><00:07:02.160><c> to</c><00:07:02.319><c> be</c><00:07:02.560><c> more</c>

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
the organisms that were able to be more
 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
the organisms that were able to be more
calorie<00:07:03.440><c> efficient</c>

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
calorie efficient
 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.909 align:start position:0%
calorie efficient
after<00:07:04.400><c> those</c><00:07:04.639><c> periods</c><00:07:05.039><c> of</c><00:07:05.120><c> starvation</c><00:07:05.680><c> were</c>

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
after those periods of starvation were
 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:07.830 align:start position:0%
after those periods of starvation were
the<00:07:06.000><c> ones</c><00:07:06.240><c> that</c><00:07:06.400><c> were</c><00:07:06.639><c> more</c><00:07:07.039><c> likely</c>

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
the ones that were more likely
 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.469 align:start position:0%
the ones that were more likely
to<00:07:08.080><c> survive</c><00:07:08.639><c> future</c><00:07:09.039><c> periods</c><00:07:09.440><c> of</c><00:07:09.520><c> starvation</c>

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
to survive future periods of starvation
 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.309 align:start position:0%
to survive future periods of starvation
so<00:07:10.639><c> our</c><00:07:10.800><c> body</c><00:07:11.120><c> basically</c><00:07:11.680><c> learns</c><00:07:12.000><c> from</c><00:07:12.160><c> this</c>

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
so our body basically learns from this
 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:12.950 align:start position:0%
so our body basically learns from this
period<00:07:12.720><c> of</c>

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
period of
 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.430 align:start position:0%
period of

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
of enforced starvation and says we
 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.950 align:start position:0%
of enforced starvation and says we
better<00:07:15.680><c> hold</c><00:07:15.919><c> on</c><00:07:16.000><c> to</c><00:07:16.160><c> weight</c><00:07:16.400><c> as</c><00:07:16.479><c> quickly</c><00:07:16.800><c> as</c>

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
better hold on to weight as quickly as
 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.909 align:start position:0%
better hold on to weight as quickly as
possible<00:07:17.440><c> or</c><00:07:17.680><c> as</c>

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
possible or as
 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:21.029 align:start position:0%
possible or as
severely<00:07:18.479><c> as</c><00:07:18.639><c> possible</c><00:07:20.080><c> and</c><00:07:20.240><c> so</c><00:07:20.560><c> the</c><00:07:20.720><c> problem</c>

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
severely as possible and so the problem
 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.309 align:start position:0%
severely as possible and so the problem
with<00:07:21.199><c> this</c><00:07:21.360><c> is</c><00:07:21.520><c> that</c><00:07:21.599><c> if</c><00:07:21.680><c> we</c><00:07:21.840><c> kind</c><00:07:22.000><c> of</c><00:07:22.080><c> switch</c>

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
with this is that if we kind of switch
 

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.309 align:start position:0%
with this is that if we kind of switch
back<00:07:22.479><c> to</c><00:07:22.639><c> the</c><00:07:22.720><c> diet</c><00:07:23.039><c> industry</c><00:07:23.360><c> for</c><00:07:23.520><c> a</c><00:07:23.599><c> second</c>

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
back to the diet industry for a second
 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:25.670 align:start position:0%
back to the diet industry for a second
you<00:07:24.400><c> know</c><00:07:24.560><c> the</c><00:07:24.720><c> diet</c><00:07:25.039><c> industry</c><00:07:25.360><c> is</c><00:07:25.440><c> really</c>

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
you know the diet industry is really
 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
you know the diet industry is really

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
interesting because what it does is

interesting because what it does is
it<00:07:27.759><c> helps</c><00:07:28.000><c> us</c><00:07:28.240><c> lose</c><00:07:28.560><c> weight</c><00:07:28.800><c> for</c><00:07:28.960><c> a</c><00:07:29.039><c> brief</c>

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
it helps us lose weight for a brief
 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.550 align:start position:0%
it helps us lose weight for a brief

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then what inevitably happens is we
 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.749 align:start position:0%
and then what inevitably happens is we
gain<00:07:32.639><c> all</c><00:07:32.800><c> the</c><00:07:32.880><c> weight</c><00:07:33.199><c> back</c>

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
gain all the weight back
 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.749 align:start position:0%
gain all the weight back
right<00:07:34.400><c> and</c><00:07:34.560><c> then</c><00:07:34.800><c> something</c><00:07:35.199><c> very</c><00:07:35.520><c> very</c>

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.350 align:start position:0%

really what's going on actually what's

going on is that the crash diet that you
 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.550 align:start position:0%
going on is that the crash diet that you

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
went on
 

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.869 align:start position:0%

is<00:08:04.800><c> actually</c><00:08:05.280><c> changing</c><00:08:05.759><c> your</c><00:08:05.919><c> metabolism</c><00:08:06.720><c> to</c>

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
is actually changing your metabolism to
 

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.469 align:start position:0%
is actually changing your metabolism to
gain<00:08:07.199><c> weight</c><00:08:07.520><c> afterwards</c><00:08:08.000><c> so</c><00:08:08.160><c> it's</c><00:08:08.319><c> kind</c><00:08:08.400><c> of</c>

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
gain weight afterwards so it's kind of
 

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
gain weight afterwards so it's kind of
like<00:08:08.720><c> it's</c><00:08:08.960><c> a</c><00:08:09.039><c> huge</c><00:08:09.440><c> scam</c>

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
like it's a huge scam
 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
like it's a huge scam
and<00:08:10.479><c> a</c><00:08:10.560><c> huge</c><00:08:10.879><c> point</c><00:08:11.120><c> of</c><00:08:11.199><c> misunderstanding</c><00:08:12.720><c> um</c>

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
and a huge point of misunderstanding um
 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.189 align:start position:0%

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:16.629 align:start position:0%
and so another thing just about a set
point<00:08:15.440><c> theory</c><00:08:15.759><c> like</c><00:08:15.919><c> so</c><00:08:16.080><c> a</c><00:08:16.160><c> lot</c><00:08:16.319><c> of</c><00:08:16.400><c> people</c>

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
point theory like so a lot of people
 

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:17.670 align:start position:0%
point theory like so a lot of people
when<00:08:16.800><c> they</c><00:08:17.039><c> diet</c>

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.230 align:start position:0%

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
they diet with the idea that okay so i'm
 

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.909 align:start position:0%
they diet with the idea that okay so i'm

00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
eating 2 000 calories a day right now
 

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:23.430 align:start position:0%
eating 2 000 calories a day right now
i'm<00:08:22.000><c> not</c><00:08:22.240><c> gaining</c><00:08:22.560><c> weight</c><00:08:22.800><c> i'm</c><00:08:22.879><c> not</c><00:08:23.120><c> losing</c>

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not gaining weight i'm not losing
 

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:23.909 align:start position:0%
i'm not gaining weight i'm not losing
weight

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
weight
 

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:26.550 align:start position:0%
weight
so<00:08:24.080><c> if</c><00:08:24.160><c> i</c><00:08:24.240><c> go</c><00:08:24.400><c> on</c><00:08:24.479><c> a</c><00:08:24.560><c> crash</c><00:08:24.960><c> diet</c><00:08:25.360><c> and</c><00:08:25.520><c> i</c><00:08:25.680><c> lose</c><00:08:26.000><c> 15</c>

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
so if i go on a crash diet and i lose 15
 

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.029 align:start position:0%
so if i go on a crash diet and i lose 15
pounds

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
pounds
 

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:30.230 align:start position:0%

and<00:08:27.120><c> i</c><00:08:27.280><c> go</c><00:08:27.520><c> back</c><00:08:27.759><c> to</c><00:08:27.919><c> a</c><00:08:28.160><c> like</c><00:08:28.479><c> my</c><00:08:28.960><c> regular</c><00:08:29.520><c> diet</c>

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.149 align:start position:0%
and i go back to a like my regular diet
i'll<00:08:30.479><c> stay</c><00:08:30.800><c> at</c><00:08:30.879><c> that</c><00:08:31.199><c> new</c><00:08:31.440><c> lower</c><00:08:31.759><c> weight</c><00:08:32.080><c> i</c>

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
i'll stay at that new lower weight i
 

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:33.909 align:start position:0%
i'll stay at that new lower weight i
won't<00:08:32.399><c> gain</c><00:08:32.560><c> weight</c><00:08:32.880><c> i</c><00:08:32.959><c> won't</c><00:08:33.120><c> lose</c><00:08:33.360><c> weight</c>

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't really work because
 

00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:37.190 align:start position:0%

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
actually cause you to binge more

actually cause you to binge more
so<00:10:42.959><c> here</c><00:10:43.120><c> are</c><00:10:43.200><c> just</c><00:10:43.360><c> a</c><00:10:43.440><c> couple</c><00:10:43.760><c> of</c><00:10:43.920><c> things</c><00:10:44.160><c> that</c>

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
you can do so the first thing to
 

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%
you can do so the first thing to

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
understand is that sustained weight loss
 

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
understand is that sustained weight loss
is<00:10:47.680><c> gained</c><00:10:47.920><c> through</c><00:10:48.160><c> sustained</c><00:10:48.640><c> action</c>

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
and a good example of this
 

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
and a good example of this
is<00:11:09.519><c> flax</c><00:11:09.839><c> seeds</c><00:11:10.560><c> so</c><00:11:10.800><c> flax</c><00:11:11.120><c> seeds</c><00:11:11.519><c> actually</c>

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
is flax seeds so flax seeds actually
 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.190 align:start position:0%
is flax seeds so flax seeds actually
increase<00:11:12.480><c> our</c><00:11:12.720><c> leptin</c><00:11:13.200><c> sensitivity</c><00:11:14.959><c> and</c><00:11:15.040><c> so</c>

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
increase our leptin sensitivity and so
 

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
increase our leptin sensitivity and so
people<00:11:15.440><c> may</c><00:11:15.600><c> ask</c><00:11:15.839><c> okay</c><00:11:16.079><c> what</c><00:11:16.240><c> is</c><00:11:16.399><c> leptin</c>

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
people may ask okay what is leptin
 

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.430 align:start position:0%
people may ask okay what is leptin
so<00:11:17.680><c> in</c><00:11:17.839><c> our</c><00:11:17.920><c> body</c><00:11:18.240><c> we</c><00:11:18.399><c> have</c><00:11:18.640><c> two</c><00:11:18.880><c> hormones</c>

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
so in our body we have two hormones
 

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.790 align:start position:0%
so in our body we have two hormones
leptin<00:11:19.839><c> and</c><00:11:19.920><c> ghrelin</c>

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.949 align:start position:0%
leptin and ghrelin
leptin<00:11:21.279><c> is</c><00:11:21.360><c> the</c><00:11:21.440><c> hormone</c><00:11:21.920><c> that</c><00:11:22.079><c> tells</c><00:11:22.399><c> us</c><00:11:22.720><c> hey</c>

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
leptin is the hormone that tells us hey
 

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:24.150 align:start position:0%
leptin is the hormone that tells us hey
we're<00:11:23.200><c> feeling</c><00:11:23.600><c> full</c>

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
we're feeling full
 

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
we're feeling full
and<00:11:24.320><c> ghrelin</c><00:11:25.040><c> is</c><00:11:25.200><c> the</c><00:11:25.279><c> hormone</c><00:11:25.760><c> that</c><00:11:25.920><c> says</c><00:11:26.320><c> hey</c>

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
and ghrelin is the hormone that says hey
 

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.550 align:start position:0%
and ghrelin is the hormone that says hey
we're<00:11:26.800><c> hungry</c><00:11:27.120><c> we</c><00:11:27.279><c> need</c><00:11:27.440><c> to</c><00:11:27.600><c> eat</c><00:11:27.839><c> more</c>

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
we're hungry we need to eat more
 

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
we're hungry we need to eat more
so<00:11:28.720><c> what</c><00:11:28.880><c> we</c><00:11:29.040><c> find</c><00:11:29.360><c> in</c><00:11:29.440><c> people</c><00:11:29.839><c> who</c><00:11:30.240><c> are</c>

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
so what we find in people who are
 

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.949 align:start position:0%
so what we find in people who are
overweight<00:11:31.120><c> is</c><00:11:31.200><c> that</c><00:11:31.360><c> they</c><00:11:31.519><c> are</c><00:11:31.760><c> actually</c>

00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
overweight is that they are actually
 

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:35.670 align:start position:0%
overweight is that they are actually
resistant<00:11:34.240><c> to</c><00:11:34.560><c> leptin</c><00:11:35.120><c> and</c><00:11:35.200><c> so</c><00:11:35.360><c> what</c><00:11:35.519><c> that</c>

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
resistant to leptin and so what that
 

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.590 align:start position:0%
resistant to leptin and so what that
means<00:11:36.000><c> is</c><00:11:36.160><c> that</c><00:11:36.320><c> there's</c><00:11:36.560><c> a</c><00:11:36.720><c> hormone</c>

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
means is that there's a hormone
 

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.829 align:start position:0%
means is that there's a hormone
that<00:11:37.760><c> is</c><00:11:38.000><c> telling</c><00:11:38.399><c> you</c><00:11:38.800><c> hey</c><00:11:39.040><c> we've</c><00:11:39.279><c> had</c><00:11:39.519><c> enough</c>

00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
that is telling you hey we've had enough
 

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:40.630 align:start position:0%
that is telling you hey we've had enough
food

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
food
 

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.550 align:start position:0%
food
but<00:11:40.800><c> you</c><00:11:41.040><c> are</c><00:11:41.120><c> resistant</c><00:11:41.680><c> to</c><00:11:41.760><c> that</c><00:11:42.000><c> signal</c><00:11:42.399><c> so</c>

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
but you are resistant to that signal so
 

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.870 align:start position:0%
but you are resistant to that signal so
you're<00:11:42.800><c> not</c><00:11:42.959><c> really</c><00:11:43.200><c> receiving</c><00:11:43.760><c> that</c><00:11:44.000><c> message</c>

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're not really receiving that message
 

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.949 align:start position:0%
you're not really receiving that message
and<00:11:45.120><c> flax</c><00:11:45.519><c> seeds</c><00:11:45.839><c> have</c><00:11:46.000><c> actually</c><00:11:46.320><c> been</c><00:11:46.560><c> shown</c>

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
and flax seeds have actually been shown
 

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
and flax seeds have actually been shown
to<00:11:47.279><c> increase</c><00:11:47.839><c> leptin</c><00:11:48.240><c> sensitivity</c>

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
to increase leptin sensitivity
 

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.470 align:start position:0%
to increase leptin sensitivity
so<00:11:49.200><c> what</c><00:11:49.360><c> that</c><00:11:49.519><c> means</c><00:11:49.839><c> is</c><00:11:50.000><c> that</c><00:11:50.160><c> if</c><00:11:50.240><c> you're</c>

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that if you're
 

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.629 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that if you're
eating<00:11:50.800><c> a</c><00:11:50.880><c> particular</c><00:11:51.440><c> meal</c><00:11:51.839><c> and</c><00:11:52.000><c> you</c><00:11:52.240><c> add</c>

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
eating a particular meal and you add
 

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
eating a particular meal and you add
let's<00:11:52.800><c> say</c><00:11:52.959><c> like</c><00:11:53.120><c> a</c><00:11:53.279><c> teaspoon</c><00:11:53.680><c> of</c><00:11:53.760><c> flax</c><00:11:54.079><c> seeds</c>

let's say like a teaspoon of flax seeds

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
on top literally that
 

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.150 align:start position:0%
on top literally that

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
meal's capacity to make you feel full
 

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.710 align:start position:0%
meal's capacity to make you feel full
goes<00:12:00.560><c> up</c><00:12:00.800><c> with</c><00:12:00.959><c> that</c><00:12:01.120><c> teaspoon</c><00:12:01.600><c> of</c><00:12:01.680><c> flax</c><00:12:01.920><c> seeds</c>

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
goes up with that teaspoon of flax seeds
 

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.470 align:start position:0%

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:04.949 align:start position:0%
so a lot of simple things that you can
do

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
