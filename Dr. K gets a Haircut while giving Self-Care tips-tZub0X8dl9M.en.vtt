yeah so I think kind of what I said is
 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think kind of what I said is
like<00:04:45.830><c> first</c><00:04:46.460><c> start</c><00:04:46.850><c> by</c><00:04:47.000><c> being</c><00:04:47.240><c> with</c><00:04:47.480><c> yourself</c>

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 align:start position:0%
like first start by being with yourself
 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.070 align:start position:0%
like first start by being with yourself
so<00:04:48.950><c> we</c><00:04:49.370><c> spend</c><00:04:49.670><c> so</c><00:04:49.940><c> much</c><00:04:50.150><c> of</c><00:04:50.210><c> our</c><00:04:50.450><c> time</c><00:04:50.690><c> with</c>

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
so we spend so much of our time with
 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.620 align:start position:0%

spent time like when you're like when
 

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
spent time like when you're like when
you<00:12:00.939><c> fail</c><00:12:01.269><c> you</c><00:12:01.300><c> miss</c><00:12:07.439><c> it</c><00:12:09.569><c> so</c><00:12:11.610><c> you</c><00:12:12.610><c> know</c><00:12:12.730><c> we</c>

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:12.850 align:start position:0%
you fail you miss it so you know we
 

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.059 align:start position:0%
you fail you miss it so you know we
don't<00:12:12.970><c> sew</c><00:12:13.689><c> like</c><00:12:13.839><c> this</c><00:12:14.019><c> this</c><00:12:14.290><c> is</c><00:12:14.499><c> getting</c><00:12:14.829><c> like</c>

00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:15.069 align:start position:0%
don't sew like this this is getting like
 

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:16.470 align:start position:0%
don't sew like this this is getting like
so<00:12:15.249><c> I</c><00:12:15.279><c> think</c><00:12:15.399><c> this</c><00:12:15.610><c> is</c><00:12:15.670><c> one</c><00:12:15.939><c> of</c><00:12:15.970><c> the</c><00:12:16.120><c> reasons</c>

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
so I think this is one of the reasons
 

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.850 align:start position:0%
so I think this is one of the reasons
why<00:12:16.660><c> like</c><00:12:16.870><c> mental</c><00:12:17.230><c> health</c><00:12:17.439><c> is</c><00:12:17.589><c> getting</c><00:12:17.709><c> worse</c>

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:17.860 align:start position:0%
why like mental health is getting worse
 

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.900 align:start position:0%
why like mental health is getting worse
is<00:12:18.399><c> because</c><00:12:19.389><c> we</c><00:12:19.629><c> spend</c><00:12:19.990><c> more</c><00:12:20.350><c> and</c><00:12:20.620><c> more</c><00:12:20.680><c> time</c>

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:20.910 align:start position:0%
is because we spend more and more time
 

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.759 align:start position:0%
is because we spend more and more time
with<00:12:21.910><c> our</c><00:12:21.939><c> mind</c><00:12:22.360><c> focus</c><00:12:22.870><c> on</c><00:12:23.019><c> external</c><00:12:23.319><c> things</c>

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:23.769 align:start position:0%
with our mind focus on external things
 

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:26.249 align:start position:0%
