00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
thing about most abusive relationships
is<00:05:55.919><c> how</c><00:05:56.080><c> they're</c><00:05:56.400><c> propagated</c><00:05:57.120><c> by</c><00:05:57.360><c> like</c>

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
is how they're propagated by like
 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
is how they're propagated by like
feelings<00:05:58.560><c> of</c><00:05:58.800><c> love</c><00:05:59.120><c> and</c><00:05:59.280><c> loyalty</c>

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
them it's not because of fear it's
 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.309 align:start position:0%
them it's not because of fear it's
because<00:06:09.039><c> of</c><00:06:09.199><c> guilt</c>

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.070 align:start position:0%
because of guilt
right<00:06:10.639><c> it's</c><00:06:10.800><c> because</c><00:06:11.120><c> of</c><00:06:11.199><c> like</c><00:06:11.520><c> emotional</c>

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
right it's because of like emotional
 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.189 align:start position:0%
right it's because of like emotional

right
 

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.510 align:start position:0%
right
so<00:29:07.600><c> sometimes</c><00:29:08.320><c> i</c><00:29:08.399><c> can</c><00:29:08.640><c> feel</c><00:29:08.799><c> guilty</c><00:29:09.200><c> because</c><00:29:09.440><c> i</c>

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
so sometimes i can feel guilty because i
 

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
so sometimes i can feel guilty because i

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
pumpkin cheesecake
my<00:29:17.200><c> actions</c><00:29:17.679><c> have</c><00:29:17.919><c> created</c><00:29:18.399><c> a</c><00:29:18.559><c> negative</c>

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
my actions have created a negative
 

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.269 align:start position:0%
my actions have created a negative
emotion<00:29:20.000><c> right</c>

00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
emotion right
 

00:29:21.279 --> 00:29:23.750 align:start position:0%
emotion right
and<00:29:21.360><c> so</c><00:29:21.520><c> who's</c><00:29:21.840><c> responsible</c><00:29:22.399><c> for</c><00:29:22.559><c> that</c>

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so who's responsible for that
 

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.669 align:start position:0%
and so who's responsible for that
let's<00:29:23.919><c> say</c><00:29:24.080><c> the</c><00:29:24.240><c> flip</c><00:29:24.480><c> end</c><00:29:24.640><c> of</c><00:29:24.720><c> the</c><00:29:24.799><c> spectrum</c>

00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
let's say the flip end of the spectrum
 

00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:27.510 align:start position:0%
let's say the flip end of the spectrum
hate<00:29:25.919><c> speech</c>

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
hate speech
 

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
hate speech
right<00:29:27.760><c> so</c><00:29:27.919><c> if</c><00:29:28.000><c> i</c><00:29:28.240><c> engage</c><00:29:28.720><c> in</c><00:29:28.880><c> hate</c><00:29:29.120><c> speech</c><00:29:29.919><c> that</c>

00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
right so if i engage in hate speech that
 

00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:32.230 align:start position:0%
right so if i engage in hate speech that
is<00:29:30.320><c> also</c><00:29:30.480><c> an</c><00:29:30.640><c> action</c><00:29:30.960><c> that</c><00:29:31.039><c> i'm</c><00:29:31.200><c> taking</c>

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
is also an action that i'm taking
 

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.830 align:start position:0%
is also an action that i'm taking
that<00:29:32.559><c> makes</c><00:29:32.799><c> someone</c><00:29:33.120><c> feel</c><00:29:33.360><c> really</c><00:29:33.600><c> bad</c><00:29:33.760><c> and</c>

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
that makes someone feel really bad and
 

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.870 align:start position:0%
that makes someone feel really bad and
they<00:29:34.000><c> start</c><00:29:34.240><c> crying</c><00:29:34.720><c> or</c><00:29:34.880><c> bullying</c><00:29:35.440><c> let's</c><00:29:35.679><c> say</c>

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
they start crying or bullying let's say
 

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.710 align:start position:0%
they start crying or bullying let's say
so<00:29:37.039><c> who's</c><00:29:37.360><c> responsible</c><00:29:38.000><c> for</c><00:29:38.159><c> that</c>

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
so who's responsible for that
 

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.909 align:start position:0%
so who's responsible for that
you<00:29:40.799><c> know</c><00:29:40.960><c> so</c><00:29:41.039><c> i</c><00:29:41.120><c> think</c><00:29:41.200><c> it's</c><00:29:41.360><c> really</c><00:29:41.600><c> tricky</c>

00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
you know so i think it's really tricky
 

00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:43.669 align:start position:0%
you know so i think it's really tricky
because<00:29:42.159><c> the</c><00:29:42.240><c> world</c><00:29:42.559><c> is</c><00:29:42.640><c> definitely</c><00:29:43.120><c> moving</c>

right<00:29:50.960><c> that's</c><00:29:51.279><c> the</c><00:29:51.440><c> direction</c><00:29:51.919><c> the</c><00:29:52.080><c> world</c><00:29:52.320><c> is</c>

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
right that's the direction the world is
 

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.710 align:start position:0%
right that's the direction the world is
is<00:29:52.960><c> going</c><00:29:53.279><c> in</c><00:29:53.600><c> and</c><00:29:53.840><c> i</c><00:29:53.919><c> think</c><00:29:54.080><c> it's</c><00:29:54.240><c> dangerous</c>

00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
is going in and i think it's dangerous
 

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.830 align:start position:0%
is going in and i think it's dangerous
