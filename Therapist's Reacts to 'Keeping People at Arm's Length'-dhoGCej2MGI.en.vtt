so let me say this the first thing is
 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.710 align:start position:0%
so let me say this the first thing is
that<00:05:41.360><c> when</c><00:05:41.520><c> we</c><00:05:41.680><c> go</c><00:05:41.919><c> through</c><00:05:42.080><c> a</c><00:05:42.160><c> stressful</c><00:05:42.639><c> and</c>

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
that when we go through a stressful and
 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.629 align:start position:0%
that when we go through a stressful and
traumatic<00:05:43.199><c> experience</c><00:05:43.680><c> there's</c><00:05:44.000><c> a</c><00:05:44.080><c> tendency</c>

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
traumatic experience there's a tendency
 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
traumatic experience there's a tendency
to<00:05:44.800><c> regress</c>

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
to regress
 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
to regress
okay<00:05:46.880><c> so</c><00:05:47.039><c> this</c><00:05:47.280><c> is</c><00:05:47.360><c> like</c><00:05:47.520><c> the</c><00:05:47.680><c> equivalent</c><00:05:48.240><c> of</c>

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay so this is like the equivalent of
 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.550 align:start position:0%
okay so this is like the equivalent of
like<00:05:48.639><c> going</c><00:05:48.960><c> back</c><00:05:49.199><c> to</c><00:05:49.280><c> what</c><00:05:49.520><c> you</c><00:05:49.680><c> know</c>
