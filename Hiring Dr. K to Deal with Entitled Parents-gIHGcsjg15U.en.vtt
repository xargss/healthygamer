that<00:00:25.439><c> we're</c><00:00:25.599><c> going</c><00:00:25.680><c> to</c><00:00:25.760><c> talk</c><00:00:25.920><c> about</c><00:00:26.160><c> is</c><00:00:26.240><c> that</c><00:00:26.400><c> a</c>

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
that we're going to talk about is that a
 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.070 align:start position:0%
that we're going to talk about is that a
narcissistic<00:00:27.359><c> parent</c>

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
narcissistic parent
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.189 align:start position:0%
narcissistic parent
an<00:00:28.240><c> entitled</c><00:00:28.880><c> and</c><00:00:29.199><c> an</c><00:00:29.439><c> entitled</c><00:00:30.080><c> parent</c><00:00:30.960><c> is</c>

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
an entitled and an entitled parent is
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.509 align:start position:0%
an entitled and an entitled parent is
not

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 align:start position:0%
not
 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.750 align:start position:0%
not
necessarily<00:00:32.239><c> the</c><00:00:32.399><c> same</c><00:00:32.800><c> so</c><00:00:33.040><c> oftentimes</c>

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same so oftentimes
 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.510 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same so oftentimes
entitlement<00:00:34.399><c> and</c><00:00:34.480><c> narcissism</c><00:00:35.200><c> tend</c><00:00:35.360><c> to</c>

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
entitlement and narcissism tend to
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.549 align:start position:0%
entitlement and narcissism tend to
overlap

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
overlap
 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.709 align:start position:0%
overlap
but<00:00:36.719><c> i</c><00:00:36.800><c> think</c><00:00:37.040><c> about</c><00:00:37.360><c> narcissism</c><00:00:38.320><c> as</c>

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
but i think about narcissism as
 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.709 align:start position:0%
but i think about narcissism as
essentially<00:00:39.280><c> a</c><00:00:39.440><c> fragile</c><00:00:40.079><c> sense</c><00:00:40.480><c> of</c>

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
essentially a fragile sense of
 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.950 align:start position:0%
essentially a fragile sense of
internal<00:00:41.280><c> self</c><00:00:42.480><c> that</c><00:00:42.800><c> requires</c><00:00:43.680><c> a</c><00:00:43.920><c> lot</c><00:00:44.320><c> of</c>

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
internal self that requires a lot of
 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.790 align:start position:0%
internal self that requires a lot of
very<00:00:45.440><c> careful</c><00:00:46.239><c> outward</c><00:00:47.920><c> appearance</c><00:00:48.640><c> and</c>

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
very careful outward appearance and
 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.549 align:start position:0%
very careful outward appearance and
treatment<00:00:49.280><c> to</c><00:00:49.440><c> sort</c><00:00:49.600><c> of</c><00:00:49.760><c> maintain</c><00:00:50.320><c> your</c>

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
treatment to sort of maintain your
 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.229 align:start position:0%
treatment to sort of maintain your
internal<00:00:51.039><c> sense</c><00:00:51.360><c> of</c><00:00:51.440><c> self</c>

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
internal sense of self
 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.270 align:start position:0%
internal sense of self
so<00:00:52.480><c> narcissists</c><00:00:53.120><c> sort</c><00:00:53.360><c> of</c><00:00:53.600><c> take</c><00:00:53.920><c> the</c><00:00:54.320><c> like</c>

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
so narcissists sort of take the like
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
so narcissists sort of take the like
take<00:00:55.600><c> things</c><00:00:56.079><c> in</c><00:00:56.239><c> the</c><00:00:56.399><c> world</c><00:00:56.800><c> around</c><00:00:57.199><c> them</c><00:00:57.520><c> is</c>

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
take things in the world around them is
 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
take things in the world around them is
like<00:00:57.920><c> personal</c><00:00:58.480><c> insults</c>

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
like personal insults
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.389 align:start position:0%
like personal insults

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
so if for example you're supposed to
 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.070 align:start position:0%
so if for example you're supposed to
pick<00:01:02.559><c> me</c><00:01:02.719><c> up</c><00:01:02.800><c> from</c><00:01:02.960><c> the</c><00:01:03.199><c> airport</c><00:01:03.680><c> and</c><00:01:03.760><c> you</c><00:01:03.920><c> get</c>

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 align:start position:0%

they no longer want to play it anymore i
 

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
they no longer want to play it anymore i
know<00:12:18.880><c> it</c><00:12:18.959><c> sounds</c><00:12:19.200><c> kind</c><00:12:19.279><c> of</c><00:12:19.360><c> weird</c><00:12:19.600><c> but</c><00:12:19.680><c> you</c>

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
know it sounds kind of weird but you
 

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.870 align:start position:0%
know it sounds kind of weird but you
don't<00:12:19.920><c> have</c><00:12:20.000><c> to</c><00:12:20.079><c> convince</c><00:12:20.320><c> them</c><00:12:20.480><c> of</c><00:12:20.560><c> anything</c>

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to convince them of anything
 

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.150 align:start position:0%
don't have to convince them of anything
you<00:12:21.040><c> just</c><00:12:21.200><c> have</c><00:12:21.279><c> to</c><00:12:21.360><c> point</c><00:12:21.600><c> out</c><00:12:21.680><c> the</c><00:12:21.839><c> rules</c><00:12:22.079><c> to</c>

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
you just have to point out the rules to
 

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
you just have to point out the rules to
them

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
them
 

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
them
so<00:12:22.800><c> it's</c><00:12:22.959><c> kind</c><00:12:23.120><c> of</c><00:12:23.200><c> interesting</c><00:12:23.600><c> because</c><00:12:23.920><c> you</c>

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of interesting because you
 

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.269 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of interesting because you
know<00:12:24.079><c> it's</c><00:12:24.160><c> sort</c><00:12:24.320><c> of</c><00:12:24.480><c> this</c><00:12:24.639><c> idea</c><00:12:24.959><c> that</c><00:12:25.120><c> like</c>

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%

this<00:16:01.360><c> is</c><00:16:01.519><c> when</c><00:16:01.680><c> we</c><00:16:01.839><c> start</c><00:16:02.079><c> to</c><00:16:02.160><c> see</c><00:16:02.320><c> entitled</c>

but the reason that we maintain this
relationship<00:23:47.919><c> is</c><00:23:48.080><c> because</c><00:23:48.320><c> i</c><00:23:48.400><c> don't</c><00:23:48.559><c> have</c><00:23:48.720><c> a</c>

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
relationship is because i don't have a

choice i feel like i'm a hostage
which<00:23:51.279><c> is</c><00:23:51.440><c> fine</c><00:23:51.840><c> it's</c><00:23:52.000><c> just</c><00:23:52.559><c> you</c><00:23:52.640><c> know</c><00:23:52.880><c> as</c><00:23:53.440><c> i</c>

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
which is fine it's just you know as i
 

00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
which is fine it's just you know as i
start<00:23:53.919><c> to</c><00:23:54.080><c> gain</c><00:23:54.400><c> independence</c>
