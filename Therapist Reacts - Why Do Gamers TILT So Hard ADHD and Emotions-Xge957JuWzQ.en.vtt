00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
that i've seen a lot whereas if you like
if<00:02:56.480><c> you</c><00:02:56.640><c> look</c><00:02:56.800><c> at</c><00:02:56.959><c> like</c><00:02:57.360><c> the</c><00:02:57.519><c> normal</c>

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at like the normal
 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.149 align:start position:0%
if you look at like the normal
population<00:02:58.720><c> okay</c><00:02:58.959><c> so</c><00:02:59.120><c> let's</c><00:02:59.360><c> just</c><00:02:59.599><c> use</c><00:02:59.840><c> paint</c>

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
population okay so let's just use paint
 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.110 align:start position:0%
population okay so let's just use paint
for<00:03:00.319><c> a</c><00:03:00.400><c> second</c><00:03:01.200><c> so</c><00:03:01.440><c> let's</c><00:03:01.680><c> say</c><00:03:01.920><c> like</c><00:03:02.480><c> here</c><00:03:02.959><c> is</c>

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
for a second so let's say like here is
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.190 align:start position:0%
for a second so let's say like here is
the<00:03:03.280><c> normal</c><00:03:03.680><c> population</c><00:03:04.560><c> in</c><00:03:04.720><c> terms</c><00:03:04.959><c> of</c>

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
the normal population in terms of
 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.350 align:start position:0%
the normal population in terms of
emotional<00:03:05.760><c> regulation</c><00:03:06.560><c> and</c><00:03:06.720><c> then</c><00:03:06.959><c> here's</c>

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
emotional regulation and then here's
 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.430 align:start position:0%
emotional regulation and then here's
like<00:03:07.680><c> adhd</c>

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
like adhd
 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
like adhd
so<00:03:09.680><c> this</c><00:03:09.920><c> is</c><00:03:10.000><c> what</c><00:03:10.159><c> it'll</c><00:03:10.400><c> look</c><00:03:10.640><c> like</c><00:03:11.040><c> where</c>

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
so this is what it'll look like where
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
so this is what it'll look like where
emotion<00:03:12.040><c> dysregulation</c><00:03:13.200><c> is</c><00:03:13.680><c> is</c><00:03:13.920><c> worse</c><00:03:14.319><c> in</c>

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
emotion dysregulation is is worse in
 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
emotion dysregulation is is worse in
people<00:03:14.640><c> with</c><00:03:14.800><c> adhd</c><00:03:15.440><c> than</c><00:03:15.599><c> it</c><00:03:15.680><c> is</c><00:03:15.840><c> in</c><00:03:15.920><c> the</c>

people with adhd than it is in the
 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.070 align:start position:0%
people with adhd than it is in the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.190 align:start position:0%
increasing i think what we're beginning
to<00:03:38.319><c> see</c>

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
to see
 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
to see
is<00:03:39.360><c> that</c><00:03:39.519><c> the</c><00:03:39.760><c> overlap</c><00:03:40.400><c> between</c><00:03:41.200><c> the</c><00:03:41.440><c> regular</c>

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
is that the overlap between the regular
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.270 align:start position:0%
is that the overlap between the regular
population<00:03:43.040><c> and</c><00:03:43.200><c> the</c><00:03:43.360><c> adhd</c><00:03:44.159><c> population</c><00:03:44.959><c> is</c>

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
population and the adhd population is
 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.470 align:start position:0%
population and the adhd population is
shrinking

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
shrinking
 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.470 align:start position:0%

so<00:03:46.720><c> this</c><00:03:47.040><c> is</c><00:03:47.120><c> what</c><00:03:47.280><c> it</c><00:03:47.360><c> looks</c><00:03:47.599><c> like</c><00:03:47.920><c> now</c><00:03:48.319><c> where</c>

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
so this is what it looks like now where
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.110 align:start position:0%
so this is what it looks like now where
there<00:03:48.799><c> there's</c><00:03:49.040><c> like</c><00:03:49.200><c> the</c><00:03:49.440><c> amount</c><00:03:49.760><c> of</c><00:03:50.000><c> overlap</c>

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
there there's like the amount of overlap
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.350 align:start position:0%
there there's like the amount of overlap
is<00:03:51.360><c> increasing</c><00:03:52.000><c> so</c><00:03:52.159><c> these</c><00:03:52.480><c> two</c><00:03:52.799><c> curves</c><00:03:53.200><c> are</c>

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
is increasing so these two curves are
 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.589 align:start position:0%
is increasing so these two curves are

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
works so the first thing that i'm going
 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.469 align:start position:0%
works so the first thing that i'm going
to<00:04:28.800><c> do</c><00:04:28.880><c> is</c><00:04:29.040><c> share</c><00:04:29.280><c> with</c><00:04:29.440><c> you</c><00:04:29.520><c> all</c><00:04:29.759><c> a</c><00:04:29.919><c> couple</c><00:04:30.240><c> of</c>

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
and adhd right it's attentional problems
 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.270 align:start position:0%
and adhd right it's attentional problems
so<00:06:15.440><c> i'm</c><00:06:15.520><c> not</c><00:06:15.759><c> able</c><00:06:15.919><c> to</c><00:06:16.080><c> restrain</c><00:06:16.560><c> my</c><00:06:16.800><c> attention</c>

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm not able to restrain my attention
 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.430 align:start position:0%

their brain kind of assesses choices

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
ability to restrain those impulses is

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.550 align:start position:0%
relatively low so what does all this
have<00:07:17.039><c> to</c><00:07:17.120><c> do</c><00:07:17.280><c> with</c><00:07:17.360><c> emotional</c><00:07:17.840><c> dysregulation</c>

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
so let's talk about that very quickly
okay<00:07:20.639><c> we</c><00:07:20.880><c> also</c><00:07:21.199><c> know</c><00:07:21.360><c> through</c><00:07:21.599><c> research</c><00:07:22.080><c> that</c>
