is like
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.910 align:start position:0%
is like
when<00:01:03.039><c> we</c><00:01:03.359><c> think</c><00:01:03.680><c> about</c><00:01:04.320><c> who</c><00:01:04.559><c> we</c><00:01:04.960><c> are</c><00:01:05.519><c> what</c><00:01:05.760><c> is</c>

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
machine
 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.070 align:start position:0%
machine
right<00:01:10.960><c> and</c><00:01:11.200><c> this</c><00:01:11.360><c> is</c><00:01:11.520><c> interesting</c><00:01:11.920><c> because</c>

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 align:start position:0%

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
pedophilic thoughts but let's call them
 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.870 align:start position:0%

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
intrusive thoughts
 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
intrusive thoughts
right<00:01:19.040><c> so</c><00:01:19.280><c> i'm</c><00:01:19.360><c> going</c><00:01:19.520><c> to</c><00:01:19.600><c> sort</c><00:01:19.759><c> of</c><00:01:19.840><c> generalize</c>

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
right so i'm going to sort of generalize
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.270 align:start position:0%
right so i'm going to sort of generalize
this<00:01:20.560><c> a</c><00:01:20.640><c> little</c><00:01:20.880><c> bit</c><00:01:21.439><c> so</c><00:01:21.680><c> sometimes</c><00:01:22.400><c> our</c><00:01:22.720><c> mind</c>

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
this a little bit so sometimes our mind
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.749 align:start position:0%
this a little bit so sometimes our mind
generates<00:01:24.000><c> thoughts</c><00:01:24.479><c> that</c><00:01:25.119><c> like</c><00:01:25.360><c> we</c><00:01:25.520><c> don't</c>

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 align:start position:0%
generates thoughts that like we don't
 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:26.789 align:start position:0%
generates thoughts that like we don't
like

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.469 align:start position:0%
like
and<00:01:26.960><c> so</c><00:01:27.119><c> if</c><00:01:27.200><c> we</c><00:01:27.520><c> stop</c><00:01:27.840><c> and</c><00:01:27.920><c> think</c><00:01:28.080><c> about</c><00:01:28.240><c> them</c>

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
and so if we stop and think about them
 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.149 align:start position:0%
and so if we stop and think about them
then<00:01:28.640><c> what</c><00:01:28.799><c> happens</c><00:01:29.119><c> is</c><00:01:29.200><c> we</c><00:01:29.520><c> feel</c><00:01:29.759><c> like</c>

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
then what happens is we feel like
 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.550 align:start position:0%
then what happens is we feel like
morally<00:01:30.640><c> deficient</c><00:01:31.600><c> for</c><00:01:31.759><c> our</c><00:01:32.000><c> mind</c>
