and<00:15:24.110><c> I</c><00:15:25.110><c> think</c><00:15:25.769><c> it's</c><00:15:25.889><c> like</c><00:15:26.069><c> you</c><00:15:26.220><c> know</c><00:15:26.310><c> if</c><00:15:26.399><c> the</c>

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:26.490 align:start position:0%
and I think it's like you know if the
 

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.069 align:start position:0%
and I think it's like you know if the

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
evidence supports that I'm open to it
 

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:29.629 align:start position:0%
evidence supports that I'm open to it
but<00:15:28.259><c> I</c><00:15:28.319><c> think</c><00:15:28.380><c> that</c><00:15:28.680><c> it's</c><00:15:28.800><c> too</c><00:15:28.949><c> preliminary</c><00:15:29.490><c> to</c>

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's too preliminary to
 

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:31.370 align:start position:0%
but I think that it's too preliminary to
really<00:15:29.880><c> tell</c><00:15:30.060><c> what's</c><00:15:30.389><c> what's</c><00:15:30.959><c> good</c><00:15:31.199><c> or</c><00:15:31.230><c> what's</c>
