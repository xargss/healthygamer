00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
problems out there where you can't say
 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.550 align:start position:0%
problems out there where you can't say
anymore<00:01:42.159><c> like</c><00:01:42.399><c> i</c><00:01:42.560><c> don't</c><00:01:42.799><c> know</c><00:01:43.040><c> what</c><00:01:43.200><c> we</c><00:01:43.360><c> can</c><00:01:43.600><c> do</c>

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
anymore like i don't know what we can do
 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.910 align:start position:0%
anymore like i don't know what we can do

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
dying
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.749 align:start position:0%

like<00:01:47.680><c> that's</c><00:01:47.920><c> not</c><00:01:48.079><c> an</c><00:01:48.240><c> exaggeration</c><00:01:49.280><c> and</c><00:01:49.439><c> this</c>

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 align:start position:0%
like that's not an exaggeration and this
 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.429 align:start position:0%
like that's not an exaggeration and this
happens<00:01:50.240><c> again</c><00:01:50.560><c> and</c><00:01:50.720><c> again</c><00:01:50.960><c> and</c><00:01:51.119><c> it</c><00:01:51.200><c> keeps</c>

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
happens again and again and it keeps
 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.870 align:start position:0%
happens again and again and it keeps
happening<00:01:51.840><c> and</c><00:01:51.920><c> i</c><00:01:52.000><c> think</c><00:01:52.159><c> that</c><00:01:52.320><c> there's</c><00:01:52.560><c> a</c><00:01:52.640><c> lot</c>

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
happening and i think that there's a lot
 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.950 align:start position:0%
happening and i think that there's a lot
that<00:01:53.600><c> we</c><00:01:53.759><c> don't</c><00:01:54.079><c> really</c><00:01:54.399><c> know</c><00:01:54.720><c> how</c><00:01:54.880><c> to</c>

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't really know how to
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.630 align:start position:0%
that we don't really know how to
approach<00:01:55.360><c> this</c><00:01:55.600><c> problem</c>

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
approach this problem
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.510 align:start position:0%
approach this problem
um

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.510 align:start position:0%
um
so<00:01:57.840><c> what</c><00:01:58.000><c> we</c><00:01:58.159><c> tend</c><00:01:58.320><c> to</c><00:01:58.399><c> do</c><00:01:58.560><c> at</c><00:01:58.640><c> healthy</c><00:01:58.960><c> gamer</c>

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
so what we tend to do at healthy gamer
 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.870 align:start position:0%
so what we tend to do at healthy gamer
is

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
is
 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.429 align:start position:0%
is
try<00:02:01.119><c> to</c><00:02:01.200><c> like</c><00:02:01.439><c> look</c><00:02:01.600><c> at</c><00:02:01.680><c> things</c><00:02:01.920><c> authentically</c>

try to like look at things authentically
 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.870 align:start position:0%
try to like look at things authentically
right<00:02:03.600><c> so</c><00:02:03.759><c> we</c><00:02:03.920><c> try</c><00:02:04.079><c> to</c><00:02:04.240><c> like</c><00:02:04.640><c> be</c>

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
right so we try to like be
 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.830 align:start position:0%
right so we try to like be

um treat them like you know give them
 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.869 align:start position:0%
um treat them like you know give them

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
the more that we propagate this kind of

the more that we propagate this kind of

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.710 align:start position:0%
so i think the next thing that i want to
talk<00:11:24.880><c> about</c><00:11:25.200><c> is</c><00:11:25.440><c> like</c><00:11:25.760><c> you</c><00:11:25.920><c> know</c><00:11:26.079><c> what</c><00:11:26.240><c> we</c><00:11:26.480><c> can</c>

the safe space that you gravitate to

the safe space that you gravitate to

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
and this is another thing that started
 

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.230 align:start position:0%
and this is another thing that started
to<00:15:12.560><c> happen</c><00:15:12.880><c> which</c><00:15:13.120><c> is</c><00:15:13.199><c> that</c><00:15:13.360><c> safe</c><00:15:13.600><c> spaces</c><00:15:14.079><c> have</c>

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
to happen which is that safe spaces have
 

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.910 align:start position:0%
to happen which is that safe spaces have
started<00:15:14.560><c> to</c><00:15:14.639><c> become</c><00:15:14.880><c> breeding</c><00:15:15.519><c> grounds</c><00:15:15.839><c> of</c>

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
started to become breeding grounds of

started to become breeding grounds of

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.189 align:start position:0%

so<00:15:17.680><c> what</c><00:15:17.920><c> happened</c><00:15:18.320><c> is</c><00:15:18.399><c> like</c><00:15:18.560><c> people</c><00:15:18.880><c> didn't</c>

so what happened is like people didn't
 

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:20.870 align:start position:0%
so what happened is like people didn't

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.870 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about it so like i've got
a<00:23:02.799><c> lot</c><00:23:02.960><c> of</c><00:23:03.039><c> research</c><00:23:03.440><c> like</c><00:23:03.600><c> in</c><00:23:03.760><c> my</c><00:23:03.919><c> brain</c><00:23:04.720><c> but</c>

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of research like in my brain but
 

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:07.350 align:start position:0%
a lot of research like in my brain but
it's<00:23:05.120><c> not</c><00:23:05.280><c> exhaustively</c><00:23:05.919><c> studied</c><00:23:06.480><c> or</c><00:23:06.880><c> cited</c>

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is that psychologists
 

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.390 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is that psychologists
discovered<00:23:15.120><c> that</c><00:23:15.280><c> processing</c><00:23:15.840><c> trauma</c><00:23:16.240><c> is</c>

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
discovered that processing trauma is
 

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.549 align:start position:0%
discovered that processing trauma is
useful<00:23:17.120><c> okay</c><00:23:17.360><c> so</c><00:23:17.520><c> this</c><00:23:17.679><c> is</c><00:23:17.760><c> like</c><00:23:18.080><c> discovery</c>

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
useful okay so this is like discovery
 

00:23:18.559 --> 00:23:20.230 align:start position:0%
useful okay so this is like discovery
number<00:23:18.880><c> one</c>

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
number one
 

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.669 align:start position:0%
number one
so<00:23:20.400><c> then</c><00:23:20.559><c> what</c><00:23:20.799><c> people</c><00:23:21.200><c> decided</c>

00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
so then what people decided
 

00:23:21.679 --> 00:23:23.430 align:start position:0%
so then what people decided
psychologists<00:23:22.400><c> were</c><00:23:22.559><c> like</c><00:23:22.799><c> oh</c><00:23:23.039><c> there's</c><00:23:23.280><c> like</c>

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.990 align:start position:0%
psychologists were like oh there's like
genocide<00:23:24.080><c> going</c><00:23:24.320><c> on</c><00:23:24.559><c> in</c><00:23:24.720><c> africa</c><00:23:25.200><c> let's</c><00:23:25.520><c> go</c><00:23:25.760><c> and</c>
