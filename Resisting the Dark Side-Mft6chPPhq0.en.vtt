00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
becoming aware of that filter
 

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
becoming aware of that filter
and<00:12:04.480><c> like</c><00:12:04.639><c> so</c><00:12:05.040><c> like</c><00:12:05.360><c> you</c><00:12:05.519><c> know</c><00:12:05.600><c> if</c><00:12:05.680><c> you've</c><00:12:05.839><c> got</c>

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
and like so like you know if you've got
 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.269 align:start position:0%
and like so like you know if you've got
the<00:12:06.079><c> filter</c><00:12:06.480><c> like</c><00:12:06.639><c> that's</c><00:12:06.880><c> what</c><00:12:06.959><c> you've</c><00:12:07.120><c> got</c>

00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
the filter like that's what you've got
 

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.710 align:start position:0%
the filter like that's what you've got
to<00:12:07.360><c> remove</c><00:12:07.760><c> and</c><00:12:07.839><c> then</c><00:12:08.000><c> the</c><00:12:08.079><c> world</c><00:12:08.320><c> will</c><00:12:08.480><c> become</c>

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
to remove and then the world will become
 

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
to remove and then the world will become
a<00:12:08.800><c> different</c><00:12:09.120><c> place</c>

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.190 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:12:12.399><c> i</c><00:12:12.560><c> guess</c><00:12:12.720><c> like</c><00:12:13.440><c> is</c><00:12:14.079><c> removing</c><00:12:14.800><c> the</c>

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess like is removing the
 

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.470 align:start position:0%
so i guess like is removing the
filter<00:12:15.680><c> just</c><00:12:16.720><c> you</c><00:12:16.880><c> know</c><00:12:17.760><c> a</c><00:12:17.920><c> matter</c><00:12:18.160><c> of</c><00:12:18.320><c> like</c>
