00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
with sexual stimuli and so the question
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.030 align:start position:0%
with sexual stimuli and so the question
is<00:01:32.320><c> what</c><00:01:32.479><c> does</c><00:01:32.640><c> that</c>

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
is what does that
 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
is what does that
do<00:01:33.200><c> to</c><00:01:33.360><c> us</c><00:01:34.320><c> and</c><00:01:34.479><c> the</c><00:01:34.640><c> short</c><00:01:34.960><c> answer</c><00:01:35.360><c> is</c><00:01:35.520><c> like</c><00:01:35.840><c> no</c>

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
do to us and the short answer is like no
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.830 align:start position:0%
do to us and the short answer is like no
one<00:01:36.320><c> really</c><00:01:36.640><c> knows</c><00:01:37.119><c> but</c><00:01:37.280><c> i</c><00:01:37.439><c> suspect</c><00:01:38.000><c> it</c><00:01:38.560><c> ain't</c>

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
one really knows but i suspect it ain't
 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.990 align:start position:0%

so<00:01:40.240><c> here's</c><00:01:40.560><c> what</c><00:01:40.720><c> we</c><00:01:40.880><c> do</c><00:01:41.119><c> know</c><00:01:42.320><c> if</c><00:01:42.479><c> we</c><00:01:42.720><c> look</c><00:01:42.960><c> at</c>

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
so here's what we do know if we look at
 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.710 align:start position:0%
so here's what we do know if we look at

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
is that like the content that does well
 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.510 align:start position:0%
is that like the content that does well
is<00:01:50.000><c> the</c><00:01:50.240><c> stuff</c><00:01:50.640><c> that</c><00:01:50.960><c> from</c><00:01:51.200><c> an</c>

of like
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.389 align:start position:0%
of like
the<00:01:56.079><c> evolution</c><00:01:56.640><c> of</c><00:01:56.799><c> our</c><00:01:56.960><c> brains</c><00:01:58.000><c> so</c><00:01:58.159><c> our</c>

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 align:start position:0%
the evolution of our brains so our
 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
the evolution of our brains so our
brains<00:01:58.799><c> have</c><00:01:59.040><c> evolved</c><00:01:59.759><c> to</c><00:01:59.920><c> be</c><00:02:00.079><c> attracted</c><00:02:00.640><c> to</c>

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
brains have evolved to be attracted to
 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.469 align:start position:0%
brains have evolved to be attracted to
particular<00:02:01.439><c> things</c>

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
particular things
 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.109 align:start position:0%
particular things
and<00:02:02.719><c> though</c><00:02:03.040><c> that</c><00:02:03.360><c> attraction</c><00:02:04.159><c> in</c><00:02:04.320><c> our</c><00:02:04.479><c> brain</c>

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
and though that attraction in our brain
 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.870 align:start position:0%
and though that attraction in our brain
led<00:02:05.280><c> to</c><00:02:05.520><c> survival</c><00:02:06.000><c> benefits</c>

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
led to survival benefits
 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.070 align:start position:0%
led to survival benefits
so<00:02:07.040><c> a</c><00:02:07.119><c> good</c><00:02:07.360><c> example</c><00:02:07.840><c> of</c><00:02:07.920><c> this</c><00:02:08.239><c> is</c><00:02:08.399><c> like</c><00:02:09.360><c> we're</c>

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
so a good example of this is like we're
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.229 align:start position:0%
so a good example of this is like we're
attracted<00:02:10.800><c> to</c><00:02:11.840><c> high</c><00:02:12.319><c> calorie</c><00:02:12.959><c> density</c><00:02:13.520><c> food</c>

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
attracted to high calorie density food
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.309 align:start position:0%
attracted to high calorie density food
so<00:02:14.400><c> we're</c><00:02:14.640><c> attracted</c><00:02:15.120><c> to</c><00:02:15.280><c> food</c><00:02:15.520><c> that</c><00:02:15.760><c> is</c><00:02:15.920><c> like</c>

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
so we're attracted to food that is like
 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.670 align:start position:0%
so we're attracted to food that is like
you<00:02:16.400><c> know</c><00:02:16.800><c> sugary</c>

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 align:start position:0%

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
like food that is like low calorie is
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
like food that is like low calorie is

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
and so pornography had given this this
 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.589 align:start position:0%

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.830 align:start position:0%
confused about when they have an orgasm
that's<00:07:32.479><c> not</c><00:07:32.639><c> like</c><00:07:32.880><c> you</c><00:07:33.039><c> just</c><00:07:33.199><c> can't</c><00:07:33.440><c> make</c><00:07:33.599><c> that</c>

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's not like you just can't make that
 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.629 align:start position:0%
that's not like you just can't make that
prediction<00:07:34.319><c> but</c><00:07:34.479><c> it's</c><00:07:34.720><c> it's</c><00:07:34.880><c> an</c><00:07:34.960><c> effect</c>

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
prediction but it's it's an effect
 

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
prediction but it's it's an effect
and<00:07:36.800><c> so</c><00:07:37.199><c> you</c><00:07:37.280><c> know</c><00:07:37.440><c> what</c><00:07:37.680><c> effect</c><00:07:38.000><c> is</c><00:07:38.080><c> it</c><00:07:38.160><c> having</c>

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
and so you know what effect is it having
 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.830 align:start position:0%
and so you know what effect is it having
the<00:07:38.560><c> short</c><00:07:38.800><c> answer</c><00:07:39.120><c> is</c><00:07:39.199><c> like</c><00:07:39.360><c> we</c><00:07:39.520><c> sort</c><00:07:39.759><c> of</c>

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
the short answer is like we sort of
 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.710 align:start position:0%
the short answer is like we sort of
don't<00:07:40.080><c> know</c>

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
don't know
 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.309 align:start position:0%
don't know
so<00:07:40.880><c> we're</c><00:07:41.120><c> certainly</c><00:07:41.520><c> seeing</c><00:07:41.840><c> some</c><00:07:42.000><c> of</c><00:07:42.080><c> these</c>

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
so we're certainly seeing some of these
 

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
so we're certainly seeing some of these
things<00:07:42.560><c> like</c><00:07:42.720><c> you</c><00:07:42.800><c> know</c><00:07:42.960><c> death</c><00:07:43.199><c> grip</c><00:07:43.440><c> syndrome</c>

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
things like you know death grip syndrome

and some of these other things where our

and some of these other things where our

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
brain is like wiring to expect a certain
 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:49.270 align:start position:0%
brain is like wiring to expect a certain
kind<00:07:48.080><c> of</c><00:07:48.240><c> stimulus</c>

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.029 align:start position:0%
kind of stimulus
and<00:07:49.360><c> then</c><00:07:49.680><c> it</c><00:07:49.840><c> takes</c><00:07:50.080><c> some</c><00:07:50.319><c> time</c><00:07:50.639><c> for</c><00:07:50.800><c> us</c><00:07:50.960><c> to</c>

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
and then it takes some time for us to
 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.990 align:start position:0%
and then it takes some time for us to
like<00:07:51.280><c> rewire</c><00:07:51.840><c> to</c><00:07:52.000><c> like</c><00:07:52.160><c> regular</c><00:07:52.639><c> stimuli</c>

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
like rewire to like regular stimuli
 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.749 align:start position:0%
like rewire to like regular stimuli
and<00:07:54.240><c> so</c><00:07:54.800><c> you</c><00:07:54.879><c> know</c><00:07:54.960><c> there</c><00:07:55.120><c> are</c><00:07:55.280><c> a</c><00:07:55.360><c> couple</c><00:07:55.680><c> of</c>

and so you know there are a couple of
 

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
and so you know there are a couple of
things<00:07:56.000><c> like</c><00:07:56.160><c> this</c><00:07:56.400><c> but</c><00:07:56.560><c> the</c><00:07:56.720><c> short</c><00:07:56.960><c> answer</c><00:07:57.280><c> is</c>

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
things like this but the short answer is
 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.790 align:start position:0%
things like this but the short answer is
like<00:07:57.520><c> is</c><00:07:57.599><c> it</c><00:07:57.759><c> affecting</c><00:07:58.240><c> us</c>
