what that means I guess you have to sort

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 align:start position:0%
of sort that out for yourself but my
 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.570 align:start position:0%
of sort that out for yourself but my
sense<00:02:06.869><c> is</c><00:02:07.050><c> that</c><00:02:07.110><c> if</c><00:02:07.470><c> you</c><00:02:07.739><c> think</c><00:02:08.039><c> that</c><00:02:08.220><c> the</c>

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
sense is that if you think that the
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.229 align:start position:0%
sense is that if you think that the
