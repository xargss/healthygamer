i think it's a little bit paternalistic
 

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
i think it's a little bit paternalistic
and<00:09:43.680><c> it's</c><00:09:43.839><c> like</c><00:09:44.000><c> oh</c><00:09:44.240><c> we</c><00:09:44.399><c> have</c><00:09:44.480><c> to</c><00:09:44.640><c> teach</c><00:09:44.880><c> you</c>

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.470 align:start position:0%
and it's like oh we have to teach you
how<00:09:45.279><c> it</c><00:09:45.440><c> is</c><00:09:45.600><c> because</c><00:09:45.839><c> you</c><00:09:45.920><c> don't</c><00:09:46.160><c> know</c><00:09:46.320><c> the</c>

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
how it is because you don't know the
 

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.990 align:start position:0%
how it is because you don't know the
right<00:09:46.800><c> the</c><00:09:47.040><c> truth</c>

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
right the truth
 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.790 align:start position:0%
right the truth
but

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
but
 

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
but
so<00:09:48.959><c> i</c><00:09:48.959><c> i</c><00:09:49.200><c> think</c><00:09:49.360><c> that</c><00:09:49.600><c> remember</c><00:09:50.000><c> that</c><00:09:50.160><c> there's</c>

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
