00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
those and that'll become important in a

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%

the next thing that you need to be

the next thing that you need to be

out there
 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.670 align:start position:0%

so<00:04:41.680><c> a</c><00:04:41.759><c> lot</c><00:04:41.919><c> of</c><00:04:42.080><c> times</c><00:04:42.720><c> we</c><00:04:42.880><c> know</c><00:04:43.120><c> what</c><00:04:43.280><c> we</c><00:04:43.440><c> need</c>

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times we know what we need
 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.030 align:start position:0%
so a lot of times we know what we need

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
to do
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
to do
but<00:04:45.280><c> there's</c><00:04:45.520><c> a</c><00:04:45.600><c> reason</c><00:04:46.000><c> that</c><00:04:46.320><c> we</c><00:04:46.560><c> can't</c><00:04:46.800><c> do</c><00:04:46.960><c> it</c>

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
but there's a reason that we can't do it
 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
but there's a reason that we can't do it
right<00:04:47.280><c> so</c><00:04:47.440><c> this</c><00:04:47.680><c> person</c><00:04:48.080><c> says</c>

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
right so this person says
 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
right so this person says
i<00:04:49.199><c> know</c><00:04:49.440><c> that</c><00:04:49.600><c> the</c><00:04:49.759><c> right</c><00:04:50.000><c> answer</c><00:04:50.320><c> here</c><00:04:50.560><c> is</c><00:04:50.720><c> to</c>

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
i know that the right answer here is to
 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.110 align:start position:0%
i know that the right answer here is to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
distance myself but
 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.230 align:start position:0%

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 align:start position:0%

fill up that input over here
 

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.269 align:start position:0%
fill up that input over here
and<00:10:39.680><c> this</c><00:10:39.920><c> is</c><00:10:40.000><c> where</c><00:10:40.480><c> you</c><00:10:40.560><c> know</c><00:10:40.720><c> if</c><00:10:40.800><c> you</c><00:10:40.959><c> really</c>

want like if you really want to fill
 

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.710 align:start position:0%
want like if you really want to fill
this<00:10:43.279><c> thing</c><00:10:43.600><c> up</c><00:10:43.760><c> you</c><00:10:43.920><c> actually</c><00:10:44.240><c> have</c><00:10:44.399><c> to</c><00:10:44.480><c> get</c>

so this is where sometimes you know
 

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.310 align:start position:0%
so this is where sometimes you know

people that i'll work with like they
 

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
people that i'll work with like they
keep<00:10:50.560><c> on</c><00:10:50.800><c> breaking</c><00:10:51.200><c> up</c><00:10:51.279><c> with</c><00:10:51.440><c> each</c><00:10:51.600><c> other</c><00:10:51.839><c> and</c>

keep on breaking up with each other and
 

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.269 align:start position:0%
keep on breaking up with each other and
then<00:10:52.079><c> getting</c><00:10:52.320><c> back</c><00:10:52.560><c> together</c><00:10:53.040><c> and</c><00:10:53.120><c> the</c>

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
then getting back together and the

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because there's not
 

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because there's not

you've been thinking about it for a long

00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
so i think a good example of this is um
 

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:08.950 align:start position:0%
so i think a good example of this is um

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
that but i'd say be careful about it you
 

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.029 align:start position:0%
that but i'd say be careful about it you
know<00:20:43.760><c> and</c><00:20:44.000><c> then</c><00:20:44.159><c> the</c><00:20:44.320><c> other</c><00:20:44.480><c> thing</c><00:20:44.640><c> is</c><00:20:44.799><c> that</c><00:20:44.880><c> if</c>

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
know and then the other thing is that if
 

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.230 align:start position:0%
know and then the other thing is that if
you<00:20:45.120><c> want</c><00:20:45.200><c> to</c><00:20:45.280><c> go</c><00:20:45.440><c> for</c><00:20:45.600><c> love</c><00:20:45.840><c> you</c><00:20:45.919><c> can</c><00:20:46.000><c> always</c>

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
you want to go for love you can always
 

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.430 align:start position:0%
you want to go for love you can always
confess<00:20:46.640><c> your</c><00:20:46.720><c> feelings</c><00:20:47.039><c> and</c><00:20:47.120><c> see</c><00:20:47.280><c> what</c>

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
happens but that's probably not going to
 

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
happens but that's probably not going to
end<00:20:49.120><c> well</c>
