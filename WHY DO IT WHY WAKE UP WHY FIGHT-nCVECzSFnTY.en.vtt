00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.390 align:start position:0%
but they like kind of talk like they
know<00:01:29.119><c> science</c><00:01:29.360><c> so</c><00:01:29.520><c> then</c><00:01:29.680><c> he</c><00:01:29.840><c> was</c><00:01:30.000><c> like</c>

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
know science so then he was like
 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.469 align:start position:0%
know science so then he was like
he<00:01:30.640><c> has</c><00:01:30.720><c> to</c><00:01:30.880><c> be</c><00:01:31.840><c> why</c><00:01:32.079><c> does</c><00:01:33.040><c> where</c><00:01:33.200><c> does</c><00:01:33.439><c> all</c>

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
he has to be why does where does all

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
water end up and where does all fire

not<00:01:45.439><c> really</c><00:01:45.680><c> because</c><00:01:45.920><c> like</c><00:01:46.159><c> you</c><00:01:46.240><c> know</c>

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
not really because like you know
 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.710 align:start position:0%
not really because like you know
the<00:01:47.280><c> like</c><00:01:47.520><c> it</c><00:01:47.680><c> also</c><00:01:47.920><c> ends</c><00:01:48.079><c> up</c><00:01:48.159><c> in</c><00:01:48.320><c> the</c><00:01:48.399><c> clouds</c>

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
the like it also ends up in the clouds

you<00:01:51.200><c> get</c><00:01:51.439><c> evaporation</c><00:01:52.079><c> then</c><00:01:52.240><c> you</c><00:01:52.320><c> get</c><00:01:52.479><c> clouds</c>

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
you get evaporation then you get clouds
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.789 align:start position:0%
you get evaporation then you get clouds

things like that and he was like
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.910 align:start position:0%
things like that and he was like
it<00:02:12.959><c> ends</c><00:02:13.200><c> up</c><00:02:13.360><c> in</c><00:02:13.440><c> the</c><00:02:13.599><c> sun</c><00:02:13.920><c> and</c><00:02:14.000><c> i</c><00:02:14.080><c> was</c><00:02:14.239><c> like</c><00:02:15.680><c> so</c>

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
it ends up in the sun and i was like so
 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.630 align:start position:0%
it ends up in the sun and i was like so
i was<00:02:16.000><c> like</c><00:02:16.239><c> okay</c>

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
i was like okay

i was like okay
whatever<00:02:17.200><c> and</c><00:02:17.280><c> so</c><00:02:17.440><c> then</c><00:02:17.599><c> his</c><00:02:17.840><c> point</c><00:02:18.080><c> was</c><00:02:18.319><c> this</c>

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
whatever and so then his point was this
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.750 align:start position:0%
whatever and so then his point was this
that<00:02:19.360><c> all</c><00:02:19.680><c> fire</c><00:02:20.080><c> points</c><00:02:20.400><c> towards</c><00:02:20.720><c> the</c><00:02:20.879><c> sun</c>

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
that all fire points towards the sun
 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.790 align:start position:0%
that all fire points towards the sun
and<00:02:22.000><c> all</c><00:02:22.480><c> all</c><00:02:22.720><c> water</c><00:02:23.040><c> goes</c><00:02:23.280><c> towards</c><00:02:23.680><c> the</c><00:02:23.840><c> ocean</c>

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.790 align:start position:0%
and all all water goes towards the ocean
i<00:02:25.040><c> was</c><00:02:25.120><c> like</c><00:02:25.440><c> sure</c><00:02:25.760><c> i</c><00:02:25.840><c> mean</c><00:02:26.000><c> i</c><00:02:26.160><c> guess</c><00:02:26.319><c> from</c><00:02:26.640><c> sort</c>

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
i was like sure i mean i guess from sort
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.630 align:start position:0%
i was like sure i mean i guess from sort
of<00:02:26.959><c> like</c><00:02:27.120><c> a</c><00:02:27.360><c> you</c><00:02:27.520><c> know</c><00:02:27.680><c> like</c>

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
of like a you know like
 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.150 align:start position:0%
of like a you know like
i<00:02:28.720><c> mean</c><00:02:28.959><c> i</c><00:02:29.120><c> guess</c><00:02:29.280><c> sort</c><00:02:29.440><c> of</c><00:02:29.599><c> in</c><00:02:29.680><c> a</c><00:02:29.760><c> weird</c><00:02:30.000><c> way</c>

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess sort of in a weird way
 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.830 align:start position:0%
i mean i guess sort of in a weird way
it's<00:02:30.319><c> like</c><00:02:30.480><c> kind</c><00:02:30.720><c> of</c><00:02:30.800><c> true</c><00:02:31.040><c> because</c><00:02:31.280><c> fire</c><00:02:31.599><c> goes</c>

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's like kind of true because fire goes
 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.509 align:start position:0%
it's like kind of true because fire goes
up<00:02:32.000><c> and</c><00:02:32.080><c> the</c><00:02:32.239><c> sun</c><00:02:32.480><c> is</c><00:02:32.640><c> generally</c><00:02:33.120><c> up</c><00:02:33.200><c> there</c><00:02:33.360><c> so</c>

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 align:start position:0%
up and the sun is generally up there so
 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.350 align:start position:0%
up and the sun is generally up there so
i'm<00:02:33.599><c> with</c><00:02:33.840><c> you</c><00:02:34.080><c> kind</c><00:02:34.319><c> of</c>

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
i'm with you kind of
 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.630 align:start position:0%
i'm with you kind of
and<00:02:35.519><c> so</c><00:02:35.680><c> i</c><00:02:35.760><c> mean</c><00:02:36.000><c> i</c><00:02:36.080><c> think</c><00:02:36.239><c> the</c><00:02:36.319><c> dude</c><00:02:36.560><c> was</c>

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
and so i mean i think the dude was
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.990 align:start position:0%
and so i mean i think the dude was
trying<00:02:36.800><c> to</c><00:02:36.879><c> make</c><00:02:37.040><c> a</c><00:02:37.120><c> point</c><00:02:37.360><c> so</c><00:02:37.519><c> i</c><00:02:37.599><c> was</c><00:02:37.680><c> like</c><00:02:37.840><c> let</c>

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make a point so i was like let
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.509 align:start position:0%
trying to make a point so i was like let
that<00:02:38.239><c> slide</c><00:02:38.560><c> okay</c><00:02:38.800><c> so</c><00:02:38.879><c> this</c><00:02:39.040><c> is</c><00:02:39.120><c> the</c><00:02:39.280><c> problem</c>

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
that slide okay so this is the problem
 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.190 align:start position:0%
