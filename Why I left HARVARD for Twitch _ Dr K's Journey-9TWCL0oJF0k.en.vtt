00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
the idea of being a doctor and then i
 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.110 align:start position:0%
the idea of being a doctor and then i
set<00:05:53.360><c> a</c><00:05:53.440><c> target</c><00:05:53.840><c> like</c><00:05:54.240><c> i'm</c><00:05:54.400><c> gonna</c><00:05:54.560><c> be</c><00:05:54.720><c> like</c><00:05:54.880><c> this</c>

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%

how to levitate and do all these cool
 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.510 align:start position:0%
how to levitate and do all these cool
things<00:06:00.639><c> because</c><00:06:00.880><c> i</c><00:06:00.960><c> did</c><00:06:01.120><c> encounter</c>

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
things because i did encounter
 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
things because i did encounter
potentially<00:06:02.160><c> back</c><00:06:02.400><c> then</c>

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
potentially back then
 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
potentially back then
and<00:06:03.840><c> so</c><00:06:04.319><c> you</c><00:06:04.400><c> know</c><00:06:04.639><c> that's</c><00:06:04.880><c> sort</c><00:06:05.120><c> of</c><00:06:05.199><c> what</c><00:06:05.360><c> i</c>

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
and so you know that's sort of what i
 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.270 align:start position:0%
and so you know that's sort of what i
gravitated<00:06:06.160><c> towards</c><00:06:06.479><c> and</c><00:06:06.639><c> i</c><00:06:06.720><c> did</c><00:06:06.960><c> work</c>

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
gravitated towards and i did work
 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.790 align:start position:0%
gravitated towards and i did work

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.790 align:start position:0%

but there's good evidence there's a

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.590 align:start position:0%
really fascinating study that um
essentially<00:29:54.320><c> demonstrated</c><00:29:55.039><c> that</c><00:29:55.279><c> like</c>

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
essentially demonstrated that like
 

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.789 align:start position:0%
essentially demonstrated that like
suffering<00:29:56.240><c> actually</c><00:29:56.720><c> like</c><00:29:57.440><c> you</c><00:29:57.520><c> know</c>

00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
suffering actually like you know
 

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:02.149 align:start position:0%
suffering actually like you know
correlates<00:29:59.520><c> with</c><00:29:59.919><c> like</c><00:30:00.480><c> how</c><00:30:00.640><c> can</c><00:30:00.880><c> i</c><00:30:00.960><c> say</c><00:30:01.120><c> this</c>

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
correlates with like how can i say this
 

00:30:02.159 --> 00:30:04.389 align:start position:0%
correlates with like how can i say this
that<00:30:02.399><c> going</c><00:30:02.720><c> through</c><00:30:03.039><c> something</c><00:30:03.600><c> bad</c><00:30:04.080><c> makes</c>

00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
that going through something bad makes
 

00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
that going through something bad makes
things<00:30:04.720><c> more</c><00:30:04.960><c> pleasant</c>

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
things more pleasant
 

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.350 align:start position:0%
things more pleasant
so<00:30:06.159><c> this</c><00:30:06.320><c> is</c><00:30:06.480><c> a</c><00:30:06.559><c> really</c><00:30:06.799><c> interesting</c><00:30:07.200><c> it's</c>

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
so this is a really interesting it's
 

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.549 align:start position:0%
so this is a really interesting it's
it's<00:30:07.520><c> somewhat</c><00:30:07.840><c> of</c><00:30:07.919><c> a</c><00:30:08.000><c> stretch</c><00:30:08.320><c> of</c><00:30:08.399><c> an</c>

it's somewhat of a stretch of an

it's somewhat of a stretch of an

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
