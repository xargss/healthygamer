00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 align:start position:0%
in our brain and then our brain learns
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.740 align:start position:0%
in our brain and then our brain learns
from<00:00:28.980><c> them</c><00:00:29.189><c> and</c><00:00:29.400><c> changes</c><00:00:30.239><c> the</c><00:00:30.390><c> way</c><00:00:30.509><c> that</c><00:00:30.689><c> we</c>

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 align:start position:0%

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
things that it's really important for
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
things that it's really important for
gamers<00:00:35.399><c> to</c><00:00:35.700><c> understand</c><00:00:36.210><c> is</c><00:00:36.390><c> how</c><00:00:36.899><c> does</c><00:00:37.170><c> playing</c>

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 align:start position:0%
gamers to understand is how does playing
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.660 align:start position:0%
gamers to understand is how does playing
games<00:00:38.000><c> shape</c><00:00:39.000><c> the</c><00:00:39.300><c> person</c><00:00:39.750><c> that</c><00:00:39.930><c> you</c><00:00:40.140><c> are</c><00:00:40.670><c> what</c>

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 align:start position:0%
games shape the person that you are what
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.970 align:start position:0%
games shape the person that you are what
is<00:00:41.820><c> playing</c><00:00:42.059><c> games</c><00:00:42.360><c> teach</c><00:00:42.930><c> your</c><00:00:43.350><c> brain</c><00:00:43.620><c> and</c>

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
is playing games teach your brain and
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190 align:start position:0%
is playing games teach your brain and
then<00:00:44.489><c> how</c><00:00:44.789><c> does</c><00:00:44.850><c> your</c><00:00:45.270><c> brain</c><00:00:45.450><c> use</c><00:00:45.899><c> that</c>

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
then how does your brain use that
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.899 align:start position:0%
then how does your brain use that
information<00:00:46.950><c> or</c><00:00:47.100><c> that</c><00:00:47.250><c> knowledge</c><00:00:47.730><c> from</c>

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 align:start position:0%
information or that knowledge from
 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.419 align:start position:0%
information or that knowledge from
playing<00:00:48.179><c> games</c><00:00:48.449><c> and</c><00:00:48.859><c> approach</c><00:00:49.859><c> the</c><00:00:50.219><c> real</c>

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 align:start position:0%
playing games and approach the real
 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.209 align:start position:0%
playing games and approach the real
world<00:00:51.260><c> so</c><00:00:52.260><c> one</c><00:00:52.409><c> of</c><00:00:52.440><c> the</c><00:00:52.620><c> things</c><00:00:52.859><c> that</c><00:00:53.070><c> I</c><00:00:53.100><c> think</c>

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
world so one of the things that I think
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
world so one of the things that I think
it's<00:00:53.489><c> really</c><00:00:53.670><c> important</c><00:00:54.210><c> for</c><00:00:54.329><c> gamers</c><00:00:54.510><c> to</c>

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 align:start position:0%
it's really important for gamers to
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.189 align:start position:0%
it's really important for gamers to
understand<00:00:55.260><c> is</c><00:00:55.499><c> that</c><00:00:55.980><c> they're</c><00:00:56.309><c> very</c><00:00:56.609><c> good</c>

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 align:start position:0%

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 align:start position:0%
closed-ended problem solvers and I think
 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.590 align:start position:0%
closed-ended problem solvers and I think
this<00:01:00.569><c> is</c><00:01:00.780><c> a</c><00:01:00.809><c> big</c><00:01:02.089><c> problem</c><00:01:03.089><c> for</c><00:01:03.120><c> a</c><00:01:03.359><c> lot</c><00:01:03.420><c> of</c>

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is a big problem for a lot of
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
this is a big problem for a lot of

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 align:start position:0%
kind of problem solving which I call
 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
kind of problem solving which I call

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
open-ended problem solving so I guess
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.690 align:start position:0%
open-ended problem solving so I guess
the<00:01:22.200><c> first</c><00:01:22.380><c> question</c><00:01:22.560><c> is</c><00:01:22.980><c> what</c><00:01:23.250><c> do</c><00:01:23.340><c> I</c><00:01:23.400><c> mean</c><00:01:23.640><c> by</c>

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
the first question is what do I mean by
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
the first question is what do I mean by

operation of moving from point A to Z so
for<00:08:39.210><c> example</c><00:08:39.570><c> if</c><00:08:39.690><c> we</c><00:08:39.810><c> wanted</c><00:08:40.110><c> to</c>

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:40.460 align:start position:0%
for example if we wanted to

for example if we wanted to

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
operationalize like let's say financial
 

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.900 align:start position:0%
operationalize like let's say financial
independence<00:08:45.900><c> we</c><00:08:46.800><c> start</c><00:08:47.130><c> to</c><00:08:47.280><c> break</c><00:08:47.550><c> that</c>

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:47.910 align:start position:0%
independence we start to break that
 

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.790 align:start position:0%
independence we start to break that
process<00:08:48.510><c> down</c><00:08:48.720><c> so</c><00:08:48.930><c> financial</c><00:08:49.560><c> independence</c>

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
process down so financial independence
 

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.190 align:start position:0%
process down so financial independence
involves<00:08:50.610><c> having</c><00:08:51.330><c> a</c><00:08:51.450><c> bank</c><00:08:51.630><c> account</c><00:08:51.750><c> where</c><00:08:52.170><c> you</c>

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
involves having a bank account where you
 

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.860 align:start position:0%
involves having a bank account where you
can<00:08:52.320><c> pay</c><00:08:52.590><c> rent</c><00:08:52.830><c> and</c><00:08:53.130><c> having</c><00:08:53.820><c> a</c><00:08:54.060><c> place</c><00:08:54.480><c> to</c><00:08:54.720><c> live</c>

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:54.870 align:start position:0%
can pay rent and having a place to live
 

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.930 align:start position:0%
can pay rent and having a place to live
and<00:08:55.170><c> so</c><00:08:55.710><c> what</c><00:08:55.860><c> we</c><00:08:55.950><c> can</c><00:08:56.070><c> do</c><00:08:56.190><c> is</c><00:08:56.310><c> break</c><00:08:56.550><c> that</c><00:08:56.580><c> down</c>

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
and so what we can do is break that down
 

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.690 align:start position:0%
and so what we can do is break that down
into<00:08:57.270><c> two</c><00:08:57.450><c> pieces</c><00:08:57.900><c> and</c><00:08:58.140><c> then</c><00:08:58.650><c> those</c><00:08:59.130><c> two</c><00:08:59.460><c> can</c>

00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
into two pieces and then those two can
 

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.700 align:start position:0%
into two pieces and then those two can
be<00:08:59.820><c> further</c><00:09:00.060><c> operationalized</c><00:09:00.960><c> so</c><00:09:01.140><c> finding</c><00:09:01.650><c> a</c>
