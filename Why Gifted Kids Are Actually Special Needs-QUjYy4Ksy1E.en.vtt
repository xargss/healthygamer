and so when that kind of falls short
they<00:06:38.639><c> like</c><00:06:39.120><c> they</c><00:06:39.360><c> really</c><00:06:39.600><c> kind</c><00:06:39.759><c> of</c><00:06:40.000><c> really</c><00:06:40.240><c> hit</c>

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
they like they really kind of really hit
 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
they like they really kind of really hit

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
a wall it's a very very hard cliff to to

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
overcome
 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.629 align:start position:0%
overcome
and<00:06:45.280><c> so</c><00:06:45.440><c> this</c><00:06:45.680><c> is</c><00:06:45.759><c> kind</c><00:06:45.919><c> of</c><00:06:46.000><c> the</c><00:06:46.160><c> first</c><00:06:46.400><c> thing</c>

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
and so this is kind of the first thing
 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.390 align:start position:0%
and so this is kind of the first thing
that<00:06:46.880><c> that</c><00:06:47.039><c> sort</c><00:06:47.199><c> of</c><00:06:47.360><c> shoots</c><00:06:47.600><c> gifted</c><00:06:48.080><c> kids</c><00:06:48.319><c> in</c>

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
that that sort of shoots gifted kids in
 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.469 align:start position:0%

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
the foot and this also leads to kind of
 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.230 align:start position:0%
the foot and this also leads to kind of
this<00:06:50.639><c> idea</c><00:06:50.960><c> of</c><00:06:51.039><c> perfectionism</c><00:06:51.759><c> and</c><00:06:51.840><c> burnout</c>

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
this idea of perfectionism and burnout
 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.589 align:start position:0%

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
sense it's like completely artificial
 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
sense it's like completely artificial
so<00:07:26.800><c> that's</c><00:07:27.039><c> the</c><00:07:27.120><c> first</c><00:07:27.280><c> thing</c><00:07:27.440><c> that</c><00:07:27.599><c> happens</c>

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing that happens
 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.629 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing that happens
is<00:07:28.720><c> that</c><00:07:28.960><c> they</c><00:07:29.120><c> kind</c><00:07:29.280><c> of</c><00:07:29.360><c> hit</c><00:07:29.520><c> this</c><00:07:29.759><c> wall</c><00:07:30.080><c> of</c><00:07:30.400><c> of</c>

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
is that they kind of hit this wall of of

is that they kind of hit this wall of of

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
the second thing to consider is the
 

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
the second thing to consider is the

00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
the more it's filled with shame
 

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.629 align:start position:0%
the more it's filled with shame

00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
struggle and so then the question
 

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
struggle and so then the question
becomes<00:14:59.440><c> okay</c><00:14:59.680><c> like</c><00:14:59.760><c> what</c><00:14:59.920><c> do</c><00:15:00.000><c> we</c><00:15:00.079><c> do</c><00:15:00.240><c> about</c><00:15:00.480><c> it</c>

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
self-esteem and shame and that once
 

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.110 align:start position:0%
self-esteem and shame and that once
again<00:20:37.679><c> is</c><00:20:37.760><c> because</c><00:20:38.000><c> their</c><00:20:38.159><c> expectations</c><00:20:38.960><c> are</c>

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
again is because their expectations are
 

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
again is because their expectations are

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.710 align:start position:0%
up here and their performance is down
here<00:20:41.600><c> right</c>

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
here right
 

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.190 align:start position:0%
here right
and<00:20:42.880><c> so</c><00:20:43.200><c> in</c><00:20:43.440><c> that</c><00:20:43.760><c> gap</c><00:20:44.240><c> is</c><00:20:44.400><c> where</c><00:20:44.640><c> your</c><00:20:44.880><c> shame</c>

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%

let<00:26:21.200><c> me</c><00:26:21.279><c> just</c><00:26:21.440><c> think</c><00:26:21.600><c> about</c><00:26:21.760><c> this</c><00:26:21.919><c> for</c><00:26:22.000><c> a</c>

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
let me just think about this for a
 

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:29.750 align:start position:0%
let me just think about this for a

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.669 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:26:30.000><c> here's</c><00:26:30.240><c> a</c><00:26:30.320><c> good</c><00:26:30.480><c> example</c><00:26:30.880><c> of</c><00:26:30.960><c> a</c><00:26:31.039><c> nyani</c><00:26:31.360><c> yoga</c>

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
is a good example
 

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.830 align:start position:0%
is a good example
this<00:26:34.400><c> is</c><00:26:34.559><c> one</c><00:26:34.640><c> of</c><00:26:34.720><c> the</c><00:26:34.880><c> ones</c><00:26:35.039><c> that</c><00:26:35.200><c> i</c><00:26:35.279><c> feel</c><00:26:35.600><c> less</c>

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is one of the ones that i feel less
