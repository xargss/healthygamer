---------00:00----------
so one of the really confusing things


---------00:02----------
about depression


---------00:03----------
is trying to figure out where exactly it


---------00:05----------
comes from every human being that has


---------00:07----------
ever existed experiences negative


---------00:09----------
emotions


---------00:11----------
we have to understand how we kind of


---------00:13----------
carry them forward


---------00:14----------
in our subconscious mind we have to


---------00:17----------
start by differentiating what's actually


---------00:19----------
a clinical


---------00:20----------
illness from a mindset or an outlook on


---------00:22----------
life


---------00:23----------
because each one has a drastically


---------00:25----------
different solution


---------00:29----------
this module is designed to mirror how i


---------00:31----------
actually work with people


---------00:33----------
who are suffering from depression by


---------00:36----------
looking at the neuroscience


---------00:37----------
the gut biology the sort of spirituality


---------00:40----------
of depression


---------00:41----------
we can give you a road map that you can


---------00:44----------
use to tackle your


---------00:46----------
individual depression one branch of the


---------00:48----------
module


---------00:49----------
explains the basics of clinical


---------00:51----------
depression


---------00:53----------
humans have the special capacity where i


---------00:55----------
can stand over here


---------00:56----------
and look at my thinking what happens in


---------00:59----------
depression


---------01:00----------
is that people are stuck thinking about


---------01:02----------
themselves and thinking


---------01:04----------
negative things about themselves down


---------01:06----------
the non-clinical


---------01:07----------
track we'll explore existential or what


---------01:09----------
i call congruent depression


---------01:12----------
the depressed mind dwells in the past


---------01:15----------
and is sort of


---------01:16----------
filled with regret where does your


---------01:18----------
dissatisfaction come from


---------01:20----------
why do you stay stuck every day every


---------01:22----------
night when you go to bed you promise


---------01:24----------
yourself


---------01:25----------
that tomorrow will be different and


---------01:26----------
every morning when you wake up


---------01:28----------
it's the same damn thing over and over


---------01:30----------
and over again


---------01:31----------
so how do you fix that we'll cover


---------01:34----------
common psychiatric treatments and


---------01:35----------
scientifically validated treatments


---------01:37----------
as well as holistic approaches to


---------01:39----------
depression how depression can affect the


---------01:41----------
body the mind and even the spirit


---------01:44----------
and how we can intervene on each of


---------01:46----------
those layers to give us a comprehensive


---------01:48----------
approach to depression


---------02:02----------
you
