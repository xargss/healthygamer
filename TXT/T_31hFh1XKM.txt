---------00:00----------
yeah so thank you so much for for


---------00:02----------
joining us today dr mike


---------00:04----------
yeah of course thank you so much for


---------00:06----------
having me i'm really excited to have


---------00:07----------
this conversation


---------00:08----------
um oh really what what is this con are


---------00:11----------
we


---------00:11----------
what are we talking about well i think


---------00:14----------
we're talking about how


---------00:15----------
the mind and the body are actually


---------00:17----------
mind-body not two separate words so


---------00:19----------
um i'm hopeful that you know i can


---------00:23----------
sort of bring up the subject of how


---------00:25----------
interconnected these two subjects


---------00:27----------
are and then get your take on your


---------00:29----------
experiences maybe personally maybe


---------00:31----------
professionally


---------00:32----------
if you agree or disagree with some of


---------00:34----------
the statements that i make i always like


---------00:35----------
for these to be as


---------00:37----------
personal and conversational as possible


---------00:39----------
but if you have a different


---------00:40----------
way of doing it in mind i'm all yours


---------00:43----------
yeah so sometimes when people come on or


---------00:45----------
actually usually when people come on


---------00:46----------
we'll have like something more of a


---------00:48----------
personal conversation where you know i


---------00:50----------
think a lot of people


---------00:51----------
are interested to hear actually like


---------00:53----------
your story


---------00:54----------
and and kind of um sometimes people will


---------00:57----------
come on and we'll have


---------00:58----------
uh you know particular questions that um


---------01:02----------
or sometimes they're facing challenges


---------01:04----------
and


---------01:05----------
and potentially want to work through


---------01:06----------
some of those but i i recognize that you


---------01:09----------
know as


---------01:09----------
both being like medical professionals


---------01:11----------
like we could have a conversation about


---------01:13----------
something instead of doing


---------01:14----------
a more traditional like personal


---------01:16----------
interview kind of thing


---------01:17----------
so i'm really game for both um it really


---------01:20----------
depends on


---------01:21----------
you know what yeah i'd love to have a


---------01:24----------
conversation about the subject


---------01:26----------
of the the mind body connection and from


---------01:28----------
there if we have personal anecdotes to


---------01:30----------
work those in


---------01:31----------
uh i i'm open to sharing some stuff so


---------01:33----------
that's cool


---------01:34----------
so let's get started so tell me about


---------01:36----------
the mind body


---------01:37----------
connection yeah so for me um


---------01:40----------
just to give a little background i'm a


---------01:42----------
board-certified family medicine doctor


---------01:44----------
uh but i happen to be a d.o not an md


---------01:47----------
which is an equally licensed medical


---------01:49----------
licensed degree


---------01:51----------
in the united states and basically the


---------01:54----------
premise of our education in comparison


---------01:56----------
to that of


---------01:57----------
md education is we really try and put


---------02:00----------
forth a holistic


---------02:01----------
patient forward approach to everything


---------02:04----------
and anything that we do in the field of


---------02:06----------
health care


---------02:07----------
this could mean something as simple as a


---------02:09----------
patient coming in with acid reflux


---------02:11----------
symptoms


---------02:12----------
and instead of simply fixing the acid


---------02:14----------
reflux to a medication


---------02:15----------
we would do that but in addition to look


---------02:18----------
at some of the risk factors that that


---------02:19----------
patient might have in their everyday


---------02:21----------
lives that are predisposing them to


---------02:23----------
continually having


---------02:25----------
this acid reflux condition and as a


---------02:27----------
result we kind of take a bigger picture


---------02:29----------
approach


---------02:30----------
when it comes to treating patients


---------02:33----------
using that background i've started


---------02:36----------
treating


---------02:36----------
a lot of patients for pain


---------02:39----------
because what would happen is any time a


---------02:42----------
colleague in my hospital


---------02:43----------
in a nearby hospital in urgent care


---------02:46----------
would run into a patient who's having


---------02:47----------
chronic pain issues


---------02:49----------
or perhaps an acute pain condition they


---------02:52----------
would


---------02:53----------
end up sending them to me as a referral


---------02:55----------
for osteopathic treatment


---------02:57----------
because in addition to this patient


---------02:58----------
first philosophy that we have in do


---------03:00----------
schools we also learn an


---------03:01----------
extra hands-on technique called omt


---------03:05----------
and it's not really one technique it's


---------03:06----------
more of a therapy it's more of a way of


---------03:08----------
thinking


---------03:09----------
it's not magical it may look somewhat


---------03:12----------
like


---------03:12----------
physical therapy like chiropractic


---------03:14----------
medicine but in theory it's more


---------03:16----------
medical in nature in that we use the


---------03:19----------
body's own mechanisms that


---------03:21----------
no one disagrees with in the medical


---------03:23----------
community to try and help patients out


---------03:25----------
with their pain


---------03:26----------
or perhaps with the dysfunction that's


---------03:28----------
causing them a


---------03:29----------
concern so an example this could be


---------03:33----------
a patient having recurrent tension


---------03:34----------
headaches as a result of spasms in their


---------03:37----------
neck


---------03:37----------
uh a proper and osteopathic exam could


---------03:39----------
go into


---------03:40----------
what their work ergonomic situation is


---------03:43----------
like are they sitting in the right chair


---------03:44----------
where where's their monitor


---------03:46----------
in relationship to their eye level then


---------03:48----------
putting our hands on the neck feeling


---------03:50----------
where the dysfunction comes from


---------03:52----------
checking the joints above and below


---------03:54----------
meaning that if it's the neck


---------03:56----------
uh we're checking the thoracic region as


---------03:58----------
well and not just forgetting that the


---------03:59----------
cervical spine is connected to the


---------04:01----------
thoracic spine and there's impacts of


---------04:03----------
that


---------04:03----------
checking for shoulder dysfunctions


---------04:05----------
seeing if a patient is using one


---------04:07----------
shoulder over another because of


---------04:09----------
another injury that exists and then


---------04:11----------
figuring out a way to


---------04:13----------
treat that condition whether it's


---------04:15----------
through using the body's own reflexes to


---------04:17----------
relax


---------04:18----------
this spasm because the body has a lot of


---------04:20----------
these innate reflexes in it where it


---------04:22----------
uh essentially turns on some muscles and


---------04:25----------
turns on other muscles


---------04:26----------
i'll give you an example if you ever try


---------04:28----------
pushing against a stationary object like


---------04:30----------
a wall


---------04:31----------
or a pole and you know that object's not


---------04:33----------
moving


---------04:34----------
what your mind tends to do is actually


---------04:36----------
send signals to those muscles that are


---------04:38----------
being activated during this isometric


---------04:40----------
contraction where the muscle is not


---------04:41----------
lengthening not shortening


---------04:42----------
is to relax because it doesn't like to


---------04:45----------
waste energy on something where there is


---------04:47----------
no eccentric or concentric motion


---------04:49----------
happening


---------04:50----------
so we use that body's response to an


---------04:52----------
isometric contraction in order to induce


---------04:55----------
relaxation


---------04:56----------
and increase range of motion in spasm


---------04:58----------
areas that's fascinating i wonder if


---------05:00----------
actually that i i never connected


---------05:02----------
the isometric contraction i wonder if


---------05:04----------
actually that is partially responsible


---------05:07----------
for the clinical superiority of


---------05:09----------
exercises like especially yoga which are


---------05:11----------
essentially isometric contractions right


---------05:14----------
because you take a position and you hold


---------05:15----------
it


---------05:16----------
and whether that because i know that


---------05:18----------
yoga is sort of superior to physical


---------05:19----------
exercise in terms of


---------05:21----------
recruiting like or shutting down the hpa


---------05:24----------
axis


---------05:25----------
and i never thought i never realized


---------05:27----------
that there was actually a mechanism that


---------05:28----------
involves isometric contraction that


---------05:31----------
induces relaxation but that sort of


---------05:33----------
because i've been always curious why


---------05:34----------
yoga


---------05:35----------
sometimes outperforms exercise in


---------05:37----------
clinical trials and this is the first


---------05:39----------
time that i've ever heard of a


---------05:41----------
potential physiologic mechanism through


---------05:43----------
which it acts


---------05:44----------
fast yeah and there's another level why


---------05:47----------
yoga is


---------05:48----------
probably superior in a lot of instances


---------05:51----------
because of breathing the hpa axis


---------05:54----------
is directly affected upon our


---------05:56----------
sympathetic or parasympathetic state


---------05:59----------
and we can control that state based on


---------06:01----------
how we control our breathing


---------06:02----------
and this is where i can throw in a


---------06:03----------
personal anecdote i'm horrible at


---------06:05----------
controlling my breathing


---------06:06----------
i tend to hold my breath a lot maybe not


---------06:08----------
when i'm doing weight lifting but


---------06:10----------
if i'm bending over to tie my shoe i


---------06:12----------
catch myself holding my breath to focus


---------06:14----------
on tying the shoe even though it's such


---------06:15----------
a simple task


---------06:16----------
but when we do that we actually start


---------06:19----------
decreasing our ability to heal our


---------06:20----------
ability to breathe properly


---------06:22----------
and yoga really institutes proper


---------06:24----------
breathing mechanics where it's


---------06:26----------
diaphragmatic breathing


---------06:27----------
belly coming out lower ribcage spreading


---------06:30----------
out to the sides


---------06:31----------
and you can practice this not even just


---------06:32----------
doing yoga through a mindfulness session


---------06:34----------
and that's where i think a lot of the


---------06:36----------
benefits of yoga comes from probably


---------06:39----------
those two


---------06:39----------
instances and while isometric


---------06:41----------
contraction is really crucial in yoga


---------06:43----------
eccentric contraction which a lot of


---------06:46----------
times is missed out on when you're doing


---------06:48----------
weight training i'll give an example so


---------06:50----------
if you're pushing a weight like you're


---------06:51----------
doing a bench press


---------06:52----------
uh the eccentric contraction is when


---------06:54----------
you're bringing the weight down


---------06:56----------
where the muscle essentially slowly


---------06:58----------
lengthening but still contracting


---------07:00----------
to control the the lengthening process


---------07:03----------
yeah that is a very good way


---------07:06----------
to rehabilitate your muscles injured


---------07:08----------
muscles it's actually


---------07:09----------
the best form of rehabilitation so if


---------07:12----------
you have like


---------07:12----------
a achilles injury a calf injury


---------07:16----------
these types of eccentric contractions is


---------07:18----------
what your physical therapist is likely


---------07:19----------
to focus on first


---------07:21----------
so yoga in in contradiction to like when


---------07:25----------
we push our weights down and then drop


---------07:26----------
them real quickly and then push them


---------07:27----------
back


---------07:28----------
up really focuses on that eccentric


---------07:30----------
isometric phase the breathing phase


---------07:32----------
and that's where you get so much of the


---------07:34----------
benefit obviously in addition to the


---------07:36----------
mindfulness component of it so i'm glad


---------07:38----------
you brought up yoga i don't know if


---------07:40----------
eccentric contractions is also something


---------07:41----------
in the back of your mind or something


---------07:42----------
you've heard before what are your


---------07:44----------
thoughts on that


---------07:44----------
no so i'm i'm not so i'm not familiar


---------07:47----------
with this degree of


---------07:48----------
um you know physiology around muscle


---------07:52----------
contraction like it's certainly not


---------07:54----------
it's not something that i've like


---------07:55----------
studied extensively so it's fascinating


---------07:57----------
to hear i mean i if you asked me what an


---------07:59----------
eccentric contraction was i wouldn't


---------08:00----------
even i wouldn't even know


---------08:02----------
it's interesting because when i think


---------08:04----------
about yoga though i think you know most


---------08:06----------
of yoga is not actually about movement


---------08:08----------
it's about stillness


---------08:09----------
so if i had to put my money somewhere


---------08:11----------
i'd say that you know the isometric


---------08:12----------
component of yoga


---------08:14----------
generally speaking outweighs the


---------08:16----------
eccentric component


---------08:17----------
but at the same time you certainly have


---------08:21----------
compared to regular exercise a very


---------08:24----------
significant amount of eccentric


---------08:26----------
muscular movement right because it's


---------08:27----------
about slow movements that involve like


---------08:30----------
gradually moving from one place to the


---------08:32----------
other


---------08:32----------
um you know so you definitely have that


---------08:35----------
it's interesting i


---------08:36----------
i wasn't i never connected those dots


---------08:38----------
like i didn't realize


---------08:40----------
um you know i have some theories about


---------08:41----------
how yoga works and stuff like that but i


---------08:43----------
just didn't have the resolution of


---------08:45----------
understanding of


---------08:46----------
muscular physiology to really connect


---------08:48----------
those dots that was fascinating


---------08:50----------
yeah i think that highlights why


---------08:51----------
osteopathic medicine is so cool because


---------08:53----------
we


---------08:54----------
think so holistically in our approach


---------08:56----------
that when a patient comes in


---------08:58----------
with musculoskeletal pain of the neck


---------09:00----------
while we are thinking about this


---------09:02----------
approach


---------09:02----------
we're simultaneously thinking about the


---------09:04----------
anatomy of the region for


---------09:06----------
you know real like medical interventions


---------09:08----------
whether it's medicinal


---------09:10----------
uh injection based surgical approaches


---------09:13----------
and it's not that i do all of these


---------09:14----------
approaches


---------09:15----------
but i keep them in the back of my mind


---------09:17----------
when i'm trying to figure out which


---------09:18----------
patient


---------09:19----------
is best suitable for these options and


---------09:23----------
in thinking this way and seeing so many


---------09:25----------
patients who were in pain


---------09:26----------
over and over and over again i began to


---------09:29----------
see a relationship between


---------09:31----------
the mental health state of my patients


---------09:34----------
in addition to


---------09:35----------
their um pain that they were


---------09:37----------
experiencing or physical symptoms that


---------09:39----------
they were experiencing


---------09:40----------
and while it's very easy to conflate


---------09:42----------
this correlation and say oh well of


---------09:44----------
course someone that's in pain is going


---------09:46----------
to be in an unhappier mental state who's


---------09:48----------
going to be happy when they're in pain


---------09:50----------
that is in fact true but what i started


---------09:52----------
seeing in doing thorough histories of my


---------09:53----------
patients is that


---------09:55----------
the mental health state preceded


---------09:58----------
the physical pain and once the mental


---------10:01----------
health state


---------10:02----------
was treated because it was largely


---------10:04----------
overlooked in their past


---------10:06----------
treatments that's when the physical pain


---------10:08----------
went away


---------10:09----------
because i would have patients come in


---------10:11----------
and they would start saying you know


---------10:12----------
their elbow pain was bothering them for


---------10:15----------
six months


---------10:15----------
they've had mris cat scans x-rays you


---------10:18----------
know doctors would do special tests and


---------10:20----------
there was nothing to be found


---------10:21----------
anatomically


---------10:22----------
but this is not to say that this patient


---------10:24----------
is making this up


---------10:26----------
what the reality is they were still


---------10:28----------
subjectively feeling this pain


---------10:30----------
it was debilitating to them because it


---------10:32----------
prevented them from doing their work or


---------10:33----------
enjoying their life


---------10:35----------
so it was real it just the source wasn't


---------10:38----------
anatomical


---------10:39----------
and a lot of times our healthcare system


---------10:41----------
falters here because


---------10:42----------
if they can't point to something on an


---------10:44----------
imaging scan


---------10:45----------
we right away start writing this patient


---------10:47----------
off or we stop being able to help them


---------10:49----------
because it's not reimbursable well by


---------10:51----------
insurance companies because we can't say


---------10:52----------
look this is what they have this is why


---------10:54----------
we're doing x for z


---------10:56----------
and i did a lot of research into this


---------10:58----------
field and i came across


---------11:00----------
a great book called the divided mind by


---------11:02----------
dr john sarno


---------11:04----------
the late dr john sarno actually and


---------11:07----------
his field of research is he's by


---------11:09----------
training or he was by training a


---------11:12----------
physical medicine and rehabilitation


---------11:13----------
specialist the pm in our physician


---------11:16----------
so he wasn't the mental health


---------11:17----------
specialist by any means


---------11:19----------
and he actually worked and taught at nyu


---------11:21----------
medical school


---------11:22----------
um at nyu medical center just by me


---------11:25----------
and through his research he actually


---------11:29----------
found


---------11:30----------
that helping patients deal with some of


---------11:32----------
their most


---------11:33----------
repressed childhood potentially


---------11:36----------
current negative life situations


---------11:39----------
mental health situations treating those


---------11:43----------
actually yielded better results for his


---------11:46----------
pain patients his chronic pain patients


---------11:48----------
his acute injury patients and he started


---------11:51----------
doing research on this


---------11:53----------
where it wasn't just okay let's see this


---------11:55----------
patient let's see if they improved he


---------11:57----------
actually started doing mri studies can i


---------11:59----------
jump in for a second by the way should i


---------12:00----------
call this mike or dr michael


---------12:01----------
mike is fine mike is fine um so let me


---------12:05----------
ask you what do you think is the


---------12:06----------
mechanism of that how does that work


---------12:09----------
um i don't know i don't have a good


---------12:11----------
answer for it yet


---------12:12----------
there are definitely proposed mechanisms


---------12:14----------
his research focused on


---------12:17----------
for example if you had a true injury


---------12:20----------
let's say in your low back


---------12:21----------
and you had a pulled muscle in the past


---------12:24----------
what he saw


---------12:25----------
in mri studies at mri research that


---------12:28----------
individuals when they were in a


---------12:29----------
stressful state


---------12:30----------
the body actually limited the amount of


---------12:32----------
blood flow to those areas


---------12:35----------
in order to decrease their stress


---------12:38----------
and this was a high level of stress of


---------12:40----------
thinking about those


---------12:42----------
repressed thoughts those acute stress


---------12:44----------
thoughts and instead focused


---------12:46----------
on a physical problem that low back pain


---------12:49----------
and it functioned as a distraction to


---------12:52----------
not


---------12:53----------
overwhelm the body the mind


---------12:56----------
and this was a theory and this is a very


---------12:58----------
out there theory and some


---------13:00----------
physicians disagree with this theory it


---------13:01----------
was the route he chose to explore


---------13:04----------
it's actually not that out there in fact


---------13:06----------
there's good evidence to support that


---------13:08----------
because


---------13:08----------
if you look at self-injurious behavior


---------13:11----------
so self-injurious behavior that's not


---------13:13----------
suicidal like cutting and


---------13:15----------
burning and things like that these are


---------13:16----------
actually not injuries that


---------13:19----------
if you really look at self-injurious


---------13:21----------
behavior it's fascinating because from


---------13:22----------
an evolutionary standpoint


---------13:24----------
what people do is the thing that causes


---------13:26----------
the least damage to their body


---------13:28----------
and also hurts the most


---------13:32----------
so if you look at cutting it's very


---------13:33----------
superficial cuts


---------13:35----------
and so if you think about what's that


---------13:37----------
person actually doing and if you talk to


---------13:38----------
people who engage in self-injurious


---------13:40----------
behavior what you actually find


---------13:42----------
is that they their goal in the


---------13:46----------
self-injurious behavior is almost


---------13:47----------
meditative in nature


---------13:49----------
that that eliciting a cut slowly like


---------13:51----------
time and time and time again actually


---------13:53----------
distracts them from


---------13:54----------
emotional feelings and the intensity of


---------13:57----------
the pain is so


---------13:58----------
great that they literally cannot think


---------14:00----------
about anything else


---------14:02----------
so what we tend to find is that you know


---------14:05----------
when i work with people who have


---------14:06----------
self-injurious behavior


---------14:07----------
and an addiction that if you control the


---------14:10----------
addiction like let's say they're in a


---------14:11----------
rehab


---------14:12----------
the self-injurious behavior will get


---------14:14----------
worse because they need a coping


---------14:16----------
mechanism


---------14:17----------
because they can't use like alcohol or


---------14:18----------
marijuana or like other things to cope


---------14:20----------
so it's really fascinating because i've


---------14:21----------
never you know i i'm not familiar with


---------14:23----------
with


---------14:24----------
dr sarno's work but like there's


---------14:26----------
actually a decent


---------14:28----------
understanding that people will actually


---------14:31----------
induce that principle of utilizing pain


---------14:35----------
as a distraction from the mind um


---------14:38----------
absolutely


---------14:39----------
it doesn't actually sound that out there


---------14:41----------
to me it's like that's actually well


---------14:44----------
i probably misspoke when i'm saying that


---------14:46----------
it's somewhat out there in that


---------14:48----------
we definitely know that that sort of


---------14:50----------
distraction method exists as you said


---------14:52----------
the mechanism with the mind altering


---------14:55----------
blood flow


---------14:56----------
is the mechanism that is somewhat


---------14:58----------
questionable interesting so that it's


---------14:59----------
it's


---------15:00----------
less of the patient doing it and more


---------15:02----------
like it's like an automatic


---------15:03----------
physiological you know


---------15:05----------
neurophysiological like


---------15:07----------
we're not going to fix this injury to


---------15:08----------
protect our mind


---------15:10----------
yeah that that certainly does seem uh


---------15:12----------
you know less understood


---------15:14----------
that's that's cool so but that's one of


---------15:17----------
the mechanisms i mean for me the way


---------15:18----------
that i think about it as an osteopathic


---------15:20----------
physician


---------15:21----------
is that not only do we have electro


---------15:24----------
co connections in our body from neurons


---------15:27----------
but we also have


---------15:28----------
neurochemical connections with


---------15:30----------
neurotransmitters with


---------15:31----------
hormones that are impacted upon our


---------15:34----------
stress levels the way that we feel


---------15:36----------
and if we're constantly that hyper


---------15:38----------
parasympathetic state


---------15:40----------
i know that my patient isn't going to


---------15:41----------
have good circulation of their neck


---------15:43----------
because what happens when we're in a


---------15:44----------
hyper sympathetic state


---------15:46----------
we're locked in so everything is


---------15:48----------
tightened there's less circulation


---------15:50----------
happening just because of this state


---------15:52----------
but then you're less likely to look at


---------15:53----------
your surroundings look up and down


---------15:55----------
and therefore you have less range of


---------15:57----------
motion and when you have less range of


---------15:59----------
motion you


---------15:59----------
basically develop like a frozen shoulder


---------16:02----------
situation just of your neck


---------16:04----------
and therefore you propagate the injury


---------16:06----------
moving forward


---------16:07----------
so a lot of the work that i do with my


---------16:09----------
patients even though they're coming in


---------16:11----------
for a physical symptom


---------16:12----------
is exploring some of this mental health


---------16:15----------
side of what they're doing


---------16:16----------
and i'm by no means a mental health


---------16:18----------
specialist i'm not a psychiatrist i'm


---------16:20----------
not a psychologist


---------16:21----------
well you're an iphone i'm an fm doc


---------16:24----------
but i broach the subject with them and i


---------16:27----------
gauge their interest level in continuing


---------16:29----------
this


---------16:29----------
line of communication and once i see


---------16:32----------
that they have


---------16:33----------
a layer of interest and they want to


---------16:35----------
pursue and they've seen some good


---------16:36----------
initial


---------16:37----------
outcomes we then connect them to a


---------16:38----------
mental health specialist who can


---------16:40----------
actually continue this work with them


---------16:42----------
but unless i'm going to be the one


---------16:44----------
screening for it catching this early


---------16:46----------
they're never going to see the mental


---------16:47----------
health specialist in order to get there


---------16:49----------
so that's why i find the beauty of


---------16:51----------
family medicine and osteopathic medicine


---------16:53----------
combining


---------16:54----------
in a place where i actually have patient


---------16:56----------
contact at a time when they're


---------16:57----------
experiencing this pain


---------16:59----------
and probably when they're most motivated


---------17:01----------
to seek help even though


---------17:03----------
they may have come in for a sore arm and


---------17:05----------
yet we're now talking about their


---------17:06----------
childhood


---------17:07----------
and how things are going in life it's a


---------17:09----------
conversation they didn't expect


---------17:11----------
yeah absolutely mike do you mind if i


---------17:13----------
ask you like a couple of questions just


---------17:15----------
a little bit about your


---------17:16----------
your training and stuff yeah so i've


---------17:18----------
noticed that you've highlighted the fact


---------17:20----------
that you're an osteopathic physician


---------17:21----------
like several times and you're short


---------17:23----------
sort of sharing principles of osteopathy


---------17:26----------
um can you just help me a little bit


---------17:28----------
uh understand a little bit about you


---------17:30----------
know


---------17:32----------
what's the reason that you kind of


---------17:34----------
highlight things that way


---------17:35----------
that you kind of draw that distinction


---------17:38----------
yeah so


---------17:38----------
when i was uh in high school i had


---------17:41----------
options of where i wanted to go


---------17:42----------
for college and then thinking about


---------17:44----------
medical school in the future because i


---------17:45----------
knew it was something i was passionate


---------17:46----------
about


---------17:48----------
and when my father actually immigrated


---------17:51----------
from russia to the united states at age


---------17:54----------
40 i was six years old at the time


---------17:56----------
he actually went to medical school and


---------17:58----------
residency all over again


---------17:59----------
in the united states and he happened to


---------18:01----------
go to an osteopathic school the same


---------18:03----------
school that i attended


---------18:05----------
and i got to witness him learning omt


---------18:07----------
the principles


---------18:08----------
of being a do and it became part of my


---------18:12----------
innate knowledge


---------18:13----------
of how i treat patients it's become


---------18:15----------
something that i'm very proud of


---------18:17----------
because historically in the united


---------18:19----------
states there has been some stigma


---------18:20----------
around osteopathic physicians as being


---------18:23----------
perhaps too


---------18:24----------
alternative or not thinking about


---------18:26----------
medications enough and a lot of this


---------18:27----------
stems from what osteopathic physicians


---------18:30----------
are not physicians


---------18:31----------
osteopathy practitioners are across the


---------18:33----------
globe


---------18:34----------
for their for example in some countries


---------18:36----------
in europe and in asia


---------18:37----------
they are not fully licensed medical


---------18:39----------
doctors and they do only perhaps perform


---------18:42----------
omt and that is such an important


---------18:44----------
distinction to be made because here in


---------18:46----------
the united states we are fully licensed


---------18:47----------
we can practice across any specialty we


---------18:50----------
can get board certified any specialty


---------18:52----------
when we do our residency training our


---------18:54----------
now programs are combined


---------18:56----------
all of them this just happened not too


---------18:58----------
long ago my program where i did my


---------19:00----------
family medicine training i was trained


---------19:02----------
alongside


---------19:02----------
mds and do's and after a while we forgot


---------19:05----------
who was an md and who is a do because


---------19:07----------
our principles align so much that we


---------19:10----------
took away what they learned in school


---------19:11----------
they took away what we learned in school


---------19:13----------
and it really became merged


---------19:15----------
so much so that if i'm being honest the


---------19:16----------
differences in


---------19:18----------
md and do education is shrinking year to


---------19:20----------
year


---------19:21----------
because the mda curriculum is learning


---------19:23----------
how well this holistic approach works


---------19:25----------
that they've incorporated into their own


---------19:27----------
uh honestly mike that's that's why i was


---------19:28----------
a little bit surprised by you


---------19:29----------
highlighting because i like in my mind


---------19:31----------
like


---------19:32----------
whether someone is an md or do um


---------19:36----------
you know i i don't like i fully


---------19:38----------
understand


---------19:39----------
uh that you know osteopathy has a


---------19:41----------
different perspective that you all learn


---------19:42----------
omt and we don't


---------19:44----------
i in my experience honestly of do versus


---------19:46----------
md school is that


---------19:47----------
you all learn everything that we learn


---------19:49----------
and you guys learn extra stuff


---------19:52----------
yeah you know i think it also came from


---------19:54----------
the idea that


---------19:55----------
the entrance exams and grades initially


---------19:59----------
to get into osteopathic schools were


---------20:01----------
somewhat lower


---------20:02----------
in that they were taking non-traditional


---------20:04----------
applicants perhaps those who are going


---------20:06----------
into their second career


---------20:07----------
uh immigrant applicants and as a result


---------20:10----------
people just looked at the scores and


---------20:12----------
said oh well if i want to be competitive


---------20:14----------
and go to the highest


---------20:15----------
specialty possible you know plastic


---------20:17----------
surgery ophthalmology


---------20:19----------
i'll have a better shot by becoming an


---------20:20----------
md and that sort of changed the patient


---------20:24----------
the student selection for who went to


---------20:26----------
each school


---------20:28----------
but now i think it's changing because


---------20:29----------
now we see do


---------20:31----------
medical students and do doctors across


---------20:33----------
all these specialties


---------20:35----------
and you know at some of the highest


---------20:36----------
positions in the united states


---------20:39----------
the former president uh personal


---------20:41----------
physician


---------20:42----------
the current president's personal


---------20:44----------
physician both were do's


---------20:46----------
one is obviously still a deo and um the


---------20:50----------
the head of medicine for nasa as a do


---------20:53----------
we we really are now starting to expand


---------20:55----------
into being everywhere


---------20:56----------
but i still bring up the concept of


---------20:58----------
osteopathy because it's really my


---------21:00----------
foundation as to why i think


---------21:02----------
holistically it happened because of my


---------21:04----------
education


---------21:05----------
and in seeing how my md colleagues were


---------21:07----------
trained it's not that they got a lower


---------21:08----------
form of education they're brilliant


---------21:10----------
physicians


---------21:10----------
it was just with a slightly different


---------21:12----------
focus but i honestly think that focus is


---------21:14----------
changing and it's shifting for the


---------21:15----------
better


---------21:17----------
what what would you say is the


---------21:18----------
difference in the focus that your md


---------21:20----------
colleagues got


---------21:22----------
they had an intense understanding of the


---------21:24----------
physiology


---------21:25----------
and the pathophysiology behind


---------21:27----------
conditions


---------21:28----------
but less of the psychosocial components


---------21:32----------
less of the communication component and


---------21:35----------
i can give a very concrete example here


---------21:37----------
when i went in as a third year student


---------21:41----------
uh into my clinicals into my internal


---------21:43----------
medicine rotation


---------21:44----------
in inner city brooklyn i was very


---------21:47----------
comfortable performing physical exams


---------21:49----------
because from year one as a do you're uh


---------21:52----------
working on your other classmates doing


---------21:54----------
osteopathic manipulative therapy so


---------21:56----------
you're


---------21:56----------
getting used to what it's like to feel


---------21:58----------
normal structures on a body


---------22:00----------
you're getting used to interacting with


---------22:02----------
different uh


---------22:03----------
people different shapes different sizes


---------22:05----------
etc so when i came in


---------22:07----------
i was very ready to talk to a patient to


---------22:10----------
feel what was going on


---------22:11----------
to feel perhaps a tumor earlier than


---------22:14----------
other colleagues of mine so i i think


---------22:17----------
that that


---------22:18----------
helped me in a way to be a better


---------22:20----------
physician


---------22:21----------
and again every school is different


---------22:24----------
every residency program is different


---------22:26----------
i only highlight this because that


---------22:28----------
stigma that existed


---------22:30----------
probably 10 20 years ago more so than it


---------22:32----------
does today against ceos


---------22:34----------
to really highlight the fact that not


---------22:35----------
only are we so similar each year we're


---------22:37----------
becoming more and more similar


---------22:39----------
absolutely man so i mike i'm noticing


---------22:41----------
that you know a lot of your


---------22:42----------
it sounds like you've thought a lot


---------22:44----------
about what you're sharing today like


---------22:46----------
it sounds um you know very well


---------22:48----------
organized


---------22:49----------
i i can sort of see that the teacher


---------22:52----------
inside you coming out


---------22:54----------
um and and so i'm a little bit honestly


---------22:57----------
curious about because it sounds like you


---------22:58----------
sort of


---------22:59----------
you know it sounds like you kind of


---------23:00----------
figured things out bro i


---------23:03----------
appreciate you saying that um i probably


---------23:05----------
should prepare


---------23:06----------
more for when i give presentations but i


---------23:09----------
like for it to come from an


---------23:10----------
organic place because as i present


---------23:13----------
information like this


---------23:15----------
i'm actually at the same time while i'm


---------23:16----------
presenting it trying to re-understand


---------23:19----------
and process it myself


---------23:20----------
so that if i say something that doesn't


---------23:22----------
make sense it's because i'm actively


---------23:23----------
trying to listen to myself speak


---------23:25----------
kind of a way that i uh fact check


---------23:28----------
myself


---------23:29----------
especially when making youtube videos


---------23:31----------
and social media content so


---------23:33----------
i tend not to like to prepare for things


---------23:35----------
like this because


---------23:37----------
i wanted to be like you're a patient or


---------23:38----------
you're a friend of mine who's asking me


---------23:40----------
these questions and we're just having a


---------23:41----------
conversation about it


---------23:43----------
yeah absolutely so i'm not i'm not


---------23:44----------
getting the sense that you're over


---------23:45----------
prepared at all but i i just i'm hearing


---------23:47----------
a certain organization


---------23:49----------
to your you know the way you're kind of


---------23:51----------
talking and like


---------23:52----------
it really sounds like i'm talking to a


---------23:54----------
teacher it reminds me


---------23:56----------
of being in class like in medical school


---------23:58----------
where you know


---------23:59----------
i and i i totally get that you don't


---------24:01----------
know everything but at the same time


---------24:03----------
what i'm hearing is


---------24:04----------
a very um you know strong and consistent


---------24:07----------
representation of


---------24:09----------
when you work with a patient when you


---------24:10----------
kind of think holistically


---------24:12----------
you've noticed that there are very


---------24:15----------
real mental components that will


---------24:18----------
contribute to someone's physical pain


---------24:20----------
um and i mean i you know i i don't


---------24:24----------
i kind of i'm with you yeah i mean i i


---------24:28----------
love that we're on the same page on that


---------24:30----------
because for me i've always been a


---------24:32----------
curious individual i think my uh


---------24:35----------
either my college or medical school


---------24:37----------
application


---------24:38----------
uh title was essay title was why am i


---------24:41----------
always hungry


---------24:42----------
and it was hungry for knowledge and


---------24:44----------
whenever i see a patient


---------24:46----------
i always treat every interaction as uh


---------24:48----------
like one interaction and then i think


---------24:50----------
about it later what could i do to


---------24:51----------
improve that interaction or what i could


---------24:53----------
do better to be


---------24:54----------
a better doctor and i think about the


---------24:56----------
unanswered questions i have


---------24:57----------
and i think about that not just for


---------24:59----------
osteopathic principles but also for


---------25:01----------
like if a patient comes in for strep


---------25:03----------
throat why am i giving antibiotics for


---------25:05----------
strep throat


---------25:06----------
the the scary reality is if we ask most


---------25:09----------
doctors why we treat strep throat


---------25:12----------
i think most doctors won't know the


---------25:14----------
answer to that question like they're


---------25:15----------
going to say oh to get better faster or


---------25:17----------
they'll say oh because that's cardiac


---------25:19----------
complications bro


---------25:20----------
right yeah cardiac complications


---------25:22----------
rheumatic fever


---------25:24----------
and the reality is if you don't take uh


---------25:27----------
antibiotics


---------25:28----------
the symptoms will only on average be 16


---------25:30----------
hours longer


---------25:32----------
so it's not like patients think oh i


---------25:34----------
need to get my antibiotics so i can get


---------25:35----------
better quicker


---------25:36----------
not really going to happen and we're


---------25:39----------
really preventing complications like you


---------25:40----------
said cardiac rheumatic fever any


---------25:42----------
potentially kidney complications


---------25:44----------
but most doctors don't know that they


---------25:46----------
think they're just treating the bacteria


---------25:47----------
where the bacteria here is not so much a


---------25:49----------
threat as if it spreads it becomes


---------25:51----------
problematic and even then


---------25:52----------
it's a thin line as we study more and


---------25:54----------
more how often should we be doing this


---------25:56----------
what's the risk versus benefit in doing


---------25:58----------
this


---------25:59----------
and we're starting to continually


---------26:01----------
explore our knowledge here that's why i


---------26:02----------
fell in love with medicine because we're


---------26:04----------
continually learning we're continually


---------26:05----------
fact checking ourselves because even in


---------26:08----------
an era like this where misinformation's


---------26:10----------
so prominent


---------26:10----------
people are like the science is wrong no


---------26:14----------
science is never wrong scientists are


---------26:16----------
wrong doctors are wrong


---------26:18----------
the science is never wrong the science


---------26:19----------
is the process that helps us figure out


---------26:21----------
that we were wrong or that our


---------26:22----------
hypotheses were wrong


---------26:24----------
so i love reading about that studying


---------26:26----------
that and applying it to my everyday


---------26:29----------
sort of patients and such mike i find


---------26:31----------
that the things that i'm the most


---------26:32----------
curious about are actually like more


---------26:34----------
you as opposed to your patient


---------26:36----------
interactions because it's fascinating to


---------26:37----------
hear


---------26:38----------
um you know maybe it's because i'm a


---------26:40----------
psychiatrist but speaking holistically


---------26:42----------
like here we are having a conversation


---------26:44----------
about mind-body connection


---------26:46----------
and what i'm sort of seeing is the


---------26:48----------
person underneath


---------26:51----------
like so you're asking the question but


---------26:53----------
what i'm really find myself kind of


---------26:54----------
curious about is like


---------26:56----------
who is the person asking the question i


---------26:58----------
mean just so far


---------26:59----------
you know because i think you like i said


---------27:00----------
i think you've explained everything


---------27:02----------
really well i mean you clearly know what


---------27:03----------
you're talking about


---------27:04----------
and so what i'm kind of curious about


---------27:07----------
because you sort of don't


---------27:08----------
leave questions unanswered in the way


---------27:09----------
that you speak i think you do a really


---------27:11----------
good job of


---------27:12----------
of you know kind of laying things out


---------27:13----------
offering examples things like that


---------27:15----------
sharing personal anecdotes and it really


---------27:16----------
gets woven together like quite


---------27:18----------
beautifully


---------27:19----------
but what i find myself being curious


---------27:21----------
about is you know who is the person who


---------27:22----------
wrote that essay


---------27:23----------
what was it like to have a dad who was


---------27:25----------
an osteopathic physician and you kind of


---------27:27----------
said that like you grew up with this


---------27:28----------
stuff right


---------27:29----------
and so i'm kind of thinking a little bit


---------27:31----------
about like if we want to change


---------27:33----------
medicine to be a little bit more


---------27:34----------
holistic like honestly the stuff that i


---------27:36----------
want to ask you like i'm sure i could


---------27:38----------
ask you questions about


---------27:39----------
you know how you approach acid reflux


---------27:41----------
but to be honest what i'm the most


---------27:43----------
curious about is actually like


---------27:44----------
you yeah i know i mean absolutely if you


---------27:48----------
want to venture into that i'm happy to


---------27:50----------
talk about anything i consider myself


---------27:52----------
uh one of those people on social media


---------27:54----------
that treats life like an open book


---------27:56----------
so uh whatever questions or whichever


---------27:58----------
direction you want to take this you're


---------27:59----------
the host


---------28:00----------
you lead the way yeah so if i ask


---------28:02----------
anything that you think is kind of out


---------28:03----------
of line or you don't feel comfortable


---------28:05----------
answering you know just feel free but


---------28:06----------
like i was just curious so it sounds


---------28:08----------
like you


---------28:08----------
you i mean you moved to the united


---------28:12----------
states at the age of six


---------28:14----------
can you tell me a little bit about what


---------28:16----------
what you remember about


---------28:18----------
russia and yeah i don't remember much


---------28:21----------
um i just remember leaving very abruptly


---------28:24----------
um


---------28:25----------
my one story that i remember that i tell


---------28:27----------
quite often is a really funny story i


---------28:31----------
remember i guess my entrepreneurial


---------28:33----------
sense was even very healthy back then


---------28:35----------
where my dad went to the food market and


---------28:37----------
bought some


---------28:38----------
pears home and corn on the cob home


---------28:41----------
and i was eating some corn on the cob in


---------28:43----------
the playground and some of the older


---------28:44----------
kids were like oh we want some corn


---------28:46----------
and i'm like well i have some corn


---------28:48----------
upstairs they're like oh we'll buy it


---------28:49----------
from you at a markup so i ran upstairs


---------28:51----------
and then i realized we had no more corn


---------28:53----------
left because my whole family ate it


---------28:54----------
so instead i brought outside pears and i


---------28:57----------
said okay i'll


---------28:58----------
sell you these pairs and i started


---------28:59----------
selling pairs at like


---------29:01----------
5x the cost which is still not that much


---------29:03----------
money obviously


---------29:04----------
uh to everyone on the playground


---------29:06----------
grandparents kids older kids etc


---------29:08----------
and i brought home and i showed my dad


---------29:10----------
the money i'm like look


---------29:12----------
and like very surprising to me my dad


---------29:15----------
yells at me and says


---------29:17----------
how dare you rip people off um get you


---------29:20----------
have to go back and give everyone


---------29:21----------
back their money and i gave everyone


---------29:23----------
back their money some people wouldn't


---------29:24----------
take it back they were like no you sold


---------29:26----------
me the pair i knew what i was getting


---------29:27----------
and you keep it


---------29:28----------
and he came with me and we went to those


---------29:30----------
people's houses and he made me give it


---------29:31----------
back and


---------29:32----------
they laughed and they took their money


---------29:34----------
back but um


---------29:36----------
i don't know why that story stuck in my


---------29:38----------
head i guess it might have been a


---------29:39----------
dramatic experience of sorts but


---------29:41----------
that is what sticks with me most uh from


---------29:43----------
my russian experience


---------29:45----------
i mean i'm not hearing traumatic what


---------29:47----------
i'm hearing the word i'd use is


---------29:48----------
formative


---------29:50----------
perhaps yep right so like sometimes i


---------29:53----------
understand why you kind of go towards


---------29:54----------
traumatic because a lot of times we


---------29:56----------
think of dramatic experiences as


---------29:57----------
formative


---------29:58----------
you know they shape the way that we look


---------30:00----------
at things but i i mean


---------30:01----------
what what do you think it was that your


---------30:03----------
dad was trying to like like


---------30:05----------
teach you there like what'd you come


---------30:06----------
away with


---------30:08----------
i think he was probably going for


---------30:10----------
fairness


---------30:12----------
equality making sure that i'm never


---------30:14----------
unethical or moral in my dealings


---------30:16----------
and i think it definitely stuck i mean


---------30:19----------
in the work that we do


---------30:20----------
on my social media channel i think i


---------30:23----------
don't know if it's directly because of


---------30:24----------
that situation obviously but the way


---------30:26----------
that i was raised definitely affects the


---------30:28----------
way that i run


---------30:29----------
social media as a business entity like i


---------30:32----------
don't know like a lot of


---------30:33----------
you know youtubers sell merch and while


---------30:35----------
i think it's great to make money from


---------30:37----------
your audience i feel like i'm already so


---------30:38----------
blessed with the success that i've had


---------30:40----------
we like to do it all for charity or we


---------30:42----------
have a patreon


---------30:44----------
and again we're taking money from the


---------30:45----------
audience instead we decide every month


---------30:48----------
where collectively as a group where


---------30:49----------
we're going to donate that money


---------30:51----------
and i like to do good as much as i can


---------30:55----------
in addition to you know succeeding on my


---------30:58----------
own like i i would want it to be a


---------30:59----------
universal success as much as possible


---------31:01----------
i i'm not in favor when i say that the


---------31:04----------
communist model by any means we left


---------31:06----------
russia for


---------31:07----------
a reason but um if people are working


---------31:10----------
for it i want them to succeed as much as


---------31:12----------
possible and


---------31:13----------
witnessing my immigrant family go


---------31:14----------
through it i think that definitely


---------31:16----------
instilled some strong morals in me and


---------31:18----------
that was a formative experience for sure


---------31:20----------
what do you mean by watching your


---------31:21----------
immigrant family go through it


---------31:24----------
um well coming to the united states you


---------31:26----------
know we're very poor


---------31:27----------
we lived on welfare for the first few


---------31:29----------
years here in the u.s


---------31:30----------
especially when my father was in school


---------31:32----------
my mom was a phd math professor


---------31:35----------
at an esteemed university in russia when


---------31:37----------
coming here she didn't speak english


---------31:39----------
so she was sweeping floors to make ends


---------31:42----------
meet


---------31:43----------
she was saving money on bus fare like


---------31:46----------
the dollar


---------31:46----------
bus fare or what it was at the time and


---------31:48----------
would walk two three miles to work every


---------31:50----------
day


---------31:51----------
like there was this russian saying that


---------31:53----------
i frequently revisit in my videos called


---------31:55----------
cheers and it means going through i


---------31:58----------
can't


---------31:58----------
that's the very literal translation of


---------32:01----------
it but um


---------32:02----------
it's almost like nike's just do it i


---------32:04----------
guess my dad was a fan of nike back in


---------32:06----------
the


---------32:07----------
early 90s can you help me that sounds


---------32:09----------
like a cool


---------32:10----------
saying can you explain what what the


---------32:12----------
meaning of it is going through i can't


---------32:15----------
yeah so when things get going it's


---------32:18----------
basically pushing through the struggles


---------32:19----------
uh you know there's plenty of great


---------32:21----------
quotes out there michael jordan one


---------32:23----------
sticks out of my head of if there's an


---------32:25----------
obstacle in front of you


---------32:26----------
think about going through it think about


---------32:28----------
going over it think about you know


---------32:29----------
digging underneath


---------32:30----------
uh i'm probably butchering that quote


---------32:32----------
but i'm paraphrasing uh i see so like


---------32:34----------
that's sort of


---------32:35----------
working through i can't like yeah like


---------32:38----------
you don't wanna say i can't


---------32:39----------
this is hard don't let that emotion stop


---------32:42----------
you from whatever it is you're seeking


---------32:44----------
to accomplish


---------32:45----------
wow so it sounds like you're you know


---------32:46----------
your parents worked


---------32:48----------
really hard and and really had uh


---------32:52----------
i mean it's got to be tough to go


---------32:53----------
through my parents um


---------32:56----------
both my parents were medical doctors


---------32:58----------
thankfully they didn't have to repeat


---------32:59----------
medical school but they you know they


---------33:01----------
did residency over here


---------33:02----------
um and and i i mean


---------33:06----------
it must have been tough for your dad to


---------33:08----------
repeat medical school and go through


---------33:09----------
residency


---------33:10----------
again i try and put myself in his shoes


---------33:13----------
and say okay like i'm a doctor now


---------33:15----------
what's going to take in 10 years for me


---------33:17----------
to be so unhappy living in the united


---------33:19----------
states that i'm going to move to another


---------33:20----------
country let's say china


---------33:21----------
and learn chinese and while i'm learning


---------33:24----------
chinese go to a chinese medical school


---------33:26----------
and then a residency like


---------33:28----------
i don't know how bad it needs to get and


---------33:29----------
how motivated i have to be


---------33:31----------
10 years from now to want to do that but


---------33:34----------
it shows the level of dedication that he


---------33:36----------
had


---------33:36----------
for the success of myself and my sister


---------33:39----------
for us to


---------33:40----------
have a good childhood and grow up with


---------33:43----------
opportunities because that's essentially


---------33:44----------
why he came here and why we


---------33:46----------
brought her family here and faced all


---------33:47----------
these risks


---------33:49----------
and you said you kind of grew up with


---------33:50----------
that holistic perspective at home like


---------33:53----------
um you know do you have a sense of


---------33:55----------
whether your dad like because i


---------33:57----------
assume he went to like a md school in in


---------33:59----------
russia


---------34:00----------
and so do you have a sense of like you


---------34:02----------
know how his perspective changed or what


---------34:04----------
it means to grow up with a holistic


---------34:06----------
perspective at school


---------34:07----------
i mean at home yeah i don't know if he


---------34:09----------
ever went into depth


---------34:11----------
uh i think it happened through an


---------34:13----------
osmosis type of knowledge transfer where


---------34:15----------
he would be practicing omt


---------34:17----------
for his boards or for his exams and he


---------34:20----------
would be practicing on me


---------34:22----------
and at the time i was an athlete i was


---------34:24----------
doing taekwondo for about eight nine


---------34:26----------
years i was going to tournaments


---------34:27----------
regularly getting


---------34:28----------
injured and him working on me and also


---------34:31----------
helping me focus


---------34:33----------
on school and giving me these mental


---------34:35----------
health sort of boosts by telling me i


---------34:37----------
need to go through i can't


---------34:39----------
i think that sort of presented that


---------34:41----------
holistic picture


---------34:42----------
and whether it came from the medical


---------34:45----------
school that he was attending or that's


---------34:46----------
who he was as a person before


---------34:48----------
it's hard for me to say can you tell me


---------34:50----------
about taekwondo


---------34:53----------
yeah so that was a a really long part of


---------34:55----------
my childhood


---------34:57----------
when i was six right away they enrolled


---------34:59----------
me in this program


---------35:00----------
um it was like three four days a week a


---------35:03----------
lot of training


---------35:04----------
uh i was getting pretty good at it too


---------35:06----------
where i was deciding or at least


---------35:08----------
considering


---------35:09----------
trying out for the u.s olympic team wow


---------35:13----------
and yeah i won some like national


---------35:14----------
tournaments and stuff


---------35:16----------
for sparring and i was really excited


---------35:19----------
about it but then with school and i


---------35:20----------
moved


---------35:21----------
to a different city i kind of lost track


---------35:24----------
with it and


---------35:26----------
started playing other sports i became


---------35:27----------
like the captain of my high school


---------35:29----------
soccer team played that


---------35:30----------
for a while and then when i went into my


---------35:32----------
seven year combined


---------35:33----------
undergrad med school program uh when you


---------35:36----------
were an undergrad they didn't allow you


---------35:37----------
to play sports because you were taking


---------35:38----------
so many credits it would break the ncaa


---------35:40----------
rules so


---------35:41----------
i didn't play any collegiate sports


---------35:43----------
except some intramural stuff here and


---------35:44----------
there


---------35:45----------
wow how mike i'm i'm fascinated i mean


---------35:48----------
how do you understand


---------35:50----------
why i mean how does someone become


---------35:53----------
you know a national taekwondo champion


---------35:55----------
[Music]


---------35:57----------
captain of the soccer team like


---------36:00----------
like how do you do that


---------36:04----------
i mean i don't know i was just i it


---------36:05----------
wasn't some


---------36:07----------
pre-thought out plan that i had um i


---------36:09----------
think


---------36:10----------
i'm athletic genetically i'm tall i'm


---------36:13----------
lean


---------36:13----------
so um i was training from an early age


---------36:16----------
i think any time that you know you have


---------36:18----------
some good genetics and


---------36:20----------
you put the dedication in you're going


---------36:22----------
to have good outcomes


---------36:23----------
um i didn't achieve you know olympic


---------36:26----------
success or do any of this stuff so


---------36:28----------
i don't want to take the credit for any


---------36:29----------
of this but it was fun i i genuinely


---------36:32----------
enjoy sports and i think


---------36:34----------
i sort of have taken some of the


---------36:35----------
principles from sports and applied it to


---------36:38----------
my medical training and


---------36:39----------
even the way that i treat patients


---------36:41----------
whether they're one year old or 101 year


---------36:43----------
old


---------36:44----------
i try and treat them like athletes you


---------36:45----------
know like even parkinson's patients


---------36:47----------
we now treat like athletes we create a


---------36:49----------
rehab program


---------36:51----------
as if they're rehabbing from a you know


---------36:53----------
an acl injury


---------36:54----------
in order for them to be uh moving better


---------36:57----------
swallowing better working with a


---------36:59----------
speech language pathologist for their


---------37:00----------
swallowing working with a physical


---------37:02----------
therapist to improve their gait


---------37:04----------
and i really believe in the sports


---------37:06----------
philosophy i think there's a lot of


---------37:07----------
great takeaways from it


---------37:08----------
as well as some negatives you know like


---------37:11----------
sports psychology is a really


---------37:12----------
interesting field of research that i'm


---------37:14----------
uh


---------37:15----------
constantly looking at connections to the


---------37:18----------
mind body from sports is always


---------37:19----------
something i'm really interested in


---------37:21----------
and that sort of interest and constantly


---------37:24----------
moving i think translates well to the


---------37:26----------
medical field


---------37:28----------
interesting and and can you tell me a


---------37:31----------
little bit it sounds like you went to a


---------37:32----------
combined


---------37:33----------
uh seven year undergrad


---------37:36----------
med school program how did you decide to


---------37:38----------
do that


---------37:39----------
yeah so i knew i wanted to become a


---------37:42----------
physician


---------37:42----------
when i was in high school i witnessed uh


---------37:45----------
you know as


---------37:47----------
kind of popular as it sounds my father


---------37:49----------
going through the whole journey


---------37:50----------
and seeing that i really enjoyed it that


---------37:52----------
it was a respectful field


---------37:54----------
i was good at science i liked learning


---------37:56----------
about the human body like i said i was


---------37:58----------
somewhat athletic so


---------37:59----------
that was part of the journey and i said


---------38:02----------
what's the quickest way i can do it


---------38:03----------
because i was always in a rush like


---------38:05----------
i never had any patience for anything


---------38:07----------
and because my father went to that


---------38:08----------
program he was aware


---------38:10----------
that there was this seven-year program


---------38:12----------
that existed sorry he went to that


---------38:13----------
medical school


---------38:14----------
and um i applied and i luckily got


---------38:18----------
in and instead of going the undergrad


---------38:20----------
route i was accepted into this very


---------38:21----------
competitive program where there were


---------38:23----------
about


---------38:24----------
let's say 88 acceptance uh people's


---------38:28----------
88 individuals accepted to the program


---------38:30----------
and then upon completion of medical


---------38:32----------
school for the seven years like 13


---------38:34----------
14 individuals finished so you had to


---------38:36----------
maintain a very strict gpa in undergrad


---------38:38----------
you have to get an mcat score to


---------38:40----------
continue


---------38:41----------
into the medical school portion and also


---------38:43----------
life gets in the way i mean in seven


---------38:45----------
years things change


---------38:46----------
for people you know when you're 16 17 18


---------38:48----------
years old you're making a decision what


---------38:49----------
you want to do


---------38:50----------
for your rest of your life people change


---------38:53----------
and grow


---------38:54----------
yeah so i it's interesting because you


---------38:55----------
say that you you knew you wanted to be a


---------38:57----------
physician in high school can you help me


---------38:59----------
are these two personal by the way or is


---------39:00----------
this cool no no absolutely not yeah of


---------39:02----------
course please


---------39:04----------
um how did you know you wanted to be a


---------39:05----------
physician


---------39:07----------
yeah i mean like i knew as much as a 16


---------39:09----------
or 17 year old would know anything


---------39:11----------
like i didn't know but uh i thought


---------39:14----------
it was a good choice and that it was


---------39:16----------
something i enjoyed


---------39:18----------
i thought it was a good choice because


---------39:19----------
it lined up with my skill set


---------39:21----------
communicating with patients having an


---------39:23----------
interest in the human body being able to


---------39:25----------
focus to actually study on these topics


---------39:27----------
because my mom being a math professor i


---------39:29----------
hated math


---------39:30----------
you know like luckily she tutored me so


---------39:33----------
much so that i crushed the sat because


---------39:35----------
of her i almost got a perfect score on


---------39:36----------
the math portion


---------39:37----------
but if you told me i had to study math


---------39:38----------
on my own it would never happen


---------39:41----------
um so science was just a like a really


---------39:46----------
happy line that matched up with my uh


---------39:48----------
skill line


---------39:49----------
that worked really well for a career and


---------39:52----------
seeing what the intricacies were like


---------39:53----------
like a lot of students say they want to


---------39:55----------
go into medicine


---------39:56----------
but they have no idea what medicine is i


---------39:58----------
knew i went with my dad to his residency


---------40:00----------
when he when there was a bring your


---------40:01----------
child to work day i saw what his on-call


---------40:04----------
rooms were like i saw


---------40:05----------
what looked like when he was studying


---------40:07----------
with his power points


---------40:09----------
his textbooks so like i kind of got an


---------40:12----------
inside look at the journey


---------40:13----------
and i got the good with the bad he never


---------40:15----------
forced me to become a doctor in fact he


---------40:16----------
said you sure you want to do this


---------40:18----------
probably not ideal


---------40:19----------
our health care system is broken i'm


---------40:21----------
doing this because i'm old and there's


---------40:22----------
nothing else to do you can do anything


---------40:24----------
but uh he he always spoke very highly


---------40:27----------
about his connection with his patients


---------40:29----------
and how it's never a dull day and the


---------40:32----------
career sold itself for me


---------40:34----------
wow so


---------40:37----------
med school then how did you decide on


---------40:39----------
family medicine or what


---------40:41----------
yeah yeah so i initially wanted to


---------40:44----------
pursue the field of surgery going into


---------40:47----------
medical school


---------40:48----------
and i during my first two years that


---------40:50----------
still held true


---------40:52----------
during my third year surgical rotation


---------40:55----------
it was about 12 weeks and i spent that


---------40:58----------
time in lutheran medical center


---------41:00----------
a very high trauma area


---------41:04----------
it was a level one trauma center and i


---------41:07----------
scrubbed into like 60 surgeries at the


---------41:09----------
time maybe 70 surgeries


---------41:11----------
and i was like i want to make a good


---------41:12----------
impression because this is a


---------41:14----------
program that accepts some of our medical


---------41:16----------
school applicants so maybe i want to go


---------41:18----------
here


---------41:19----------
and the more and more i did it i


---------41:20----------
realized it's not where my skill set was


---------41:21----------
it wasn't where i found myself to be


---------41:23----------
most happy while i enjoyed the technical


---------41:25----------
prowess of becoming a surgeon


---------41:27----------
i disliked the fact that i didn't get


---------41:28----------
continuity with the patients that i


---------41:30----------
didn't get to communicate much with them


---------41:32----------
because the reality is they're asleep


---------41:34----------
for the majority of the time so um


---------41:37----------
i spent a lot of time doing family


---------41:39----------
medicine as well because that's part of


---------41:40----------
your required


---------41:41----------
rotations and then i found myself just


---------41:44----------
addicted to the field that i constantly


---------41:45----------
wanted to do it more and more


---------41:47----------
my fourth year i had like five different


---------41:49----------
family medicine rotations as my


---------41:50----------
electives


---------41:52----------
i was also really passionate about


---------41:53----------
sports medicine i


---------41:55----------
considered making that as part of my


---------41:57----------
fellowship training after residency


---------42:00----------
and i started even during my residency


---------42:03----------
my first year covering sporting events


---------42:05----------
high school college football games um


---------42:08----------
and i i was really passionate about that


---------42:10----------
as well especially being an osteopathic


---------42:11----------
physician


---------42:12----------
and you know i just kept exploring more


---------42:14----------
and more family medicine was the field


---------42:16----------
for me


---------42:17----------
fascinating yeah i think the the most


---------42:20----------
important lesson i took away from


---------42:22----------
my surgery rotation was that if you


---------42:24----------
round super early in the morning no one


---------42:26----------
wants to talk to you


---------42:28----------
and it's something that i actually


---------42:30----------
sometimes would use when i'd be


---------42:32----------
like moonlighting so i'd cover like you


---------42:34----------
know weekends at hospitals and stuff


---------42:36----------
and you know shift starts at 6 30. so a


---------42:39----------
lot of times we're like oh you know like


---------42:41----------
you can start rounding around eight or


---------42:42----------
nine


---------42:43----------
you know the patients will be awake then


---------42:44----------
i was like uh i'm gonna round it like


---------42:46----------
seven well speaking of mind and body


---------42:50----------
isn't that like messed up that we do


---------42:51----------
that to patients who are healing in the


---------42:53----------
hospital


---------42:54----------
we don't let them sleep and then we


---------42:56----------
round on them at 5am and they're


---------42:58----------
like not getting better because they're


---------42:59----------
not resting we're we're pretty evil in


---------43:01----------
hospitals and oh that's the worst food


---------43:03----------
ever


---------43:04----------
i i think i think hospital care is


---------43:06----------
important and i think that's part of the


---------43:07----------
reason why


---------43:08----------
you know people get so much better after


---------43:10----------
they leave is because


---------43:11----------
you know um and speaking of you know


---------43:14----------
giving people healthy food this is a


---------43:16----------
if i can share a story one of my


---------43:18----------
favorite stories from residency is on


---------43:19----------
the inpatient psychiatry unit


---------43:21----------
um uh at mass general hospital they were


---------43:24----------
doing like you know they're trying to be


---------43:25----------
healthy right so like they're they're


---------43:27----------
like their


---------43:28----------
food has gotten a lot healthier over


---------43:29----------
time and it's actually like the


---------43:30----------
cafeteria is like pretty good


---------43:32----------
okay um so relatively healthy like


---------43:34----------
relatively tasty


---------43:36----------
and so we had this one person that was


---------43:38----------
hospitalized


---------43:39----------
who had a lot of behavioral problems we


---------43:41----------
had to keep on calling security you know


---------43:43----------
inpatient psychiatry um i'm sure you


---------43:46----------
remember a little bit about how it can


---------43:47----------
be sometimes


---------43:48----------
and and so one of my colleagues was just


---------43:51----------
absolutely brilliant


---------43:53----------
and and she was just incredibly


---------43:55----------
compassionate this


---------43:56----------
patient is just really combative um


---------43:59----------
and and so she sort of asked him like


---------44:02----------
you know like what like


---------44:03----------
is there anything we can do like what do


---------44:05----------
you hate about being here you hate being


---------44:07----------
here we can't let you leave i'm so sorry


---------44:09----------
about that is there anything that i can


---------44:11----------
do


---------44:11----------
and so somehow i think she like figured


---------44:13----------
out that he wanted like chicken fingers


---------44:16----------
so what she did is get him a pediatric


---------44:18----------
menu


---------44:19----------
right because like the adult menus have


---------44:20----------
like salads and like you know like


---------44:22----------
you know wheat bread with like lean


---------44:25----------
protein kind of sandwiches


---------44:26----------
so she got him a pediatric menu and like


---------44:29----------
the


---------44:29----------
the behavioral disturbances just tanked


---------44:31----------
he was just like as long as he got his


---------44:33----------
chicken fingers and pizza and stuff like


---------44:34----------
that and then the funny thing is like


---------44:37----------
the rest of the unit like started to


---------44:39----------
revolt


---------44:40----------
because they're like why does he get


---------44:41----------
chicken figures and i just get


---------44:43----------
salad and so then we had this like like


---------44:46----------
unit why they're like i want my chicken


---------44:48----------
fingers like where's my attendees at you


---------44:51----------
know


---------44:52----------
and so it was it was a real problem our


---------44:54----------
our unit like you know the person who


---------44:56----------
ran the unit was like really frustrated


---------44:58----------
with the situation because


---------44:59----------
he's actually someone who's very into


---------45:01----------
like diet and you know all about like


---------45:03----------
mind body kind of stuff and like we have


---------45:04----------
to


---------45:04----------
you know we have to you know offer


---------45:06----------
patients like healthy


---------45:08----------
foods and so some people you know we


---------45:10----------
just sort of


---------45:11----------
i think some people ended up you know it


---------45:13----------
was like 10 days on the unit for a week


---------45:14----------
and then people started to get


---------45:15----------
discharged and then


---------45:17----------
sort of evened itself out but yeah yeah


---------45:20----------
well that's like a form of risk


---------45:21----------
reduction right so like


---------45:23----------
you know eating chicken fingers isn't


---------45:24----------
great but if it's going to prevent


---------45:26----------
patients from harming themselves or


---------45:27----------
harming others maybe chicken fingers


---------45:28----------
aren't so bad


---------45:29----------
absolutely right i think that's that was


---------45:31----------
ultimately the approach is that it's way


---------45:33----------
better than


---------45:34----------
injecting them with medication that they


---------45:35----------
don't want like just give them some you


---------45:37----------
know give them some tenders


---------45:38----------
um i love that you call them attendees


---------45:41----------
that's awesome


---------45:43----------
yeah that you know attendees


---------45:46----------
i don't know if you you're how familiar


---------45:48----------
you are with 4chan familiar with 4chan


---------45:51----------
uh i've heard of it that's like a


---------45:53----------
reddit-esque forum right


---------45:55----------
i don't know people are going to be


---------45:57----------
insulted or flattered by that comparison


---------46:00----------
i don't know so fortunately yeah yeah so


---------46:03----------
4chan is um


---------46:04----------
it's a message board that's entirely


---------46:06----------
anonymous


---------46:08----------
so there are no accounts and or maybe


---------46:11----------
i don't know if there are accounts or


---------46:12----------
not but like since it's all anonymous it


---------46:14----------
tends to


---------46:15----------
um get a lot of flack for actually


---------46:17----------
there's a lot of like weird and


---------46:19----------
relatively toxic stuff there because


---------46:22----------
and so a lot of like memes and and


---------46:24----------
things like that come out of 4chan and


---------46:26----------
one of the big things that


---------46:27----------
that came out of 4chan is actually


---------46:28----------
attendees and i don't know if you were


---------46:30----------
following any of this gamestop


---------46:32----------
kind of stuff yep we're actually doing


---------46:35----------
uh


---------46:36----------
um we're actually in the process of


---------46:37----------
doing a research paper


---------46:39----------
on um prevalence of different mental


---------46:42----------
health conditions on 4chan um and i


---------46:46----------
wonder have you ever heard of something


---------46:47----------
called arfid i know it's like a


---------46:48----------
relatively new diagnosis it's like a


---------46:51----------
wait are fit you said arfid yeah it's


---------46:54----------
like a


---------46:55----------
restrictive it's a restrictive feeding


---------46:57----------
disorder it's like a new kind of eating


---------46:58----------
disorder


---------46:59----------
so kind of on the frontier is relatively


---------47:01----------
new diagnosis but the interesting thing


---------47:03----------
is that


---------47:04----------
um people who have arfid who basically


---------47:06----------
can't eat certain foods because they


---------47:07----------
can't tolerate like the texture


---------47:10----------
um so sometimes kids will be like you


---------47:12----------
know picky eaters and some people grow


---------47:14----------
out of it but especially some people on


---------47:15----------
the autism spectrum


---------47:16----------
seem to have like a lot of um arfid-like


---------47:19----------
qualities


---------47:20----------
the one thing is every single patient


---------47:22----------
i've had with arfid


---------47:24----------
loves tendees it's like the one thing


---------47:26----------
that they can eat


---------47:27----------
so like it does like you know it's not


---------47:29----------
it seems to be like that attendees are


---------47:31----------
what


---------47:31----------
people eat also every patient that i've


---------47:33----------
had with autism actually i don't know


---------47:35----------
about


---------47:35----------
every patient actually yeah that i can


---------47:37----------
fairly say likes attendees too


---------47:41----------
and and so we're really curious about


---------47:43----------
whether there's actually like a


---------47:45----------
a correlation between the prevalence of


---------47:47----------
arfid and and whether you


---------47:48----------
hang out on 4chan so we're we're


---------47:50----------
studying and those are the kinds of


---------47:51----------
studies that unfortunately the nih isn't


---------47:53----------
funding


---------47:55----------
you know well it's unclear whether


---------47:58----------
you know it it serves humanity to know


---------48:00----------
whether the prevalence of rfid is


---------48:02----------
greater on 4chan or not


---------48:04----------
i don't really know but it's a research


---------48:05----------
question that we're fascinated in so


---------48:07----------
we're going to try to study it


---------48:09----------
i love it okay and that should be a fun


---------48:11----------
study to get results from i'm sure


---------48:13----------
you're going to get a meme out of it


---------48:14----------
yeah so i think it's going to be all


---------48:16----------
memes like it means


---------48:17----------
is one of the major outcomes of the


---------48:19----------
study there's going to be like


---------48:20----------
prevalence of arfid and production of


---------48:22----------
memes are going to be the two outcomes


---------48:23----------
that we look at


---------48:26----------
but anyway yeah i don't know where i was


---------48:28----------
going with that


---------48:29----------
um i learned something i didn't know


---------48:32----------
about our fit and now i know that


---------48:33----------
attendees are the go-to


---------48:34----------
for patients that are yep potentially


---------48:37----------
struggling with texture


---------48:38----------
and yeah so f you know as an fm doc like


---------48:41----------
i don't know you know how pediatric your


---------48:42----------
your population is but for picky eaters


---------48:44----------
like some of them may have actually


---------48:46----------
arfid fed


---------48:49----------
so just kind of going back to so it


---------48:51----------
sounds like you you did a seven-year


---------48:53----------
combined program


---------48:54----------
and then um went into family medicine


---------48:58----------
and can you tell me a little bit about


---------49:00----------
like social media and how that


---------49:02----------
started for you because as i understand


---------49:04----------
you're huge


---------49:06----------
um it it happened in a weird way


---------49:10----------
during medical school i had an instagram


---------49:12----------
profile


---------49:13----------
and i never had social media prior to


---------49:16----------
instagram but then when i was


---------49:17----------
studying for my boards actually i was


---------49:18----------
studying alongside my friend who was in


---------49:20----------
nursing school


---------49:21----------
studying for his nclex and he was taking


---------49:23----------
pictures outside of the small library


---------49:25----------
window of clouds


---------49:26----------
and i'm like what are you doing like


---------49:28----------
stop distracting me like you're taking


---------49:29----------
pictures i hear the flash


---------49:30----------
i hear the clicking sound and he's like


---------49:33----------
no dude there's this new app it's called


---------49:35----------
instagram where if you take a picture of


---------49:36----------
the sunset and you do hashtag sunset


---------49:39----------
uh you'll get a bunch of likes and all


---------49:40----------
these people come visit your profile and


---------49:42----------
i was like that sounds silly like you're


---------49:43----------
just bored


---------49:44----------
so later that day i come home i'm like


---------49:46----------
oh it's kind of a cool app let me try


---------49:48----------
and i posted a picture of my siberian


---------49:49----------
husky at the time and


---------49:51----------
they got all these likes and one of the


---------49:53----------
likes stood out to me was from a


---------49:54----------
professional


---------49:56----------
like i think alpine skier that i watched


---------49:58----------
in the olympics


---------49:59----------
the prior olympics and i said wow look


---------50:01----------
how cool this is this app can bring


---------50:02----------
people together


---------50:03----------
let me like use this as sort of my blog


---------50:06----------
if you will


---------50:07----------
day-to-day activities put pictures on it


---------50:09----------
there was no stories at the time so


---------50:12----------
just kind of like posting on there and


---------50:13----------
without any real


---------50:15----------
goals but with the potential that it


---------50:17----------
could somewhat help my medical career in


---------50:19----------
the future whether it was for marketing


---------50:20----------
connections et cetera et cetera and i


---------50:23----------
did the entrepreneurial mindset


---------50:25----------
exactly that i just thought like


---------50:27----------
connecting with people by the


---------50:28----------
thousands is going to be beneficial in


---------50:30----------
one way or another and


---------50:32----------
it also didn't hurt growing up i didn't


---------50:34----------
get a lot of compliments or like female


---------50:36----------
attention


---------50:37----------
and now on social media i was probably


---------50:40----------
in the best shape that i was at the time


---------50:41----------
i was posting on social media i was


---------50:43----------
really into bodybuilding


---------50:44----------
i was getting a lot of compliments there


---------50:46----------
for that i'm sure that played a role


---------50:48----------
in continuing to to do that um


---------50:52----------
and uh i was doing that for a while yep


---------50:55----------
so sorry what role do you think that


---------50:56----------
played


---------50:58----------
um positive dopamine hits continue to


---------51:01----------
come back


---------51:02----------
um there was definitely a point in time


---------51:04----------
where it


---------51:05----------
affected me in a way where i became like


---------51:07----------
arrogant with the fact that i had


---------51:09----------
you know 5 000 followers or something


---------51:12----------
and my friends


---------51:13----------
uh they are quick to humble me and


---------51:16----------
they pointed out that i was becoming


---------51:18----------
that person and i had to do some


---------51:20----------
introspection i actually deleted the app


---------51:22----------
for a while


---------51:22----------
not like my profile off the app but the


---------51:24----------
app off my phone


---------51:26----------
and really questioned why i was doing it


---------51:28----------
was there something unhealthy behind it


---------51:29----------
and i definitely saw that i was


---------51:31----------
talking way too much about it all the


---------51:33----------
time and it became something that like


---------51:36----------
i didn't like about myself that i was


---------51:37----------
becoming so i said okay i need to like


---------51:40----------
tone down the amount of


---------51:41----------
time i'm talking about social media


---------51:43----------
realize that my value is not tied to the


---------51:45----------
self-worth of how many followers i have


---------51:47----------
that if people like me it's because they


---------51:49----------
like me not because of the followers


---------51:51----------
and i learned that lesson fairly early


---------51:53----------
on yeah


---------51:54----------
bro you're fast forwarding past all the


---------51:55----------
good parts so like here's what i'm


---------51:56----------
hearing like


---------51:57----------
if it like like just think about this


---------51:59----------
for a second okay because like people


---------52:00----------
getting wrapped up in social media


---------52:02----------
people becoming arrogant


---------52:03----------
as you said people becoming that person


---------52:05----------
there are a lot of those people out


---------52:06----------
there


---------52:07----------
and if there's one thing that i think


---------52:09----------
actually could be very educational for


---------52:11----------
people it's like


---------52:12----------
not everyone is able to do that right


---------52:14----------
like


---------52:15----------
in fact it's i i'd love to ask you a few


---------52:17----------
more questions but if you know if you


---------52:19----------
yeah no no that's fair game um i think


---------52:22----------
my sort of skill like i'm always kind of


---------52:25----------
making fun of the fact that i'm not the


---------52:27----------
smartest person in the world and that


---------52:29----------
i wasn't the top student in my class but


---------52:32----------
i think where my skill lies in being


---------52:34----------
introspective and constantly


---------52:35----------
reevaluating my actions and my thoughts


---------52:38----------
so


---------52:39----------
if you'd like to ask about that well


---------52:40----------
yeah so so who would who did you become


---------52:43----------
when you say you became that person what


---------52:45----------
started to happen what does that person


---------52:46----------
look like


---------52:48----------
yeah um it would basically be


---------52:51----------
every conversation that i had


---------52:54----------
was about the social media and my value


---------52:58----------
ranking system of the people in my life


---------53:00----------
became about who had followers


---------53:02----------
yeah i don't know if you're familiar


---------53:04----------
with black mirror or the tv show on


---------53:05----------
netflix


---------53:08----------
yeah there was one episode where they


---------53:10----------
kind of like rated each other a ranking


---------53:12----------
system


---------53:13----------
yeah and like no joke it was


---------53:17----------
eerily similar to what was becoming sort


---------53:19----------
of in my mind to a degree where like


---------53:22----------
if someone would talk to me i would feel


---------53:24----------
perhaps above them because i had a


---------53:26----------
certain following and keep in mind i'm


---------53:28----------
19 years old at the time so like


---------53:30----------
i i'm still a student like i have no


---------53:32----------
money i'm broke and this is the only


---------53:34----------
thing where i had some value that i was


---------53:36----------
like oh my god


---------53:37----------
i'm cool because of this and i realized


---------53:39----------
i was tying all my self-worth to it and


---------53:41----------
everyone else's self-worth to it


---------53:43----------
because it was simple in that the


---------53:45----------
dopamine hits came when likes came


---------53:48----------
that you could easily quantify like


---------53:51----------
people based on their numbers


---------53:53----------
but that's not reality because people


---------53:55----------
aren't just numbers so it was a


---------53:56----------
false system but it was an easy system


---------54:00----------
and yeah i just talked way too much


---------54:02----------
about it and i showed off way too much


---------54:04----------
about


---------54:05----------
how many likes my posts got or how many


---------54:06----------
followers i had


---------54:08----------
and i didn't like who i was becoming i


---------54:11----------
didn't like that i was doing that so


---------54:12----------
often and


---------54:13----------
i learned that lesson early on but


---------54:15----------
that's not to say that


---------54:16----------
i didn't relearn that lesson over and


---------54:19----------
over and over again


---------54:20----------
like even over the last year um


---------54:23----------
not so much that i was becoming arrogant


---------54:25----------
but over the last year


---------54:26----------
i found myself again tying my happiness


---------54:29----------
levels or my fulfillment levels


---------54:31----------
to numbers on social media and that's


---------54:33----------
something i talk about not doing all the


---------54:35----------
time


---------54:36----------
and yet i did it so often even this last


---------54:39----------
year


---------54:40----------
so it's a constant process of learning


---------54:42----------
and


---------54:43----------
can you tying things back to things that


---------54:45----------
you learned before


---------54:46----------
that that sounds like really really like


---------54:48----------
helpful to understand like


---------54:50----------
because what i'm hearing is that you


---------54:52----------
know you kind of fell into that trap


---------54:54----------
once and you kind of worked your way


---------54:56----------
through it


---------54:57----------
you know and then but at the same time


---------55:00----------
you can still fall into the trap again


---------55:03----------
yeah for sure and it might be a slightly


---------55:05----------
different trap like it might be the


---------55:06----------
numbers again but


---------55:08----------
not so much with arrogance the next time


---------55:10----------
but with happiness


---------55:11----------
or success or fulfillment what have you


---------55:14----------
so


---------55:15----------
the trap is always there can you help me


---------55:17----------
understand that and


---------55:18----------
you mentioned like over the last year


---------55:20----------
like what


---------55:21----------
yeah so i have a cool probably one


---------55:25----------
an example that you'll really relate to


---------55:28----------
well uh


---------55:28----------
being in the field of psychiatry um the


---------55:32----------
the treadmill of hedonism where we


---------55:34----------
constantly are on this treadmill chasing


---------55:36----------
extrinsic levels of happiness um so


---------55:39----------
whether it's money fame what have you


---------55:41----------
uh is something i try and stay away from


---------55:43----------
as much as possible i try and get


---------55:44----------
fulfillment from my deep personal


---------55:46----------
relationships from the volunteer work


---------55:48----------
that i do my patients etc however


---------55:51----------
youtube specifically youtube


---------55:54----------
is savagely


---------55:57----------
pushing the treadmill onto you and


---------56:00----------
doesn't let you leave the treadmill


---------56:02----------
because youtube is this unique algorithm


---------56:06----------
that essentially is this evil personal


---------56:08----------
trainer


---------56:09----------
that doesn't let you get off the tread


---------56:11----------
bill


---------56:13----------
because when you create a piece of


---------56:14----------
content that does well


---------56:17----------
it doesn't allow you to celebrate that


---------56:19----------
success because the next video


---------56:22----------
has to either equate or even supersede


---------56:25----------
the success of the next one


---------56:27----------
otherwise the algorithm will just stop


---------56:29----------
recommending it


---------56:30----------
and the feedback mechanism of what makes


---------56:32----------
you happy falls off very quickly


---------56:35----------
so while in other platforms like if you


---------56:38----------
did well


---------56:40----------
you continue doing well youtube you're


---------56:42----------
either growing or you're shrinking


---------56:43----------
there's no like in between


---------56:45----------
and because of that you find yourself on


---------56:46----------
this treadmill all the time


---------56:48----------
chasing success and you never really get


---------56:51----------
to take a proper break


---------56:52----------
unless you have a great understanding of


---------56:54----------
how all of this works psychologically


---------56:56----------
and knowing yourself so


---------56:59----------
i like to make the comparison between


---------57:01----------
traditional television and youtube in


---------57:03----------
this way


---------57:05----------
and i'm borrowing part of this concept


---------57:07----------
from a good friend of mine


---------57:08----------
who runs this channel called infographic


---------57:10----------
show he talks about


---------57:12----------
deserved views versus earned views


---------57:16----------
and when we talk about like game of


---------57:18----------
thrones if season one is a hit


---------57:21----------
everyone will tune in to season two


---------57:24----------
because it deserved those views


---------57:27----------
youtube is savage in that you could have


---------57:30----------
a great


---------57:31----------
10 videos but if your 11th video


---------57:34----------
gets a lower watch time or has a lower


---------57:36----------
click-through rate youtube doesn't care


---------57:38----------
that you crushed it on the last 10


---------57:39----------
videos


---------57:40----------
your views will just get destroyed in


---------57:42----------
the algorithm which is great for the


---------57:44----------
viewer because the viewer is only


---------57:45----------
getting the top tier content


---------57:47----------
but as a creator you're constantly under


---------57:50----------
the gun


---------57:51----------
because all of your views have to be


---------57:53----------
earned none of them are deserved


---------57:56----------
so good in the concept that the viewer


---------57:59----------
gets the best content


---------58:01----------
good and that it's created a level


---------58:02----------
playing field that it doesn't matter if


---------58:03----------
you have one subscriber or a million


---------58:05----------
subscribers


---------58:05----------
any piece of content can get recommended


---------58:08----------
and get get viral success


---------58:10----------
bad for the creator in terms of burnout


---------58:12----------
bad for the creator that you


---------58:14----------
never really get a chance to disconnect


---------58:16----------
or celebrate your successes


---------58:18----------
unless you are really really organized


---------58:21----------
and psychologically well understood


---------58:23----------
individual


---------58:25----------
can you that's blew my mind first of all


---------58:28----------
thank you so much for sharing that and


---------58:30----------
i'm i'm so curious like what what


---------58:34----------
so what does that do to you right so you


---------58:36----------
talked about youtube


---------58:38----------
you talked about how you basically like


---------58:41----------
can't ever stop growing


---------58:44----------
otherwise you'll fall off and what does


---------58:46----------
that do


---------58:47----------
to you how does that how does that


---------58:50----------
affect


---------58:51----------
fulfillment success things like that


---------58:55----------
well i've been doing youtube for


---------58:57----------
probably just over four years now


---------58:59----------
and never missing a posting date


---------59:03----------
you want to continue that your growth


---------59:06----------
was really good you want to continue


---------59:08----------
that


---------59:10----------
inadvertently you end up tying your


---------59:12----------
self-worth to your subscriber count or


---------59:14----------
your view count


---------59:15----------
or your growth count and as a result


---------59:18----------
if that for whatever reason pauses fades


---------59:21----------
decreases it ultimately starts affecting


---------59:25----------
your mental health


---------59:26----------
and unless you are in a very healthy


---------59:30----------
healthy psychological mindset


---------59:32----------
like i'm talking about where you can be


---------59:34----------
in that buddhist state where you're like


---------59:36----------
everything is transient even if


---------59:38----------
something bad happens it won't be long


---------59:40----------
and if anything good happens it won't be


---------59:41----------
for that long so i'll be happy here sad


---------59:43----------
here


---------59:43----------
and i'm so balanced you're going to


---------59:46----------
suffer as a result


---------59:47----------
and for me despite how balanced i come


---------59:50----------
off or happy i come off in my posts and


---------59:52----------
all of that


---------59:53----------
this last year was absolutely a struggle


---------59:56----------
you know pandemic has affected everybody


---------59:58----------
to a degree


---------59:59----------
but watching sometimes content drop off


---------60:02----------
or going through some difficult times in


---------60:04----------
life


---------60:05----------
watching the youtube channel suffer


---------60:07----------
affected me way more than it should have


---------60:09----------
and as a result i had to function in


---------60:13----------
much the same way i did when i was 18 19


---------60:15----------
years old


---------60:15----------
when i was becoming arrogant and tying


---------60:17----------
my self-worth to it back then


---------60:20----------
and how how what how did that you kind


---------60:22----------
of say you


---------60:23----------
talk about it like it's inevitable what


---------60:25----------
like what was your experience


---------60:28----------
of so i'm i'm i'm just inferring here


---------60:30----------
that


---------60:31----------
over the last year your youtube channel


---------60:33----------
growth slowed down


---------60:36----------
yeah well not only did it slow down but


---------60:38----------
also you know


---------60:39----------
burnout is real like uh like i said


---------60:42----------
you don't get deserved views you get


---------60:44----------
earned views


---------60:45----------
and when you know you do that without


---------60:48----------
taking any breaks


---------60:49----------
and that's essentially what i've been


---------60:51----------
doing for four years


---------60:53----------
saying like i will outlast i will


---------60:55----------
persevere going through i can't you know


---------60:57----------
my dad's advice


---------60:58----------
um i i've been pushing really hard in


---------61:02----------
addition to residency because


---------61:05----------
all of this started towards the middle


---------61:07----------
of my residency and i made sure to make


---------61:08----------
that a priority


---------61:10----------
so never took a day off residency um to


---------61:12----------
do anything social media related


---------61:14----------
so while finishing that also doing this


---------61:17----------
at the same time it just it was such a


---------61:20----------
long process that it caught up with me


---------61:22----------
in that


---------61:23----------
i was like really getting


---------61:26----------
burned out like the classical symptoms


---------61:28----------
of burnout where you derive less joy


---------61:30----------
from the things that once brought you


---------61:31----------
joy


---------61:33----------
sleep was messed up anxiety was high


---------61:35----------
where i actually had to seek therapy


---------61:37----------
throughout the pandemic


---------61:38----------
and i learned a lot you know i learned a


---------61:40----------
lot going through them because it's


---------61:41----------
something i advocate for my patients


---------61:43----------
and now it was the time that i realized


---------61:45----------
i do need help and i need to figure out


---------61:47----------
what was going on


---------61:48----------
and i think this was a cool takeaway


---------61:50----------
that i learned from therapy


---------61:52----------
which is uh you're very familiar with


---------61:55----------
cbt


---------61:56----------
cognitive behavioral therapy you know


---------61:58----------
attacking your irrational thoughts


---------62:00----------
putting in a more rational thought to at


---------62:02----------
least decrease


---------62:03----------
the grasp or the depth of how sad you


---------62:06----------
feel or how depressed you feel


---------62:08----------
and i would do that quite well for the


---------62:10----------
last 10 years or so i would say


---------62:11----------
or at least well enough to help me


---------62:13----------
manage but over the last year what i


---------62:15----------
found was that i was doing the cbt on


---------62:17----------
myself so often


---------62:19----------
that i was reliving the negative


---------62:20----------
experiences over and over again


---------62:23----------
where like you know if you watch a movie


---------62:25----------
a scary movie


---------62:27----------
and like or an action movie your brain


---------62:29----------
on a functional mri


---------62:31----------
lights up the same areas of your brain


---------62:33----------
as if you were experiencing that pain or


---------62:35----------
that that fear


---------62:36----------
so i was essentially doing that to my


---------62:39----------
brain over and over again by trying to


---------62:41----------
force cbt on myself


---------62:43----------
and only when speaking to a mental


---------62:45----------
health professional realized that


---------62:47----------
i need to actually disconnect from that


---------62:49----------
and i need to disconnect from social


---------62:51----------
media


---------62:52----------
and i need to not constantly be


---------62:54----------
refreshing


---------62:55----------
my feeds and that while they're going


---------62:57----------
through i can't


---------62:58----------
could be a great coping mechanism and


---------63:01----------
hiding or disconnecting


---------63:03----------
like disconnecting viewed as hiding


---------63:05----------
could be perceived as a negative coping


---------63:06----------
mechanism if i'm not facing reality


---------63:09----------
but that wasn't what was happening i was


---------63:10----------
facing reality but i was doing it so


---------63:12----------
much so


---------63:13----------
that it was actually having a negative


---------63:15----------
effect so the coping mechanism of


---------63:17----------
hot hiding or disconnecting was actually


---------63:20----------
a strong positive that i was missing out


---------63:21----------
on


---------63:22----------
and that was something i learned that i


---------63:23----------
wouldn't have learned had i not


---------63:25----------
uh sought out help yeah that's


---------63:29----------
thank you so much for sharing that mike


---------63:31----------
can i just kind of recap what i heard


---------63:32----------
there


---------63:33----------
please yeah so so it's interesting


---------63:35----------
because you know when i when i listen to


---------63:36----------
you mike when i when i


---------63:38----------
you know what you give off is like


---------63:43----------
unrivaled success right


---------63:47----------
like it's like you know you're it's it's


---------63:49----------
the immigrant story like


---------63:51----------
growing up like you know this i mean


---------63:53----------
you're you're driven


---------63:54----------
you're focused you're caring um


---------63:58----------
and you know like national oh yeah like


---------64:00----------
like


---------64:01----------
even even the even the humility is so


---------64:04----------
amazing because you're like yeah like


---------64:05----------
it's not like i was an olympic athlete i


---------64:07----------
was just


---------64:08----------
a national champion you know like nvd


---------64:12----------
and and and so it's like because you


---------64:14----------
seem to you know really succeed a lot


---------64:17----------
man like you know like succeeding from a


---------64:20----------
young age like


---------64:21----------
seven year medical programs are not easy


---------64:23----------
to get into they're


---------64:25----------
 way more competitive than md


---------64:27----------
schools for sure


---------64:28----------
i'm pretty sure about that i mean i i


---------64:30----------
mean i actually don't know the


---------64:31----------
statistics but


---------64:32----------
my understanding of the accelerated you


---------64:34----------
know programs are that


---------64:36----------
they're hard to get into um


---------64:39----------
and like like you said because they have


---------64:40----------
like a high drop-off rate right because


---------64:42----------
it


---------64:42----------
ain't easy a lot of people drop out so


---------64:44----------
they're very selective with who they


---------64:45----------
take


---------64:46----------
and then fm residency and then social


---------64:48----------
media and it's kind of like whether you


---------64:50----------
like


---------64:50----------
whether it starts with offering to sell


---------64:53----------
corn


---------64:54----------
and making a profit on pairs right


---------64:57----------
you find a way right you follow through


---------65:02----------
or you you what did you say you work


---------65:03----------
through i can't


---------65:05----------
yeah and and so it's really interesting


---------65:08----------
to see kind of


---------65:09----------
what that mentality how it's helped you


---------65:12----------
a lot and also like


---------65:14----------
it sounds like you've sort of paid a


---------65:15----------
price for never letting yourself


---------65:19----------
say i can't can't take a break


---------65:22----------
got to keep growing i can do this you


---------65:25----------
know like


---------65:27----------
and and even the way you when you were


---------65:29----------
talking about cbt you said


---------65:30----------
attack your rational thoughts and i was


---------65:32----------
like yeah that's


---------65:34----------
that's going to be a problem i mean i


---------65:36----------
think if we're talking about


---------65:38----------
you know balance in the mind and the


---------65:40----------
buddha state that you're talking about


---------65:41----------
attacking your mind is


---------65:43----------
not how you get there you can absolutely


---------65:45----------
succeed


---------65:46----------
it's how you can get success and this is


---------65:48----------
what i've seen time and time again it's


---------65:49----------
that you know when people


---------65:51----------
you know really like


---------65:54----------
don't let themselves fail it's it's a


---------65:56----------
very brutal way of


---------65:57----------
of living it's a very successful way of


---------65:59----------
living but it's


---------66:00----------
it's brutal on the self um you know it's


---------66:04----------
hard because yeah i don't think you're


---------66:05----------
quite


---------66:05----------
listening to other parts of your body


---------66:07----------
listening to other parts of your mind


---------66:09----------
because you're not going to be a quitter


---------66:11----------
you know that's not that's not who you


---------66:13----------
are


---------66:14----------
um and so it was really fascinating to


---------66:16----------
hear i i think i i


---------66:18----------
feel like i learned a lot and thank you


---------66:19----------
so much for sharing that


---------66:21----------
yeah i think any coping mechanism


---------66:24----------
if it's successful in the beginning uh


---------66:27----------
if you overuse it


---------66:28----------
it's ultimately going to have drawbacks


---------66:30----------
so you know this isn't a problem unique


---------66:33----------
to me or unique to people who've had


---------66:34----------
success


---------66:35----------
i think every human goes through


---------66:37----------
something like this just in different


---------66:39----------
ways in different situations


---------66:41----------
just for me i've always been like this


---------66:42----------
energized kind of person


---------66:44----------
people call me energizer bunny growing


---------66:46----------
up my friend uh


---------66:48----------
here in new york he's like you're like a


---------66:49----------
cockroach they can't kill you you just


---------66:51----------
keep going like you never get tired i


---------66:53----------
would work a 36 hour shift and i would


---------66:54----------
go play basketball with


---------66:56----------
my agent here in new york so like yeah


---------66:58----------
like i've always viewed that as a batch


---------67:00----------
of honor or something that identified


---------67:02----------
myself as


---------67:03----------
but at the same time i need to be aware


---------67:05----------
of the pitfalls


---------67:06----------
of always being on or of always being


---------67:08----------
super friendly and accessible even like


---------67:10----------
right now


---------67:11----------
so if i go outside in new york and let's


---------67:14----------
say i want to take my headphones and


---------67:16----------
listen to an audio book and chill out on


---------67:17----------
the grass on the west side highway


---------67:19----------
with my dog without a doubt now it's


---------67:22----------
come to the point that someone will come


---------67:24----------
up


---------67:24----------
and maybe ask for a picture which isn't


---------67:26----------
a big problem but


---------67:28----------
we'll want to get into a conversation


---------67:29----------
and i want to talk to people i want to


---------67:31----------
meet people


---------67:31----------
but sometimes you just kind of want to


---------67:33----------
be by yourself and vibe out on a book


---------67:36----------
and now i'm learning the reality of it


---------67:38----------
not that


---------67:39----------
it's not a show-off thing people want to


---------67:41----------
come up and get to know you and talk to


---------67:42----------
you and they get excited and i would


---------67:44----------
have gotten excited if i was 18 and i


---------67:46----------
was meeting someone i was following


---------67:48----------
so i understand it but now understanding


---------67:50----------
that i can't


---------67:51----------
always be available and i can't always


---------67:53----------
be super friendly or


---------67:54----------
just say yes to everybody that is a


---------67:57----------
completely foreign experience to me


---------67:59----------
because i hate saying no i don't like


---------68:01----------
saying no


---------68:02----------
but for my own mental health i have to


---------68:04----------
sometimes now set some boundaries which


---------68:06----------
i've never set in my life before


---------68:09----------
well yeah sounds like it's a lesson you


---------68:11----------
had to learn the hard way


---------68:13----------
it's not a hard way because there's way


---------68:15----------
harder lessons learned uh


---------68:16----------
in life for my patients from my friends


---------68:19----------
that i've seen


---------68:20----------
uh you know struggle with serious


---------68:22----------
serious problems and it's not to


---------68:24----------
downplay


---------68:24----------
the seriousness of my problem it's just


---------68:27----------
that's exactly what you're doing it's


---------68:30----------
it's just


---------68:31----------
there's things that are cause real


---------68:33----------
suffering and


---------68:34----------
there's problems like each problem has a


---------68:36----------
scale


---------68:37----------
and i would say this is a true problem


---------68:39----------
and it's truly affecting me


---------68:40----------
um but on levels of severity and how bad


---------68:43----------
things could get


---------68:44----------
i know maybe this is my own coping


---------68:46----------
mechanism at play


---------68:48----------
and that's exactly what it is yeah well


---------68:50----------
done with the introspection there


---------68:52----------
right because it's interesting how you


---------68:54----------
invalidate your suffering i think that's


---------68:56----------
what got you to four years of burnout


---------68:58----------
because i think that's actually mike


---------69:00----------
like i'm sorry if this is


---------69:02----------
going off the rails in terms of what


---------69:03----------
you're okay with but like that's how you


---------69:05----------
get


---------69:06----------
burnt out right because you're there's a


---------69:07----------
signal in your mind


---------69:09----------
and you've learned how to say like


---------69:11----------
actually i am okay having boundaries but


---------69:13----------
why did it take you four years


---------69:15----------
it's because when you say like even now


---------69:17----------
when you say to me like oh my god i


---------69:18----------
sound like such an


---------69:20----------
right like that's how it feels to be


---------69:22----------
like because you want to be a nice


---------69:23----------
person


---------69:24----------
you don't want to be that arrogant prick


---------69:26----------
who's big on social media and doesn't


---------69:28----------
have the time of day


---------69:30----------
like you recognize because you're a


---------69:31----------
physician that every human is a human


---------69:33----------
doesn't matter how many like


---------69:35----------
followers you've got on social media


---------69:36----------
like you've got one heart you can get an


---------69:38----------
mi i can get an m i we can both get


---------69:40----------
strokes we can all get cancer


---------69:41----------
you know i think medicine is great in


---------69:43----------
terms of teaching you that all humans


---------69:44----------
are equal


---------69:45----------
and bizarrely i think that's what's


---------69:47----------
actually trapping you


---------69:50----------
right because not all humans i mean when


---------69:53----------
i i just took a walk before we streamed


---------69:54----------
today and i walked around for 15 minutes


---------69:56----------
i've been recognized a total of four


---------69:58----------
times on the street


---------69:59----------
you know and so that it's still fun at


---------70:01----------
that frequency it's like four times over


---------70:03----------
two years is great


---------70:05----------
makes you feel good but i still get to


---------70:07----------
take walks


---------70:09----------
you know it's like it's something that


---------70:10----------
most human beings get to do


---------70:12----------
and i'd be really careful with yourself


---------70:14----------
because you know


---------70:16----------
sure the suffering that other people go


---------70:18----------
through is greater but like be careful


---------70:19----------
there


---------70:20----------
because i think that's makes you a good


---------70:23----------
physician


---------70:24----------
it's also going to burn you the out


---------70:26----------
when it comes to social media


---------70:28----------
no you're absolutely fundamentally in


---------70:31----------
every way right


---------70:32----------
um it's the reason why it's confusing


---------70:35----------
is it's unnatural this type of


---------70:39----------
notoriety is not a natural human thing


---------70:42----------
and it's not something even


---------70:44----------
like i guess like you could look to


---------70:46----------
celebrities in


---------70:47----------
traditional formats actors singers etc


---------70:50----------
but like really from medical


---------70:52----------
professionals or regular people


---------70:53----------
there's not a lot of people i can go to


---------70:55----------
for advice especially in the beginning


---------70:57----------
when i was starting all the social media


---------70:59----------
things so


---------71:00----------
i'm kind of trailblazing in a weird way


---------71:02----------
so that's why i'm always you know


---------71:03----------
there's people who are growing in the


---------71:04----------
medical space


---------71:05----------
i keep my dms open to them again


---------71:08----------
sometimes at my own peril


---------71:09----------
where at midnight where i should be


---------71:11----------
sleeping i'm having an hour conversation


---------71:13----------
helping a fellow medical influencer


---------71:15----------
navigate how to not get taken advantage


---------71:17----------
by a brand


---------71:18----------
so like i want to do that as much as


---------71:20----------
possible so i'm trying to figure out how


---------71:22----------
to manage all that


---------71:23----------
but it's a journey and i'm going to make


---------71:24----------
mistakes and you know as long as i learn


---------71:26----------
i feel like that's okay


---------71:28----------
and by the way the comparison thing


---------71:29----------
isn't also just looking at


---------71:31----------
uh what other people are going through


---------71:32----------
it's also things that i've gone through


---------71:34----------
in life and


---------71:35----------
you know well i don't want to get too


---------71:36----------
much into childhood stuff but like


---------71:38----------
during medical school


---------71:39----------
i did lose my mom to medical uh to


---------71:42----------
cancer


---------71:42----------
and that was a very tough thing to not


---------71:45----------
again


---------71:46----------
it was tough for me for sure but the


---------71:48----------
toughest part for me was watching how it


---------71:50----------
affected my father


---------71:51----------
who did this whole process who


---------71:54----------
you know sacrificed so much of his life


---------71:57----------
and was finally getting on his feet as a


---------71:59----------
doctor


---------71:59----------
him and my mom had all these plans


---------72:01----------
watching that break down


---------72:03----------
that hurt and you know leaving long


---------72:06----------
island where i was living on campus at


---------72:07----------
the time and moving back in with my dad


---------72:09----------
that presented all sorts of challenges


---------72:11----------
and i saw how difficult that was


---------72:12----------
so when i look through what i'm dealing


---------72:14----------
through now dealing with now


---------72:16----------
there definitely is a layer of like an


---------72:18----------
understanding of this is less serious


---------72:20----------
than that


---------72:21----------
so it's not that i'm just saying oh


---------72:22----------
people have it harder so my broken bones


---------72:24----------
shouldn't count


---------72:25----------
it's i've experienced 10 broken bones


---------72:27----------
and this one broken bone is probably not


---------72:29----------
as bad


---------72:30----------
yeah so what i'm hearing there is that


---------72:32----------
there's a healthy amount of


---------72:34----------
perspective as opposed to invalidation


---------72:37----------
yeah right like i don't want to say


---------72:40----------
healthy


---------72:42----------
why wouldn't you say healthy well no it


---------72:45----------
is a healthy mechanism but i wouldn't


---------72:46----------
say that this is perfect all the time


---------72:48----------
like i don't


---------72:48----------
again i don't want to give myself so


---------72:49----------
much credit that i'm like oh all the


---------72:51----------
time i'm able to


---------72:52----------
make this healthy comparison between my


---------72:54----------
past struggles and my current struggles


---------72:55----------
i absolutely look at other people and


---------72:57----------
see


---------72:57----------
that they're struggling more than me and


---------72:59----------
i invalidate my own experiences i do


---------73:01----------
that that's for sure


---------73:04----------
i was just really confused why can't


---------73:08----------
like bro like why can't you give


---------73:10----------
yourself credit for growing


---------73:13----------
no no i i take the credit i just don't


---------73:14----------
want it to come off like i know


---------73:16----------
everything because it's not true


---------73:19----------
why okay i'll explain why it's important


---------73:23----------
um i think it's important because i want


---------73:25----------
people to see


---------73:26----------
that while i'm doing this job that you


---------73:29----------
labeled healthy and i appreciate that


---------73:32----------
it's not always healthy i'm a lot of


---------73:35----------
times am invalidating my feelings


---------73:37----------
so while i do have this sense of healthy


---------73:40----------
perspective and all that


---------73:42----------
i also make a lot of these mistakes of


---------73:44----------
comparing myself and invalidating my


---------73:46----------
feelings


---------73:46----------
so people can understand that if they do


---------73:48----------
that too they're not failures this is


---------73:50----------
what everyone does including myself


---------73:56----------
can i just think for a second yeah sure


---------74:01----------
you're probably like this guy is crazy


---------74:04----------
no on the contrary


---------74:06----------
i think um you know so here's here's


---------74:09----------
what i'm


---------74:09----------
i'm seeing mike you're not crazy you're


---------74:11----------
at the top of the bell curve and the


---------74:13----------
problem here is that


---------74:14----------
which i think which and apologies


---------74:16----------
because i kind of think of you as a


---------74:17----------
colleague but what i'm going to say now


---------74:19----------
may come across


---------74:20----------
as like i know better than you but um


---------74:22----------
you know i think


---------74:23----------
we each have our respective areas of of


---------74:25----------
specialty


---------74:26----------
so i think you got to be careful because


---------74:29----------
like


---------74:31----------
i don't know what how do i say this


---------74:39----------
there's just something about how hard


---------74:42----------
you try to consider


---------74:45----------
other people right so like you think so


---------74:49----------
much about how what you're saying is


---------74:50----------
being perceived which


---------74:51----------
may be like related to social media but


---------74:53----------
i don't think i think that would be a


---------74:54----------
little bit unfair i think it's just


---------74:56----------
like you you want people to understand


---------74:59----------
that it's okay to fail you want people


---------75:02----------
to understand that like you struggle too


---------75:04----------
and that's not you could you could say


---------75:06----------
that there's a piece of that that's like


---------75:07----------
oh like


---------75:07----------
image conscious right like in and you


---------75:09----------
don't want to come across as arrogant


---------75:11----------
there may be a piece of that but i'm


---------75:12----------
getting a lot of genuine like


---------75:14----------
you care about sending the right


---------75:16----------
messages to people


---------75:17----------
and not propagating actually like a lot


---------75:20----------
of the


---------75:20----------
messages that social media seems to


---------75:22----------
project which is that there are


---------75:25----------
the chads right the taekwondo champions


---------75:29----------
soccer captains seven year medical


---------75:31----------
school program


---------75:34----------
people on youtubers like you're all of


---------75:36----------
those things and then they're like


---------75:39----------
the normal people over here and so i i


---------75:42----------
think it's it's very clear to me that


---------75:44----------
you're trying to


---------75:45----------
share that you're not actually any


---------75:46----------
different right that it's the


---------75:48----------
introspection it's the work it's the


---------75:50----------
effort and that's what you really want


---------75:51----------
people to come away with


---------75:53----------
get that but there's a subtle thing


---------75:55----------
there which is like you're caring so


---------75:56----------
much about other people like what about


---------75:58----------
you


---------76:01----------
yeah that's the the way that i would


---------76:04----------
first of all 100 accurate so very well


---------76:07----------
done reading me and


---------76:08----------
clearly you're a specialist and a


---------76:10----------
professional in this space


---------76:12----------
no surprise there um for me i sum it up


---------76:15----------
in this


---------76:16----------
i become very good at being comfortable


---------76:19----------
with being uncomfortable


---------76:20----------
i'm at being comfortable with being


---------76:23----------
comfortable


---------76:25----------
so part of that from


---------76:28----------
all of that is essentially how you


---------76:30----------
explained it so


---------76:32----------
yes there's a layer of i don't want to


---------76:33----------
come off arrogant and there's like a


---------76:35----------
brand


---------76:35----------
image conscious thing that i'm doing but


---------76:37----------
also it's because i


---------76:39----------
my ultimate mission and why i'm doing


---------76:41----------
social media and where i derive my


---------76:43----------
intrinsic value


---------76:44----------
is by putting out the accurate message


---------76:46----------
and especially to help people


---------76:48----------
who are truly suffering with things that


---------76:50----------
are confused and want good information


---------76:51----------
so


---------76:53----------
yeah hmm


---------76:56----------
are you happy mike yeah


---------77:00----------
i'm fulfilled oh man there's such a did


---------77:03----------
you see that show i'm such a tv geek and


---------77:06----------
movie geek


---------77:06----------
i relate everything back to shows i


---------77:08----------
don't know if i've watched too much tv


---------77:09----------
in my life but


---------77:11----------
there's a show called magic city um tell


---------77:14----------
me about it


---------77:15----------
the worst show that i'm like using as an


---------77:17----------
example for such a high-level


---------77:19----------
conversation about mental health but


---------77:20----------
it's a show about gangsters uh starting


---------77:23----------
up


---------77:24----------
gambling from cuba in florida and


---------77:27----------
they're trying to get it passed and all


---------77:28----------
that


---------77:28----------
but they asked one of the mobsters like


---------77:30----------
are you happy


---------77:32----------
and he says howdy duties happy i'm


---------77:33----------
content


---------77:35----------
and i don't know why that line stuck


---------77:37----------
with me but instead of content i think


---------77:39----------
i'm fulfilled


---------77:40----------
what is this so help me understand what


---------77:42----------
fulfillment is


---------77:44----------
uh fulfillment is i like to think of it


---------77:48----------
in a situation


---------77:50----------
so if today is my last day on earth do i


---------77:52----------
feel like i've accomplished everything i


---------77:54----------
could have until this point and am i am


---------77:55----------
i satisfied


---------77:56----------
and the answer is yes and i feel like if


---------77:59----------
i could be in that mental state


---------78:01----------
as much as i can in my life i'm happy


---------78:04----------
like that that's how i


---------78:05----------
sort of grade it so fulfillment is about


---------78:08----------
accomplishment before you die


---------78:12----------
satisfaction with what you have


---------78:14----------
accomplished and when i say accomplished


---------78:16----------
i really mean it in a holistic way in an


---------78:19----------
osteopathic way if you will


---------78:23----------
good relationships with my family good


---------78:25----------
relationships with my friends


---------78:27----------
being an ethical and moral person


---------78:29----------
helping the world while having success


---------78:31----------
on my own right


---------78:32----------
that's how i think of accomplishments as


---------78:34----------
opposed to you know seven million


---------78:36----------
followers or whatever it is


---------78:40----------
can i think for a second how we doing on


---------78:42----------
time by the way i don't know so we


---------78:43----------
usually run for about two hours at a


---------78:45----------
stretch i think that's like the


---------78:46----------
bandwidth that i have but


---------78:48----------
and we're coming up on an hour and a


---------78:49----------
half um


---------78:52----------
i'm good i'm used to uh long


---------78:54----------
interactions with my patients so


---------78:57----------
um


---------79:04----------
so fulfillment is happiness


---------79:08----------
yeah i mean like it's are we looking for


---------79:11----------
uh an oxford definition of happiness


---------79:13----------
and the funny thing is i love the field


---------79:16----------
of positive psychology so


---------79:18----------
uh martin seligman um i'm gonna butcher


---------79:21----------
his name


---------79:22----------
me highly checker the the author of the


---------79:24----------
book flow i think


---------79:26----------
kick set me highly i think is how you


---------79:27----------
pronounce it but


---------79:29----------
not even gonna try because it's so bad


---------79:31----------
on my part if i ever


---------79:32----------
end up i probably bless you i apologize


---------79:35----------
so


---------79:36----------
i've i've read a lot of these authors


---------79:39----------
and i've tried to figure out what


---------79:41----------
happiness means and i don't know like


---------79:43----------
you know martin selig's whole thing is


---------79:45----------
flourish instead of happiness he changed


---------79:47----------
the term


---------79:47----------
in his books for me i think


---------79:50----------
happiness is fulfillment i think


---------79:53----------
happiness is also probably more accurate


---------79:55----------
as a state of mind in a single moment


---------79:57----------
as opposed to like is your life


---------80:00----------
happiness


---------80:01----------
like i don't think you can say that i


---------80:03----------
think happiness is like how you feel in


---------80:05----------
this given moment one to ten bull


---------80:07----------
and right now i can be happy because


---------80:09----------
we're having a very fulfilling


---------80:10----------
conversation


---------80:11----------
but if i stub my toe in 10 minutes and


---------80:12----------
you ask me then i'm not going to be so


---------80:14----------
happy


---------80:14----------
so i think happiness is like a point of


---------80:16----------
time reference where fulfillment is


---------80:18----------
sort of a more grand scheme adjective


---------80:22----------
or now yeah so i i'm not i'm not so sure


---------80:26----------
i agree with you there


---------80:27----------
i love it please share with me why so


---------80:29----------
here's here's what i'm hearing okay


---------80:31----------
what i'm hearing is that you're not sure


---------80:33----------
what happiness is so


---------80:35----------
your mind has figured out in an almost


---------80:38----------
like a rational way like you've asked


---------80:39----------
like not


---------80:40----------
i don't want to make it sound


---------80:41----------
intellectual i think it's a little bit


---------80:43----------
more philosophical or spiritual in


---------80:45----------
nature


---------80:46----------
you're like what is the nature of


---------80:47----------
happiness and when you kind of looked at


---------80:49----------
like here's what i'm imagining okay like


---------80:50----------
you kind of looked at your life and you


---------80:52----------
were like


---------80:53----------
you know because i think even the way


---------80:54----------
that you define fulfillment


---------80:57----------
comes with the construction of if i died


---------80:59----------
today


---------81:00----------
would i have regrets could i be proud of


---------81:03----------
what i've accomplished


---------81:04----------
right could i be proud of the life that


---------81:06----------
i've built


---------81:08----------
like i'm on this earth i've been given


---------81:10----------
certain challenges i've been give


---------81:11----------
given certain privileges did i do a good


---------81:14----------
job and if the answer to that question


---------81:17----------
is yes


---------81:18----------
then you feel fulfilled is that fair


---------81:23----------
yes with just the small stipulation that


---------81:27----------
yes


---------81:27----------
is not a binary answer it's kind of like


---------81:32----------
a percentage if you will of how much yes


---------81:35----------
yeah absolutely right so like there are


---------81:36----------
these certain things that you can say


---------81:38----------
like


---------81:39----------
you know did mike like do a good job did


---------81:43----------
he leave the world a better place


---------81:45----------
and like you know then he left it and i


---------81:47----------
totally get that but i think it's


---------81:49----------
it's a it's a little bit of a


---------81:50----------
philosophical answer


---------81:52----------
and then it's interesting because then


---------81:54----------
on the flip side you also talk about an


---------81:55----------
experiential answer


---------81:57----------
right which is that in a particular


---------81:59----------
moment i can have


---------82:00----------
a particular state of mind my


---------82:02----------
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous


---------82:04----------
system or like in a right kind of


---------82:05----------
balance


---------82:06----------
you know i'm in a state of eustress like


---------82:08----------
in kind of a flow straight state where


---------82:09----------
it's not


---------82:10----------
boring but it's also not overly


---------82:12----------
stressful and


---------82:13----------
i can feel like a temporary moment of


---------82:15----------
happiness


---------82:16----------
but that that happiness is transient by


---------82:19----------
nature


---------82:21----------
so when you talk about the buddha when


---------82:23----------
you did this thing over here right


---------82:25----------
so like when you talk about that it


---------82:27----------
sounds to me like


---------82:28----------
that's really the one thing that you


---------82:30----------
sort of don't


---------82:31----------
quite haven't grasped fully yet like


---------82:34----------
you're aware that it's possible


---------82:35----------
you know that people kind of do it i'm


---------82:37----------
not saying that you haven't grown and


---------82:39----------
you haven't


---------82:40----------
learned how to carve out balance in your


---------82:42----------
life


---------82:43----------
but it feels like like mike everything


---------82:45----------
you do is so damn effortful


---------82:48----------
you work so hard at it it's funny you're


---------82:51----------
saying the exact


---------82:52----------
opposite of what like the attendings who


---------82:55----------
have trained me say


---------82:56----------
they say mike always takes the path of


---------82:58----------
least resistance he works smarter not


---------83:00----------
harder


---------83:01----------
it's like the exact opposite of the


---------83:03----------
feedback i've been giving my whole life


---------83:05----------
so it's interesting that you say that


---------83:06----------
yeah so that means on the one hand maybe


---------83:08----------
i'm completely wrong


---------83:11----------
right because if it's if it's completely


---------83:13----------
contrary there's there's truth to both


---------83:15----------
sides as always


---------83:16----------
and and no no well maybe i'm just wrong


---------83:20----------
right i just could be talking about you


---------83:22----------
because you're not wrong you're not


---------83:23----------
wrong in the sense of like


---------83:24----------
but i sometimes feel that on an unfair


---------83:27----------
characterization of my work when


---------83:29----------
like i remember my ex-girlfriend's


---------83:31----------
father said something like oh mike's


---------83:33----------
really smart like


---------83:34----------
he figured out a way to not work so many


---------83:35----------
hours in the hospital


---------83:37----------
great i'm like are you insane like do


---------83:39----------
you know how many hours i work on social


---------83:41----------
media and how stressful this is and all


---------83:42----------
this


---------83:43----------
yeah sometimes i do feel like it's an


---------83:45----------
unfair characterization


---------83:46----------
but at other times i agree with it i


---------83:49----------
mean so here's like even when it comes


---------83:50----------
to


---------83:51----------
happiness like you talk about being


---------83:52----------
introspective you've worked at happiness


---------83:56----------
well it's not like it's not like work


---------83:59----------
sounds tedious


---------84:00----------
i enjoyed what i was doing i forgot how


---------84:03----------
effortful


---------84:04----------
effortful you exerted effort right


---------84:07----------
that's like i'm noticing that you


---------84:09----------
thought about it


---------84:10----------
you know i'm not saying it's bad like


---------84:12----------
i'm not saying it's not enjoyable but


---------84:14----------
like there was energy expended let's put


---------84:16----------
it that way


---------84:18----------
agreed and and so i think that there's


---------84:20----------
actually something


---------84:21----------
in between those two states so on the


---------84:23----------
one hand there's like


---------84:24----------
the construction of can i be proud of my


---------84:27----------
life


---------84:28----------
and then on the other hand there's the


---------84:29----------
variant emotion of like transients


---------84:32----------
maybe it's not quite emotion i think


---------84:33----------
it's a little bit more than that but i


---------84:35----------
think that if you if you really pay


---------84:37----------
attention to buddhism and what that


---------84:38----------
sort of being content is like when you


---------84:41----------
talk about


---------84:42----------
being psychologically like let's say


---------84:43----------
grounded to the point or


---------84:45----------
yeah like you know tethered enough to


---------84:47----------
where the fluctuations of social media


---------84:50----------
which from a dopamine perspective


---------84:51----------
neuroscience perspective they're going


---------84:53----------
to knock you off track right it's the


---------84:55----------
equivalent of sailing in stormy seas


---------84:58----------
for your ego and your sense of like


---------85:00----------
happiness like that's just what it is


---------85:01----------
that's what social media does


---------85:02----------
that's why it's so successful because


---------85:04----------
they figured out how to like flip all


---------85:06----------
these switches in our brain


---------85:08----------
that you know make us creating content


---------85:13----------
and never quitting and giving a


---------85:16----------
wonderful experience to the user at the


---------85:18----------
sacrifice to ourself


---------85:19----------
and so i think finding that place of


---------85:21----------
buddha is actually there's something in


---------85:22----------
between which is actually a space of


---------85:24----------
detachment


---------85:26----------
where it's sort of like i know it sounds


---------85:27----------
kind of weird but like you know


---------85:29----------
acknowledging realism nope


---------85:32----------
not nihilism detachment and so this is


---------85:36----------
where


---------85:36----------
you know and i think it kind of comes


---------85:38----------
back to like when and i i think you will


---------85:39----------
probably understand this actually


---------85:41----------
so when you make some youtube content i


---------85:43----------
think there are a lot of different


---------85:45----------
drivers in your mind one is like the


---------85:48----------
entrepreneurial like how do i make


---------85:49----------
successful content


---------85:51----------
and then there are times though that i


---------85:52----------
think that you probably put out a piece


---------85:54----------
of con


---------85:55----------
or you've got conflicting things okay so


---------85:57----------
there's a tension between


---------85:58----------
what would be successful and like what


---------86:01----------
feels spiritually


---------86:02----------
or holistically like the right kind of


---------86:04----------
content there's some balance between


---------86:06----------
that


---------86:07----------
and and so i think if you think about


---------86:10----------
the spiritually


---------86:12----------
the when you lean towards the holistic


---------86:14----------
content


---------86:15----------
what you actually have to do is like


---------86:17----------
detach


---------86:18----------
from the consequences of what's gonna


---------86:21----------
happen with the content


---------86:22----------
when you make a piece of content you're


---------86:23----------
like this may not do very well but i'm


---------86:26----------
just gonna let that go


---------86:27----------
if it doesn't do so well it's actually


---------86:29----------
not that big of a deal


---------86:30----------
like i acknowledge it's gonna do well


---------86:33----------
i'm not gonna get bent out of shape that


---------86:34----------
it's not gonna


---------86:35----------
that it's gonna do well but i'm gonna do


---------86:37----------
this because it's like


---------86:38----------
aligned with my values and it's like


---------86:40----------
what i want to do does that make sense


---------86:42----------
absolutely and if i could just


---------86:46----------
like from here not to ruin your train of


---------86:48----------
thought really quickly


---------86:49----------
throw in here i think about that


---------86:53----------
a lot and i think about from a practical


---------86:56----------
perspective


---------86:58----------
what it would mean if i would switch and


---------87:00----------
just go


---------87:01----------
to making the content that pleases the


---------87:03----------
soul if you will


---------87:05----------
and i also think about how on a


---------87:08----------
practical sense what it means to survive


---------87:10----------
what it means to you know be financially


---------87:13----------
well off to be able to help others


---------87:15----------
and do all these things and i think


---------87:16----------
about the value that comes from perhaps


---------87:19----------
making


---------87:20----------
uh like a memes video that may be on


---------87:22----------
memes 28


---------87:23----------
i'm not so excited to do memes 29 but i


---------87:26----------
know that it'll bring in a ton of


---------87:27----------
viewers that will watch the meaningful


---------87:28----------
content that will then enrich their


---------87:30----------
lives


---------87:30----------
so i think all these things are kind of


---------87:33----------
i think content creators struggle with


---------87:34----------
this a lot


---------87:35----------
but here's the interesting thing if you


---------87:37----------
made content for the soul i think you'd


---------87:38----------
be unhappy


---------87:40----------
interesting okay so because here's the


---------87:42----------
important thing


---------87:43----------
it's not choosing content for the soul


---------87:47----------
or choosing content for success it is


---------87:49----------
the detachment from the decision that is


---------87:52----------
the source of happiness


---------87:55----------
i don't know if that makes sense but


---------87:56----------
like when you make content for the soul


---------87:58----------
it's not making content for the soul


---------88:00----------
that is actually the source of happiness


---------88:02----------
it's the internal process


---------88:03----------
that you go through to let go of the


---------88:06----------
successful content that is the source of


---------88:08----------
happiness


---------88:11----------
is that true does that like is it


---------88:13----------
possible


---------88:14----------
like i agree that that could be the case


---------88:16----------
could it also be the case


---------88:18----------
that there is a source of happiness that


---------88:20----------
it's you enjoy doing that for the soul


---------88:22----------
not just deciding not to do the other


---------88:24----------
thing


---------88:25----------
uh i know this is gonna sound weird


---------88:27----------
right it's gonna sound really weird what


---------88:29----------
i'm about to say


---------88:30----------
no so this is where and then this is


---------88:33----------
where we have to be really careful right


---------88:34----------
because i'm talking about


---------88:36----------
happiness as if it's true so what i'm


---------88:38----------
going to say like so let me qualify


---------88:40----------
that's


---------88:41----------
that statement okay so i think this is


---------88:43----------
the problem is because people like


---------88:44----------
do what they love right like and they


---------88:46----------
think that that's the source of


---------88:47----------
happiness that's not that's not how it


---------88:48----------
works


---------88:49----------
i think bizarrely happiness is actually


---------88:51----------
a relatively simple thing that


---------88:53----------
i think would like there's a reason we


---------88:55----------
kind of quote him right


---------88:56----------
because i think he figured it out and


---------88:58----------
the reason that


---------88:59----------
a religion cropped up around him is


---------89:02----------
because he actually like


---------89:03----------
actually figured it out in sort of a


---------89:05----------
scientific way


---------89:06----------
that what is the nature of happiness and


---------89:09----------
the nature of happiness is actually


---------89:10----------
detachment


---------89:12----------
and and you know if you kind of think a


---------89:13----------
little bit about why was it so hard for


---------89:16----------
your dad when your mom passed away


---------89:18----------
it's because he was so attached to all


---------89:21----------
of the things that they were going to do


---------89:24----------
right like and so it's kind of


---------89:26----------
interesting but if you think about you


---------89:27----------
know


---------89:29----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but like


---------89:31----------
the more you get tangled up with


---------89:33----------
something and i think you probably


---------89:34----------
understand this too because


---------89:35----------
it sounds like you've gone through the


---------89:37----------
process of disentangling yourself


---------89:39----------
from your social media identity like


---------89:42----------
over and over again


---------89:43----------
and so if we really think about it each


---------89:45----------
of those times if you look for a common


---------89:47----------
thread


---------89:48----------
i think what you're gonna see is that


---------89:49----------
you got caught up in it right like who


---------89:52----------
mike was mike wasn't over here


---------89:55----------
mike got taken over by dr mike and the


---------89:58----------
more that you get entangled with dr mike


---------90:01----------
you can be successful actually in both


---------90:03----------
situations but one of them is going to


---------90:05----------
come with suffering and one of them is


---------90:06----------
going to come without suffering


---------90:07----------
does that make sense yes


---------90:11----------
my pushback or question would be


---------90:16----------
first of all i would say i would venture


---------90:18----------
to say that there's probably not one


---------90:20----------
right way to live life like there's like


---------90:22----------
who is the ultimate judge of what


---------90:24----------
happiness is if someone finds happiness


---------90:26----------
in


---------90:27----------
not following a buddhist mentality they


---------90:30----------
could be doing the right thing for them


---------90:31----------
right so like i try not to judge other


---------90:33----------
people's definition of happiness


---------90:35----------
um when it comes to


---------90:39----------
attaching yourself to something and then


---------90:42----------
feeling tremendous sense of loss


---------90:44----------
like you mentioned with my father i


---------90:47----------
this is not based on any on any evidence


---------90:49----------
but perhaps


---------90:51----------
there is a layer of beauty in that that


---------90:54----------
is happiness


---------90:54----------
that is not defined by neurotransmitters


---------90:57----------
or


---------90:59----------
numbers on a happiness rating scale yeah


---------91:02----------
absolutely this is why detachment is


---------91:05----------
separate from the axis of emotion


---------91:07----------
right so like appreciating like you're


---------91:10----------
100 right and i think it's sort of like


---------91:12----------
is not actually i don't take that as


---------91:14----------
pushback


---------91:15----------
i think that point is actually exactly


---------91:17----------
what i'm trying to say


---------91:18----------
it's the distance from the thing the


---------91:21----------
loss you can feel sadness


---------91:23----------
and you can still find contentment and


---------91:25----------
happiness in sadness which is weird


---------91:27----------
so this is the axis that buddha was


---------91:29----------
talking about which is sort of like if


---------91:30----------
we think about watching sad movies right


---------91:32----------
so your


---------91:33----------
movie buff so if we think about the


---------91:35----------
experience of movies like have you seen


---------91:37----------
parasite


---------91:38----------
yes okay so like no spoilers but like


---------91:40----------
parasite is an emotional roller coaster


---------91:43----------
and the emotions that you feel are


---------91:46----------
largely negative


---------91:47----------
like they're not in the positive valence


---------91:49----------
you know it's not you know a story of


---------91:51----------
you know puppies and siberian huskies


---------91:54----------
and things like that it's like


---------91:56----------
it's emotionally brutal and yet


---------91:59----------
why do we enjoy it because the axis of


---------92:02----------
positive and negative emotion is is


---------92:04----------
separated


---------92:05----------
once we have that detachment to a


---------92:07----------
certain degree right right like


---------92:09----------
but yeah go you wanted to say something


---------92:11----------
about why it was no it's going to answer


---------92:12----------
your question of


---------92:13----------
like to me why we feel sadness watching


---------92:16----------
parasite


---------92:17----------
is the same reason we feel happy sorry


---------92:20----------
the reason we feel happiness after


---------92:22----------
watching parasite despite it being a sad


---------92:23----------
movie


---------92:24----------
is the same reason we feel happiness


---------92:26----------
after eating an incredibly


---------92:27----------
spicy pepper it's like you had this


---------92:30----------
potential threat


---------92:31----------
so the capsaicin attaches to your


---------92:34----------
receptors


---------92:35----------
you feel this pain the pain goes away


---------92:37----------
you realize


---------92:38----------
there was no damage endorphin rush


---------92:41----------
combined with surviving


---------92:43----------
this painful experience brings you


---------92:46----------
happiness


---------92:47----------
that's interesting so parasite


---------92:50----------
your brain functional mri is going off


---------92:52----------
and experiencing all these negative


---------92:54----------
things


---------92:54----------
the movie ends you realize you didn't go


---------92:56----------
through this horrible situation


---------92:58----------
and you feel better i also relate this


---------93:01----------
to


---------93:01----------
addiction with gambling you lose all of


---------93:04----------
your money


---------93:05----------
you've mortgaged your house you've lost


---------93:08----------
all this stuff


---------93:09----------
after you lose you realize you're still


---------93:11----------
alive


---------93:12----------
and life goes on you get an endorphin


---------93:15----------
rush and that is why frequently people


---------93:16----------
are addicted to gambling


---------93:17----------
and actually addicted to losing because


---------93:19----------
there's such a rush in losing and yet


---------93:21----------
still surviving


---------93:22----------
correct me if i run on that i'm gonna


---------93:24----------
have to think about that let me


---------93:26----------
see if you've tumbled down the entire


---------93:28----------
foundation of how i understand this


---------93:30----------
stuff


---------93:31----------
give me a second


---------93:40----------
i don't think so so here's here's what


---------93:42----------
i'll say


---------93:43----------
okay so i think what you've done a


---------93:45----------
beautiful job of doing is


---------93:47----------
illustrating the mechanism of like


---------93:49----------
rebound relief you know so there's an


---------93:51----------
interesting experiment i can't


---------93:52----------
think of the reference right off the top


---------93:53----------
of my head but i know i've got it


---------93:55----------
sitting on my google drive


---------93:56----------
so they took they took like you know 100


---------93:59----------
people


---------94:00----------
and they had them put their hand in cold


---------94:01----------
water and like the water was of


---------94:04----------
different temperatures so like it was


---------94:05----------
like painfully cold and then like even


---------94:08----------
more painfully cold


---------94:10----------
but the experiment that they looked at


---------94:12----------
was that you know it


---------94:13----------
if you have the most painful experience


---------94:16----------
like painfully cold water and they start


---------94:18----------
to warm it up at the end


---------94:21----------
and even though they never get to the


---------94:23----------
warm uh like


---------94:24----------
they never reach like the the less cold


---------94:26----------
water


---------94:28----------
people will rate that second experience


---------94:30----------
as more favorable than


---------94:32----------
absolutely being in warmer water so i


---------94:34----------
think there's


---------94:35----------
absolutely a principle that you're


---------94:37----------
tapping into which is like a


---------94:38----------
neuroscience mechanism


---------94:40----------
through which the relief of a negative


---------94:43----------
experience can be like reinforcing in


---------94:46----------
some way


---------94:46----------
with you i think that's very good point


---------94:48----------
from a neuroscience perspective


---------94:50----------
i still think though that that is a


---------94:52----------
mechanistic


---------94:54----------
neuroscientific thing that doesn't quite


---------94:57----------
translate if anything maybe i gave the


---------94:58----------
wrong example


---------95:00----------
but i think what i'm kind of talking


---------95:02----------
about is actually like a state of


---------95:04----------
consciousness or a state of mind it's a


---------95:06----------
perspective


---------95:08----------
that i think we can all experience that


---------95:09----------
essentially when we look at like the


---------95:11----------
the karmic religions they talk about


---------95:13----------
something called enlightenment


---------95:15----------
which is a state of persistent happiness


---------95:18----------
it's actually they don't use the word


---------95:20----------
happiness they use the word bliss


---------95:22----------
and so if you think about this


---------95:23----------
experience that has been described by


---------95:24----------
people like over and over and over again


---------95:26----------
there has been something of a scientific


---------95:28----------
study and this is where you kind of say


---------95:30----------
i try not to judge


---------95:31----------
and that's where i kind of say well like


---------95:33----------
i don't know if i really agree with that


---------95:35----------
because


---------95:35----------
as a scientist i do believe


---------95:39----------
as a scientist a psychiatrist and


---------95:41----------
studying some neuroscience


---------95:43----------
i do believe that happiness is while


---------95:45----------
there is an individual determination and


---------95:47----------
every person's life is different


---------95:49----------
i do think as a scientist that if you


---------95:51----------
study a hundred happy people


---------95:53----------
a hundred sad people that you will find


---------95:56----------
common elements that lead to this


---------95:59----------
experience that human beings have


---------96:02----------
and i think that like buddhism is


---------96:03----------
essentially i mean it's a religion


---------96:05----------
sure but it's essentially like a group


---------96:06----------
of people who sat down


---------96:08----------
and like studied the science of


---------96:10----------
happiness in a personal and individual


---------96:12----------
way


---------96:13----------
and it's been my experience that when


---------96:15----------
when i work with people that teaching


---------96:17----------
them this


---------96:18----------
like i don't think that i have had a


---------96:22----------
single person


---------96:24----------
who has not arrived at the same


---------96:26----------
conclusion if they have done the work


---------96:30----------
do you think that's that selection bias


---------96:31----------
at play like that they did the work


---------96:33----------
so we've pre-selected the people that


---------96:36----------
are going to do the work so these are


---------96:37----------
the people that are going to get the


---------96:38----------
benefit


---------96:40----------
absolutely it do i think it's selection


---------96:42----------
bias at play


---------96:43----------
no is it possible it's selection bias


---------96:45----------
absolutely


---------96:47----------
right so like this is where i would like


---------96:48----------
so let's let's you know let's think


---------96:50----------
about it


---------96:50----------
you know if i give someone antibiotics


---------96:52----------
for


---------96:54----------
let's not use strep throat let's say


---------96:55----------
pneumonia right


---------96:57----------
is it selection bias at play that the


---------97:00----------
like could selection bias


---------97:01----------
be at play it's studying the efficacy of


---------97:03----------
our antibiotics for pneumonia


---------97:06----------
of much lower likelihood because it's


---------97:08----------
randomized


---------97:10----------
and right behind it absolutely right so


---------97:13----------
like like it's much lower likelihood but


---------97:15----------
you know i would also argue that you


---------97:18----------
know it's unclear because we haven't


---------97:19----------
done well actually we sort of


---------97:20----------
hold on let me think about how to


---------97:22----------
respond to this


---------97:24----------
so as an individual practitioner by


---------97:26----------
definition


---------97:27----------
i'm going to have a lot more selection


---------97:28----------
bias than any rct


---------97:31----------
at the same time i think that you could


---------97:34----------
argue that a religious tradition has


---------97:36----------
selection bias to it


---------97:38----------
but i think it's really tricky because


---------97:40----------
when you have a sustainable


---------97:42----------
answer that generations of people have


---------97:45----------
found have been like successful


---------97:47----------
it's hard for me to tease apart what


---------97:49----------
part of that is selection bias


---------97:51----------
and what part of that is like an


---------97:53----------
actually correct


---------97:55----------
treatment it's like you're saying


---------97:58----------
i was gonna say like if you let's say


---------98:01----------
you have a cure


---------98:02----------
for pneumonia like 100 cure but the


---------98:05----------
compliance rate is only 5


---------98:07----------
with this treatment is that a successful


---------98:09----------
treatment


---------98:14----------
yeah how would you define it yeah so i


---------98:17----------
would call that a successful treatment


---------98:18----------
right the problem is in the compliance i


---------98:19----------
would


---------98:20----------
as a family medicine doctor i'm with you


---------98:22----------
and i think that's fair because i think


---------98:24----------
you have to bake in compliance but this


---------98:25----------
is where so also as like you know as a


---------98:28----------
psychiatrist


---------98:30----------
i i mean i i'm with you i i completely


---------98:33----------
understand i still remember in my first


---------98:34----------
pharmacology lecture


---------98:36----------
they were like any monkey can prescribe


---------98:37----------
blood pressure medication


---------98:39----------
it takes a doctor to get a patient to


---------98:41----------
take it


---------98:42----------
when they have to wake up twice in the


---------98:43----------
middle of the night to go pee


---------98:45----------
that's the job the real doctor's job of


---------98:47----------
a doctor is compliance


---------98:49----------
and this is also where like if you think


---------98:50----------
about as a psychiatrist i get that as a


---------98:52----------
fm doc but like if you think about


---------98:54----------
what do i treat what i treat is the


---------98:57----------
compliance issue


---------98:58----------
i don't treat them you know like 90 i'm


---------99:01----------
an addiction psychiatrist


---------99:02----------
all you know my treatment is focused on


---------99:04----------
compliance


---------99:06----------
so if we think about you know meditation


---------99:07----------
is an effective treatment like is


---------99:09----------
meditation and effective


---------99:10----------
treatment to reduce negative symptoms of


---------99:12----------
schizophrenia


---------99:14----------
yes is it hard to get people


---------99:17----------
to meditate is it an effective holistic


---------99:19----------
intervention


---------99:21----------
possibly not but if we look at the


---------99:23----------
actual treatment


---------99:24----------
does it work yes and i'm with you that


---------99:28----------
that an intervention and this is where


---------99:30----------
maybe i'd qualify a little bit


---------99:32----------
that the interventional intervention


---------99:34----------
globally may not be effective if it only


---------99:36----------
has a five percent compliance rate


---------99:38----------
but is the is is the tree well you know


---------99:41----------
i'd so i'd separate out those two things


---------99:42----------
and i'd say that that's where like


---------99:44----------
90 of the work that i do is getting


---------99:46----------
people to be compliant


---------99:49----------
yeah like for me we have such great


---------99:51----------
evidence behind


---------99:53----------
you know behavioral therapy uh it


---------99:55----------
working sometimes as well


---------99:56----------
uh as anti-depressant medications


---------99:59----------
usually


---------100:00----------
rest in tandem obviously when you look


---------100:02----------
at the evidence


---------100:04----------
but let's think about it from my


---------100:06----------
perspective as a family medicine doctor


---------100:08----------
i have a patient who comes in and is


---------100:10----------
experiencing depressive symptoms and i


---------100:12----------
diagnose them with major depressive


---------100:13----------
disorder


---------100:14----------
a lot of my patients suffer with low


---------100:16----------
motivation levels they struggle to


---------100:18----------
shower to get out of bed


---------100:19----------
to go to work to take care of their


---------100:21----------
family to enjoy things that once brought


---------100:23----------
them pleasure


---------100:24----------
although what you see on a commercial


---------100:26----------
for pharma ad


---------100:28----------
and these patients are suffering i then


---------100:32----------
give them a referral to see you or a


---------100:34----------
psychologist and now they have to be


---------100:37----------
motivated enough to call the number on


---------100:38----------
the back of their insurance


---------100:40----------
get five providers one who's no longer


---------100:43----------
taking new patients one who's no longer


---------100:44----------
in network one who has a six month


---------100:46----------
waiting period


---------100:47----------
and we we then say these individuals


---------100:50----------
who end up finding this care do well


---------100:54----------
how do we study the people that have


---------100:57----------
never even got in


---------100:58----------
and i don't know maybe they would have


---------101:00----------
had the same impact as the people who


---------101:02----------
got in


---------101:02----------
but to me when i look at the individuals


---------101:04----------
that i help


---------101:06----------
a lot of times i'm only helping the


---------101:07----------
people who actually end up getting the


---------101:09----------
motivation to go for these treatments


---------101:11----------
so how do we sort of merge those two


---------101:15----------
groups


---------101:15----------
yeah so this is where i think this


---------101:17----------
conversation is changing a little bit


---------101:19----------
which i love


---------101:19----------
so this is where like i'm a big fan of


---------101:21----------
like meeting people where


---------101:23----------
they're at so i think the biggest


---------101:25----------
problem in medicine what you're the


---------101:26----------
problem you're describing and if we talk


---------101:28----------
about


---------101:28----------
if a treatment works a hundred percent


---------101:30----------
of the time but only five percent of


---------101:31----------
people


---------101:32----------
do it i think that's the problem that


---------101:33----------
needs to be fixed


---------101:35----------
right so the question is like and this


---------101:37----------
is the problem with the rct


---------101:39----------
because like this is this is why like i


---------101:41----------
know that in western medicine the rct is


---------101:42----------
the gold standard treatment i think it's


---------101:44----------
a terrible standard of treatment


---------101:46----------
i think it's the fact that the rct is


---------101:48----------
the gold standard


---------101:49----------
of what we use in medicine creates these


---------101:51----------
problems


---------101:52----------
because the whole point behind an rct


---------101:54----------
which is a randomized controlled trial


---------101:56----------
is that it removes all of the


---------102:00----------
like real world or the real world from


---------102:01----------
the equation well so when you test


---------102:03----------
versus effectiveness right so so this is


---------102:05----------
where like in psychiatry we


---------102:07----------
there's actually a couple of really


---------102:08----------
great studies that are naturalistic


---------102:10----------
studies


---------102:11----------
so what they did is they followed


---------102:12----------
patients over time


---------102:14----------
and like put them on certain medications


---------102:16----------
and they actually


---------102:17----------
factored in like if this medication has


---------102:19----------
this side effect


---------102:21----------
what's the likelihood that the person


---------102:23----------
will stop taking it


---------102:25----------
and so i personally i've found the


---------102:28----------
naturalistic studies to actually be


---------102:29----------
superior to rcts in this way because it


---------102:32----------
mirrors a real world thing where we're


---------102:33----------
following patients


---------102:35----------
we're giving them something like


---------102:36----------
clozapine right and then like sure it's


---------102:39----------
the most effective drug for like


---------102:40----------
schizophrenia


---------102:42----------
but it also causes people to like drool


---------102:44----------
constantly


---------102:46----------
and gain 200 pounds and so how effective


---------102:50----------
is it


---------102:50----------
in in the real world like i think that's


---------102:52----------
a better way to study it and this is


---------102:53----------
where i think if we want to solve that


---------102:55----------
problem like that's sort of why we you


---------102:56----------
know a lot of people like will criticize


---------102:58----------
us and i think that


---------102:59----------
criticism is fair that we offer like


---------103:01----------
mental health support services at


---------103:02----------
healthy gamer like we help parents and


---------103:04----------
we help people but we do it as coaching


---------103:06----------
instead of therapy


---------103:07----------
and what's part of the reason for that


---------103:08----------
it's because there are so many barriers


---------103:11----------
and like we actually try to meet people


---------103:14----------
where they're


---------103:14----------
at which is i think how you fix it right


---------103:17----------
so you're right that the 95


---------103:19----------
compliance issue is the big problem so


---------103:21----------
how do you fix that


---------103:22----------
i think it's like stepping away from the


---------103:24----------
rct


---------103:26----------
the reason i brought it up even to bring


---------103:28----------
us back to the previous conversation the


---------103:30----------
tie-in that i saw


---------103:31----------
was we're talking about this very


---------103:36----------
difficult to grasp concept for most


---------103:38----------
myself included


---------103:39----------
of being detached but not detached


---------103:42----------
emotionally as you described in the


---------103:43----------
buddhist model


---------103:45----------
how do we get there in a way that is


---------103:48----------
compatible


---------103:49----------
and practical with our current everyday


---------103:51----------
life when we are not living


---------103:53----------
on a mountaintop without distractions


---------103:55----------
without this thing constantly going off


---------103:57----------
great great question and so this is


---------103:59----------
where the answer is going to be weird


---------104:01----------
and you're 100 right it's actually not


---------104:04----------
compatible


---------104:06----------
you can't actually do both okay so this


---------104:09----------
is this is this is the story of buddha


---------104:10----------
right so like


---------104:11----------
buddha was a prince and he was wealthy


---------104:14----------
and powerful and all this other crap and


---------104:17----------
he was unhappy


---------104:19----------
and then like in his journey he first


---------104:21----------
like he just


---------104:22----------
peaced out like he left his wife left


---------104:25----------
his infant son


---------104:26----------
and just went on this journey of


---------104:28----------
self-fulfillment and then like


---------104:30----------
decades later he's he's going back


---------104:32----------
through his his capital city former


---------104:33----------
capital city because he gave up his


---------104:35----------
kingdom


---------104:35----------
he's walking down the street and he sees


---------104:37----------
his wife and his kid


---------104:39----------
and his wife lets him have it she's like


---------104:41----------
you piece of


---------104:42----------
you abandoned us you left you have a


---------104:44----------
responsibility to your child


---------104:46----------
you gave it all up you suck at life and


---------104:49----------
she's right


---------104:50----------
right and then so he says you know


---------104:52----------
you're right i do have a responsibility


---------104:54----------
it's my job to pass on what i understand


---------104:57----------
to my child


---------104:58----------
so he shows his wife his bagging bowl


---------105:00----------
and she's he's like let me make


---------105:02----------
up for it you've had him for 20 years


---------105:03----------
i'll take him for the next 20 years


---------105:05----------
we'll wander around india i'll have my


---------105:07----------
begging bowl and i'll teach him


---------105:09----------
everything that that i i'll do my


---------105:10----------
father's duty and she's like uh-uh


---------105:13----------
no no you crazy he's a prince there's no


---------105:15----------
way i would let him


---------105:16----------
follow around your broke ass the first


---------105:18----------
thing though it's it's interesting mike


---------105:20----------
because you're right it's not actually


---------105:21----------
compatible


---------105:22----------
if we really talk about true


---------105:24----------
enlightenment it's not in a sense


---------105:26----------
compatible with regular life if


---------105:30----------
you are if you are measuring by the


---------105:33----------
level of accomplishment of regular life


---------105:35----------
so for example if you were enlightened


---------105:38----------
would you be as successful of a youtuber


---------105:41----------
as you


---------105:41----------
are jury's still out


---------105:45----------
theoretically i think you can make a


---------105:46----------
strong case and i won't argue against


---------105:48----------
you that the answer is going to be no


---------105:50----------
in my experience so and this is where


---------105:52----------
things get really down the rabbit hole


---------105:54----------
is that the more personally detached


---------105:57----------
i've become the more


---------105:58----------
i realized so i was planning on becoming


---------105:59----------
a monk like i studied to become a monk


---------106:01----------
for a few years


---------106:02----------
and then decided to not do that


---------106:05----------
and then ultimately realize that like


---------106:07----------
being a monk is not about living on a


---------106:08----------
mountaintop it's like all


---------106:10----------
internal and so whether i'm married or


---------106:12----------
not married or


---------106:13----------
you know whether i enjoy you know like


---------106:17----------
soda i like it's all the work is


---------106:20----------
entirely internal and there i've i've


---------106:22----------
found really promising results


---------106:24----------
that you can learn to be detached and


---------106:26----------
because mike i think you've done it dude


---------106:27----------
you've


---------106:28----------
dis-intake like you've been wrapped up


---------106:29----------
in it right and as you disentangle


---------106:32----------
yourself the really bizarre thing is


---------106:33----------
that i think you will actually become


---------106:34----------
more successful


---------106:36----------
because these things as you become aware


---------106:38----------
and detached like this is where i


---------106:40----------
got to say this to you like i think it's


---------106:42----------
amazing that you're


---------106:43----------
you identify as a person who's got to


---------106:47----------
work through can't


---------106:48----------
and it's responsible for so much of your


---------106:50----------
success


---------106:51----------
and it's become maladaptive the higher


---------106:53----------
you go that which is adaptive


---------106:55----------
starts to become maladaptive which is a


---------106:56----------
beautiful lesson that you've learned


---------106:59----------
and so like if we really kind of think


---------107:01----------
about it like


---------107:02----------
as you start to detach i think you'll


---------107:04----------
actually become more successful because


---------107:05----------
i think


---------107:06----------
some of those ways that you view


---------107:08----------
yourself you say to yourself


---------107:10----------
i am not going to be some i'm not going


---------107:12----------
to let my dad down like he taught me


---------107:13----------
these


---------107:14----------
really important lessons he taught me


---------107:15----------
all these things and that's who i


---------107:17----------
am and the higher you go the more that's


---------107:20----------
going to cause you problems


---------107:22----------
and bizarrely like those helped you they


---------107:24----------
helped you become a national taekwondo


---------107:25----------
champion


---------107:26----------
they helped you become one of the most


---------107:27----------
successful medical influencers


---------107:29----------
in the history of medical influencers


---------107:32----------
and at the same time the next step


---------107:34----------
up is actually like pulling away from


---------107:35----------
some of those things


---------107:38----------
and as you become detached i think i


---------107:39----------
know it sounds weird and then you ask


---------107:40----------
the question you asked me a question


---------107:42----------
which is


---------107:42----------
how do you do that and there are ways so


---------107:44----------
we can go into that but i want to


---------107:46----------
i want to give you a chance the


---------107:48----------
mysterious ways


---------107:49----------
no they're not they're not that


---------107:50----------
mysterious it's just i i wanted to pause


---------107:52----------
for a second give you a chance to


---------107:53----------
respond


---------107:54----------
you know disagree no agree and i think


---------107:57----------
this we're coming to this similar


---------107:58----------
conclusion that i did when i was doing


---------108:00----------
my therapy


---------108:01----------
which is you know you call detached she


---------108:03----------
called a disconnect


---------108:05----------
it's all aiming towards the same


---------108:06----------
principle uh you know we get caught up


---------108:08----------
in nomenclature in science probably too


---------108:10----------
often


---------108:11----------
um so i completely agree and i think


---------108:14----------
i've already seen the benefits of doing


---------108:16----------
therapy and disconnecting some and


---------108:18----------
watching a video underperform and not


---------108:21----------
have it affect me negatively be like oh


---------108:22----------
yeah that sucks but let's figure out the


---------108:24----------
next one or


---------108:25----------
what what's my take away from this so


---------108:26----------
that we can learn from it


---------108:28----------
so yeah i absolutely think that that is


---------108:31----------
the case


---------108:32----------
um to me thinking it in a bigger picture


---------108:34----------
sense like


---------108:35----------
the concept of mindfulness or like


---------108:38----------
meditation


---------108:39----------
i've tried with a like me being a person


---------108:42----------
who's


---------108:43----------
tried a lot and accomplished a lot the


---------108:45----------
failure i have with mindfulness


---------108:47----------
and like sitting and breathing and doing


---------108:50----------
this


---------108:52----------
is like insane like how much failure


---------108:54----------
i've had with it


---------108:56----------
so it's not to say that no one can do it


---------108:59----------
it's just to say as someone who's i


---------109:01----------
consider myself a dedicated person


---------109:03----------
i cannot for the life of me do this i


---------109:05----------
start wondering is this a practical


---------109:07----------
solution for most people


---------109:09----------
the answer is absolutely yes so let me


---------109:11----------
ask you a question


---------109:12----------
right so you are are you working like uh


---------109:16----------
do you work in an academic setting or


---------109:18----------
like community setting


---------109:20----------
like you guys are residents and stuff


---------109:21----------
rotating yes so like i have i'm in a


---------109:23----------
community health center but i work with


---------109:25----------
residents


---------109:26----------
i actually have a resident shadowing me


---------109:27----------
right now for this perfect youtube


---------109:29----------
channel so if we think about it like if


---------109:30----------
you have a dedicated student


---------109:33----------
who's smart driven focused and they're


---------109:36----------
not learning medicine


---------109:38----------
where's the problem


---------109:42----------
maybe they don't want to learn medicine


---------109:44----------
no they do want to learn medicine


---------109:45----------
they're trying really hard


---------109:47----------
you know it's kind of weird medicine's


---------109:48----------
not for them no medicine could be for


---------109:52----------
that's what they would think right


---------109:53----------
that's exactly what the person would


---------109:54----------
think and that's exactly what you think


---------109:55----------
about mindfulness


---------109:57----------
it's not for me that's what i'm hearing


---------109:58----------
from you so i'm with you there


---------110:00----------
but the fault is with the teacher


---------110:04----------
so if you've got all the right stuff


---------110:06----------
right you're driven you're focused


---------110:08----------
you're dedicated


---------110:09----------
like whose fault is it it's the


---------110:10----------
attending's fault if they're not


---------110:11----------
learning medicine


---------110:13----------
and so this is where like i turn to you


---------110:15----------
and i'd say i completely get where


---------110:17----------
you're coming from because this is what


---------110:18----------
i hear


---------110:18----------
time and time and time again i suck at


---------110:21----------
meditation meditation's not for me and


---------110:24----------
that's where i'd say like


---------110:25----------
how qualified are your teachers


---------110:28----------
how did you try to learn yeah i've self


---------110:31----------
tried to self learn well there you go


---------110:34----------
right so like


---------110:35----------
meditation is something that


---------110:37----------
traditionally has been taught


---------110:39----------
by very qualified teachers and so i


---------110:41----------
don't think you're bad at meditation i i


---------110:44----------
gotta say this mike and this could


---------110:45----------
could also be a selection bias like


---------110:49----------
95 of people who i teach meditation to


---------110:53----------
first of all half i'm successful in


---------110:56----------
teaching meditation


---------110:57----------
to 95 of people that i work with half of


---------111:00----------
them feel like meditation is not


---------111:02----------
for them the first time they come into


---------111:03----------
my office and the reason


---------111:06----------
is because they don't have good teachers


---------111:10----------
and the reason is because we have a


---------111:11----------
propagation of meditation resources


---------111:14----------
without meditation teachers the reason


---------111:17----------
is because people meditation


---------111:18----------
teachers are taught in one tradition


---------111:21----------
right so like how do you become a


---------111:22----------
certified meditation teacher


---------111:23----------
you go to a particular person you learn


---------111:25----------
their particular branch of meditation


---------111:27----------
and then they are the their any to any


---------111:30----------
student comes to them they say


---------111:31----------
this is the the way to meditate and if a


---------111:34----------
teacher says this is the way to meditate


---------111:36----------
and it's not suited to your cognitive


---------111:38----------
fingerprint


---------111:39----------
then the student walks away thinking i


---------111:42----------
suck at meditation


---------111:43----------
and meditation is not for me because


---------111:45----------
look at this like


---------111:46----------
you know tibetan monk


---------111:49----------
who's like an expert on meditation if


---------111:52----------
they're such a good teacher


---------111:53----------
that like people don't acknowledge that


---------111:55----------
there are different traditions of


---------111:56----------
meditation it's sort of like if we force


---------111:58----------
you to become a surgeon


---------111:59----------
you would think that you were bad at


---------112:00----------
medicine but the whole point is that


---------112:02----------
like


---------112:03----------
you're an fm doc through and through


---------112:05----------
right and so like becoming a successful


---------112:07----------
doctor


---------112:08----------
has to do with the tradition that you're


---------112:10----------
trained in in the tradition that you


---------112:12----------
practice within


---------112:13----------
as opposed to like you know you're not a


---------112:15----------
bad doctor it's just if we force you to


---------112:17----------
become a surgeon


---------112:19----------
like does that make sense


---------112:23----------
it does um the question that i have


---------112:26----------
is um if we like for example


---------112:30----------
maybe not me let's say i have a friend


---------112:33----------
he's five foot one


---------112:34----------
and he he wants to play basketball and


---------112:38----------
by your methods any teacher a a good


---------112:41----------
teacher would be able to teach him how


---------112:42----------
to play basketball very


---------112:44----------
well but genetically he's slow he's


---------112:46----------
clumsy


---------112:48----------
he can't play on a even moderately


---------112:51----------
competitive level no matter how great


---------112:52----------
the teacher is that's


---------112:54----------
physical limitation yep


---------112:58----------
for me i feel like when i uh practice


---------113:01----------
meditation


---------113:02----------
i can pick up on it and i've gotten some


---------113:04----------
benefit from it absolutely i see it


---------113:06----------
but maybe i'm not the one that's going


---------113:08----------
to be the collegiate meditator


---------113:10----------
does that absolutely absolutely so but


---------113:12----------
but listen the five


---------113:13----------
the five foot one guy can learn how to


---------113:15----------
play basketball hundred percent can


---------113:17----------
learn how to play basketball


---------113:19----------
he may never be in the decide what to do


---------113:21----------
with it right so like but i feel like


---------113:23----------
i've learned what meditation is


---------113:25----------
how to sort of do it but then like it


---------113:28----------
didn't give me enough value to continue


---------113:30----------
doing it is that without visible


---------113:31----------
absolutely right so it may not be for


---------113:34----------
you like you can teach a five foot one


---------113:36----------
person how to play basketball you can


---------113:37----------
100 do that


---------113:39----------
i'm not saying they're gonna enjoy it


---------113:40----------
i'm not saying they're gonna play in the


---------113:41----------
mba


---------113:43----------
and enlightenment of buddhism like to


---------113:45----------
have meditation and mindfulness part of


---------113:47----------
it is that intertwined with it


---------113:50----------
sort of the solution no sort of


---------113:53----------
but let's think about a couple of


---------113:55----------
distinctions in the analogy


---------113:56----------
the goal of teaching you meditation is


---------113:59----------
not to get you to play in the nba


---------114:01----------
enlightenment is not for everyone not


---------114:03----------
everyone is temperamentally


---------114:04----------
appropriate to it so when i work with


---------114:06----------
someone who's got down syndrome


---------114:08----------
and i teach them meditation my goals are


---------114:11----------
different from if i work for you


---------114:12----------
with you right so like like the kind of


---------114:15----------
meditation


---------114:16----------
that i'm not going to teach it's not one


---------114:19----------
standard for all people


---------114:21----------
which is the problem with the nba


---------114:22----------
analogy and i think may actually be your


---------114:24----------
problem with meditation


---------114:25----------
because what you're doing is if you


---------114:27----------
really pay attention


---------114:28----------
you're setting an objective standard and


---------114:31----------
you say i


---------114:32----------
suck at meditation because i am not able


---------114:34----------
to live up to the objective standard


---------114:36----------
that's the problem because you're


---------114:38----------
meditating against an objective standard


---------114:40----------
instead of meditating to like like meet


---------114:44----------
you where you're at


---------114:45----------
it's it's right back to like you know


---------114:47----------
recommending therapy to a patient


---------114:49----------
because there's an objective standard


---------114:50----------
that's rct supported


---------114:52----------
evidence-based works here's the referral


---------114:54----------
and it doesn't go anywhere


---------114:55----------
the same problem with you because you're


---------114:57----------
saying oh i should get this out of


---------114:59----------
meditation this is the way that i should


---------115:01----------
meditate


---------115:01----------
isn't it supposed to do this forget all


---------115:03----------
that crap


---------115:05----------
if you want to learn how to meditate we


---------115:07----------
start you got


---------115:08----------
a few more minutes yeah i do


---------115:11----------
okay can i can i give it a shot


---------115:15----------
okay okay so the first question is why


---------115:17----------
do you want to meditate


---------115:19----------
to reach a state of detachment


---------115:22----------
with an emotional component still


---------115:30----------
present


---------115:40----------
okay so


---------115:46----------
okay so i feel like i'm the riddler


---------115:50----------
right now


---------115:50----------
oh no on the contrary you just dug


---------115:52----------
yourself into the biggest pit you ever


---------115:54----------
could


---------115:54----------
okay so this is what i want you to do


---------115:56----------
you want to feel an emotion


---------115:58----------
and be detached from it


---------116:02----------
you want practice at that you want me to


---------116:04----------
teach you how to do that yeah


---------116:06----------
i want you to be a shitty meditator i


---------116:07----------
want you to meditate every day


---------116:09----------
i want you to feel like a failure i want


---------116:11----------
you to feel like this doesn't work


---------116:13----------
this doesn't help i'm doing it wrong and


---------116:15----------
i want you to separate


---------116:16----------
so you we can pick any meditation


---------116:19----------
technique


---------116:20----------
and it's perfect because all you're


---------116:24----------
going to do is you're going to practice


---------116:26----------
feeling like a bad meditator


---------116:31----------
so anyway go up to 100 uh


---------116:34----------
you know women ask them for their phone


---------116:36----------
numbers get rejected by all of them and


---------116:38----------
then you get okay with rejection and you


---------116:39----------
have no fear to talk to anybody else


---------116:42----------
i think there's some overlap but if


---------116:44----------
we're really talking about what


---------116:45----------
meditation


---------116:46----------
is if you want to practice something if


---------116:48----------
you want to practice being detached from


---------116:50----------
something


---------116:52----------
i'm going to this is what we're


---------116:53----------
literally going to do i'm going to teach


---------116:54----------
you one meditation technique that you're


---------116:56----------
bad at


---------116:57----------
you'll ask god for patience and god


---------116:59----------
gives you the most frustrating


---------117:00----------
situations over and over


---------117:02----------
that's what you're giving me so


---------117:05----------
you're gonna you're gonna do any kind of


---------117:07----------
meditation that you've learned that you


---------117:08----------
suck at


---------117:09----------
then what we're gonna do is notice the


---------117:11----------
feeling of sucking at it


---------117:14----------
then i'm gonna give you a quick


---------117:15----------
breathing practice and you're just gonna


---------117:17----------
sit with it all


---------117:20----------
and like i know it sounds kind of weird


---------117:21----------
but the worse you feel like you're


---------117:24----------
doing at it just notice oh see how bad i


---------117:26----------
am


---------117:28----------
see how much it isn't working and i know


---------117:30----------
it sounds kind of weird


---------117:32----------
but the more you're able to see because


---------117:34----------
what happens is if you get tangled up


---------117:36----------
in being bad at it you're not going to


---------117:38----------
be detached you're going to be attached


---------117:40----------
does that make sense yeah how do you


---------117:42----------
find the motivation to continue doing


---------117:44----------
something you're bad at that's


---------117:45----------
my question very good so this is the


---------117:49----------
perfect technique for you


---------117:51----------
right so like like this is where and the


---------117:54----------
short answer is that you


---------117:55----------
you become detached because if you're


---------117:57----------
detached whether you're good or you're


---------117:59----------
bad doesn't matter like the five foot


---------118:00----------
one guy


---------118:01----------
who plays basketball how does someone


---------118:03----------
who's five foot one play basketball


---------118:05----------
they let go of being in the nba who


---------118:07----------
cares if i'm a failure


---------118:09----------
i just love shooting hoops man that's


---------118:11----------
how you do it you detach


---------118:13----------
that's what i'm saying it's like the


---------118:14----------
actual answer to your question it's the


---------118:15----------
actual answer to happiness


---------118:18----------
how do you find the motivation you let


---------118:19----------
go of the success


---------118:21----------
and you do it for the sake of the thing


---------118:23----------
because you enjoy doing it


---------118:27----------
not the five or one gentleman is


---------118:29----------
enjoying learning how to play basketball


---------118:31----------
as opposed to making a goal to play


---------118:33----------
in the nba and so it's it's a chicken or


---------118:37----------
egg thing because as he


---------118:38----------
lets go of the


---------118:41----------
goal to play in the nba he will enjoy


---------118:44----------
the basketball more


---------118:47----------
see that's that's the thing i need


---------118:49----------
proven to me yep


---------118:50----------
because you're saying by saying i will


---------118:53----------
get nothing from meditation or i will


---------118:54----------
fail at meditation


---------118:56----------
starting with like a really low set


---------118:57----------
point like almost a negative set point


---------118:59----------
of expectation i will then start


---------119:02----------
enjoying it


---------119:04----------
only one way to find out okay


---------119:08----------
yeah i mean yeah no this is tricky you


---------119:10----------
have to be really tricky here okay


---------119:11----------
because


---------119:12----------
if you say to yourself it won't work


---------119:14----------
mike if you say to yourself


---------119:16----------
oh i'm going to start enjoying this by


---------119:18----------
suffering through it it's not going to


---------119:20----------
work


---------119:22----------
because you're good at that right you're


---------119:24----------
good at making temporary sacrifices for


---------119:25----------
success in the end


---------119:26----------
no no no you're going to fail if you do


---------119:28----------
that so what do i do


---------119:31----------
you have to do it with knowing it'll


---------119:33----------
never work


---------119:36----------
you have to you can't trick yourself


---------119:37----------
because that's it's gonna be the same


---------119:38----------
 thing


---------119:39----------
because then what's gonna happen is


---------119:40----------
you're gonna you're gonna start to


---------119:41----------
meditate you're saying it's not to work


---------119:43----------
but i'm going to start


---------119:44----------
enjoying it at some point i'm going to


---------119:45----------
walk up to 100 girls


---------119:47----------
and and then i'll get good at it because


---------119:48----------
in the back your mind you're going to


---------119:49----------
know i'm going to get good at it


---------119:51----------
and then what's going to feel like a


---------119:52----------
failure you're going to do it 100 times


---------119:54----------
and you're not going to be good at it


---------119:55----------
and then you're going to feel like a


---------119:56----------
failure oh it's not working it's not


---------119:57----------
working it was supposed to work but it's


---------119:58----------
not working it's not working it's not


---------120:00----------
working


---------120:00----------
so you see what i'm saying there you


---------120:02----------
gotta be careful sneaky sneaky


---------120:04----------
i i understand the the complexity of it


---------120:06----------
it just


---------120:07----------
to me it's i i'm gonna try i'm honestly


---------120:10----------
gonna give it a try uh


---------120:12----------
to me it sounds like there's like knobs


---------120:14----------
like okay turn down expectation


---------120:16----------
turn down expectation of not having an


---------120:18----------
expectation


---------120:19----------
and it's like i don't like who i don't


---------120:21----------
know like i don't i don't think i have


---------120:22----------
that good control over my


---------120:24----------
mental state but i'll try yes you


---------120:26----------
understand it perfectly mike


---------120:28----------
and when you can turn down knobs all the


---------120:30----------
way to infinity


---------120:31----------
that is enlightenment yeah i mean i'm


---------120:34----------
more than willing to try it


---------120:36----------
okay so now you're gonna teach us some


---------120:40----------
meditation okay


---------120:41----------
you get it you get it bro you're you're


---------120:43----------
on this you you're you're good


---------120:45----------
you figured it out seriously i'm i'm


---------120:47----------
very optimistic for you


---------120:48----------
it's gonna suck i'm sorry and it's not


---------120:51----------
gonna amount to anything


---------120:54----------
see but i know you're lying you know


---------120:56----------
it's gonna amount to something


---------120:57----------
no i don't i don't you do i heard you i


---------121:01----------
heard you give the intellectual


---------121:02----------
statement earlier no because because as


---------121:04----------
long no no no because


---------121:06----------
as long as you believe that i think it's


---------121:08----------
going to be successful


---------121:09----------
you think it's going to be successful


---------121:10----------
and then it's going to fail


---------121:12----------
so it's not going to do i lie to myself


---------121:15----------
nope


---------121:15----------
you just do the practice and then you


---------121:18----------
practice you notice


---------121:20----------
like the more knobs you see the better


---------121:22----------
you're gonna get at it


---------121:24----------
okay okay and then i'm actually tricking


---------121:28----------
you into a completely different


---------121:29----------
direction but we'll


---------121:30----------
worry about that later okay so this is


---------121:33----------
what i want you to do i want you to just


---------121:34----------
share with us


---------121:36----------
yeah a meditation practice that you've


---------121:38----------
tried you're doing great bro


---------121:40----------
love it um like uh just anything


---------121:44----------
four four second inhale eight second


---------121:46----------
exhale


---------121:47----------
diaphragmatic breathing beautiful okay


---------121:50----------
so what we're gonna do


---------121:52----------
is let me just think for a second


---------122:01----------
okay so this is what we're gonna do all


---------122:04----------
right


---------122:04----------
so we're gonna do four seconds of


---------122:06----------
inhalation followed by eight seconds of


---------122:08----------
exhalation we're gonna do like let's say


---------122:11----------
five


---------122:12----------
rounds of that and what i want you to do


---------122:15----------
as you're breathing is notice that there


---------122:18----------
may be thoughts in your mind


---------122:20----------
of this isn't working or this doesn't


---------122:21----------
feel like working or whatever


---------122:24----------
and then as you notice those thoughts


---------122:26----------
just like notice them like


---------122:28----------
prepare for it right it's like this


---------122:30----------
person's got an sd elevation


---------122:32----------
on the ekg when i look at the echo this


---------122:35----------
is what i'm going to be looking for


---------122:36----------
right


---------122:36----------
so we're going to like look for it and


---------122:38----------
then as it arises you're just going to


---------122:40----------
see it


---------122:42----------
and then after the five rounds of


---------122:45----------
breathing


---------122:46----------
i want you to see how long the feeling


---------122:49----------
of


---------122:50----------
this is a waste of my time i'm not doing


---------122:52----------
it right


---------122:53----------
this will work in the end just see how


---------122:55----------
how long those feelings kind of last


---------122:59----------
and then what i want you to do is try to


---------123:01----------
find the moment


---------123:03----------
where inhalation becomes exhalation


---------123:08----------
after the five rounds after the five


---------123:12----------
rounds


---------123:14----------
uh-huh i'm not sure i grasp what that


---------123:17----------
means


---------123:18----------
that's that's good so like you know we


---------123:21----------
have an


---------123:21----------
inhalation and then we have an


---------123:22----------
exhalation right you can observe that


---------123:25----------
there's a period of time where you're


---------123:26----------
inhaling and you can observe


---------123:28----------
the time that you're exhaling and in


---------123:31----------
between that


---------123:32----------
as long as you don't hold your breath


---------123:34----------
there's gonna be like a moment where one


---------123:36----------
becomes the next


---------123:37----------
and i want you to try to catch that


---------123:40----------
moment okay


---------123:42----------
okay hey you want me just now


---------123:45----------
yeah let's do it now we're gonna do it


---------123:47----------
together so can you count for us


---------123:49----------
like for the first round like show us i


---------123:52----------
i like to do it mentally but i guess i


---------123:53----------

---------123:54----------
okay okay okay then do it mentally can i


---------123:56----------

---------123:57----------

---------124:00----------

---------124:01----------

---------124:03----------
uh i'll count the first round and then


---------124:05----------
continue i'm fine with it if you prefer


---------124:08----------
it that way


---------124:10----------
let me just think about how i want to do


---------124:12----------
this no we're going to do just the first


---------124:14----------
one


---------124:15----------
okay okay this is what i do to my


---------124:17----------
patients


---------124:18----------
when i want to check their reflexes on


---------124:19----------
their knee and they won't let me do it


---------124:21----------
so i make them


---------124:22----------
pull their hands up and look up at the


---------124:23----------
ceiling and then their reflexes come


---------124:24----------
back


---------124:25----------
that's what you're doing to me it's a


---------124:27----------
scene right through me


---------124:29----------
okay all right so


---------124:33----------
i've met my match okay so we're gonna


---------124:36----------
we're gonna just take start


---------124:38----------
with just take a moment to feel the


---------124:39----------
weight of your body in the chair


---------124:48----------
okay so now we're gonna take a deep


---------124:49----------
breath in expanding your diaphragm


---------124:51----------
pushing out your stomach


---------124:53----------
one two three


---------124:56----------
four and then exhale for eight seconds


---------125:00----------
one two three


---------125:03----------
four five 6


---------125:07----------
7 8. and now again


---------125:11----------
breathe in one two


---------125:15----------
three four and breathe out


---------125:20----------
one two three


---------125:24----------
four five six


---------125:27----------
seven eight and now continue at your own


---------125:31----------
pace


---------125:32----------
we'll practice for about 60 seconds


---------125:36----------
just continue breathing i'll prompt you


---------125:37----------
when to stop


---------126:00----------
us


---------126:14----------
please


---------126:37----------
go ahead and finish the breath that


---------126:39----------
you're on


---------126:41----------
and now just observe yourself


---------126:46----------
see if there are sensations of


---------126:51----------
feeling like you didn't do a good job


---------126:53----------
like you should have done better


---------126:56----------
and we'll let you just pay attention to


---------126:59----------
thoughts and feelings as they arise


---------127:06----------
for another


---------127:09----------
45 seconds or so


---------127:38----------
and now i want you to take a deep breath


---------127:39----------
in


---------127:41----------
and exhale


---------127:46----------
and again


---------127:49----------
exhale


---------127:52----------
and then a third time in


---------127:56----------
and out as the final breath


---------128:01----------
as you finish your expiration go ahead


---------128:03----------
and


---------128:04----------
or exhalation go ahead and open your


---------128:06----------
eyes


---------128:09----------
tell me what happened


---------128:13----------
when you stopped counting and i started


---------128:15----------
to have to count for myself


---------128:17----------
i cannot count i lose track of the


---------128:20----------
numbers


---------128:23----------
so that happens i started worrying about


---------128:26----------
my 5 45 meeting


---------128:31----------
i thought about some emails that i


---------128:32----------
should have received today that i didn't


---------128:35----------
okay that's that's the majority of the


---------128:37----------
thoughts okay


---------128:39----------
so you have a goal for meditation now


---------128:42----------
i'm gonna be a teacher and i'm gonna


---------128:43----------
teach you one more technique


---------128:45----------
okay okay this is what you


---------128:48----------
i think you need so i'm going to teach


---------128:50----------
you a technique called nari shodhana or


---------128:52----------
alternate nostril breathing have you


---------128:53----------
ever learned this before


---------128:55----------
okay can you do this with your right


---------128:58----------
hand


---------128:59----------
so bring your index yep very good now


---------129:01----------
just let the thumb out


---------129:02----------
perfect yeah it could be like that


---------129:03----------
that's fine okay


---------129:06----------
i think it's pretty good yeah yeah it's


---------129:07----------
so what we're going to do is i'm going


---------129:08----------
to take


---------129:09----------
my right thumb and i'm going to block my


---------129:11----------
right nostril and i'm going to breathe


---------129:12----------
in through my left


---------129:15----------
allergies are making this a little hard


---------129:17----------
okay


---------129:20----------
and then once you have a full breath of


---------129:22----------
air once you inhale


---------129:25----------
then we're gonna switch and exhale out


---------129:28----------
the other side


---------129:33----------
and now we're going to inhale again


---------129:34----------
through this side


---------129:39----------
switch and exhale


---------129:46----------
good inhale


---------129:50----------
don't switch it inhale


---------129:53----------
it's gonna be tough because you've got


---------129:54----------
allergies


---------129:56----------
switch and exhale


---------130:02----------
inhale


---------130:07----------
switch exhale


---------130:12----------
you got the rhythm of it so let's pause


---------130:14----------
for a second maybe tough with allergies


---------130:16----------
i understand that


---------130:17----------
but i want what i want you to do is


---------130:18----------
inhale with through one nostril


---------130:21----------
switch and complete the breath out the


---------130:22----------
other side then you


---------130:24----------
start with the same side again and


---------130:26----------
switch on a


---------130:27----------
full full total lung capacity filled to


---------130:30----------
the brim okay


---------130:32----------
okay i hate that i know what you're


---------130:33----------

---------130:36----------

---------130:39----------
doing tell me


---------130:40----------
you're not doing anything no you're


---------130:41----------
you're uh you're distracting my mind


---------130:44----------
you're giving me an activity to do


---------130:47----------
good okay so close your eyes 60 seconds


---------130:50----------
alternate nostril breathing


---------130:54----------
why is this so hard for me to do it's


---------130:56----------
okay you can you can


---------130:58----------
do with my pinky okay pinky is great


---------131:00----------
yeah okay


---------131:01----------

---------131:04----------
nostril blood good in


---------131:09----------
switch out


---------131:17----------
in


---------131:21----------
switch out


---------131:29----------
in


---------131:34----------
switch out


---------131:37----------
good now the training wheels are coming


---------131:38----------
off you do it at your own pace we're


---------131:40----------
going to do it for 45 seconds


---------131:42----------
i'll keep track of the count you just


---------131:44----------
focus on not screwing up the breath


---------132:04----------
my


---------132:18----------
okay


---------132:30----------
go ahead and finish the breath that


---------132:31----------
you're on


---------132:36----------
how was that good


---------132:40----------
what does good mean


---------132:44----------
i feel like my breathing is slowed down


---------132:46----------
i also feel like my brain is wondering


---------132:48----------
if i have a deviated septum or true


---------132:51----------
allergies and why my left nostril


---------132:52----------
is so congested but


---------132:56----------
i i also hate that i appreciate what


---------132:59----------
you're doing like in the sense of


---------133:02----------
like my brain is like oh this is a


---------133:03----------
distraction method so this is what


---------133:05----------
you're doing and it's


---------133:06----------
it's rationalizing it i wish it wouldn't


---------133:09----------
but


---------133:10----------
yeah so control it so yep so don't


---------133:12----------
control it just continue the practice


---------133:16----------
okay so like your problem mike


---------133:19----------
is that the meditation you're trying is


---------133:21----------
too easy


---------133:23----------
so you need something called a powerful


---------133:25----------
alumni and this is where i have to i


---------133:27----------
have to beg your


---------133:28----------
if this doesn't work for you i have to


---------133:30----------
beg the opportunity to have another shot


---------133:32----------
at it okay okay i'm gonna i'm gonna try


---------133:35----------
it what's up


---------133:36----------
what's the prescription how often when


---------133:40----------
you i want you to practice for five


---------133:42----------
minutes


---------133:45----------
whenever you like i would say three


---------133:47----------
times a week


---------133:48----------
five times a week but just


---------133:52----------
yeah three five minutes five times a


---------133:55----------
week


---------133:56----------
okay okay and and this is where


---------133:59----------
so what you need is a powerful alumna an


---------134:01----------
alumni is the sanskrit word for support


---------134:04----------
you need something that there's so much


---------134:06----------
going on in your mind


---------134:08----------
you're actually so good at multitasking


---------134:10----------
you can juggle so many things at the


---------134:11----------
same time


---------134:12----------
that you actually need a very intensive


---------134:14----------
technique


---------134:15----------
that will demand all of your attention


---------134:18----------
so i'm going to leave you with one other


---------134:20----------
technique don't try this one yet but


---------134:21----------
just as an example


---------134:22----------
you need to stand with one foot you need


---------134:25----------
to balance on


---------134:26----------
one foot with your eyes closed that's


---------134:28----------
going to be your form of meditation


---------134:30----------
you can't try any of this new


---------134:31----------
observation stuff because your mind is


---------134:33----------
going to fill that vacuum


---------134:34----------
you need a very powerful focusing


---------134:36----------
technique


---------134:39----------
and i the why why this makes a lot of


---------134:42----------
sense to me specifically at a practical


---------134:43----------
level is


---------134:45----------
for example if i was to and my


---------134:46----------
headphones listen to an audible book


---------134:48----------
right now sitting here there's no way i


---------134:50----------
could listen to it


---------134:51----------
but while i'm driving to the hospital


---------134:53----------
and i'm busy with the stimuli of driving


---------134:56----------
and doing all these things


---------134:57----------
i can grasp the most complex subjects


---------135:01----------
whereas like if i'm just sitting i have


---------135:03----------
no idea what the speakers this is a


---------135:04----------
deficiency of your prior teachers


---------135:06----------
because your mind needs to be occupied


---------135:09----------
so the way that you keep your mind from


---------135:11----------
wandering is by keeping it focused on


---------135:13----------
one thing


---------135:14----------
alluringly enough imagine you're doing


---------135:17----------
pediatric


---------135:17----------
physical exam on a kid what do you do


---------135:20----------
right you're like oh hey why don't you


---------135:21----------
play with my stethoscope while i look in


---------135:23----------
your ears


---------135:23----------
you're right you recognize what i'm


---------135:25----------
doing you get the principle and it still


---------135:27----------
works


---------135:27----------
it's not about manipulation it's about


---------135:29----------
providing a technique for your mind that


---------135:31----------
it can sit in one place


---------135:33----------
and giving it what it needs to it's like


---------135:36----------
training a dog where you give it a treat


---------135:37----------
first and then it learns how to fetch


---------135:39----------
then it no longer needs the treat so we


---------135:42----------
need to train your mind to be able to do


---------135:44----------
this we'll give it the alumni the


---------135:45----------
support it needs at the beginning


---------135:47----------
and then as you get better at it you're


---------135:49----------
not going to need the alumni and then


---------135:50----------
you'll know how to meditate


---------135:53----------
hoping that is the case


---------135:56----------
okay my balance also sucks so if i fall


---------135:59----------
uh


---------135:59----------
is there malpractice coverage here there


---------136:01----------
is not because it is not a medical


---------136:04----------
conversation


---------136:05----------
it is not medical advice i am not your


---------136:07----------
doctor


---------136:11----------
now i hate our legal system yeah


---------136:14----------
there is not malpractice coverage for


---------136:16----------
standing on one foot


---------136:18----------
on the west side highway of all places i


---------136:20----------
was literally just


---------136:22----------
discussing with my producer about doing


---------136:23----------
a video about giving medical advice


---------136:26----------
and how complicated it is like when my


---------136:28----------
friends call and say like hey i'm dizzy


---------136:29----------
what should i do


---------136:31----------
and i i just had that in the back of my


---------136:33----------
mind because we just had this


---------136:33----------
conversation but


---------136:34----------
it was just crazy how complicated so i


---------136:37----------
