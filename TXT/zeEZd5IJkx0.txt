---------00:00----------
right so as you


---------00:01----------
like let go of that stuff and you start


---------00:03----------
focusing on yourself like as you start


---------00:05----------
like just allowing yourself to be this


---------00:07----------
human that you are


---------00:09----------
instead of failing to be that what you


---------00:11----------
want to be people find that attractive


---------00:13----------
that's the huge paradox


---------00:15----------
all right so posted by machine gun


---------00:16----------
wizardry


---------00:18----------
i believe i'm going to be a virgin for


---------00:19----------
life because i'm ugly


---------00:21----------
every insult says this but i think i'm


---------00:24----------
the exception and it's true


---------00:26----------
i know how egoistic and pitiful that


---------00:28----------
sentence reads at first glance but i


---------00:30----------
think it's true i have a lazy eye and a


---------00:32----------
crooked nose i was born with it and


---------00:34----------
without success i have never been able


---------00:36----------
to get past a first date


---------00:39----------
i'm 26 and every year i lose hope more


---------00:41----------
and more i know there's things i could


---------00:43----------
do to improve my chances i'm overweight


---------00:45----------
5 11 and 273 pounds but i can't find the


---------00:48----------
motivation to do it because i don't


---------00:50----------
think it would make a difference


---------00:51----------
i know dr k talks frequently about how


---------00:54----------
in cell mindset is a delusion but most


---------00:56----------
of the people he talks to aren't as ugly


---------00:58----------
as they believe they are i'm


---------01:00----------
conventionally ugly


---------01:02----------
i'm deformed and i don't ever feel any


---------01:04----------
attraction from women i'm around and


---------01:06----------
been friends with


---------01:08----------
besides even if i did magically wake up


---------01:10----------
tomorrow a new man with a new face i'm


---------01:12----------
so broken from years of rejection and so


---------01:15----------
romantically stunted from years of no


---------01:17----------
success that even if i could i'd be so


---------01:20----------
behind i wouldn't know what to do


---------01:22----------
or read body language


---------01:25----------
i'm always just going to be the 26 plus


---------01:27----------
year old virgin if i even if i did get


---------01:30----------
laid i'm branded


---------01:32----------
being so late to the game makes me feel


---------01:34----------
like i'm branded a virgin loser for life


---------01:37----------
i usually don't think about it but


---------01:39----------
lately it's been rough i've been


---------01:41----------
thinking about suicide here and there


---------01:42----------
and sometimes i feel close to it but i


---------01:44----------
don't want to live my whole life alone


---------01:47----------
i'm not looking for advice i just need


---------01:48----------
to vent because i can't talk to any of


---------01:50----------
my friends and i don't want them to see


---------01:52----------
how much of a depressed loser i am


---------01:54----------
i rather have been born looking


---------01:56----------
literally like anyone else than this


---------01:58----------
thanks for reading and i hope you all


---------02:00----------
had a lovely new year


---------02:03----------
okay


---------02:05----------
so let's upvote this


---------02:07----------
all right


---------02:09----------
so


---------02:14----------
sometimes when people feel like they're


---------02:16----------
going to be alone forever they feel like


---------02:18----------
they're ugly


---------02:19----------
or they feel like objectively


---------02:24----------
um


---------02:25----------
they have like no shot


---------02:27----------
right and they can even acknowledge that


---------02:29----------
if i got into shape


---------02:31----------
if i changed my mindset


---------02:33----------
like all that stuff like i understand


---------02:35----------
that technically that improves my


---------02:36----------
chances but i'm so far beyond


---------02:40----------
help


---------02:41----------
that objectively i'm screwed


---------02:44----------
and the truth is like


---------02:46----------
i know it's going to sound kind of


---------02:47----------
bizarre but i'm inclined to agree with


---------02:49----------
that person right so this is where


---------02:51----------
we have to be kind of careful here for a


---------02:53----------
second so what some people may say


---------02:55----------
in response to this is you're entitled


---------02:57----------
to your feelings right you're entitled


---------02:59----------
to feel that way like it's okay to feel


---------03:02----------
like you're screwed


---------03:05----------
and i want you all to think a little bit


---------03:06----------
for a second


---------03:08----------
if i were to respond to this person and


---------03:10----------
say you're entitled to your feelings is


---------03:13----------
that validating or invalidating


---------03:16----------
what does that actually mean


---------03:20----------
what do you all think


---------03:22----------
if i were to tell this person you're


---------03:24----------
invalid you're valid you're entitled to


---------03:26----------
your feelings


---------03:29----------
right what are we actually telling this


---------03:30----------
person what's the signal that we send to


---------03:32----------
this person we say you're entitled to


---------03:34----------
your feelings


---------03:36----------
so it's kind of tricky because for a lot


---------03:38----------
of people if you say you're entitled to


---------03:39----------
your feelings what you're sort of


---------03:41----------
telling them is like it's just all in


---------03:43----------
your head right these are just your


---------03:44----------
feelings it's not real


---------03:47----------
it's just like all in your head like oh


---------03:49----------
it's like oh you feel hurt oh you're


---------03:51----------
like it's valid that you feel hurt


---------03:56----------
doesn't mean that you are hurt


---------03:58----------
but you're allowed to feel that way


---------04:00----------
so there's something really interesting


---------04:01----------
going on which is that i've noticed that


---------04:03----------
people are starting to use


---------04:06----------
the language of entitlement to feelings


---------04:09----------
as a way to invalidate people's


---------04:11----------
experiences


---------04:13----------
right it's kind of weird


---------04:15----------
so let's just try to so we're going to


---------04:16----------
try i know it's kind of weird but it but


---------04:18----------
i'm sort of inclined to kind of agree


---------04:20----------
with this person now i don't think that


---------04:22----------
they're hopeless but i agree with a lot


---------04:24----------
of their premises


---------04:26----------
and if you if you are someone who


---------04:29----------
feels objectively like you understand


---------04:30----------
that mindset works for under peop other


---------04:32----------
people like you understand that like any


---------04:34----------
one of these things can improve your


---------04:35----------
chances but you still feel hopeless i


---------04:38----------
don't think you're actually wrong


---------04:40----------
and at the same time i don't think


---------04:43----------
things are quite as hopeless i think the


---------04:45----------
situation is as you describe it


---------04:48----------
and i do not agree with your conclusion


---------04:50----------
i'll agree with your premise because in


---------04:52----------
a lot of these situations what people


---------04:53----------
will do is they'll like dispute the


---------04:54----------
premise oh it's like actually not that


---------04:56----------
bad and we kind of see this it in this


---------04:58----------
post as well where he kind of says


---------05:00----------
you know


---------05:02----------
um i know dr k talks frequently about


---------05:04----------
how the incel mindset is is a delusion


---------05:07----------
so i wouldn't start by saying that this


---------05:09----------
person is delusional right i don't think


---------05:11----------
they're actually delusional i think that


---------05:13----------
their conclusions are incorrect


---------05:15----------
but like who am i to say that this


---------05:17----------
person is delusional right like i don't


---------05:18----------
know what this person looks like i don't


---------05:20----------
know what this person's experiences have


---------05:21----------
been


---------05:22----------
so let's just try to understand like


---------05:24----------
what is going on with this person and


---------05:26----------
what we can do about it


---------05:29----------
so the first thing is this person says


---------05:31----------
that i'm 26


---------05:32----------
okay


---------05:33----------
no sexual experience


---------05:39----------
missed the boat


---------05:43----------
right spawned too late


---------05:46----------
late to the party


---------05:47----------
things got patched and i wasn't able to


---------05:49----------
get the fat loots from the exploit


---------05:52----------
okay


---------05:53----------
so they're lack motivation


---------06:00----------
okay


---------06:00----------
they have a lazy eye


---------06:03----------
they have a crooked nose


---------06:07----------
like they're pointing out too like


---------06:09----------
legitimate physical what we call


---------06:11----------
deformities their word


---------06:14----------
that most people don't have right these


---------06:15----------
are things that are like minus one


---------06:17----------
penalty to dating like that's like a


---------06:20----------
pretty like legitimate concern


---------06:22----------
overweight


---------06:26----------
right we don't really know much about


---------06:29----------
uh you know their professional standing


---------06:32----------
education things like that maybe they're


---------06:34----------
rich maybe they're poor we don't know


---------06:35----------
anything about that so let's steer clear


---------06:36----------
of that stuff


---------06:38----------
and then the last thing is that they


---------06:39----------
feel so broken


---------06:41----------
right


---------06:42----------
they like they've been rejected so much


---------06:44----------
that even if they could fix all of these


---------06:46----------
other things that like this sense of


---------06:48----------
brokenness and the sense of rejection is


---------06:50----------
too hard to fix


---------06:51----------
now let's try to understand this


---------06:52----------
person's mindset so what they're kind of


---------06:53----------
saying is like i'm screwed so this


---------06:55----------
results in


---------06:59----------
i'm screwed


---------07:02----------
and now i'm gonna ask y'all like let's


---------07:03----------
be a little bit honest here for a second


---------07:05----------
like


---------07:06----------
you know how screwed is this person like


---------07:08----------
it doesn't look


---------07:09----------
optimistic right they've got a lot of


---------07:11----------
stuff going against them they don't know


---------07:13----------
how to read body language they have no


---------07:14----------
experience they've got a crooked nose


---------07:17----------
they're overweight they have lazy eye


---------07:19----------
they lack the motivation to like help


---------07:20----------
themselves


---------07:22----------
so it's like natural like i think it's


---------07:23----------
not stupid to arrive at this conclusion


---------07:26----------
i disagree with it i think there's a lot


---------07:27----------
that you can do


---------07:28----------
but let's start by like at least


---------07:30----------
acknowledging that this isn't just your


---------07:31----------
feelings like this person objectively


---------07:34----------
has the deck sacked against them like


---------07:36----------
can we kind of


---------07:37----------
acknowledge that for a moment


---------07:40----------
so now now here's the problem


---------07:43----------
is that when you are this screwed


---------07:47----------
our brain


---------07:48----------
when it's trying to determine so like


---------07:50----------
let's talk about motivation so like


---------07:52----------
people are saying okay like this person


---------07:54----------
should be you know should start working


---------07:56----------
out start doing this and start doing


---------07:57----------
this then you can get better you can get


---------07:58----------
better right there's a lot of solutions


---------08:00----------
that people will offer


---------08:03----------
go to the gym


---------08:05----------
you can fix that


---------08:06----------
right go to a therapist


---------08:12----------
you can fix that


---------08:14----------
go do coaching if there's no illness


---------08:17----------
like right so you can like do coaching


---------08:19----------
and understand about yourself and like


---------08:20----------
get motivated and all that kind of crap


---------08:24----------
right but all these solutions


---------08:27----------
i would even toss a couple of others on


---------08:28----------
there so there's like surgery you can do


---------08:30----------
for lazy eyes


---------08:34----------
depends on what's causing the lazy eye


---------08:36----------
you know


---------08:38----------
there's also surgery you can do for


---------08:39----------
crooked noses


---------08:44----------
right it's it's possible i'm not


---------08:46----------
necessarily saying you should do it i'm


---------08:47----------
not recommending it


---------08:48----------
but there's a lot you know there's a lot


---------08:50----------
that you could do


---------08:52----------
so why is this person lacking motivation


---------08:54----------
if there are so many different things


---------08:55----------
that they can do


---------08:56----------
right so that that's a common experience


---------08:58----------
sometimes like


---------08:59----------
so so let's talk about this for a second


---------09:08----------
so the more things you can do to improve


---------09:10----------
your life


---------09:12----------
the more overwhelmed you are the more


---------09:14----------
solutions you have so people think that


---------09:15----------
you're hopeless because you lack


---------09:17----------
solutions


---------09:18----------
but the truth is that the most hopeless


---------09:20----------
people have the most solutions


---------09:23----------
there's like way too much stuff to do


---------09:25----------
it's not actually that you're hopeless


---------09:27----------
because you lack solutions it's because


---------09:29----------
you're hopeless because you're


---------09:30----------
overwhelmed and then you're like get


---------09:32----------
into the procrastination mode you guys


---------09:34----------
get this the closest thing to this


---------09:36----------
person's psychology is someone who's a


---------09:38----------
chronic procrastinator


---------09:40----------
because there's a lot that they can do


---------09:42----------
but it's just too much to handle


---------09:45----------
and so they're almost like i want you


---------09:46----------
all to think about this as like a


---------09:48----------
procrastination problem as opposed to


---------09:50----------
like a no solutions problem because


---------09:51----------
there's actually tons of solutions


---------09:54----------
you can like


---------09:55----------
you know read books about dating you can


---------09:56----------
work on your self-confidence you can


---------09:58----------
like you know focus on yourself


---------10:04----------
you can become confident work on your


---------10:07----------
confidence


---------10:08----------
right like you can these are all the


---------10:09----------
things that you can do but why don't you


---------10:10----------
do them it's because there's it's too


---------10:12----------
overwhelming


---------10:13----------
now let's try to understand what what


---------10:15----------
does that mean overwhelming like how


---------10:16----------
does that work in our brain so our brain


---------10:18----------
is very good at making calculations and


---------10:20----------
it's like really good at figuring out


---------10:22----------
what is worth doing and what is not


---------10:23----------
worth doing


---------10:24----------
right so like i'm not going to go


---------10:26----------
outside and like hunt for ducks


---------10:28----------
because my brain knows that my


---------10:30----------
likelihood of finding being able to hunt


---------10:32----------
for a duck is pretty low i don't know


---------10:34----------
how to do that so i'm not going to go


---------10:35----------
engage in that behavior


---------10:37----------
our brain is very good at figuring out


---------10:38----------
what we can accomplish and what we can't


---------10:40----------
accomplish so let's understand what's


---------10:41----------
going on in the brain of this person


---------10:44----------
so if we say go get surgery


---------10:48----------
but what about all these things


---------10:51----------
right like


---------10:53----------
this is left undone this is left undone


---------10:55----------
this is left undone this is left undone


---------10:57----------
and this is left undone therefore


---------10:58----------
surgery is not gonna fix my problem


---------11:00----------
therefore i'm not gonna do it


---------11:02----------
okay but like what about my getting


---------11:05----------
going to the gym


---------11:07----------
yeah like even if i did that this is not


---------11:09----------
gonna get done this is not gonna get


---------11:10----------
done this is not gonna get done and this


---------11:11----------
is not gonna get done so it's like this


---------11:13----------
is gonna be insufficient to fix my


---------11:14----------
problem


---------11:15----------
so i'm not gonna do it


---------11:17----------
i feel broken and rejected okay go to


---------11:19----------
therapy


---------11:21----------
okay sure like if i go to therapy and i


---------11:22----------
feel less broken and rejected like i'm


---------11:24----------
still gonna have the lazy eye i'm still


---------11:25----------
gonna have the crooked nose i'm still


---------11:26----------
gonna be fat it's not going to be enough


---------11:28----------
so i'm not going to do it


---------11:31----------
right


---------11:34----------
like and even if i like


---------11:36----------
have like if i get surgery and i lose


---------11:38----------
weight and stuff like that i'm still


---------11:39----------
going to have no sexual i'm going to be


---------11:40----------
a 26 year old virgin like nothing is


---------11:42----------
going to change that


---------11:43----------
and so the reason we feel overwhelmed is


---------11:46----------
because any step we take is not enough


---------11:50----------
right and i want you guys to think about


---------11:51----------
when you're procrastinating for finals


---------11:52----------
it's like when you've got so much stuff


---------11:54----------
to do i know i'm actually personally


---------11:57----------
experiencing this now where i feel


---------11:59----------
paralyzed because i have so much crap to


---------12:01----------
do like i've noticed this in a way that


---------12:03----------
i haven't noticed in a very long time


---------12:05----------
where it's like there's just so much to


---------12:07----------
i don't even know where to get started


---------12:09----------
and when you don't know where to get


---------12:10----------
started you can't do anything


---------12:13----------
and if you can't do anything you stay


---------12:15----------
stuck


---------12:17----------
right and then we procrastinate then we


---------12:18----------
go back to our coping mechanism okay so


---------12:21----------
like this is too much so what am i gonna


---------12:23----------
do


---------12:25----------
play games


---------12:28----------
pornography


---------12:30----------
here we go


---------12:32----------
i'm gonna advance the clock


---------12:34----------
right


---------12:35----------
i'm gonna advance the clock i can get an


---------12:37----------
rpg i'm going to wait 24 hours but like


---------12:39----------
your situation is still the same


---------12:43----------
so how do you deal with this


---------12:45----------
right and i think the answer is is kind


---------12:47----------
of interesting and it's it's old stuff


---------12:49----------
that people say that they say things


---------12:51----------
like focus on yourself and and you know


---------12:52----------
focus on your confidence and things like


---------12:53----------
that which i think is the answer


---------12:55----------
but


---------12:58----------
it's not i can can't just tell you just


---------12:59----------
focus on like what does that mean


---------13:01----------
practically like what's going to go on


---------13:02----------
in your brain practically if i tell you


---------13:04----------
to focus on yourself


---------13:05----------
right


---------13:06----------
so i'm going to kind of tell you all a


---------13:08----------
story


---------13:09----------
so when i


---------13:11----------
started residency i got married my first


---------13:13----------
year at like towards the end of my first


---------13:15----------
year of medical school


---------13:16----------
so when i was like


---------13:18----------
when i started residency so i'm a doctor


---------13:20----------
i'm working in a hospital


---------13:22----------
and i kind of noticed something weird so


---------13:24----------
when i was growing up like i didn't get


---------13:25----------
any female attention


---------13:26----------
in college i tried to get some female


---------13:28----------
attention and it went horribly


---------13:31----------
and then like you know even in my middle


---------13:33----------
years like i i had a girlfriend who was


---------13:35----------
awesome and stuff and that was great


---------13:37----------
um


---------13:38----------
but like kind of the couple years before


---------13:39----------
medical school it wasn't like i was


---------13:40----------
getting you know i wasn't like talking


---------13:42----------
to girls or girls didn't seem that


---------13:44----------
interested in me


---------13:46----------
and then


---------13:47----------
you know i got married


---------13:48----------
and then during med school then like i


---------13:50----------
didn't have to worry about any of that


---------13:51----------
crap anymore and so i got married and i


---------13:54----------
like had this woman that i loved and we


---------13:55----------
were happy and so like i started you


---------13:58----------
know doing things just like for the sake


---------14:01----------
of doing them like i wasn't worried


---------14:02----------
about any of that other crap i wasn't


---------14:04----------
trying to look for a girlfriend i wasn't


---------14:05----------
flirting so like if i met a girl


---------14:08----------
like in school


---------14:10----------
like i didn't care if she was pretty i


---------14:12----------
didn't care if she was ugly i didn't


---------14:13----------
care if she was single i didn't care


---------14:14----------
like about any of that crap


---------14:16----------
like i don't care like it's just like


---------14:18----------
i'm gonna interact with this person


---------14:19----------
based on the circumstances of our


---------14:21----------
interaction


---------14:22----------
and then something like magical happened


---------14:24----------
i started becoming like a warm and


---------14:25----------
pleasant human being


---------14:27----------
and then i go to the hospital and then


---------14:29----------
there's like a lot of people at the


---------14:30----------
hospital right and so i'm like


---------14:32----------
interacting with people and i tend to be


---------14:34----------
like kind of warm and funny and upbeat


---------14:36----------
and stuff like that and then like i kind


---------14:38----------
of noticed i started getting like female


---------14:40----------
attention


---------14:42----------
and i was kind of confused by that


---------14:43----------
because i had never had really female


---------14:45----------
attention before


---------14:46----------
you know i i still think to this day


---------14:48----------
that


---------14:49----------
you know the girlfriend thing and the


---------14:50----------
wife thing was that was a fluke like it


---------14:51----------
was just like a one-off


---------14:53----------
right i don't think i i mean i guess i


---------14:55----------
did some things good but


---------14:56----------
and so then i started to realize like oh


---------14:58----------
like why is this happening and it's just


---------15:00----------
like i'm allowing myself to you know be


---------15:02----------
my best self like i'm just being my best


---------15:04----------
self


---------15:05----------
and i'm not worried about dating anyone


---------15:08----------
i'm not worried about getting into


---------15:09----------
anyone's pants so i'm just like you know


---------15:11----------
if i see someone and i like someone's


---------15:13----------
shirt like i can compliment like a nurse


---------15:15----------
on her shirt i'd be like that shirt


---------15:16----------
looks i mean you don't do that it's a


---------15:18----------
stupid example cause they all wear


---------15:20----------
scrubs


---------15:21----------
but you know you can just compliment


---------15:22----------
someone you can say hey like you know


---------15:23----------
looks like you got a haircut looks


---------15:24----------
fantastic you can say that


---------15:27----------
you're just like you just be a nice


---------15:28----------
human being


---------15:29----------
and as you start being a nice human


---------15:30----------
being and you get the [ __ ] out of your


---------15:32----------
own head


---------15:33----------
because that's an important part right


---------15:35----------
like you start attending to other people


---------15:37----------
like you start to come across as


---------15:39----------
confident


---------15:41----------
and then i'm also focusing on yourself


---------15:43----------
so i'm like trying to you know exercise


---------15:45----------
and like you know i'm just like trying


---------15:46----------
to be a decent human being all on all on


---------15:49----------
my own


---------15:50----------
and the funny thing is that by focusing


---------15:52----------
on yourself by focusing on being a


---------15:53----------
decent human being


---------15:55----------
and not worrying about


---------15:57----------
dating anyone


---------15:59----------
i was like


---------16:00----------
found a ridiculous amount of like female


---------16:03----------
attention which i had never experienced


---------16:04----------
before and then i was confused and i was


---------16:05----------
like this is because i'm a doctor


---------16:07----------
because the doctor probably has


---------16:07----------
something to do with it but it's a


---------16:08----------
common myth that just because you become


---------16:10----------
a doctor does not mean that like the


---------16:11----------
opposite sex will start drooling all


---------16:13----------
over you or the same sex if you're


---------16:14----------
that's your thing


---------16:16----------
sure it's kind of attractive but it's


---------16:17----------
not gonna fix all this other crap


---------16:20----------
and so then like the problem here is


---------16:22----------
that you're going to be stuck


---------16:24----------
as long as you're trying to like


---------16:27----------
you know


---------16:28----------
get with someone


---------16:30----------
so if your goal is this


---------16:33----------
none of these steps will be sufficient


---------16:36----------
and then your brain will tell you


---------16:38----------
there's no point in trying because


---------16:41----------
getting with someone


---------16:43----------
oh let's see if that


---------16:44----------
shows up


---------16:45----------
so getting with someone like is too big


---------16:47----------
of a problem to solve and since that's


---------16:49----------
the problem you're trying to solve


---------16:52----------
your motivation is gonna completely


---------16:54----------
disappear because nothing you do will be


---------16:56----------
enough because i agree with your premise


---------16:58----------
and so the paradox here is that like


---------17:00----------
this is what keeps you stuck


---------17:03----------
so this is where also like if you're


---------17:04----------
procrastinating like you can't solve you


---------17:06----------
can't fix it all at once


---------17:08----------
so the only way forward is to stop


---------17:10----------
trying to fix it


---------17:12----------
and this is where things get a little


---------17:13----------
bit tricky because


---------17:15----------
stop trying to fix it can mean one of


---------17:17----------
two things it can mean becoming hopeless


---------17:19----------
or it can mean changing your goal


---------17:21----------
so forget about everything else and just


---------17:24----------
focus on this


---------17:26----------
right like are you happy with the way


---------17:28----------
that your body is like forget about


---------17:29----------
women forget about sexual attraction


---------17:32----------
forget about dating forget about


---------17:33----------
everything else are you internally happy


---------17:35----------
with this


---------17:36----------
is this something you are happy with


---------17:39----------
and if the answer is no


---------17:40----------
change it


---------17:42----------
right let the outcome be something that


---------17:44----------
is like absolutely much more close to


---------17:46----------
what you can do


---------17:48----------
or even like let go of the outcome


---------17:49----------
completely which i'm not sure that this


---------17:50----------
person can do


---------17:52----------
but like understand that this is not the


---------17:54----------
goal over here like this is the goal


---------17:57----------
right if you like if you have a lazy eye


---------17:59----------
like there may be medication that you


---------18:00----------
can get or there may be surgery you can


---------18:01----------
do like you may be able to do that if


---------18:03----------
you have a difficulty with driving i


---------18:05----------
don't know where what part of the world


---------18:06----------
you live in but like generally speaking


---------18:08----------
you know people will do things like you


---------18:09----------
can get those kinds of surgeries and


---------18:11----------
they'll be covered


---------18:13----------
if you've got double vision and you


---------18:15----------
drive or like there are all kinds of


---------18:16----------
different things


---------18:17----------
if you're feeling you know you're


---------18:19----------
worried about being broken and rejected


---------18:20----------
like you can go to therapy just because


---------18:22----------
you don't want to feel broken anymore


---------18:23----------
like it has nothing to do with women it


---------18:26----------
has nothing to do with being alone and


---------18:28----------
this is the biggest problem that this is


---------18:30----------
how we shoot ourselves in the foot is we


---------18:32----------
try to set a goal


---------18:34----------
or we don't try we end up setting a goal


---------18:36----------
for ourself


---------18:37----------
that involves so many different


---------18:39----------
variables that we create an unsolvable


---------18:42----------
problem


---------18:43----------
and when faced with an unsolvable


---------18:44----------
problem we feel overwhelmed we feel we


---------18:47----------
procrastinate we feel no motivation


---------18:52----------
and then we end up not solving our


---------18:54----------
unsolvable problem which is not a


---------18:56----------
delusion


---------18:57----------
like this person isn't delusional like


---------18:59----------
they're smart they're like not an idiot


---------19:01----------
right they've like accurately


---------19:03----------
concluded they've like figured this out


---------19:06----------
now the problem is you can say but okay


---------19:07----------
dr k if i start working on myself is


---------19:09----------
that the way that you i end up with


---------19:11----------
someone who's i say yes that's the way


---------19:12----------
you end up with someone


---------19:13----------
but the problem is if that is your


---------19:15----------
target in your mind literally the


---------19:17----------
equation in your mind will not let you


---------19:19----------
engage in it


---------19:20----------
it cannot be the outcome that you're


---------19:22----------
chasing


---------19:22----------
because if you chase that outcome


---------19:24----------
nothing will be sufficient it'll never


---------19:26----------
be sufficient


---------19:27----------
and so when people say focus on yourself


---------19:29----------
like how do you do that i know it's kind


---------19:30----------
of weird but what you do is you give up


---------19:32----------
on it sure give up on finding someone i


---------19:34----------
sure as well know that i did


---------19:36----------
and that when i met my girlfriend is


---------19:38----------
bizarre


---------19:39----------
but giving up on it doesn't mean suicide


---------19:41----------
giving up on it means finding a


---------19:42----------
different goal just let go that goal


---------19:46----------
right grieve it


---------19:48----------
so when you're when you're faced with an


---------19:50----------
unsolvable situation you've got two


---------19:52----------
options


---------19:53----------
hopelessness and grief


---------19:55----------
and what you need to do is grieve it say


---------19:57----------
sucks for me i will be alone for the


---------19:59----------
rest of my life so be it


---------20:01----------
then the question becomes what can i do


---------20:02----------
in this life that will give me some


---------20:04----------
shred of happiness what can i take some


---------20:06----------
pride in


---------20:07----------
what can i do for myself that'll like do


---------20:09----------
something for me


---------20:12----------
like i don't know maybe five years from


---------20:13----------
now i'm gonna commit suicide but


---------20:15----------
people are gonna be able to lift the


---------20:17----------
casket


---------20:18----------
because i ain't gonna be overweight when


---------20:20----------
they put me in the ground


---------20:22----------
right like i know it's kind of morbid


---------20:23----------
but i'm serious like there are things


---------20:25----------
that you can take pride in in this life


---------20:29----------
right even if you're single like there


---------20:30----------
are things that you can do you could try


---------20:32----------
to be a better human being for other


---------20:34----------
people


---------20:35----------
you can


---------20:37----------
feel less broken you can like be happy


---------20:40----------
with what you see when you look in the


---------20:41----------
mirror


---------20:42----------
like even if you're broken on the inside


---------20:43----------
you can take pride in what you see when


---------20:45----------
you look in the mirror every day and


---------20:46----------
that could be that could mean surgery


---------20:48----------
for your nose it could mean losing


---------20:50----------
weight even if you're unhappy with what


---------20:52----------
you see when you look in the mirror you


---------20:53----------
can be happy with what your body is


---------20:55----------
capable of when you jump into the ocean


---------20:58----------
that you can swim for a long amount of


---------20:59----------
time you can feel


---------21:01----------
amazing for climbing to the top of a


---------21:03----------
mountain there's absolutely all kinds of


---------21:04----------
stuff you can do


---------21:06----------
and the big paradox here


---------21:08----------
is that as you start doing those things


---------21:12----------
this becomes more likely


---------21:15----------
but this is the really tricky thing is


---------21:17----------
that we can't we're not going to win


---------21:18----------
this game with our mind like we're


---------21:20----------
really not the mind will win all the


---------21:22----------
time


---------21:23----------
so if you keep that as your goal so it's


---------21:25----------
kind of weird but i'd say like very


---------21:26----------
practically


---------21:28----------
when there are too many things that you


---------21:30----------
have to do


---------21:31----------
to accomplish something


---------21:32----------
the mind has a lot of difficulty with


---------21:34----------
motivation and it's just going to feel


---------21:36----------
overwhelmed and procrastinate


---------21:38----------
and you're not wrong


---------21:40----------
in believing that things feel very very


---------21:42----------
far away and so that's why i would say


---------21:45----------
that like you know i agree with you that


---------21:48----------
it's almost reasonable to be hopeless


---------21:51----------
and so this what i'd say is like let go


---------21:53----------
of it right let go of hope


---------21:56----------
doesn't mean you have to be despair


---------21:58----------
but you can let go of rope you could


---------22:00----------
just set that whole thing aside


---------22:02----------
and you can try to think about okay like


---------22:04----------
is my life defined by this one thing


---------22:07----------
because if it is then i can understand


---------22:09----------
why people feel suicidal


---------22:12----------
but the truth is there's more to life


---------22:14----------
than relationships there just is more to


---------22:16----------
life than relationships


---------22:18----------
right if if all life was was


---------22:20----------
relationships everyone who is in a


---------22:22----------
relationship would be perfectly happy


---------22:25----------
but people aren't perfectly happy


---------22:27----------
we've seen posts today about you know


---------22:29----------
people being unhappy at work people


---------22:30----------
being unfulfilled people not


---------22:32----------
following their creative pursuits


---------22:35----------
people being unsatisfied with how you


---------22:37----------
know what their mmr is on an online


---------22:39----------
video game there are all kinds of things


---------22:41----------
in life


---------22:42----------
and so if if


---------22:44----------
relationships are too hard to solve then


---------22:46----------
let it go


---------22:47----------
and start fixing the other stuff


---------22:49----------
and when you're ready a relationship


---------22:50----------
will come you'll be surprised like


---------22:52----------
literally it'll come to you


---------22:54----------
you need to stop chasing it


---------22:56----------
because it's that chasing that sort of


---------22:58----------
like makes you come across as like


---------23:00----------
desperate


---------23:02----------
that is like unattractive to people in


---------23:03----------
the first place


---------23:05----------
right so as you


---------23:06----------
like let go of that stuff and you start


---------23:08----------
focusing on yourself like as you start


---------23:10----------
like just allowing yourself to be this


---------23:12----------
human that you are


---------23:14----------
instead of failing to be that what you


---------23:16----------
want to be people find that attractive


---------23:18----------
that's the huge paradox


---------23:21----------
is that if i try to be something else


---------23:25----------
by definition i'm gonna be insufficient


---------23:27----------
because i'm not there yet


---------23:30----------
and that gap that i feel about myself is


---------23:32----------
gonna be something that other people


---------23:33----------
pick up on and as i let go of that thing


---------23:36----------
and i allow myself to be what i am i


---------23:38----------
embrace who i am you can still work


---------23:41----------
towards things by all means but you can


---------23:42----------
start to say to yourself you know what


---------23:44----------
tired of being 273 pounds and 5 11.


---------23:46----------
so i'm going to go to the gym i'm not


---------23:47----------
going to try to pick up chicks


---------23:49----------
i'm not doing it for them because if


---------23:51----------
you're doing it for them and it doesn't


---------23:53----------
work out the first time that you expend


---------23:55----------
effort and it doesn't you've lost 10


---------23:57----------
pounds there's a cute girl at the gym


---------23:59----------
you ask her out she says no or you don't


---------24:01----------
even ask her out because this person


---------24:02----------
wouldn't even ask around they'd talk to


---------24:04----------
her


---------24:05----------
but then they'd find that oh like now


---------24:06----------
she's talking to some guy who's more fit


---------24:08----------
than i am suddenly your motivation is


---------24:10----------
the girl and you're not gonna work out


---------24:12----------
because you've lost 10 pounds and like


---------24:13----------
screw it she's talking to this other guy


---------24:14----------
so gigi i'm


---------24:16----------
leaving your motivation is going to


---------24:19----------
disappear you are letting your


---------24:20----------
motivation be determined by the outcomes


---------24:23----------
and whims of another human being


---------24:26----------
like


---------24:28----------
that's


---------24:29----------
that's screwed


---------24:33----------
right so like


---------24:35----------
why do that


---------24:37----------
because i don't want to be alone


---------24:39----------
well


---------24:40----------
with love too bad you are right now


---------24:44----------
and so like learn how to be alone it's


---------24:46----------
another huge thing


---------24:48----------
people don't really understand that like


---------24:51----------
a big part of being in a healthy


---------24:52----------
relationship is learning how to be alone


---------24:56----------
right you have to be like comfortable


---------24:58----------
like if you want to be in a really


---------24:59----------
healthy relationship you need to be like


---------25:02----------
comfortable and


---------25:03----------
happy with yourself


---------25:06----------
because like a relationship


---------25:08----------
makes things harder not easier like like


---------25:10----------
the more grounded you are


---------25:12----------
the easier things are going to be


---------25:14----------
not the harder things are going to be


---------25:20----------
anyway


---------25:21----------
so you know if you fall into the


---------25:23----------
category of feeling that


---------25:25----------
any relationship you're just too far


---------25:27----------
gone in too many dimensions like i know


---------25:29----------
it sounds kind of weird but like


---------25:31----------
you may be


---------25:33----------
and yet that doesn't mean that you have


---------25:34----------
to be hopeless


---------25:35----------
right because at the end of the day like


---------25:38----------
just because your logical analysis is


---------25:40----------
correct doesn't mean that your


---------25:42----------
conclusion has to be that conclusion


---------25:44----------
there's another route and if you feel


---------25:46----------
like unmotivated because there are too


---------25:48----------
many dimensions of your life and you


---------25:50----------
don't know where to start like that's


---------25:51----------
also like completely normal i'm not just


---------25:53----------
saying like your feelings are valid like


---------25:54----------
as if you know your analysis is


---------25:56----------
incorrect and your feelings are all


---------25:58----------
coloring your analysis and you're


---------25:59----------
actually an idiot but you're entitled to


---------26:01----------
your feelings so


---------26:02----------
you know like no like i think your


---------26:04----------
feelings are valid and also your like


---------26:06----------
logical analysis is valid but i don't


---------26:08----------
think it's the complete story


---------26:11----------
and as you start reframing away from


---------26:13----------
that goal which makes any mo any effort


---------26:16----------
useless so if any effort is useless you


---------26:19----------
are not going to be motivated towards


---------26:20----------
anything


---------26:22----------
so you have to start making your effort


---------26:24----------
mean something and how do you ever make


---------26:25----------
your effort mean something you let go of


---------26:27----------
that goal you grieve it you're going to


---------26:29----------
be alone for the rest of your life but


---------26:31----------
you know what this world has more to


---------26:32----------
offer than relationships


---------26:35----------
this is where you say but what can i


---------26:37----------
truly be happy without it i don't know


---------26:39----------
but neither do you because you haven't


---------26:41----------
tried to be happy without a relationship


---------26:43----------
all you've been caught up in is


---------26:44----------
relationship relationship relationships


---------26:46----------
so who the [ __ ] knows


---------26:54----------
so by all means


---------26:55----------
give up hope on the relationship but


---------26:57----------
don't give up hope on life


---------26:59----------
and start working on what you can work


---------27:01----------
on


---------27:02----------
let your goals be small let your goals


---------27:04----------
be insufficient to accomplish that that


---------27:07----------
great great


---------27:08----------
monumental task that is too far out of


---------27:10----------
your reach just let go of it


---------27:12----------
don't try to climb a mountain


---------27:14----------
try to climb one step up


---------27:17----------
right because if you're looking to the


---------27:18----------
top of a mountain i take one step


---------27:20----------
forward it's like


---------27:22----------
literally it looks exactly the same


---------27:24----------
even though technically i'm one step


---------27:26----------
closer it is looks the view is exactly


---------27:28----------
the same you guys could try this


---------27:30----------
go look at a mountain and then take one


---------27:32----------
step towards it and then one step back


---------27:34----------
does the view of the mountain change no


---------27:36----------
it doesn't change at all


---------27:38----------
and this is the the big scam of the mind


---------27:41----------
is that the mind is like so focused on


---------27:43----------
the outcome because that's what you're


---------27:44----------
focused on it's going to destroy your


---------27:46----------
motivation and keep you stuck where you


---------27:48----------
are


---------27:49----------
so let go of the goal


---------27:52----------
and start focusing on yourself like


---------27:54----------
literally like that's the advice right


---------27:55----------
that's what people say people don't know


---------27:57----------
how to do that but this is why you have


---------27:58----------
to focus on yourself you can't can't if


---------28:00----------
you focus on that you're never going to


---------28:01----------
achieve it


---------28:02----------
but there's something you can do for


---------28:04----------
yourself there's something you can take


---------28:05----------
pride in


---------28:06----------
find out what that thing is and move


---------28:08----------
towards it


---------28:10----------
and you'll be surprised where you end up


---------28:12----------
but no guarantees


---------28:25----------
you
