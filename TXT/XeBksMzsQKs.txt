so if you drink caffeine every morning


---------00:05----------
at the first cup of caffeine that you


---------00:06----------
ever have in your life is gonna make you


---------00:08----------
completely wired and so what happens


---------00:10----------
over time is benefit caffeine every day


---------00:13----------
is your your body develops a tolerance


---------00:15----------
to that caffeine and then if you don't


---------00:17----------
have caffeine you feel really crappy and


---------00:20----------
even if you do have caffeine it doesn't


---------00:21----------
actually have you up it just makes you


---------00:23----------
feel normal guys with me so what what


---------00:27----------
video games do is they release that


---------00:28----------
constant stream of dopamine and then


---------00:30----------
what the brain does is actually down


---------00:32----------
regulates the response of that doughnut


---------00:34----------
so if you talked if you really look at


---------00:36----------
people who play video games like a lot


---------00:39----------
they actually don't have fun while


---------00:41----------
they're playing bang but it becomes


---------00:43----------
something like happy where if they don't


---------00:44----------
play the game they just don't feel like


---------00:46----------
the other thing that's really dangerous


---------00:49----------
that it does is it actually it makes


---------00:50----------
people and hedonic which means it makes


---------00:53----------
people have difficulty finding pleasure


---------00:55----------
from other activities and so the reason


---------00:57----------
for that is like let's say you read a


---------00:59----------
book in a book normally you can find it


---------01:01----------
enjoyable but if your dopamine circuits


---------01:03----------
have been so down regulated because the


---------01:06----------
intensity of dopamine release that you


---------01:08----------
get the intensity and consistency of


---------01:10----------
dopamine release you get from a game is


---------01:13----------
so high that like it down rate increases


---------01:16----------
your entire these Olympics circuit which


---------01:18----------
means things that you would normally


---------01:20----------
find enjoyable gamers have more trouble


---------01:22----------
finding jointly
