---------00:00----------
there is no such thing as a first step


---------00:01----------
there is only a step there's only the


---------00:03----------
step that you can take that's not a


---------00:05----------
philosophy that is an actual reality


---------00:12----------
yeah but don't try it next week don't


---------00:15----------
know much you're like try tomorrow


---------00:17----------
like you guys need to start today yeah I


---------00:22----------
I can't believe I'm about to say this


---------00:24----------
but the subs giving it away it's like


---------00:26----------
throwing me off because of the sound but


---------00:29----------
I understand that I'm supposed to


---------00:30----------
encourage this behavior I mean so so I


---------00:33----------
think you guys should do right but like


---------00:35----------
understand that


---------00:36----------
so try is the problem don't try do or


---------00:42----------
fail I'll take either of those either of


---------00:44----------
those are fine like failing is fine the


---------00:49----------
problem is trying trying is the problem


---------00:51----------
you do you don't have to succeed like


---------00:55----------
failing is great failing is fantastic


---------00:59----------
just do or [ __ ] up like fail or succeed


---------01:04----------
but do one of those two things try is


---------01:07----------
like in the middle try is like tries


---------01:09----------
like it's like the [ __ ] future killer


---------01:11----------
try is a thing that prevents you from


---------01:13----------
actually doing anything it don't try


---------01:18----------
just do it and [ __ ] up like failure so


---------01:22----------
this is a very common problem where like


---------01:23----------
people think that the way that you get


---------01:25----------
confident is through success but you


---------01:27----------
don't get confident through success you


---------01:29----------
get confident through failure right


---------01:32----------
think about that for a second like when


---------01:34----------
you screw up and you survive and you


---------01:37----------
come out on the other side and you're


---------01:39----------
still alive like that's when you get


---------01:41----------
confidence it's like oh wow like I fell


---------01:46----------
down oh look I can get back up again


---------01:48----------
then you don't have to be afraid of


---------01:50----------
walking right just just do something let


---------01:54----------
just try and then if you don't mean I


---------01:56----------
say try do it and then fail and then


---------01:59----------
like look at it understand it what


---------02:01----------
happened what happened why did I fail


---------02:05----------
like what actually happened was it


---------02:07----------
motivation was a discipline was it


---------02:09----------
willpower is it because and think about


---------02:12----------
this - because gamers think that they


---------02:14----------
want all this stuff like you guys want


---------02:16----------
stuff yeah like I want a [ __ ] yacht


---------02:18----------
like I said I want a jet plane you know


---------02:20----------
I want like like this mic setup to work


---------02:23----------
properly I want


---------02:25----------
all that stuff but like what isn't gonna


---------02:27----------
get you anywhere Lane north shouldn't


---------02:29----------
because I also work with people that


---------02:31----------
want a lot of things and they are not as


---------02:33----------
lazy and they don't they're not happy


---------02:36----------
like this is the other big thing is that


---------02:37----------
even if you accomplish your wants you're


---------02:39----------
not gonna be happy and people here are


---------02:43----------
saying the hardest part is taking that


---------02:45----------
first step like this is what y'all also


---------02:47----------
have to understand every step is the


---------02:49----------
first step there's only one step to be


---------02:51----------
taken it's not the first step


---------02:52----------
that's like future-oriented thinking


---------02:54----------
which is wrong it's like where does


---------02:56----------
climate change gonna be fixed in the


---------02:58----------
future wrong it's gonna be fixed now


---------03:00----------
like you go outside you plant a [ __ ]


---------03:02----------
tree that's how it gets done future is


---------03:06----------
an illusion of the mind understand this


---------03:08----------
very deeply like I know it sounds crazy


---------03:11----------
but I want you guys to really like sink


---------03:13----------
into this right so PI to Africa said the


---------03:15----------
hardest part is taking that first step


---------03:16----------
there is no such thing as a first step


---------03:18----------
there is only a step there's only the


---------03:20----------
step that you can take that's not a


---------03:22----------
philosophy that is an actual reality so


---------03:25----------
I want you guys to understand this right


---------03:27----------
now we are in the present and where are


---------03:30----------
we now in the present where are we now


---------03:33----------
in the present where are we now in the


---------03:37----------
present this is the only thing that


---------03:38----------
there is and gamer's you guys your mind


---------03:42----------
plays all kinds of tricks with you once


---------03:44----------
you incorporate the future because once


---------03:47----------
the future is a possibility you're


---------03:49----------
[ __ ]


---------03:51----------
right like once the future is a


---------03:54----------
possibility then you could do something


---------03:57----------
in the future like we didn't really get


---------04:01----------
too much into this but I want you guys


---------04:03----------
to understand that for Joro


---------04:04----------
the future is the problem he can move


---------04:06----------
out one day he's gonna do it one day


---------04:11----------
he's gonna exercise one day one day one


---------04:15----------
day one day one day one day no he can't


---------04:19----------
exercise one day the only time he can


---------04:20----------
exercise is now literally you cannot


---------04:22----------
exercise except for right now so like


---------04:29----------
understand that you guys have to be in


---------04:32----------
the collective present is the only place


---------04:33----------
that exists and the more that you try to


---------04:35----------
solve problems in the future like no


---------04:37----------
wonder they're not getting solved


---------04:38----------
because you're [ __ ] solving them in


---------04:39----------
the play


---------04:39----------
that doesn't exist so people are asking


---------04:47----------
can't future thinking be helpful


---------04:50----------
absolutely


---------04:51----------
like you don't accomplish much without


---------04:55----------
thinking about the future right so like


---------04:57----------
I couldn't stream if I just randomly


---------05:00----------
decided when to stream like I have to


---------05:02----------
schedule so it's absolutely apart like


---------05:06----------
so the future thinking mind is one


---------05:08----------
function of the mind that needs to be


---------05:10----------
under your control right you should


---------05:15----------
decide when the future thinking mind


---------05:17----------
gets to run the show and when it doesn't


---------05:18----------
the problem is that for a lot of people


---------05:21----------
the future thinking mind runs the show


---------05:23----------
it says what we're gonna do it later


---------05:25----------
like that's what procrastination is


---------05:27----------
procrastination is an overblown future


---------05:30----------
thinking mind consequences in the future


---------05:34----------
being overblown does what we call


---------05:35----------
anxiety all of the problems of the mind


---------05:38----------
are normal functions of the mind that


---------05:40----------
have taken control from you
