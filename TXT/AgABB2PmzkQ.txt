---------00:43----------
think so far you know we haven't doxed


---------00:44----------
you


---------00:45----------
you revealed your identity we're going


---------00:46----------
to try to see how long we can keep that


---------00:48----------
going well


---------00:48----------
it's it's one of those things like um


---------00:51----------
i mean it's not impossible to find a


---------00:53----------
quick google search we'll


---------00:55----------
get you exactly what you want to see um


---------00:57----------
i mean it's not like


---------00:58----------
we can see the big d on google no


---------01:01----------
you can go to google images we'll help


---------01:04----------
you out with that


---------01:05----------
um but you know it's just one of those


---------01:07----------
things where a lot of people just don't


---------01:08----------
want to have the magic


---------01:10----------
ruined for whatever reason and they have


---------01:13----------
their own idea of what i look like and i


---------01:14----------
don't want to ruin that


---------01:15----------
that that magic for them so it's totally


---------01:18----------
up to them


---------01:19----------
okay cool and jason is there something


---------01:22----------
in


---------01:22----------
uh thank you very much for you know


---------01:24----------
coming on um it's


---------01:26----------
it's cool to hear the you know you go


---------01:28----------
into the voice


---------01:30----------
yeah i mean it's kind of cool so i


---------01:31----------
basically add a little bit of stress on


---------01:33----------
it i mean my


---------01:33----------
i use my like you know my regular voice


---------01:35----------
but if i want to like i


---------01:36----------
add a little bit of stress and the


---------01:38----------
reason why i do that is because


---------01:40----------
i want to make it sound as clear as


---------01:43----------
possible because


---------01:44----------
i it's an international audience so i


---------01:46----------
get people from


---------01:47----------
all around the world and they're like


---------01:49----------
wow you know um


---------01:50----------
you know i'm just learning english and i


---------01:52----------
like watching your videos because it


---------01:53----------
helps me


---------01:54----------
practice and learn my english because


---------01:56----------
you speak so so so clearly


---------01:59----------
um so i'm like yes that's exactly what i


---------02:00----------
was kind of shooting for i want to sound


---------02:02----------
as clear as possible for


---------02:03----------
as many people to understand the point


---------02:05----------
i'm trying to get across and


---------02:06----------
yeah there you go that's cool but you


---------02:09----------
have very


---------02:10----------
very clear like a crisp diction i guess


---------02:13----------
yeah


---------02:14----------
i mean yeah that's i i didn't really


---------02:18----------
i never connected those dots until you


---------02:20----------
kind of set it that that


---------02:22----------
it is yeah i mean i obviously i add


---------02:25----------
stress on it for


---------02:26----------
on purpose yeah um yeah it's cool


---------02:30----------
um is there something in particular that


---------02:32----------
you want to talk about today or


---------02:34----------
anything that we can help you with well


---------02:35----------
i don't i don't know i mean i'm


---------02:37----------
i don't know exactly what you've already


---------02:39----------
covered but


---------02:40----------
like i i think it's interesting um from


---------02:43----------
my perspective


---------02:44----------
on on what you know your what


---------02:47----------
most youtubers go through what they have


---------02:49----------
to go through and from a mental health


---------02:52----------
aspect in what they have to overcome


---------02:54----------
what they have to conquer and what they


---------02:56----------
deal with on a


---------02:56----------
on a daily basis is really interesting


---------02:59----------
um


---------03:00----------
i don't know like for me personally it's


---------03:03----------
it's interesting how my whole life


---------03:04----------
changed


---------03:05----------
um because of youtube um you know i


---------03:07----------
didn't really use social media much


---------03:09----------
um is just kind of um


---------03:12----------
i i really didn't and now that it's


---------03:16----------
i use it every day it's my job i'm it's


---------03:19----------
my


---------03:20----------
i have to be on you know instagram and


---------03:22----------
tic tac and youtube and


---------03:23----------
all this stuff for many hours a day and


---------03:26----------
i just wonder


---------03:28----------
um you know if there will be any


---------03:31----------
negative


---------03:31----------
impact on that in the future um


---------03:35----------
because i have seen in my own life how


---------03:37----------
um


---------03:38----------
it's almost like my perspective on what


---------03:41----------
is


---------03:42----------
considered normal and what is considered


---------03:45----------
um what's the correct term is


---------03:48----------
what is considered normal is what's


---------03:51----------
considered normal on instagram is not


---------03:52----------
considered normal


---------03:53----------
on everyday life sure so so basically


---------03:56----------
it it only shows the good and it kind of


---------03:59----------
distorts my view on reality


---------04:00----------
and um i'm not saying like oh social


---------04:02----------
media


---------04:04----------
i'm saying like i i truly believe in


---------04:07----------
some aspects of my life it has distorted


---------04:10----------
my view


---------04:11----------
of reality and yeah so i just


---------04:14----------
i just wonder years from now how what's


---------04:17----------
going to happen


---------04:18----------
you know when we because social media is


---------04:20----------
still relatively new


---------04:22----------
years years from now when all these


---------04:23----------
studies come out what's going to be the


---------04:25----------
negative impact of social media and


---------04:28----------
what's


---------04:29----------
and how is it distorting other people's


---------04:31----------
views because


---------04:32----------
i mean you know when you spend multiple


---------04:36----------
hours


---------04:36----------
every day on social media no days off


---------04:40----------
what's what what does that do to you are


---------04:43----------
you afraid of what it's doing to you


---------04:45----------
that's what i'm afraid of i am afraid


---------04:48----------
because i don't know


---------04:48----------
it's this is this is unknown territory


---------04:52----------
in the scientific world because we


---------04:55----------
really don't know it's


---------04:56----------
like i said sign yeah social media is


---------04:58----------
very very new


---------05:00----------
um and we don't you know we don't have a


---------05:03----------
ton of studies on this we don't have


---------05:05----------
decades of you know studies on the


---------05:07----------
impact of social social media on


---------05:10----------
someone um so i'm just i just don't know


---------05:13----------
what's going to happen so i


---------05:15----------
hopefully nothing bad but you know i


---------05:17----------
don't know yeah so so i i think um we


---------05:19----------
don't


---------05:20----------
so it's interesting so i'm going to


---------05:21----------
start just a touch like


---------05:23----------
abstract academic or philosophical i


---------05:26----------
think unfortunately


---------05:27----------
i don't know if we're ever really going


---------05:29----------
to have studies on it


---------05:31----------
and there's a really simple reason for


---------05:32----------
that and that is that


---------05:34----------
the pace at which science studies


---------05:36----------
something


---------05:37----------
is far slower than the pace at which


---------05:39----------
social media is evolving


---------05:42----------
right so this is like kind of different


---------05:44----------
i mean this is


---------05:45----------
relatively new in the history of science


---------05:47----------
so if you look at medicine


---------05:49----------
right like people have been breaking


---------05:50----------
their legs for like millions of years


---------05:52----------
people have been getting infections for


---------05:54----------
millions of years people have had


---------05:55----------
hearts and lungs and hypertension for


---------05:57----------
millions and millions of years


---------05:58----------
people have had cancer for millions and


---------06:00----------
millions of years


---------06:02----------
now there are new kinds of cancer right


---------06:04----------
so when people like started smoking


---------06:05----------
tobacco


---------06:06----------
there's like lung cancer and then we can


---------06:08----------
study that but like people have been


---------06:10----------
smoking tobacco for hundreds of years


---------06:13----------
i think there's something really


---------06:15----------
interesting going on when it comes to


---------06:16----------
things like video game addiction mental


---------06:18----------
health impacts of social media where


---------06:19----------
like


---------06:21----------
you know there are studies like sort of


---------06:24----------
coming out


---------06:24----------
now about like facebook


---------06:29----------
right and like that doesn't even account


---------06:31----------
like it's not even the current iteration


---------06:33----------
of facebook


---------06:34----------
it's like a study published today


---------06:37----------
measured people's like facebook usage


---------06:39----------
three years ago and like facebook is


---------06:41----------
different now


---------06:42----------
oh that's true it's constantly changing


---------06:44----------
isn't it it's not the same


---------06:45----------
whereas cancer will just remain you know


---------06:47----------
yeah so cancer will change a little bit


---------06:49----------
right like we've got covid


---------06:51----------
covid is like relatively new but also


---------06:53----------
we've had coronaviruses i mean the


---------06:55----------
common cold is a coronavirus


---------06:57----------
so we like have known a bunch about


---------06:59----------
coronaviruses we know about you


---------07:00----------
so there's like there's evolution in


---------07:02----------
medicine but generally speaking science


---------07:04----------
can keep up


---------07:05----------
with the change of like physical


---------07:07----------
medicines pacing


---------07:08----------
right whereas social media is evolving


---------07:11----------
so rapidly and technology is evolving so


---------07:13----------
rapidly like


---------07:14----------
we still don't really have a clear sense


---------07:16----------
of whether you know what the risk of


---------07:17----------
keeping your cell phone in your pocket


---------07:19----------
is


---------07:19----------
for testicular cancer like those are the


---------07:21----------
kinds of studies that we're


---------07:23----------
kind of like i i i've always worried


---------07:26----------
about that so i like i always keep my


---------07:27----------
back pocket i'm like i'd rather get butt


---------07:28----------
cancer than yeah


---------07:33----------
but cancer ain't pretty though no it


---------07:35----------
isn't but um


---------07:37----------
so so yeah i mean


---------07:41----------
there's just a lot of weird responses to


---------07:43----------
that statement like you can actually


---------07:45----------
just remove a testicle and like


---------07:47----------
you'll be if you get you know can't


---------07:49----------
can't remove your butt


---------07:52----------
um i guess not i mean you can if you use


---------07:54----------
instagram filters i suppose but


---------07:56----------
um anyway so i think like that's one of


---------07:59----------
the really interesting things where as a


---------08:00----------
mental health professional like i don't


---------08:02----------
i've i've come to an interesting


---------08:05----------
realization and


---------08:06----------
i'm sure that history will prove me


---------08:07----------
wrong because history produce proves


---------08:09----------
most physicians wrong


---------08:11----------
um so i actually i i know it's gonna


---------08:14----------
prove me wrong because


---------08:15----------
we're actually working on that but uh


---------08:18----------
i think that the old system of studying


---------08:20----------
things


---------08:21----------
is too slow and so


---------08:24----------
you know we're going to have to adapt


---------08:26----------
and so one way that we adapt as an


---------08:27----------
organization is like i


---------08:29----------
i don't think we need to worry so much


---------08:31----------
about what effects it's going to have on


---------08:33----------
you


---------08:34----------
because i think you already know like


---------08:36----------
this is the cool thing about clinical


---------08:37----------
medicine is that you don't need studies


---------08:39----------
right like you work with a patient


---------08:41----------
you work with an individual and based on


---------08:43----------
working with an individual you can learn


---------08:45----------
a lot


---------08:47----------
so like my question for you jason is


---------08:49----------
like how has social media already


---------08:51----------
affected you


---------08:53----------
uh well i just i just feel like


---------08:57----------
um i don't want to get too personal


---------09:00----------
about that um but i do


---------09:02----------
feel that we need a need i think there's


---------09:05----------
a need for


---------09:06----------
disclosing when photoshop is used


---------09:09----------
on in pictures and stuff i just feel


---------09:12----------
like


---------09:13----------
there has to be some sort of law of some


---------09:15----------
sort because


---------09:16----------
it's it's so easy to um to


---------09:20----------
you know edit a photo on ins on


---------09:21----------
instagram or even on tic tac or whatever


---------09:25----------
and to show something that's just not


---------09:27----------
true and


---------09:28----------
you you're constantly flooded with this


---------09:30----------
idea that oh my gosh


---------09:32----------
she looks like this oh my gosh this guy


---------09:33----------
has yeah uh so many cars and stuff like


---------09:37----------
that idea of a false reality gets


---------09:40----------
embedded as truth


---------09:41----------
and it can really distort your view on


---------09:44----------
on reality


---------09:45----------
and i just think it's really dangerous


---------09:47----------
and we really have


---------09:48----------
there's nothing we can really do about


---------09:49----------
that um in terms of preventing people


---------09:51----------
from doing that i mean anyone can


---------09:53----------
do whatever they want that's i mean


---------09:54----------
that's the beauty of it you can do


---------09:56----------
whatever you want


---------09:56----------
but also it's like you kind of have to


---------09:58----------
take it with a grain of salt like hey


---------10:00----------
watch out not everything that you see on


---------10:02----------
social media


---------10:03----------
is factual try not to um


---------10:07----------
try not to dive too deep into that yeah


---------10:10----------
so


---------10:11----------
you know it would be interesting i think


---------10:14----------
you're you're kind of talking about a


---------10:16----------
macro solution to a macro problem


---------10:18----------
so as people you know if if people had


---------10:21----------
to state when a filter was used like i


---------10:23----------
think that's


---------10:24----------
one step in the right direction


---------10:27----------
i still think though that i mean you


---------10:30----------
know i don't


---------10:32----------
how can i say this when you look at a


---------10:34----------
pic


---------10:35----------
you know when you look at 10 pretty


---------10:36----------
people in a row on instagram and there's


---------10:38----------
a little disclaimer in the bottom right


---------10:39----------
corner that a filter was used


---------10:41----------
i don't know that your brain is really


---------10:43----------
going to feel any less


---------10:45----------
yeah inadequate right


---------10:49----------
right i don't know i guess i don't know


---------10:51----------
i just don't know if there's


---------10:52----------
an answer for this sort of situation um


---------10:55----------
because i think


---------10:56----------
i think it well not a not a


---------10:59----------
i guess i would just yeah delete


---------11:00----------
instagram delete you know social media


---------11:02----------
not the one that i was thinking of but


---------11:04----------
that's an answer too


---------11:06----------
why what were you thinking well because


---------11:08----------
i i think that there are two things that


---------11:10----------
you can


---------11:10----------
there are two dimensions that you can


---------11:12----------
act right one is on the outer world


---------11:14----------
and one is on you


---------11:17----------
so so you know you were asking at the


---------11:19----------
very beginning you were kind of talking


---------11:20----------
about what youtubers face what content


---------11:22----------
creators kind of face in terms of mental


---------11:23----------
health challenges and


---------11:24----------
this is where like we've actually


---------11:26----------
learned a lot and there are things that


---------11:28----------
you can do right so like like so


---------11:31----------
let me just give you kind of a quick


---------11:33----------
example and if i'm getting too far


---------11:34----------
off track for you just let me know no


---------11:36----------
you're good so so i think the really


---------11:38----------
cool thing is if you look at like


---------11:40----------
ancient like


---------11:40----------
india and china there was a lot of


---------11:42----------
research that was done on like how the


---------11:44----------
mind functions like in its


---------11:46----------
fundamental parts so we have this thing


---------11:49----------
called


---------11:49----------
ego or ahamgara is what they call it


---------11:52----------
so ahamkada is sort of translated as ego


---------11:55----------
but technically the translation is like


---------11:57----------
the i feeling


---------11:58----------
the feeling of i so it also gets


---------12:00----------
translated as like your sense of


---------12:01----------
identity


---------12:03----------
and what the yogi's kind of figured out


---------12:05----------
is that there are some things that will


---------12:07----------
cause the ahamkara to like


---------12:09----------
get worse so comparison is a good


---------12:12----------
example


---------12:13----------
so like a comparison makes our ego or


---------12:16----------
our sense of self feel worse


---------12:19----------
what's that quote uh comparison as a


---------12:21----------
thief of joy


---------12:23----------
yeah i've heard that a lot recently


---------12:25----------
right yeah absolutely it's it's a


---------12:27----------
fantastic quote


---------12:28----------
and so the yogis also said that the


---------12:31----------
greater you're a hum god and the more


---------12:32----------
you're suffering


---------12:34----------
which is yeah well i mean since you're


---------12:37----------
on that topic i kind of did dive into


---------12:39----------
into buddhism because i was really


---------12:40----------
interested in that because


---------12:42----------
basically it's all it's like everything


---------12:45----------
in life


---------12:46----------
is like life is pain life is life is


---------12:49----------
miserable


---------12:50----------
and um it's it's like


---------12:53----------
understanding that life oh my gosh i i


---------12:56----------
forgot i had a really good quote for


---------12:58----------
this


---------12:59----------
um but i did dive into buddhism it was


---------13:00----------
just really interesting because i i


---------13:02----------
really felt connected to it because it's


---------13:03----------
like


---------13:04----------
er life is pain life is miserable but


---------13:06----------
like we it's just the way we go about it


---------13:08----------
gosh i'm sorry i haven't i haven't dived


---------13:10----------
into in a while but


---------13:11----------
i i was really obsessed with buddhism


---------13:13----------
for about six months ago


---------13:16----------
and can you help me understand why you


---------13:18----------
got interested in it


---------13:19----------
i mean it's because


---------13:23----------
gosh this is this is embarrassing


---------13:24----------
because i


---------13:26----------
i was like obsessed with it for the


---------13:27----------
longest time and now i can't remember


---------13:29----------
either hold on hold on jason jason this


---------13:30----------
is a good opportunity close your eyes


---------13:32----------
okay what are you feeling right now


---------13:36----------
um well i i'm frustrated because i wanna


---------13:40----------
i wanna figure out i had a really good


---------13:42----------
quote yep it was so awesome


---------13:45----------
yeah i couldn't find it yeah so so so


---------13:48----------
how does it feel


---------13:49----------
stop looking for the quote okay eyes


---------13:52----------
closed


---------13:54----------
how does it so notice like the


---------13:56----------
intolerability


---------13:57----------
you gotta find it you see what your mind


---------13:59----------
is doing well i think that's just my


---------14:01----------
adhd as well


---------14:02----------
sure so that's still your mind but you


---------14:05----------
you got to find it right


---------14:07----------
and what happens if you didn't find it


---------14:11----------
i get frustrated because i want to share


---------14:12----------
this this amazing


---------14:14----------
knowledge with so many people and i


---------14:15----------
can't share it yeah right


---------14:18----------
so like can you let that go


---------14:23----------
no i like educating i like educating


---------14:26----------
people


---------14:26----------
i love i love teaching people i i'm i'm


---------14:29----------
very


---------14:30----------
passionate about teaching which is why i


---------14:32----------
love my job


---------14:33----------
okay find a quote bro


---------14:37----------
if you want to hold up three it's gonna


---------14:40----------
take three seconds here i got this okay


---------14:42----------
okay i finally found it um oh


---------14:45----------
oh so that's it everyone is suffering


---------14:48----------
everyone is suffering with something


---------14:49----------
life is suffering and um


---------14:53----------
i three so all life is suffering the


---------14:55----------
second point is


---------14:56----------
the cause of all suffering is desire


---------15:00----------
and to remove


---------15:04----------
to remove the suffering you have to


---------15:05----------
remove the desire that's the three


---------15:07----------
points


---------15:08----------
so from the top all life is suffering


---------15:11----------
the cause of suffering is desire and to


---------15:13----------
remove the suffering


---------15:15----------
you have to remove the desire and i


---------15:16----------
really connected with that on buddhism i


---------15:18----------
thought it was really interesting


---------15:20----------
okay how do you feel having shared that


---------15:25----------
because i feel like i i just feel like i


---------15:28----------
i shared knowledge with people how does


---------15:30----------
that feel yeah


---------15:32----------
right so now this is really tricky


---------15:34----------
because


---------15:35----------
you had a desire to share it yes


---------15:39----------
and as a result i was suffering i was


---------15:42----------
suffering


---------15:43----------
because of my desire ah but to share you


---------15:46----------
shared and once you shared you were


---------15:48----------
happy


---------15:50----------
right and so then how do we approach


---------15:52----------
those noble truths that you have there


---------15:55----------
right so what how do we say because it


---------15:57----------
didn't i mean wouldn't you say that


---------15:59----------
if you you know the fulfillment of


---------16:01----------
desire leads to happiness


---------16:04----------
um i don't know because that's what


---------16:06----------
happened with you just now right yeah


---------16:08----------
yeah


---------16:08----------
yeah yeah good about yourself right


---------16:10----------
right that's correct


---------16:13----------
so why isn't that on there why isn't one


---------16:15----------
on there


---------16:16----------
that i feel like your desires leads to


---------16:18----------
happiness


---------16:19----------
um i i


---------16:23----------
i mean i guess i maybe maybe just a


---------16:25----------
little bit of happiness but


---------16:27----------
i i do i do feel connected in the in in


---------16:30----------
those


---------16:30----------
those noble truths there because it's


---------16:32----------
almost like i just i just feel


---------16:34----------
so kind because there's just pain


---------16:36----------
there's suffering everywhere


---------16:37----------
and it's all because we have a desire


---------16:41----------
and if with with desire comes suffering


---------16:43----------
and it's just


---------16:44----------
you know if you want something you got


---------16:45----------
to work for it and that's the most basic


---------16:48----------
form of desire uh you know you're gonna


---------16:52----------
suffer and you will be rewarded


---------16:54----------
but you're gonna suffer to get it yeah


---------16:57----------
so so this is kind of interesting right


---------16:58----------
because i i don't think that


---------17:00----------
the noble truth say anything about a


---------17:02----------
reward through suffering


---------17:04----------
no but i'm just kind of like


---------17:07----------
piggybacking off what you just said


---------17:08----------
because there is a


---------17:09----------
i guess there is a reward but even if


---------17:11----------
it's just for a short amount of time


---------17:14----------
yeah so that's that's the key thing


---------17:17----------
right so if we if so i think what


---------17:18----------
buddhism discovers so like let's talk


---------17:20----------
about a cookie for example


---------17:22----------
like so if i want to eat a cookie and i


---------17:26----------
eat the cookie


---------17:28----------
am i happy


---------17:32----------
what what was your objective did you


---------17:35----------
want to eat


---------17:35----------
yeah you wanted you wanted to i wanted


---------17:37----------
the cookie man it's a warm


---------17:39----------
freshly baked chocolate chip cookie bro


---------17:41----------
and after you eat it do you feel any


---------17:43----------
sort of regret


---------17:45----------
sure okay then


---------17:48----------
i don't know what to say right so so so


---------17:51----------
i'll ask you when you eat


---------17:52----------
do you like chocolate chip cookies i


---------17:54----------
love chocolate chip cookies everyone


---------17:55----------
does


---------17:56----------
yeah and when you eat a chocolate chip


---------17:58----------
cookie do you feel regret


---------18:00----------
um well maybe a little bit


---------18:04----------
but i'm also kind of a health freak


---------18:06----------
let's see


---------18:07----------
so this is this is what this is what the


---------18:09----------
what this discovered


---------18:11----------
you [ __ ] asked me a question i asked


---------18:12----------
you the same damn question and your


---------18:14----------
answer is at least a little bit


---------18:16----------
so right


---------18:19----------
so like this is the crazy thing about


---------18:21----------
even satisfying your desire which we


---------18:24----------
think makes us happy


---------18:26----------
but then the more that you look at it


---------18:28----------
okay one cookie oh no now it's gone


---------18:31----------
there's suffering there i want another


---------18:34----------
one


---------18:34----------
exactly it's so goofy because i almost


---------18:37----------
feel like it applies to everything in


---------18:38----------
life


---------18:39----------
yes are you are you


---------18:42----------
are you buddhist sure


---------18:48----------
i don't i don't know because you seem


---------18:49----------
very knowledgeable because i feel like a


---------18:50----------
lot of people don't


---------18:52----------
aren't unaware of this yeah so i'm


---------18:55----------
pretty knowledgeable about buddhism but


---------18:57----------
i i think


---------18:58----------
so the first thing is like buddhism is


---------19:00----------
like not really religion


---------19:02----------
no it's just a way of life yeah so so


---------19:04----------
like in buddhism is essentially like


---------19:07----------
i mean i'm sure a lot of buddhists will


---------19:08----------
take offense to this but


---------19:10----------
you know it's an outgrowth of like what


---------19:12----------
we call the hindu tradition


---------19:15----------
right so there's particular like their


---------19:17----------
hinduism is a


---------19:18----------
is also not really a religion because


---------19:20----------
it's so many different things it's


---------19:21----------
simultaneously


---------19:22----------
atheistic monotheistic and polytheistic


---------19:25----------
so i sort of know that


---------19:27----------
yeah so i sort of follow the the branch


---------19:29----------
of hinduism


---------19:30----------
which is like sort of atheistic


---------19:34----------
which is sort of basically buddhism


---------19:37----------
cool but whether it's hinduism or


---------19:38----------
buddhism i mean buddha grew up in india


---------19:41----------
all of his teachings


---------19:42----------
you know come from his own experiences


---------19:44----------
but are rooted in


---------19:46----------
quote-unquote hindu traditions but all


---------19:48----------
of those like


---------19:49----------
all of those labels and ownership of


---------19:52----------
what


---------19:52----------
is who is like all western those are all


---------19:55----------
like based on monotheistic


---------19:57----------
judeo-christian conceptions of religion


---------19:59----------
which is you are


---------20:00----------
something or you aren't something which


---------20:02----------
like that concept doesn't really apply


---------20:04----------
to what i call


---------20:05----------
the karmic religions right yeah


---------20:08----------
i don't know i've always been fascinated


---------20:10----------
with um i've always been fascinated with


---------20:13----------
just learning about different religions


---------20:15----------
learning about different ways of life


---------20:16----------
how to live


---------20:18----------
i've always been a very uh i'm not


---------20:20----------
saying like oh i'm a


---------20:21----------
i'm a scholar or anything but i've


---------20:23----------
always been very fascinated with


---------20:25----------
like um you know psychology and


---------20:28----------
um philosophers and what's wrong with


---------20:31----------
saying you're a scholar


---------20:34----------
what is the definition of a scholar


---------20:37----------
i think it's what you do


---------20:41----------
what i do on daily dose internet


---------20:44----------
i think you're a scholar that's


---------20:48----------
that's a wonderful compliment thank you


---------20:49----------
so much


---------20:52----------
all right i don't feel that way either


---------20:54----------
but


---------20:55----------
why not well i don't know


---------20:58----------
i thought a scholar was someone who who


---------21:01----------
um


---------21:02----------
who really dived into something and they


---------21:05----------
uh


---------21:05----------
they they're extremely knowledgeable


---------21:07----------
much more


---------21:08----------
because i i just scratched the surface


---------21:10----------
and everything i go oh that's


---------21:11----------
interesting and they kind of move on


---------21:13----------
okay yeah so so you know how would you


---------21:17----------
know when you've gone far enough


---------21:20----------
um what's the there's i don't know who


---------21:22----------
said the quote this um


---------21:24----------
ancient quote they said i know that


---------21:27----------
i know that i know nothing so that's the


---------21:30----------
answer to that question


---------21:32----------
yeah okay you never know you never know


---------21:35----------
okay so do you feel like you don't


---------21:36----------
understand buddhism well enough


---------21:38----------
i don't i mean i forgot the three noble


---------21:40----------
truths


---------21:41----------
doesn't that by definition make you a


---------21:43----------
scholar


---------21:45----------
i guess i guess so is i guess is if


---------21:48----------
anyone has a


---------21:50----------
ounce of curiosity they are a scholar


---------21:55----------
so you just you just inflated the egos


---------21:58----------
of so many


---------21:59----------
so many people who might be unknown


---------22:02----------
interestingly enough i think it's your


---------22:04----------
ego that gets in the way of you like


---------22:06----------
calling yourself a scholar


---------22:09----------
what do you mean that means i don't have


---------22:11----------
an ego then no no i think it's you're


---------22:13----------
actually your ego so your ego says i'm


---------22:15----------
not good enough to be a scholar


---------22:18----------
this is the way that real scholars are


---------22:20----------
and look at me


---------22:21----------
i'm just an amateur well i


---------22:26----------
this is so goofy i've never thought


---------22:28----------
about this yeah i mean


---------22:29----------
i guess i guess you're right right


---------22:32----------
you're saying it's there's a voice in


---------22:33----------
your head that says


---------22:34----------
i am not this that's [ __ ] ego


---------22:37----------
yeah i'm the best person in the world


---------22:39----------
[ __ ] ego i'm the worst person in the


---------22:41----------
world [ __ ] ego


---------22:43----------
you know i was thinking about this the


---------22:44----------
other day i was like when i was growing


---------22:46----------
up when i was a teenager i really


---------22:47----------
i truly believe i knew everything like i


---------22:50----------
thought i was so smart i


---------22:51----------
you know i don't need my parents help


---------22:52----------
all this stuff and then i got older i


---------22:55----------
went oh my gosh i don't know anything


---------22:57----------
i know nothing and it's so goofy how


---------22:59----------
that works out


---------23:00----------
yeah so i think that that's how do you


---------23:02----------
think that happened


---------23:04----------
uh i gosh hormones or something i'm not


---------23:06----------
sure


---------23:09----------
if only hormones could make people


---------23:10----------
humble the world would be a very


---------23:12----------
different place


---------23:12----------
[Laughter]


---------23:14----------
i have no idea here's an injection of


---------23:17----------
the humble hormone


---------23:18----------
yeah so i think you know jason you


---------23:20----------
mentioned


---------23:21----------
i asked you one semi-personal question


---------23:23----------
and you kind of steered away from it so


---------23:26----------
if you really want to know how that hap


---------23:27----------
happened i i would


---------23:29----------
have to we could explore that together


---------23:31----------
because i suspect like i don't think it


---------23:33----------
was just


---------23:34----------
hormones i think that i think what makes


---------23:37----------
you


---------23:38----------
scholarly i don't know what a skull i


---------23:40----------
mean is that a job i don't know


---------23:42----------
but what makes you scholarly is i think


---------23:43----------
you're curious and i think you know you


---------23:45----------
devote


---------23:46----------
what attention your mind is capable of


---------23:48----------
on on a particular thing


---------23:50----------
um and i think that our society tends to


---------23:53----------
undervalue


---------23:54----------
breadth of knowledge to depth of


---------23:56----------
knowledge yeah


---------23:58----------
yeah i don't i don't think that depth of


---------24:00----------
knowledge is


---------24:01----------
necessarily superior to breath of


---------24:03----------
knowledge


---------24:04----------
you know i wasn't always really curious


---------24:06----------
like i'm i'm i'm more curious than i've


---------24:08----------
ever been in my life i i just want to


---------24:09----------
know the answers to everything and then


---------24:11----------
the more answers i find the more


---------24:13----------
the more questions i get and i if that


---------24:16----------
does


---------24:16----------
that sort of [ __ ] scholar i mean


---------24:19----------
i don't know i don't know but like


---------24:22----------
because i


---------24:23----------
i was never this curious i mean um i


---------24:25----------
said this


---------24:26----------
i said this to some of my friends i said


---------24:27----------
i i felt like i lived


---------24:29----------
uh i think i even made a tweet about


---------24:31----------
this i felt like i lived


---------24:33----------
on my life on autopilot up until i was


---------24:36----------
about


---------24:37----------
maybe maybe i was about 23


---------24:40----------
and that's when the first time i i truly


---------24:42----------
felt like i was awake


---------24:43----------
as i i truly felt awake for the very


---------24:45----------
first time in my life and


---------24:47----------
oh my gosh and i i just got extremely


---------24:50----------
curious about everything around me


---------24:52----------
and i think it's because you know i


---------24:54----------
graduated from college and


---------24:55----------
it's my first time living on my own and


---------24:57----------
i go wait


---------24:58----------
no one's telling me what to do where to


---------25:00----------
go and it's like the first time in my


---------25:03----------
entire life that i've had to make my own


---------25:06----------
decisions


---------25:06----------
and that kind of just opened up my


---------25:08----------
entire uh


---------25:10----------
personality to trying to figure out life


---------25:16----------
how did that happen well it's because


---------25:19----------
i mean um i had a i had


---------25:22----------
a wonderful wonderful upbringing with


---------25:24----------
loving parents and loving family


---------25:27----------
however for some reason well a couple


---------25:31----------
problems here


---------25:32----------
i since i had adhd growing up


---------25:35----------
my that caused a lot of problems and it


---------25:38----------
caused a lot of self-doubt in me


---------25:40----------
and it caused me to be extremely reliant


---------25:42----------
on my parents for their opinions


---------25:44----------
for on my career goals anything


---------25:48----------
uh what i should do they helped me with


---------25:50----------
everything which is great but it left me


---------25:52----------
very helpless so i had no self


---------25:54----------
self identity like if you just if you


---------25:56----------
asked me what my personality was when i


---------25:58----------
was in high school i'd


---------25:59----------
be like i have no idea i don't i truly


---------26:02----------
didn't feel like i had a sense


---------26:04----------
of of self whatsoever um


---------26:07----------
and then that that sense of self grew in


---------26:09----------
college but it really


---------26:11----------
took off after college because it was


---------26:12----------
the first time i was really on my own i


---------26:14----------
wasn't reliant on my parents or anything


---------26:16----------
at all


---------26:17----------
and um i was able to to


---------26:20----------
become my own person and it's beautiful


---------26:23----------
like a little


---------26:24----------
blooming flower can you tell us about


---------26:27----------
that person now


---------26:29----------
um well i don't know it's just a


---------26:33----------
like i said i was very timid i had no


---------26:35----------
self-confidence and the biggest thing is


---------26:37----------
that


---------26:39----------
the best way for someone to grow


---------26:41----------
confidence


---------26:42----------
is to be good at something this this


---------26:45----------
youtube thing is the first time i've


---------26:46----------
ever had confidence in my life


---------26:48----------
and i've said this many times i i thank


---------26:50----------
people on twitter


---------26:51----------
all the time i go you know thank you for


---------26:54----------
changing my life


---------26:55----------
youtube changed my life it gave me a


---------26:57----------
sense of


---------26:59----------
of confidence that i've never had my


---------27:00----------
life i was never good at anything i was


---------27:02----------
never good i mean


---------27:03----------
never good enough at anything to be


---------27:05----------
considered you know


---------27:06----------
uh whatever um so this is the first time


---------27:09----------
in my life where i was actually


---------27:11----------
better at other people at this um for


---------27:14----------
for whatever reason


---------27:16----------
and it grew my confidence and it didn't


---------27:18----------
make me cocky or anything but it made me


---------27:20----------
go like oh my gosh like i feel proud


---------27:24----------
of of what i've accomplished which is


---------27:26----------
something i've never really felt before


---------27:27----------
in my life


---------27:28----------
and yeah yeah sorry go keep going


---------27:32----------
i don't think i had anything else uh and


---------27:34----------
what did you accomplish


---------27:36----------
jason um like i said um


---------27:40----------
when i i quit my i quit my job at the


---------27:42----------
bank uh


---------27:43----------
so february 2nd was my last


---------27:47----------
my last day uh so three years ago


---------27:50----------
okay so fibroid cycle was three days ago


---------27:52----------
that was the three year anniversary of


---------27:54----------
me quitting my job at the bank


---------27:56----------
and i was working at the bank and i


---------28:00----------
worked there for two years after college


---------28:01----------
and i didn't know what to do i only went


---------28:03----------
there because my


---------28:04----------
my uncle helped me get a job he you know


---------28:06----------
he knew a guy who knew a guy so help me


---------28:07----------
get a job


---------28:09----------
um but that was not my decision that was


---------28:11----------
not my my life goal that was not my


---------28:13----------
so obviously how am i supposed to have


---------28:14----------
confidence in something that i know


---------28:17----------
nothing true um also that job i did not


---------28:20----------
need a college degree for


---------28:22----------
i literally felt i felt like a monkey


---------28:24----------
pushing buttons


---------28:25----------
um so it's just it's just unfortunate


---------28:27----------
because my parents


---------28:29----------
and me spent so much money on my college


---------28:32----------
degree just to


---------28:33----------
be a monkey pushy button pushing button


---------28:36----------
so


---------28:37----------
i'm happy that i got out of there but i


---------28:40----------
really grew


---------28:41----------
into my sense of self once i did


---------28:43----------
something on my own like my


---------28:45----------
when i told my my family like i think i


---------28:48----------
want to quit the bank and do youtube


---------28:50----------
full-time


---------28:52----------
and like i got a lot of backlash oh no


---------28:54----------
no no you got to save the bank you got


---------28:56----------
to say because you get you know it's


---------28:57----------
that makes sense our parents grew up in


---------28:59----------
a time when it's you know


---------29:01----------
the internet's the unknown the scary


---------29:03----------
place you don't know what's going to


---------29:04----------
happen


---------29:05----------
and i'm like i'm going to try this i


---------29:07----------
know it goes against everything that my


---------29:09----------
family


---------29:10----------
really wants me to do and i i relied on


---------29:12----------
on their advice for such the long


---------29:14----------
such a long time and it was the first


---------29:16----------
time i went i


---------29:17----------
don't want to take your advice and i


---------29:19----------
felt very empowering because i felt


---------29:21----------
confident enough i was like i


---------29:23----------
really as a fir seriously the first time


---------29:25----------
i really didn't take my


---------29:26----------
my family's advice i was like i want to


---------29:28----------
do this i want to give it a shot


---------29:31----------
i don't i don't want to pressure you um


---------29:35----------
with what i'm going to say i just want


---------29:36----------
to share something i just really wish


---------29:37----------
people could see her face right now


---------29:40----------
yeah yeah um i i we don't know


---------29:44----------
you think i'm pretty no i think your


---------29:47----------
face says a lot i mean i think people


---------29:49----------
can tell


---------29:50----------
what your words mean but i think like


---------29:54----------
you can see like the hope there's you


---------29:56----------
know


---------29:58----------
yeah there's a good i'm not i'm not i'm


---------30:00----------
not saying we should change anything i'm


---------30:01----------
just


---------30:02----------
commenting we'll we'll see we'll see


---------30:04----------
what people people do next time huh we


---------30:06----------
could do another one


---------30:08----------
yeah whatever well it's worth it i just


---------30:09----------
maybe it was inappropriate for me to say


---------30:11----------
but i just wanted to


---------30:12----------
let let me put it this way i really i


---------30:15----------
really enjoyed being able to see your


---------30:17----------
face in that moment so i'm glad you're


---------30:19----------
on video


---------30:19----------
at least for me


---------30:31----------
and we're not going anywhere close your


---------30:32----------
eyes all right what happened


---------30:35----------
we're going to do it again we're going


---------30:36----------
to measure what's the desire what's


---------30:38----------
happening we're going to play this game


---------30:39----------
round two how do you feel about


---------30:42----------
going on camera in front of the internet


---------30:44----------
i think it'll be funny


---------30:46----------
but i mean i've done i've done this


---------30:48----------
before i did the um


---------30:49----------
i'm not i'm not afraid or anything i


---------30:51----------
mean i've i've shown my face


---------30:54----------
like a few times on the internet so it's


---------30:55----------
whatever but like i'm not


---------30:57----------
it's not like a big face review or


---------30:59----------
anything you can just but at the same


---------31:00----------
time i've never really um


---------31:03----------
done like a uh like a podcast


---------31:06----------
i think like a live i like a live video


---------31:08----------
of me so


---------31:10----------
let's do it so is that coming from


---------31:14----------
a tranquil mind yeah yeah i mean i'm not


---------31:17----------
a crazy person


---------31:18----------
so okay


---------31:22----------
i i swear in my life you're okay okay


---------31:26----------
all right


---------31:31----------
okay do you feel nervous no not at all


---------31:34----------
okay if you don't feel nervous then


---------31:37----------
because because you know sometimes


---------31:38----------
people will say they don't feel nervous


---------31:40----------
i'm just like i think that like you know


---------31:42----------
don't get me wrong jason your voice is


---------31:44----------
awesome


---------31:45----------
but your face is too bro thank you


---------31:49----------
okay hold on a second figure out how to


---------31:52----------
do this


---------31:55----------
oh besides then i can show off my cool


---------31:57----------
standing desk then when you get the


---------31:58----------
camera going


---------32:00----------
um let me just figure out sorry i just i


---------32:02----------
just got a standing desk and i love it


---------32:05----------
um okay all right


---------32:09----------
anyway so we can just keep talking cool


---------32:11----------
we're good


---------32:12----------
we're live yep so cool


---------32:15----------
so but so you said that developing


---------32:19----------
confidence is about being good at


---------32:20----------
something right


---------32:22----------
right okay so


---------32:25----------
did you feel like you were good at


---------32:27----------
something when you told your parents


---------32:28----------
that you wanted to do this


---------32:30----------
yeah i felt like i was i knew something


---------32:32----------
that they didn't know


---------32:33----------
and i felt like um i was more


---------32:36----------
knowledgeable


---------32:37----------
about about youtube and what goes about


---------32:40----------
it than they do


---------32:41----------
so i just felt like i


---------32:44----------
i felt extremely confident about what i


---------32:46----------
wanted to do and


---------32:48----------
so yeah it's it's been now it's a three


---------32:50----------
year anniversary of me quitting


---------32:51----------
the bank and it was a big decision it's


---------32:53----------
kind of funny um


---------32:54----------
i didn't i didn't know


---------32:57----------
you got to put in the two-week thing and


---------32:59----------
i guess you don't technically have to


---------33:01----------
but um i guess you don't technically


---------33:04----------
have to but i was kind enough to do that


---------33:06----------
and it just so happened to end up on


---------33:07----------
groundhog day which is so funny


---------33:09----------
because it's like it's so like symbolic


---------33:11----------
groundhog day you wake up do the same


---------33:12----------
thing over and over again


---------33:14----------
hating your life um hopefully a lot of


---------33:16----------
you people saw that movie


---------33:18----------
um but um


---------33:21----------
yeah so it's just kind of symbolic in


---------33:23----------
many ways that's an easy day to remember


---------33:24----------
like oh my gosh groundhog day


---------33:26----------
the day that i don't have to go to the


---------33:28----------
bank yeah that's actually


---------33:30----------
you know quite the karmic coincidence


---------33:35----------
what it's funny like i didn't know what


---------33:38----------
i was doing at the bank


---------33:39----------
whatsoever like at all and um


---------33:43----------
so you know how like most jobs they have


---------33:46----------
performance reviews and they're like


---------33:48----------
um they'll be like how what did you


---------33:51----------
oh sorry phone's ringing you


---------33:54----------
you'll do like performance reviews where


---------33:57----------
um


---------33:58----------
like whether it's like a six month


---------34:00----------
review out of the year review


---------34:03----------
most people would talk about all the


---------34:04----------
things that they accomplished


---------34:06----------
and all the amazing things they did


---------34:08----------
during that year like almost


---------34:10----------
most people do when they do a job like


---------34:11----------
here's what i did i helped on this


---------34:13----------
report i did


---------34:14----------
this task and and they'd be like you


---------34:17----------
know a page long


---------34:19----------
every time i had a performance review i


---------34:22----------
wrote


---------34:22----------
one sentence and all i said was


---------34:26----------
i just want to get better and i left at


---------34:29----------
that


---------34:30----------
my boss called me and called me in the


---------34:31----------
office the first time i did that


---------34:33----------
i did it like five times i just want to


---------34:36----------
get better


---------34:38----------
and the first time she went what's going


---------34:40----------
on here like most people give like all


---------34:41----------
the things that i did i'm like


---------34:44----------
i don't even know like i i really don't


---------34:46----------
know much


---------34:47----------
about banking i'm i'm just trying to get


---------34:49----------
better every day


---------34:50----------
i really don't know what i'm doing like


---------34:52----------
i'll be honest like i really don't know


---------34:53----------
what i'm doing


---------34:54----------
i just know what i need to do


---------34:58----------
so yeah and then what did she say


---------35:02----------
i just she was like okay whatever


---------35:05----------
whatever yeah so


---------35:08----------
yeah i get the feeling jason that you


---------35:10----------
weren't really living your life back


---------35:12----------
then


---------35:13----------
no i wasn't and it feels to me like


---------35:16----------
you're living your life now


---------35:18----------
i've wanted to be a youtuber since i was


---------35:20----------
16. so


---------35:21----------
this is this is my dream job well


---------35:22----------
actually my yes i guess in my dream job


---------35:25----------
my other job was i want that i wanted to


---------35:27----------
be


---------35:27----------
is i wanted to be a high school guidance


---------35:29----------
counselor um because i had a


---------35:31----------
such an awesome high school guidance


---------35:33----------
counselor super cool


---------35:34----------
and um and i was like this is such a


---------35:38----------
cool job all you do is call in students


---------35:40----------
every day and go like talk and he would


---------35:43----------
invite me like


---------35:44----------
what do you want to talk about like


---------35:44----------
what's going on like i think that's such


---------35:46----------
a cool job just like


---------35:47----------
just get inside the heads of uh of how


---------35:50----------
the kids are doing


---------35:51----------
in in high school so that was my other


---------35:53----------
dream job that i want to do because i


---------35:55----------
think just


---------35:55----------
it's just interesting just to you know


---------35:57----------
give that support to


---------35:59----------
to people who might be not feeling too


---------36:01----------
great


---------36:03----------
sounds like that it's kind of


---------36:06----------
interesting because i'm


---------36:07----------
noticing some


---------36:11----------
irregularities in your story what do you


---------36:14----------
mean


---------36:14----------
so the first is that like you kind of


---------36:16----------
said that you didn't really like you


---------36:17----------
weren't like a real person until 23.


---------36:20----------
you know that's sort of the impression


---------36:21----------
that i got is that like you were just


---------36:23----------
listening to your parents and like kind


---------36:25----------
of going to autopilot and stuff like


---------36:26----------
that


---------36:27----------
but and then you kind of go back and you


---------36:29----------
say actually like


---------36:30----------
you wanted to be a youtuber since you


---------36:32----------
were 16. oh i did but i didn't i didn't


---------36:34----------
seriously like i was like oh it's not


---------36:35----------
going to happen like no one's going to


---------36:36----------
watch me or anything so yeah but


---------36:39----------
so it's it's a really important


---------36:40----------
distinction right so i i think actually


---------36:43----------
like


---------36:43----------
jason you've been a person all along you


---------36:45----------
just didn't have the confidence to know


---------36:47----------
it


---------36:48----------
maybe yeah that was probably it maybe


---------36:49----------
that was the situation there right


---------36:51----------
because it's like you knew what you


---------36:52----------
wanted you just didn't have faith in


---------36:54----------
yourself that like


---------36:55----------
you your opinions were good ones because


---------36:58----------
you were


---------37:00----------
yeah yeah well i mean i didn't really


---------37:02----------
get in i didn't get in


---------37:04----------
that's why everyone was kind of my


---------37:05----------
friend in high school


---------37:07----------
i i didn't have any i didn't get in any


---------37:10----------
arguments whatsoever because i was not


---------37:12----------
knowledgeable enough to


---------37:13----------
uh think of any counterpoints like oh


---------37:16----------
that's like that's a good point i don't


---------37:18----------
know i just kind of agreed with everyone


---------37:19----------
if you agree with that


---------37:20----------
with everyone it's pretty easy to get


---------37:22----------
along yeah


---------37:25----------
you're kind of a chameleon yeah i just


---------37:27----------
kind of blended in


---------37:28----------
it's kind of it's kind of goofy because


---------37:30----------
i kind of just um blended in with


---------37:31----------
everyone else i'd be like no matter what


---------37:33----------
friend group i was with i was like oh i


---------37:34----------
guess i have to act this way now i gotta


---------37:36----------
act this way now


---------37:37----------
so i just kind of changed my personality


---------37:39----------
based on who i was with which is


---------37:40----------
obviously


---------37:41----------
not the best thing to do but um who are


---------37:44----------
you


---------37:46----------
um i i don't i don't know who i am i


---------37:50----------
don't know who i am


---------37:51----------
uh i'm just uh i'm just some guy trying


---------37:53----------
to get through life like everyone else


---------37:56----------
does that question make you


---------37:57----------
uncomfortable no


---------38:00----------
no what if i said what if i said i


---------38:03----------
didn't


---------38:04----------
believe you that you don't know who you


---------38:06----------
are


---------38:08----------
i'd be like you're okay


---------38:13----------
like i don't care so so so it's it's


---------38:16----------
interesting because


---------38:17----------
jason here's what i would say i think


---------38:19----------
you know who you are i just don't think


---------38:20----------
you know how to explain it


---------38:22----------
i i don't know how to explain either i


---------38:24----------
don't know i really don't know


---------38:26----------
you really don't know who you are oh my


---------38:27----------
gosh should i just turn off my monitor


---------38:30----------
you may have turned off your monitor but


---------38:31----------
we can see you fine


---------38:33----------
okay i think i'm back i don't know what


---------38:35----------
just happened there i'm back


---------38:37----------
uh yeah so i always say something about


---------38:40----------
i don't know who i am yeah do you do you


---------38:42----------
really not feel like you know who you


---------38:43----------
are


---------38:44----------
uh no i know i like i i don't even know


---------38:47----------
how to


---------38:48----------
what's the definition of that i don't


---------38:49----------
even know how to explain that


---------38:51----------
like what if i if i say who are you


---------38:54----------
like what would you say i'm me


---------38:58----------
okay well i'm me too so what's the


---------39:00----------
problem there's no problem


---------39:02----------
right so so here's here's what my


---------39:04----------
problem is that when you say you don't


---------39:05----------
know who you are i call [ __ ]


---------39:08----------
okay that makes sense okay well i mean


---------39:11----------
but i just get


---------39:11----------
i i mean i i don't and now it's gets


---------39:14----------
tricky because we know you're a


---------39:15----------
chameleon


---------39:16----------
so are you just playing along because


---------39:18----------
that's what i want to hear like do you


---------39:19----------
like because i i get the sense that


---------39:20----------
you're


---------39:20----------
i mean we talked about how you're


---------39:22----------
confident in yourself like you know who


---------39:23----------
you are


---------39:24----------
well i mean what i don't know what the


---------39:26----------
correct answer here is like do i just


---------39:28----------
say i'm a youtuber i make youtube videos


---------39:30----------
i mean


---------39:31----------
i'm a i'm a i'm a guy that just wants


---------39:33----------
i'm the curious person that just wants


---------39:34----------
to learn about the world


---------39:36----------
like i don't know there's just so many


---------39:37----------
different answers for that kind of


---------39:38----------
question


---------39:39----------
yeah good so now we get back to buddhism


---------39:42----------
yes


---------39:43----------
so because you're saying all of those


---------39:45----------
things are not


---------39:46----------
don't capture the essence of who i am


---------39:48----------
that's actually what i'm hearing


---------39:51----------
yeah i think so it's sort of like if i


---------39:55----------
look at a house


---------39:56----------
from one side that's not the whole house


---------39:59----------
and then if i walk around to the side of


---------40:01----------
the house that's not the whole house


---------40:02----------
either


---------40:04----------
and then if i walk around to the back


---------40:05----------
that's not the whole house


---------40:08----------
and so could you be described as a


---------40:09----------
youtuber sure


---------40:11----------
could you be described as i think a


---------40:13----------
little bit closer to the truth


---------40:15----------
of who you are is that you're just a


---------40:17----------
curious guy who likes to teach people


---------40:19----------
things


---------40:20----------
yeah that's what i love the most because


---------40:22----------
like i really wanted to be a teacher i


---------40:24----------
really wanted


---------40:24----------
to teach people things now i really can


---------40:26----------
so whenever i get something educational


---------40:27----------
i get so excited because i don't want to


---------40:29----------
like bore people with educational stuff


---------40:31----------
but like if i find something that's


---------40:32----------
genuinely


---------40:33----------
interesting i'm like ass let's go i got


---------40:36----------
something good


---------40:37----------
like because there's a lot of stuff that


---------40:39----------
people um you know


---------40:40----------
a lot of schools won't teach for


---------40:42----------
whatever reason or it's not like


---------40:44----------
controversial stuff just like they can't


---------40:45----------
cover


---------40:46----------
everything so they're not gonna talk


---------40:47----------
about here's a cool video


---------40:50----------
um here's a cool video of


---------40:53----------
a whale getting uh tracked by


---------40:56----------
the government or something i don't know


---------41:00----------
[Music]


---------41:01----------
yeah yeah so yeah i


---------41:05----------
so i i i don't know exactly where this


---------41:07----------
conversation is going but i'm going to


---------41:08----------
teach you a little bit we're going to


---------41:09----------
dig into buddhism a little bit is that


---------41:11----------
okay


---------41:11----------
sure check out my city i'm going from a


---------41:14----------
standing desk to a sitting desk watch


---------41:19----------
gg so smooth


---------41:23----------
welcome um


---------41:28----------
so the interesting thing is that what i


---------41:32----------
and and now i'm gonna sort of make some


---------41:34----------
assumptions about buddhism but i'm not


---------41:36----------
as well versed in it i think at the end


---------41:37----------
of the day buddhism and


---------41:38----------
hinduism share a lot there are some


---------41:41----------
arguments that they have


---------41:42----------
um which i think are personally i feel


---------41:44----------
like are not really important


---------41:46----------
but um the


---------41:50----------
so one interesting thing if we kind of


---------41:53----------
go back to ego and the self


---------41:55----------
is that the way to know who you really


---------41:58----------
are


---------41:58----------
is through this phrase which means not


---------42:01----------
this


---------42:02----------
not this okay so if you can


---------42:05----------
use anything to describe who you are


---------42:09----------
that is not who you are


---------42:13----------
okay so i'm not a youtuber i'm not


---------42:17----------
a curious person the true essence of


---------42:20----------
what you are is not a youtuber because


---------42:23----------
you were you before you were a youtuber


---------42:25----------
right


---------42:27----------
right right yeah i mean i was i had a


---------42:29----------
sense of self before


---------42:31----------
i became a youtuber but i think it


---------42:33----------
really grew my sense of self grew with


---------42:35----------
youtube because i got more confident


---------42:37----------
and once i got more confident in myself


---------42:38----------
then yeah it's beautiful like


---------42:40----------
i just had it's just so frustrating


---------42:41----------
because if i if i if i was a person i am


---------42:44----------
today


---------42:45----------
and um it's just i compare myself to my


---------42:49----------
sister my sister was always very


---------42:50----------
confident


---------42:50----------
from a very young age and


---------42:54----------
that i was thinking about this too i


---------42:56----------
thought about this too i was like oh my


---------42:56----------
gosh she set the bar so


---------42:58----------
high like you know she got straight a's


---------42:59----------
and everything got double majored in


---------43:01----------
spanish and engineering super smart


---------43:04----------
um so it's just like the bar was set


---------43:07----------
so high it's like how do i compete with


---------43:09----------
that and


---------43:11----------
i don't know i just i just i just i


---------43:14----------
forgot where i was going with this


---------43:15----------
what was it like growing up with adhd


---------43:17----------
with a sister who was


---------43:20----------
effortlessly successful it's um


---------43:24----------
i guess it was well we didn't really


---------43:27----------
have that close


---------43:28----------
of a relationship because i just for


---------43:30----------
some reason i was i just didn't really


---------43:31----------
talk to her that much because i guess


---------43:33----------
when we we were we were on friendly


---------43:35----------
terms and everything but


---------43:37----------
i just didn't really have a very strong


---------43:38----------
relationship with my sister and now


---------43:40----------
it's very strong now that i've i've


---------43:42----------
developed a sense of self my sister has


---------43:43----------
addressed this too she's like i'm very


---------43:45----------
proud of you jason like you've


---------43:46----------
like you've grown into a much a very


---------43:50----------
beautiful person because


---------43:51----------
uh she knows who i used to be i used to


---------43:54----------
have i used to be extremely reliant


---------43:56----------
on the opinions of others i could never


---------43:58----------
make my own decisions


---------44:00----------
and um now i can how did that happen


---------44:05----------
uh well i like i said i think it's just


---------44:07----------
from


---------44:08----------
from youtube and everything like i said


---------44:11----------
youtube has saved my life thank you so


---------44:13----------
much let's get somewhat interesting


---------44:15----------
right because we started this


---------44:16----------
conversation with oh my god what is


---------44:17----------
social media doing to me


---------44:19----------
and here we hear about the life-changing


---------44:22----------
positive aspects of youtube


---------44:23----------
not a story we hear every day no no


---------44:27----------
it's it's just so goofy um


---------44:30----------
it's because i mean yeah it does have


---------44:31----------
its positives in its negatives for sure


---------44:34----------
and


---------44:38----------
you you said your sister is proud of you


---------44:41----------
now


---------44:41----------
and you guys yeah i mean she was always


---------44:44----------
proud of me she was always


---------44:45----------
a loving sister but like she could tell


---------44:47----------
that i changed


---------44:48----------
and that's a good thing and my mom


---------44:50----------
mentioned that too she's like you've


---------44:51----------
changed jason that's a good thing


---------44:54----------
so how does it feel to hear your family


---------44:56----------
say that


---------44:57----------
it's really nice because it's like i get


---------45:00----------
to form my own opinions now i get to be


---------45:02----------
part of the conversation because i used


---------45:03----------
to


---------45:04----------
you know i like family dinners and stuff


---------45:05----------
i just sit there and eat


---------45:08----------
i had to sit there and eat um i wouldn't


---------45:10----------
i wouldn't plug anything into the


---------45:11----------
conversation i wouldn't feel a need to


---------45:13----------
um especially like you know big like


---------45:15----------
family dinners like you know christmas


---------45:17----------
and thanksgiving and stuff i would never


---------45:20----------
input anything because i wouldn't feel


---------45:22----------
confident enough to


---------45:23----------
give my own opinion and now i can it's


---------45:26----------
wonderful


---------45:31----------
can i think for a second yeah go for it


---------45:55----------
i get a lot of authenticity from you


---------45:57----------
jason


---------45:58----------
what do you mean a lot of authenticity


---------46:01----------
you're just you're authentic


---------46:03----------
uh yeah i guess i i have nothing i have


---------46:06----------
nothing to fake


---------46:07----------
this is this is me this is who i am i've


---------46:10----------
besides this seems really exhausting to


---------46:12----------
um fake a personality


---------46:15----------
oh yes like i'd just be so mentally


---------46:18----------
exhausted


---------46:21----------
but i mean you did that for years and


---------46:22----------
years and years no


---------46:24----------
no i i guess i don't even feel like i


---------46:26----------
even had a personality i don't even feel


---------46:28----------
like i had a sense of self so i


---------46:29----------
had nothing to fake i just kind of like


---------46:31----------
okay here where am i supposed to be i


---------46:33----------
guess i'm here


---------46:34----------
where am i supposed to be now mom oh i


---------46:35----------
guess i'm over here like gosh i probably


---------46:37----------
had my mom call the doctor for me up


---------46:39----------
until i was like 20.


---------46:41----------
you know make appointments for me and


---------46:42----------
stuff sure so


---------46:44----------
i i just didn't i didn't even think


---------46:46----------
about these things and now i do


---------46:47----------
everything


---------46:48----------
by myself and it's nice but it's like


---------46:51----------
i'm learning for like the first time


---------46:53----------
ever like so many things


---------46:55----------
yeah so i i find myself being a little


---------46:57----------
bit um


---------46:59----------
sort of at a crossroads of sorts or one


---------47:01----------
of these


---------47:02----------
weird boston intersections that has like


---------47:05----------
five roads


---------47:06----------
in one intersection um so i could ask


---------47:10----------
i'm not sure exactly where to take this


---------47:11----------
conversation is there a particular


---------47:13----------
i can lay out a couple of options that i


---------47:15----------
think would be interesting


---------47:17----------
um well i was i was i was talking to


---------47:20----------
someone else about this


---------47:20----------
yesterday uh-huh like kind of random but


---------47:24----------
but since you're a doctor i was


---------47:25----------
wondering what your input input would be


---------47:29----------
do you think you'll see uh lower rates


---------47:31----------
of alzheimer's


---------47:32----------
because of so many people are gaming now


---------47:35----------
like as we get older of alzheimer's


---------47:37----------
alzheimer's yes because as we get older


---------47:40----------
um


---------47:42----------
you will we're still gonna be playing


---------47:44----------
video games and stuff


---------47:45----------
like we're you know our generation


---------47:48----------
as they get older when we're gonna be


---------47:50----------
like 70 we're still going to be gaming


---------47:51----------
we're not going to stop gaming and i


---------47:53----------
think we'll


---------47:54----------
do you think we'll see a lower rate of


---------47:56----------
alzheimer's as a result


---------48:00----------
it's a damn good question and i think we


---------48:03----------
will


---------48:04----------
okay i think i think we will because


---------48:07----------
think about the


---------48:09----------
there's so much brain power being used


---------48:10----------
when you're simply playing a video game


---------48:12----------
a first person shooter or anything and


---------48:15----------
um


---------48:18----------
one of the things you want to do to


---------48:19----------
prevent alzheimer's is


---------48:21----------
alzheimer's is to exercise your brain


---------48:23----------
and that's why


---------48:24----------
like my dad he's uh today's his birthday


---------48:27----------
um


---------48:28----------
i'm gonna see him today don't worry um


---------48:30----------
and today's his birthday what he likes


---------48:32----------
to do to prevent


---------48:33----------
uh getting alzheimer's dementia whatever


---------48:34----------
he plays


---------48:36----------
uh he he doesn't play video games he he


---------48:39----------
makes videos he makes his own youtube


---------48:40----------
videos


---------48:41----------
and to you know just to exercise his


---------48:44----------
mind but he also


---------48:46----------
practices spanish a lot every day he


---------48:49----------
practices spanish every day


---------48:50----------
he he gives free legal advice to poor


---------48:52----------
people um


---------48:54----------
so he he does exercise his mind because


---------48:57----------
he's so


---------48:59----------
he takes precautions to avoid getting


---------49:00----------
alzheimer's and i was thinking about


---------49:02----------
them like


---------49:03----------
well when our generation gets older are


---------49:05----------
we are going to see


---------49:06----------
lower rates of alzheimer's as a result


---------49:08----------
and i think the answer is yes


---------49:11----------
so i think that that's a


---------49:14----------
very hopeful perspective


---------49:18----------
i think it it also could be true


---------49:21----------
so here's i there are a bunch of


---------49:24----------
variables i'm thinking about so the


---------49:25----------
first thing is that what's protective


---------49:26----------
against dementia


---------49:28----------
so the first thing is that not all


---------49:29----------
dementia is alzheimer's


---------49:31----------
and you know so alzheimer's is a


---------49:33----------
particular pathophysiologic


---------49:37----------
process in the brain that actually has


---------49:39----------
to do with the inability to clear


---------49:40----------
waste products from our neurons


---------49:44----------
um if pathophysiology serves me


---------49:47----------
correctly because i you know it's been


---------49:48----------
years now since i've


---------49:49----------
i've really dug into the pathophysiology


---------49:52----------
of alzheimer's


---------49:53----------
but so so some fortunate or unfortunate


---------49:57----------
there are some processes that happen in


---------49:59----------
our brain which have


---------50:00----------
arguably less to do with our mind and


---------50:03----------
keeping our mind engaged


---------50:04----------
some things there are some brain


---------50:06----------
processes that our mind has a greater


---------50:08----------
influence over


---------50:10----------
others that it has less of an influence


---------50:12----------
over so if we think about something like


---------50:14----------
anxiety or depression i believe that our


---------50:16----------
mind


---------50:18----------
has a strong potential impact


---------50:22----------
on the brain in anxiety


---------50:26----------
so we can do things with our mind that


---------50:28----------
will change the function of our brain


---------50:30----------
in someone who's anxious when it comes


---------50:32----------
to something like a glioblastoma


---------50:34----------
multiformi which is like a particular


---------50:37----------
kind of brain cancer i think that our


---------50:40----------
mind has


---------50:40----------
less of an impact on altering our brain


---------50:45----------
so anxiety so i say you don't think you


---------50:48----------
don't eat


---------50:48----------
do you feel like um there's not much


---------50:52----------
you almost feel like it's like it's a


---------50:54----------
given it's a given like you will get


---------50:55----------
dementia


---------50:56----------
or do you think there's really not much


---------50:58----------
we can do


---------51:00----------
like i don't think either of those


---------51:02----------
statements are true


---------51:04----------
okay so there's a lot we can do


---------51:08----------
and it isn't a given but i don't know


---------51:11----------
that video games for the answer so let


---------51:13----------
me just


---------51:13----------
so the first time i'm not saying that's


---------51:15----------
the answer they could they could be a


---------51:17----------
part of the answer we'll get to that in


---------51:18----------
a second


---------51:19----------
so well the first thing to kind of lay


---------51:21----------
out is to understand that our mind has


---------51:23----------
different like the impact of our mind on


---------51:25----------
our brain


---------51:26----------
it changes depending on what process


---------51:28----------
you're talking about so one end of the


---------51:30----------
spectrum is like cancer where like i


---------51:31----------
don't know if you can think your way out


---------51:32----------
of cancer


---------51:34----------
you can certainly as bizarre it sounds


---------51:36----------
you can train your mind to think your


---------51:37----------
way out of anxiety


---------51:39----------
um and then in the middle is something


---------51:40----------
like alzheimer's so we know that and


---------51:43----------
this is the interesting thing about


---------51:44----------
alzheimer's if


---------51:45----------
and i'm rusty here so you got to take


---------51:46----------
this with a grain of salt if i remember


---------51:48----------
correctly


---------51:49----------
what's protective against alzheimer's is


---------51:50----------
actually novel experiences


---------51:53----------
so what does that mean so that means


---------51:55----------
like if i've been playing mario kart


---------51:57----------
since the age of five and i continue to


---------51:58----------
play


---------51:59----------
mario kart into until the age of 80 i


---------52:02----------
don't think that's going to be very


---------52:03----------
protective against alzheimer's


---------52:05----------
so new experiences new games


---------52:08----------
that's different story so like this is


---------52:11----------
where we're like you know people


---------52:12----------
think that something like a crossword


---------52:13----------
like doing a crossword every day is


---------52:15----------
protective against dementia


---------52:17----------
it's it and and really the data seems to


---------52:19----------
suggest that like doing


---------52:20----------
new stuff so like your dad you know


---------52:23----------
engaging new clients that can't pay him


---------52:25----------
and stuff like that


---------52:26----------
he's like learning to make youtube


---------52:27----------
videos that [ __ ] is protective against


---------52:29----------
alzheimer's


---------52:30----------
but that's because when he was like five


---------52:31----------
he wasn't playing it so i i think the


---------52:33----------
issue is that you know if you spend your


---------52:35----------
your well like i think if you play the


---------52:36----------
league of legends for 10 hours a day now


---------52:38----------
and you continue doing that for 60 years


---------52:40----------
i think you're more likely to get


---------52:41----------
alzheimer's that makes sense because


---------52:43----------
it's when you're making new experiences


---------52:45----------
you're you're making new


---------52:46----------
new connections absolutely so that's


---------52:49----------
excellent


---------52:50----------
so so the neuroplasticity component has


---------52:52----------
to do with


---------52:53----------
with uh novel experiences


---------52:56----------
yeah as i say when you um when you learn


---------53:00----------
how to


---------53:00----------
i think i read something if you whenever


---------53:02----------
you learn how to uh


---------53:04----------
play an instrument you gain like three


---------53:06----------
percent brain matter mass or something


---------53:08----------
like something ridiculous


---------53:11----------
i don't know i i saw some sort of quote


---------53:13----------
or something so so this is also where


---------53:15----------
things get a little bit


---------53:16----------
confusing because actually trimming down


---------53:18----------
connections in your brain is how a lot


---------53:20----------
of


---------53:20----------
learning happens so the highest density


---------53:24----------
of connections


---------53:26----------
and neurons actually happens at birth or


---------53:29----------
even before birth


---------53:30----------
and then like within the first couple of


---------53:32----------
months or years


---------53:33----------
like we get down to 10 of what we


---------53:36----------
started with


---------53:38----------
and the way that i kind of think about


---------53:39----------
it is like imagine that i made a block


---------53:42----------
out of a city out of like a block of


---------53:44----------
wood like i made like a diagram


---------53:46----------
like you know really like the city


---------53:48----------
emerges


---------53:49----------
the order emerges out of the reduction


---------53:51----------
of mass


---------53:52----------
not the increase of mass and that's also


---------53:55----------
sort of how our brain works


---------53:57----------
so like like a a lot of axonal trimming


---------54:00----------
and things like that is actually


---------54:01----------
associated with learning


---------54:03----------
so so


---------54:07----------
yeah you're like because if you think


---------54:09----------
about like you know if i if i take a


---------54:10----------
blank piece of paper


---------54:11----------
and i cut it into like an image


---------54:15----------
the the resolution in the world happens


---------54:18----------
from losing stuff not gaining stuff


---------54:20----------
which is something that a lot of people


---------54:21----------
don't like they think that the brain


---------54:22----------
like oh i'm like increasing my number of


---------54:24----------
neurons


---------54:25----------
whereas like your brain rewires and it


---------54:26----------
strengthens connections it tunes


---------54:28----------
like pruning is actually a big part of


---------54:30----------
the learning process


---------54:32----------
interesting i don't know that the last


---------54:34----------
thing about


---------54:36----------
alzheimer's though this we do have very


---------54:37----------
good data about is that


---------54:39----------
heart health is brain health so a lot of


---------54:42----------
the dementing processes that happen


---------54:44----------
happen because the blood vessels in our


---------54:46----------
brain get like clogged


---------54:48----------
and so as the blood vessels in your


---------54:50----------
brain get clogged like you just can't


---------54:51----------
support the health of your neurons


---------54:53----------
you can't clear waste products and as


---------54:55----------
you can't clear waste products that


---------54:57----------
[ __ ] builds up in your brain and your


---------54:58----------
neurons start to die


---------55:00----------
so you're basically pooping in your own


---------55:02----------
head


---------55:04----------
no you're not pooping in your own head


---------55:06----------
um you're unable to poop


---------55:08----------
out of your own head it's actually


---------55:10----------
subtle but important to my head


---------55:12----------
your head is constipated yes


---------55:15----------
far better yeah right because it's the


---------55:17----------
evacuation of the waste materials which


---------55:19----------
we get bad at


---------55:20----------
in when you impact vascular health so


---------55:23----------
the problem with playing games is that


---------55:25----------
if it comes with a


---------55:26----------
a negative impact to your cardiovascular


---------55:28----------
health like ie your weight or your diet


---------55:30----------
or things like that


---------55:31----------
that's going to be more alzheimer's


---------55:33----------
prone would be my judgment


---------55:35----------
so the simple matter is that i i think


---------55:37----------
jason your theoretical instinct is


---------55:39----------
correct


---------55:40----------
that if you continue to play games that


---------55:42----------
are like new and interesting and like


---------55:44----------
you know you give some like boomer game


---------55:46----------
or vr


---------55:48----------
yeah go ahead yeah i would say i hope


---------55:49----------
there's not someone out there who's


---------55:51----------
still playing the same game for 50 years


---------55:54----------
i mean so


---------55:55----------
so i'm one of these [ __ ] noobs that


---------55:57----------
loves that though


---------55:58----------
like you know because i've been playing


---------56:00----------
dota since like


---------56:02----------
god i don't even know how long yeah and


---------56:05----------
and


---------56:06----------
i mean that's what i think is amazing


---------56:07----------
you know it's like these games like


---------56:08----------
chess like you can play chess your


---------56:10----------
entire life


---------56:12----------
um and and i think that yeah go ahead i


---------56:14----------
would say i love chess i love


---------56:16----------
i love playing chess i'm not very good


---------56:17----------
at it but i love it i like that i like


---------56:19----------
the


---------56:19----------
it's almost like um it's like a just a


---------56:22----------
very simple


---------56:23----------
war game that's all it is battle game


---------56:27----------
yeah chess is great chess is great i


---------56:30----------
love chess


---------56:32----------
um yeah so i was gonna say i'm not


---------56:35----------
really sure i mean if you've got


---------56:36----------
questions i'm happy to answer them


---------56:38----------
i find myself being immensely curious


---------56:41----------
about one detail of your personal life


---------56:43----------
that you may not want to talk about


---------56:45----------
um we can talk about buddhism or um


---------56:48----------
so i'm kind of curious what's your


---------56:49----------
what's your relationship status


---------56:52----------
i'm single how do you feel about that


---------56:55----------
um i'm at a time in my life where


---------56:59----------
why i was just in a two-year


---------57:01----------
relationship and that ended in


---------57:02----------
october and um it's because i i don't


---------57:06----------
know i just


---------57:07----------
well i don't want to get into details


---------57:09----------
why it didn't work out but um


---------57:10----------
i don't feel like i'm a complete person


---------57:13----------
yet so


---------57:14----------
i don't feel like ready for a


---------57:16----------
relationship i don't feel like i'm


---------57:17----------
i'm genuinely not ready for a


---------57:19----------
relationship i think i have a lot of


---------57:21----------
self-discovery i have to go through


---------57:22----------
i'm not um the best person i want to be


---------57:26----------
and i feel like i have a long way to go


---------57:29----------
to be


---------57:30----------
the best person that i can be so that's


---------57:33----------
why


---------57:33----------
i'm single and i don't know when that's


---------57:35----------
gonna change


---------57:36----------
um i don't know we'll see


---------57:40----------
so i'd like to challenge that for just a


---------57:42----------
second


---------57:44----------
okay so this is going to be a far


---------57:46----------
shorter conversation than i thought it


---------57:48----------
was going to be


---------57:48----------
but um first of all i appreciate you


---------57:51----------
offering the answer


---------57:53----------
because it is a personal question but


---------57:55----------
the one thing i'd encourage you to keep


---------57:57----------
in mind jason


---------57:58----------
is that you've been a youtuber for far


---------58:01----------
longer


---------58:02----------
than you give yourself credit for


---------58:05----------
so yeah you've been a person so even


---------58:07----------
amidst the chameleon-ness i think you


---------58:10----------
were always in there


---------58:12----------
and the reason i asked you about the


---------58:13----------
relationship i have no [ __ ] idea


---------58:15----------
how or why i thought this but like


---------58:20----------
i encourage you to to try to remember


---------58:22----------
that and to acknowledge that in the same


---------58:24----------
way


---------58:25----------
that you were always you before you had


---------58:28----------
the confidence to be you


---------58:32----------
you may be more ready for a relationship


---------58:34----------
than you give yourself credit for


---------58:36----------
maybe but my biggest fear is that i


---------58:39----------
don't want to hurt someone


---------58:40----------
i'm very afraid of that and i know


---------58:42----------
that's that's just part of that's part


---------58:43----------
of the game


---------58:44----------
people get hurt and people i'm very


---------58:46----------
afraid of hurting someone


---------58:48----------
and be like you know um all of a sudden


---------58:51----------
like


---------58:51----------
i i don't feel it anymore i'm not i'm


---------58:53----------
not i'm not in


---------58:54----------
i'm not invested in this anymore and


---------58:56----------
that's my fear i don't i hate i don't


---------58:58----------
want to hurt anyone


---------58:59----------
and that's my biggest fear i really


---------59:01----------
don't want to hurt anyone


---------59:05----------
i don't like hurting anyone period uh i


---------59:08----------
don't like


---------59:08----------
killing things i don't like hurting


---------59:10----------
things spiders i


---------59:12----------
i hate it i don't like hurting anyone


---------59:14----------
period


---------59:15----------
anyone or anything and i guess that's


---------59:18----------
part of the game


---------59:19----------
but that's the reason why i'm single


---------59:21----------
because i'm afraid to hurt i'm going to


---------59:23----------
hurt someone


---------59:30----------
but at the same time i maybe just got to


---------59:32----------
toughen up i'm like okay


---------59:33----------
it's part of the game people are gonna


---------59:35----------
get hurt uh


---------59:36----------
it's it's it's just part of you don't do


---------59:38----------
that well


---------59:39----------
i'm not trying to hurt someone but i'm


---------59:40----------
saying like no i think that's


---------59:43----------
that's you becoming callous and that's


---------59:44----------
you becoming something that you're not


---------59:46----------
yeah i don't know


---------59:50----------
so so jason this is where like there's a


---------59:53----------
middle road right like you can


---------59:57----------
um you want to get into this


---------60:01----------
no no go for it i want to hear it no no


---------60:03----------
no


---------60:04----------
okay yeah okay i i am


---------60:07----------
i'm i'm open to everything like i said


---------60:09----------
i'm i'm i'm not


---------60:11----------
gonna be offended by anything yeah


---------60:14----------
i know you're not going to be offended i


---------60:16----------
just may not be pleasant


---------60:18----------
go for it be brutal i'm not sure i'm not


---------60:20----------
i'm not gonna i'm i'm


---------60:22----------
not gonna hurt you i just you know i'm


---------60:24----------
not gonna be brutal it's just


---------60:25----------
it can be hard to face these things so


---------60:28----------
so like


---------60:29----------
let's think a little bit about that okay


---------60:30----------
so like it's great that we have this


---------60:32----------
backdrop of buddhism so like i want you


---------60:34----------
to recognize


---------60:35----------
that your desire to not hurt someone


---------60:40----------
can sort of be a good thing like so in


---------60:44----------
in sanskrit there's this phrase a word


---------60:46----------
ahimsa which means non-violence


---------60:48----------
and that non-violence is like the


---------60:50----------
highest ideal


---------60:51----------
that like all other like moral values


---------60:54----------
should like


---------60:55----------
be subject to non-violence yeah so i i


---------60:58----------
think that you're very


---------60:59----------
naturally like you a himsa is very


---------61:02----------
important to you


---------61:03----------
so that's wonderful and at the same time


---------61:07----------
you have to be careful because there's a


---------61:08----------
difference between fear of hurting


---------61:10----------
someone


---------61:12----------
and ahimsa there's a difference between


---------61:15----------
ideal and an emotion


---------61:20----------
like like so so like let me just give


---------61:21----------
you an example so i'm a doctor right so


---------61:23----------
like sometimes


---------61:24----------
as a doctor like i think to myself so we


---------61:27----------
we


---------61:28----------
take this oath when we graduate and it


---------61:30----------
says


---------61:31----------
you know like one of our one of our


---------61:33----------
ethical principles is non-malfeasance


---------61:36----------
which is to do no harm now the problem


---------61:39----------
is like i could prescribe a medication


---------61:41----------
and they could have an allergic reaction


---------61:43----------
and they could die which is like the


---------61:44----------
very opposite reason why i'm there


---------61:47----------
yeah and so then the question becomes


---------61:49----------
okay so like i'm really here to help


---------61:51----------
people like


---------61:52----------
i want to save lives not end them but


---------61:54----------
every time


---------61:55----------
you know if i'm a surgeon every time i


---------61:57----------
go into the operating room there's a


---------61:59----------
chance that the patient


---------62:00----------
could die and so that fear of


---------62:03----------
not wanting a patient to die like cannot


---------62:07----------
be my guiding principle you're the worst


---------62:08----------
surgeon in the world


---------62:10----------
get out of here because i wouldn't be a


---------62:12----------
surgeon


---------62:13----------
yeah yeah it makes sense i know where


---------62:16----------
you're getting it


---------62:18----------
and and so i think you've got to be


---------62:19----------
really really careful and


---------62:21----------
and so i'm going to be kind of like if


---------62:23----------
anything i'm going to be judgmental


---------62:24----------
because i'm making a lot of assumptions


---------62:25----------
about your experience


---------62:26----------
those aren't really based in reality


---------62:28----------
because i haven't asked you any [ __ ]


---------62:29----------
questions


---------62:30----------
but but i i think that you've got to be


---------62:32----------
really careful about letting that fear


---------62:34----------
control


---------62:36----------
your actions right because i think


---------62:38----------
caring is a wonderful thing for a


---------62:40----------
relationship


---------62:42----------
but fear of hurting someone and like


---------62:45----------
depriving yourself of the opportunity of


---------62:48----------
giving them


---------62:49----------
in yourself everything else


---------62:52----------
is like you're like the surgeon that'll


---------62:54----------
never enter the operating room


---------62:56----------
right no i mean i i thought about this


---------62:58----------
because at the same time i've only


---------63:00----------
i've been in like maybe like i've only


---------63:03----------
been in two relationships in my life and


---------63:04----------
only one of them was


---------63:05----------
was serious so um at the same time it's


---------63:08----------
like maybe it's just one of those


---------63:09----------
situations where i have to


---------63:12----------
just try with someone else like you


---------63:13----------
never know


---------63:15----------
yeah so i i would encourage you to like


---------63:18----------
notice that fear right so like i've


---------63:22----------
asked you to notice a couple things


---------63:23----------
within yourself like


---------63:25----------
and probably that that fear comes from


---------63:27----------
sort of like a traumatic experience


---------63:30----------
yeah i mean you know breakups are scary


---------63:33----------
no one wants to do that


---------63:34----------
yeah and well i mean it may even come


---------63:37----------
from before the breakup


---------63:39----------
no definitely not


---------63:44----------
well because it's like as is the first


---------63:46----------
time i truly fell in love with someone


---------63:47----------
so


---------63:49----------
that's why what was that like


---------63:52----------
it was wonderful that was really nice


---------63:58----------
and i know you don't want to talk about


---------64:00----------
it but i can see you're getting


---------64:01----------
emotional


---------64:02----------
yeah what are you feeling right now


---------64:06----------
um it's just sad


---------64:12----------
you know the whole thing but yeah


---------64:20----------
i'm just not gonna say anything for a


---------64:21----------
second you don't have to speak


---------64:24----------
we're just gonna sit with it


---------64:29----------
let me know if you need a dick joke yeah


---------64:32----------
i'm good


---------64:33----------
i'm good do you feel well supported


---------64:38----------
oh yeah for sure yeah definitely


---------64:44----------
i mean yeah my family's got my back


---------64:46----------
everyone's got my back so


---------64:53----------
trying to figure out what to say no


---------64:55----------
you're good you're good


---------64:57----------
life is beautiful so these are these are


---------65:00----------
good things to go through these are good


---------65:02----------
things to talk about


---------65:03----------
i like talking about everything and


---------65:04----------
everything i'm not i'm not scared to


---------65:06----------
talk about things so


---------65:10----------
can we acknowledge that not everything


---------65:12----------
is beautiful


---------65:14----------
well i think um yeah you're right not


---------65:17----------
everything is beautiful


---------65:18----------
you see um yeah


---------65:21----------
so here's the next step so buddhism


---------65:24----------
would say


---------65:26----------
it's important to acknowledge that not


---------65:28----------
everything is beautiful right because


---------65:29----------
what are the life is suffering


---------65:32----------
yeah life is suffering um yeah i can


---------65:35----------
bring it up again


---------65:37----------
uh i can give you the three because i i


---------65:39----------
just think it's so interesting because


---------65:40----------
it just


---------65:41----------
it really resonates with me it really


---------65:42----------
stuck with me and i just


---------65:44----------
um i just felt it was so interesting


---------65:46----------
because it's like if you want something


---------65:47----------
in life


---------65:48----------
it's gonna be painful and it whatever it


---------65:50----------
is whatever


---------65:52----------
because i mean you're a doctor you


---------65:53----------
probably probably want to school for


---------65:54----------
like 10 years right


---------65:55----------
so um yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be


---------65:59----------
a painful long process so um


---------66:03----------
all life is suffering the cause of all


---------66:06----------
suffering is desire


---------66:08----------
to remove the to remove the suffering


---------66:09----------
you have to remove the desire


---------66:13----------
yeah so here's what i'd say to you


---------66:16----------
your desire to not hurt someone


---------66:20----------
can't be suffering it's it's


---------66:23----------
it's not it's going to keep you from


---------66:24----------
living yeah


---------66:26----------
and and it's it's good that you don't


---------66:28----------
want to you know like ahimsa i think is


---------66:30----------
good but like


---------66:31----------
be careful about the emotions um


---------66:37----------
i had a couple of other thoughts in


---------66:38----------
there but


---------66:43----------
oh yeah so so it's it not everything in


---------66:45----------
life is beautiful


---------66:47----------
and then here's the other thing that


---------66:48----------
people don't really get is that


---------66:50----------
it's okay for things to not be beautiful


---------66:55----------
there's no problem with things not being


---------66:58----------
beautiful


---------67:00----------
right and if i if i were to kind of like


---------67:03----------
because i think this is the the


---------67:04----------
mentality that a lot of people have


---------67:05----------
right


---------67:05----------
i'm just going to pick one thing from


---------67:07----------
your background which is like when you


---------67:08----------
were growing up i can imagine that it


---------67:10----------
was


---------67:10----------
hard being a kid with adhd and sometimes


---------67:15----------
it's even hard to acknowledge how hard


---------67:17----------
it is because your parents are so


---------67:18----------
supportive


---------67:19----------
um and then you know growing up with


---------67:21----------
your sister the way that she is


---------67:23----------
but i think that's a prime example of


---------67:25----------
like she's


---------67:27----------
studious and intelligent and i have adhd


---------67:31----------
and look at where y'all i mean it's not


---------67:33----------
i hope she's doing well but like


---------67:34----------
i think adhd it's interesting i didn't


---------67:36----------
know you had adhd but


---------67:38----------
now that i think about your content


---------67:39----------
makes perfect [ __ ] sense


---------67:41----------
you know i was i was talking to um to


---------67:43----------
someone about this i


---------67:44----------
truly think my adhd gave me an advantage


---------67:46----------
so basically


---------67:48----------
um so here's the problem this is the


---------67:50----------
entire reason why i started


---------67:52----------
my youtube channel in the first place um


---------67:55----------
i looked on youtube


---------67:56----------
and it went there is no videos catered


---------67:59----------
to adhd people


---------68:01----------
and i want i want to change that and i


---------68:04----------
because i realized i couldn't pay


---------68:06----------
attention more than like


---------68:07----------
30 seconds on a video i was like i want


---------68:09----------
to click off i want to do something else


---------68:11----------
i want to so basically that's why all


---------68:13----------
the clips on my videos


---------68:14----------
are about 30 seconds or less and so i


---------68:18----------
have this


---------68:19----------
basically when i'm editing my videos


---------68:21----------
i'll just be i'll like watch it


---------68:22----------
and then as soon as i lose interest i'll


---------68:25----------
stop it i'm like i'm done


---------68:26----------
like that's where i'm gonna cut the clip


---------68:27----------
and then we're gonna put in the video i


---------68:29----------
think that's why a lot of people find it


---------68:31----------
so so it's brilliant so i know because


---------68:34----------
it's so it's so addicting because like


---------68:36----------
like as soon as like


---------68:37----------
i start to peek at one video another one


---------68:39----------
comes up it's like that's that's the


---------68:40----------
whole purpose and it's it's literally


---------68:42----------
built for adhd people like me because


---------68:45----------
i can see it firsthand i go as soon as i


---------68:47----------
lose interest as soon as i find it


---------68:48----------
not interesting the video will end there


---------68:52----------
and a lot of people get frustrated with


---------68:53----------
that they go hey the video is only


---------68:56----------
you know you didn't show the full video


---------68:58----------
like like it kept going i'm like yeah i


---------69:00----------
know but i lost interest


---------69:01----------
[Laughter]


---------69:05----------
so no it's like a superpower


---------69:09----------
it really is and i think this is where


---------69:11----------
we we talk a lot about


---------69:12----------
um so in eastern medicine


---------69:16----------
one of the key things is that like in


---------69:18----------
the west we sort of think of like minds


---------69:20----------
as all one way


---------69:21----------
right like we don't like so in we know


---------69:24----------
that for example a different color like


---------69:25----------
hair color right we know there's like


---------69:27----------
normal variants of hair color within the


---------69:29----------
human population


---------69:30----------
but when we think about mental


---------69:32----------
characteristics we don't think about


---------69:33----------
normal variants we sort of say that the


---------69:35----------
mind


---------69:35----------
is one way and what happens is we


---------69:38----------
diagnose some people as being


---------69:40----------
ill because their mind their


---------69:43----------
mind's attention span is like short so


---------69:45----------
it's not


---------69:46----------
adapted to sitting in a classroom for


---------69:48----------
eight hours a day


---------69:49----------
but it is very very adapted to sifting


---------69:52----------
through tons of [ __ ] on the internet


---------69:54----------
and finding the choicest pieces and then


---------69:56----------
linking them together


---------69:59----------
yeah exactly i mean i tried to hire


---------70:01----------
people to do my job


---------70:02----------
and to help me out and stuff not to do


---------70:04----------
my job but you know help me out and


---------70:06----------
help find videos it didn't work people


---------70:09----------
just couldn't find what i wanted


---------70:10----------
and so i was like okay this is this is


---------70:12----------
frustrating because like i can't put my


---------70:13----------
brain in someone else's head so yep um


---------70:16----------
and i'm sure other people exactly so and


---------70:19----------
like i tried like


---------70:20----------
explaining like hey like this is cool


---------70:23----------
but like it's not good


---------70:24----------
for daily dose of internet um so i i


---------70:26----------
take great pride in making sure


---------70:28----------
i i show the best clips because i


---------70:31----------
i want to put a really good product out


---------70:33----------
there for everyone to enjoy


---------70:35----------
yeah that's cool and so it's like if


---------70:37----------
it's just like a regular like standard


---------70:39----------
cat video like


---------70:40----------
being cute like i'm not going to show


---------70:41----------
that i'm not going to show that it has


---------70:43----------
to be


---------70:43----------
something funny or unique about that cat


---------70:46----------
video like


---------70:47----------
i just don't show me a regular cat video


---------70:49----------
that's not going to fly


---------70:51----------
that's cool um


---------70:54----------
yeah any questions for me no


---------70:58----------
no i mean how long do your um


---------71:00----------
[Music]


---------71:01----------
uh your podcast usually go yeah


---------71:04----------
we usually like i'll ask people around


---------71:06----------
the now mark


---------71:07----------
it's about 1 30. um sometimes they go


---------71:11----------
long like they tend to run anywhere


---------71:12----------
between like one and two and a half


---------71:14----------
hours


---------71:15----------
yeah um usually around two


---------71:18----------
and it really just sort of depends on


---------71:20----------
like the lifespan of the conversation


---------71:22----------
yeah well like i said i mean um i love i


---------71:25----------
love talking


---------71:26----------
i love i've talked i if you guys want to


---------71:27----------
know about more about me but like um


---------71:30----------
i don't know i i'm i'm more of a um i'm


---------71:33----------
not really


---------71:34----------
i know we came into this conversation


---------71:36----------
wanting to talk about


---------71:38----------
you know what youtubers go through and


---------71:39----------
stuff and


---------71:41----------
i'll tell you what like one of the


---------71:43----------
things that my my stress levels


---------71:45----------
are always high almost


---------71:48----------
because of this because my job and


---------71:51----------
uh because i want best part of the


---------71:53----------
problem is that there's no job security


---------71:55----------
here


---------71:56----------
there's no job security if you don't do


---------71:58----------
good if you don't do


---------71:59----------
do well enough someone else will take


---------72:00----------
your time someone else will take your


---------72:02----------
slot


---------72:02----------
uh just like regular tv you know if a


---------72:06----------
if a show is not performing well they


---------72:08----------
will someone else will


---------72:10----------
watch a different show instead um so i


---------72:12----------
want to make sure that


---------72:13----------
i'm always going to put out the best


---------72:16----------
product i possibly can


---------72:17----------
and um yeah so it's very stressful it's


---------72:21----------
very stressful it's


---------72:22----------
um but it's it's a good stress it keeps


---------72:25----------
me busy and the problem is that


---------72:26----------
i'm so busy that time flies by so fast


---------72:31----------
it flies by so fast like i can't believe


---------72:33----------
it's already february


---------72:35----------
jason i think you're you're touched too


---------72:37----------
positive bro


---------72:39----------
um so so like i mean i i recognize that


---------72:42----------
it


---------72:43----------
okay hold on all right so there's a lot


---------72:45----------
to talk about here


---------72:46----------
um you know i can kind of start to get


---------72:48----------
into it and we can sort of discuss


---------72:50----------
but so i recognize that the stress


---------72:53----------
drives you to perform


---------72:55----------
right right but it also drives you to


---------72:59----------
suffer


---------73:00----------
yeah i haven't had a day off in along uh


---------73:04----------
since i started uh so last my last day


---------73:07----------
off was probably 2015.


---------73:10----------
yeah so when you say stress is a good


---------73:14----------
thing


---------73:15----------
you know like it it has advantages


---------73:19----------
so i i think about stress is like do you


---------73:21----------
play do you play games


---------73:23----------
yeah i love playing playing games you


---------73:25----------
know blood pages


---------73:27----------
no i've heard of it though so like like


---------73:30----------
there are blood pages and


---------73:31----------
random ass video games and the idea


---------73:34----------
behind a blood mage is like instead of


---------73:35----------
eight


---------73:36----------
it's like zeno so mages have mp mana


---------73:38----------
right magic points


---------73:39----------
yeah and so like you spend your mp to


---------73:41----------
cast spells


---------73:43----------
and then like every now and then you'll


---------73:44----------
have a game that has a blood mage and a


---------73:45----------
blood mage doesn't have mana he uses hp


---------73:48----------
to cast spells


---------73:49----------
usually a dude right so it's like you


---------73:52----------
get the spell effect but you


---------73:53----------
you pay for it right you pay for it out


---------73:56----------
of your own lifeblood


---------73:58----------
and and when i think about like content


---------74:00----------
creators and like the stress of


---------74:02----------
performing


---------74:03----------
i kind of see them as blood mages yeah


---------74:06----------
they're basically sacrificing their life


---------74:08----------
and their free time to entertain other


---------74:10----------
people and that's fine and that's great


---------74:11----------
because that's what they want to do


---------74:13----------
and it's part you know especially like


---------74:15----------
those 24-hour live streams sort of


---------74:16----------
things like you're sacrificing your


---------74:18----------
freedom


---------74:18----------
your life to other people and that's


---------74:21----------
fine


---------74:21----------
and it's normal i guess but i'm just


---------74:24----------
saying like that's


---------74:25----------
that's part of the job you know you're


---------74:26----------
sacrificing your freedom


---------74:28----------
and your livelihood and your in your


---------74:30----------
life to other people


---------74:35----------
yeah but that's not fine so is it


---------74:38----------
normal sure okay oh so just because it's


---------74:42----------
yeah just because it's normal doesn't


---------74:43----------
mean it's okay


---------74:44----------
right right so so and and this is the


---------74:48----------
wild thing right so like we see this a


---------74:50----------
lot like y'all aren't the only ones that


---------74:51----------
are blood mages like


---------74:52----------
other examples of blood mages are


---------74:54----------
investment bankers


---------74:56----------
right they're like i'm gonna just give


---------74:58----------
my youth


---------75:00----------
in my sweat and my stomach ulcers


---------75:04----------
for the sake of this contract and you


---------75:07----------
have it you haven't had a day off since


---------75:09----------
2015.


---------75:10----------
well i i [ __ ] way that that's healthy


---------75:14----------
well it is though because the way i pace


---------75:16----------
out my day is very


---------75:18----------
uh so what i've done what i decided to


---------75:20----------
do for 2021


---------75:21----------
is to force myself to travel more um


---------75:24----------
okay and to to go do things i can still


---------75:27----------
work because what i do is i can get all


---------75:28----------
my work done on the plane


---------75:29----------
so i'm gonna i'm gonna add i'm gonna


---------75:32----------
disagree


---------75:33----------
so i'm not saying that you haven't found


---------75:36----------
a sustainable way


---------75:38----------
to not take a day off in five years


---------75:42----------
i still wouldn't call that healthy just


---------75:46----------
there's a there's a sure you have it


---------75:48----------
turned into a dumpster fire of a human


---------75:50----------
being


---------75:50----------
and it sounds like you're actually doing


---------75:52----------
really well for yourself but like


---------75:54----------
the standard of health is not be like


---------75:56----------
it's not the absence of being a dumpster


---------75:58----------
fire


---------75:59----------
yeah right it sounds like you had a


---------76:01----------
really fulfilling relationship for a


---------76:02----------
couple years you have good relationships


---------76:04----------
with your


---------76:04----------
your your family you connect with people


---------76:07----------
you educate people


---------76:08----------
you enjoy things about your day maybe


---------76:10----------
you've got a dog that you play with on a


---------76:12----------
regular basis


---------76:13----------
like who knows sure i'm not saying that


---------76:15----------
you haven't learned to adapt and this is


---------76:17----------
what we see with content creators


---------76:19----------
is that they like they come up with a


---------76:21----------
system that functions


---------76:23----------
yeah but that doesn't mean that it's


---------76:25----------
healthy


---------76:27----------
i don't feel unhealthy that's the weird


---------76:29----------
thing i don't um


---------76:33----------
i feel like if i took a day off i'd be


---------76:35----------
bored


---------76:36----------
yeah so so uh so so this is where maybe


---------76:39----------
i'm the one


---------76:39----------
who needs to disagree with myself so if


---------76:42----------
all of the people that i think that


---------76:44----------
can build a healthy lifestyle without


---------76:46----------
taking a day off in five years you may


---------76:47----------
be at the top of the list


---------76:51----------
it may really be that the work is just


---------76:53----------
so uh but here's the question


---------76:55----------
anyway so but you still use the word


---------76:57----------
stress to describe it


---------76:58----------
right i mean it's a good stress because


---------77:00----------
you want to make sure


---------77:01----------
because i'm technically a performer even


---------77:03----------
though i'm not doing anything


---------77:05----------
um so you want to make sure you're at


---------77:06----------
the top of the top of your game


---------77:10----------
yeah so this is where i think that


---------77:11----------
there's like a lot to be learned and


---------77:13----------
thankfully there are systems at place


---------77:15----------
to um you know


---------77:18----------
help people stay at the top of their


---------77:20----------
game and build a


---------77:22----------
work life balance right so so this is


---------77:25----------
where i think


---------77:25----------
you really may be an outlier but like a


---------77:27----------
lot of like you know content creators


---------77:30----------
feel burnt out i don't get the sense


---------77:32----------
that you feel burnt out


---------77:33----------
no i i i like i said i i am


---------77:37----------
here so here's the reason why the reason


---------77:39----------
why is because i think i'm a little


---------77:40----------
crazy and in the aspect


---------77:44----------
thank you in the aspect that i know i'm


---------77:46----------
not good at anything


---------77:48----------
other than this so i don't want to go


---------77:50----------
back to my bank job i know i can never


---------77:52----------
do another


---------77:53----------
regular job ever again because because


---------77:55----------
of this


---------77:56----------
and since i'm so insane about not going


---------78:00----------
back there


---------78:00----------
i should work so hard to make sure that


---------78:03----------
doesn't happen


---------78:05----------
because i i worked for a fortune 500


---------78:08----------
company


---------78:09----------
i hated every second of it that was


---------78:12----------
the worst most depressing days of my


---------78:15----------
life


---------78:15----------
like i would wake up and i'd be like


---------78:19----------
i would be upset that i was still alive


---------78:21----------
i would be like why is this my life


---------78:23----------
i cannot believe this is my life i'd


---------78:25----------
wake up every day miserable


---------78:27----------
yes that is not my situation right now


---------78:30----------
jason what i think makes you an outlier


---------78:32----------
is you have


---------78:33----------
you have somehow managed to describe


---------78:37----------
gratitude and desperation with one


---------78:40----------
rolled up emotion


---------78:42----------
what you described there is both abject


---------78:44----------
desperation


---------78:46----------
and endless gratitude yeah


---------78:49----------
yeah exactly because i i don't think i


---------78:52----------
would be the person


---------78:53----------
that i am on youtube if i didn't have


---------78:55----------
that bank job first


---------78:56----------
because if you have everything handed to


---------78:59----------
you on a silver platter


---------79:00----------
you're never gonna know if you're always


---------79:02----------
what right if you're


---------79:04----------
if you're always um winning you're not


---------79:07----------
going to


---------79:08----------
i think failing is very important and


---------79:10----------
the formation of someone's personality


---------79:12----------
and the formation of someone's morals


---------79:15----------
and how they go about their


---------79:16----------
their life yeah i think that that's also


---------79:21----------
i've i sort of found the same thing so


---------79:23----------
when i went when i started medical


---------79:25----------
school i had failed a lot


---------79:27----------
yeah and i found that it really made med


---------79:30----------
school like really easy


---------79:33----------
but it's like well because so so i was


---------79:35----------
with a group of kids who were


---------79:37----------
presumably sort of like your sister


---------79:39----------
right so they were like valedictorian of


---------79:41----------
their high school


---------79:42----------
top of their class in college like the


---------79:44----------
average gp college gpa for like pre-meds


---------79:47----------
is like 3.8


---------79:48----------
or 3.7 or something right so like


---------79:51----------
maybe a b here or there but like all a's


---------79:54----------
highly motivated smart kids top of their


---------79:56----------
class disciplined


---------79:58----------
study super hard and then there was me i


---------80:01----------
kind of scraped in


---------80:04----------
and you look working you had a question


---------80:08----------
no so you're probably so it doesn't


---------80:11----------
really matter because you're you're on


---------80:12----------
the same level now as everyone else


---------80:14----------
like same level yeah you you might have


---------80:16----------
started off in a different place


---------80:18----------
sure sure that's one way to think about


---------80:20----------
it but but i actually think my level was


---------80:22----------
way better than their level


---------80:23----------
because because i had known what it was


---------80:25----------
like to fail to like really fail


---------80:29----------
so one of my friends um was at harvard


---------80:32----------
law school and i asked him like


---------80:33----------
you know how's your i was excited for


---------80:35----------
him so his first semester ended and and


---------80:37----------
we were kind of catching up and i was


---------80:38----------
like


---------80:39----------
you know how is it and he's like it's


---------80:41----------
awful i was like


---------80:43----------
what do you mean it's awful like it you


---------80:44----------
know is it everyone's super depressed


---------80:46----------
and i was like what do you mean


---------80:47----------
everyone's super depressed i thought


---------80:48----------
like everyone wanted to go there


---------80:50----------
and then he said something he's super


---------80:52----------
wise guy


---------80:53----------
like not like not a wise guy but he's


---------80:55----------
like actually like wisdom


---------80:56----------
he has a wisdom and he was like one of


---------80:58----------
the worst things you can do


---------81:00----------
to a child or a person is like to take a


---------81:02----------
group of people who have always been the


---------81:04----------
best


---------81:04----------
and suddenly make them average oh yeah


---------81:09----------
that's true and and


---------81:12----------
that's what med school is sort of like


---------81:14----------
and then like suddenly kit like these


---------81:16----------
kids because they felt like kids to me i


---------81:18----------
mean i was four years older than them so


---------81:19----------
you know not really it's like 27 28 and


---------81:22----------
they were like 22 23.


---------81:24----------
um and they would get like a b


---------81:27----------
and it would be like devastating


---------81:29----------
devastating yeah or


---------81:30----------
or you know they'd get some feedback and


---------81:32----------
a doctor would be like hey like you


---------81:34----------
really


---------81:35----------
need to do a better job with you know


---------81:36----------
your auscultation and listening to heart


---------81:38----------
sounds because this is like


---------81:40----------
because it's not just book knowledge


---------81:41----------
it's like you know


---------81:43----------
yeah yeah and i'm not really sorry i was


---------81:46----------
sorry i'm kind of getting random here


---------81:47----------
but like


---------81:49----------
for people for doctors that that you


---------81:52----------
know graduated


---------81:53----------
30 years ago um do they have to take


---------81:56----------
mandatory courses to catch up on


---------81:58----------
all the new like medical nausea comes


---------82:00----------
out yes


---------82:01----------
they do okay so it's like mandatory like


---------82:03----------
yes it's mandatory


---------82:05----------
so there's a certain amount of


---------82:06----------
continuing medical education that you


---------82:08----------
have to do


---------82:09----------
to maintain your license i believe so


---------82:12----------
technically you're always in medical


---------82:13----------
school if you're a doctor


---------82:15----------
yes you're damn right there's there was


---------82:18----------
one interesting statistic that 50


---------82:20----------
of what you know 50


---------82:24----------
of what you learned during medical


---------82:26----------
school will be replaced by the end of


---------82:28----------
medical school


---------82:29----------
well i don't think the statistic is


---------82:32----------
quite that high


---------82:34----------
because you know like you learn things


---------82:35----------
like where the heart is in the body and


---------82:37----------
that [ __ ] ain't gonna change


---------82:39----------
you know um there is some weird


---------82:42----------
cardiac inversus or something where


---------82:44----------
people have a heart on the right side of


---------82:46----------
their body but generally speaking like


---------82:47----------
you know the location of the heart isn't


---------82:48----------
gonna change


---------82:49----------
yeah um but but you know there's there


---------82:52----------
are lots of advances and things like


---------82:54----------
that


---------82:55----------
anyway kind of going back to um


---------82:59----------
i don't know why i was telling the story


---------83:00----------
but i'll finish it now but i i think


---------83:02----------
you know oh you were talking about how


---------83:04----------
you wouldn't be who you are today unless


---------83:05----------
you worked at the bank and so i kind of


---------83:07----------
felt the same way


---------83:08----------
that in in med school it was sort of


---------83:10----------
easy because like people would kind of


---------83:11----------
get yelled at by


---------83:12----------
or not even get yelled at they would


---------83:14----------
just be told publicly that they made a


---------83:16----------
mistake


---------83:17----------
and like they they don't even know what


---------83:19----------
failure looks like so it feels like


---------83:20----------
failure to them like


---------83:22----------
this is nothing yeah i don't think


---------83:25----------
people really truly understand


---------83:26----------
how important it is to fail like if you


---------83:29----------
if


---------83:29----------
you know if you're just given everything


---------83:31----------
you're not going to learn anything you


---------83:33----------
have to learn in order to appreciate in


---------83:35----------
order to


---------83:36----------
appreciate what you have and that's why


---------83:39----------
a lot of people


---------83:40----------
um that's why that's why i love you know


---------83:43----------
rag to riches stories you know


---------83:45----------
a poor guy it went up and became a


---------83:48----------
millionaire in the nba like or something


---------83:50----------
like that i just love stories like that


---------83:51----------
because


---------83:52----------
they are and they always give back to


---------83:53----------
the community in some sort because like


---------83:55----------
i know where i came from my community


---------83:57----------
was very rough it was whatever and then


---------83:59----------
they give back and it's beautiful


---------84:00----------
because they understand the pain


---------84:02----------
you know there's not it's beautiful yeah


---------84:04----------
i mean giving back is why we're here on


---------84:06----------
twitch today


---------84:07----------
so i was like man there were a bunch of


---------84:09----------
noobs look at all these [ __ ] noobs


---------84:11----------
that are just like me


---------84:12----------
yeah and they sailing i still remember


---------84:16----------
you know going to a christmas party in


---------84:19----------
my hometown where i met people that i


---------84:20----------
had gone to call like i mean so we were


---------84:22----------
in high school together and we all went


---------84:23----------
to college


---------84:24----------
we were all pre-med and so the funny


---------84:27----------
thing was they were like


---------84:28----------
done with medical school and they were


---------84:31----------
going off to be like surgeons and


---------84:33----------
ophthalmologists and stuff like that


---------84:35----------
and um i went to this christmas party


---------84:38----------
and then


---------84:39----------
you know we were all catching up because


---------84:40----------
we hadn't seen each other in years and i


---------84:41----------
was like oh what are you doing they're


---------84:43----------
like yeah i'm gonna go be like a


---------84:44----------
ent surgeon i was like cool and they're


---------84:46----------
like what are you up to and like i was


---------84:48----------
like i'm applying to medical school


---------84:51----------
yeah we're like the same age right yeah


---------84:54----------
and and so it's it can feel bad but it's


---------84:57----------
like it makes you who you are


---------84:59----------
right right um and and i i think that


---------85:02----------
like this kind of goes back to


---------85:04----------
this idea of beautiful not beautiful


---------85:06----------
comparing ego


---------85:08----------
you know the only time you're going to


---------85:11----------
feel insufficient


---------85:12----------
is when you hold up a standard that


---------85:14----------
isn't yourself


---------85:15----------
well it's funny how my standards have


---------85:17----------
changed like back when


---------85:19----------
back when i was a very small youtube


---------85:21----------
channel i was like oh my gosh


---------85:22----------
a million views a video yes awesome it's


---------85:24----------
like i'm not saying it's like it's cocky


---------85:26----------
but it's like your


---------85:27----------
your idea of success


---------85:30----------
is like any business or


---------85:34----------
you always want to see improvement in


---------85:36----------
any sort of business or whatever and if


---------85:37----------
you don't you're going oh my gosh


---------85:38----------
what's going on what's happening like


---------85:40----------
study for businesses is good


---------85:42----------
but ultimately what they want to do is


---------85:43----------
they want to grow and i think the same


---------85:44----------
as things with youtubers like want to


---------85:46----------
constantly be growing they want to


---------85:47----------
constantly be better


---------85:49----------
because if they're not they go what am i


---------85:50----------
doing wrong


---------85:53----------
yeah so that's where jason to be honest


---------85:55----------
i mean so like as an organization we


---------85:57----------
support content creators through this


---------85:59----------
kind of stuff


---------86:00----------
so it's a lot of work that i i mean in


---------86:02----------
my in my private practice i work with a


---------86:05----------
lot of


---------86:05----------
um you know my clinic i work with a lot


---------86:07----------
of like people who are like obsessed


---------86:10----------
with being the best


---------86:11----------
yeah and we sort of teach them you know


---------86:14----------
how to recalibrate a little bit


---------86:15----------
how to like let go some of that stress


---------86:17----------
so i think a good example is like the


---------86:19----------
nuance between ahimsa


---------86:21----------
in the fear of not wanting to hurt


---------86:23----------
someone right and how


---------86:25----------
both of those things may sound the same


---------86:27----------
but one is actually going to like


---------86:28----------
keep you from living life and one is


---------86:31----------
going to like let you


---------86:33----------
live life with like a strong guiding


---------86:35----------
compass that actually gives you strength


---------86:38----------
right you know and so like to enter


---------86:40----------
every relationship so one is gonna keep


---------86:41----------
you from a relationship


---------86:43----------
and the other is gonna allow you to


---------86:45----------
enter into a relationship with this idea


---------86:47----------
that like


---------86:48----------
i'm gonna do my best not to hurt this


---------86:50----------
person


---------86:51----------
well i mean not like not hurt them and


---------86:54----------
physically hurt them


---------86:55----------
but like you know hurt their feelings


---------86:56----------
you know i know yeah


---------86:59----------
i just want to clarify youtube drama


---------87:05----------
i would be really surprised on maybe


---------87:07----------
this is just my naivete but i'm pretty


---------87:09----------
sure


---------87:09----------
everyone knows we're not talking about


---------87:11----------
physical abuse or even


---------87:12----------
being toxic just like you know sometimes


---------87:14----------
things don't work out and people are sad


---------87:17----------
yeah i'm pretty sure that's what we're


---------87:18----------
all talking about i just want to make


---------87:20----------
sure


---------87:20----------
we're good okay sorry if i feel like a


---------87:23----------
little uncomfortable because i


---------87:24----------
am but that's just because i'm i'm like


---------87:26----------
that with most new people


---------87:28----------
what's like i mean yeah that's i think


---------87:32----------
you should feel uncomfortable


---------87:34----------
well i don't know like because i'm like


---------87:36----------
i know how i'm acting right now


---------87:37----------
i feel like i'm not um completely


---------87:39----------
relaxed


---------87:41----------
what's wrong with that um


---------87:44----------
i don't know is i because i because i


---------87:46----------
want to i want to show


---------87:47----------
kind of show the real me but it's i


---------87:49----------
almost feel like it's not the real me


---------87:52----------
because it's like it's like nervous it's


---------87:54----------
like nervous me sure so that's


---------87:56----------
we love nervous you all right thank you


---------87:58----------
we love relaxing you too


---------88:01----------
you've never really seen it though we've


---------88:03----------
never seen relaxed you


---------88:05----------
not really okay i don't think what we


---------88:07----------
love like


---------88:08----------
well i know when i was in that zoom call


---------88:10----------
with like a bunch of other youtubers i


---------88:12----------
was i was kind of relaxed there but


---------88:13----------
but i don't know why it was maybe


---------88:14----------
because there's so many people i i


---------88:16----------
didn't feel like i need to um


---------88:18----------
like i kind of just like could just like


---------88:20----------
say my thing and then back up in the


---------88:21----------
crowd so jason we've we kind of touched


---------88:23----------
on this a couple times remember so


---------88:24----------
buddhism says


---------88:26----------
not all things are beautiful but that


---------88:28----------
beauty is not worth


---------88:30----------
more than ugly yeah


---------88:33----------
that's the other piece of the equation


---------88:35----------
so this is where like


---------88:36----------
i'll take you however you are if you're


---------88:39----------
nervous


---------88:40----------
that's fine if you don't want to be on


---------88:42----------
camera that's fine


---------88:43----------
no no that's not no it's not the camera


---------88:45----------
it's just no i i know i'm just using it


---------88:46----------
as an example of like you're allowed to


---------88:48----------
be


---------88:49----------
whatever you are you're allowed to be


---------88:50----------
fearful you're allowed to be anxious


---------88:52----------
you're allowed to be happy you're


---------88:53----------
allowed to be positive you're allowed to


---------88:55----------
lie we had this dude come on stream


---------88:56----------
couple weeks ago


---------88:57----------
[ __ ] just lied about everything oh


---------89:00----------
yeah i don't know


---------89:01----------
and and that's fine too right like like


---------89:06----------
it's like it's okay to like be exactly


---------89:08----------
where you are


---------89:10----------
you know i used to be a crazy liar when


---------89:11----------
i was growing up i


---------89:13----------
used to lie all the time i lied all the


---------89:15----------
time


---------89:16----------
and then i think around college is when


---------89:19----------
i stopped


---------89:20----------
because i went lying is getting me in


---------89:23----------
more trouble and causing more stress in


---------89:25----------
my life than i need


---------89:26----------
i'm like if i just tell the truth i


---------89:28----------
usually get in less trouble


---------89:29----------
also it's just a burden off my chest i


---------89:32----------
just the the stress of constantly


---------89:33----------
holding on to that


---------89:35----------
that lie for the rest of my life was


---------89:36----------
just like just get this off my chest so


---------89:38----------
i missed crazy


---------89:39----------
how that changed because i used to be


---------89:40----------
such a liar i used to lie about


---------89:42----------
everything


---------89:43----------
you know i'm like if i lie i'll be like


---------89:45----------
i'll feel horrible about it and then


---------89:46----------
i'll be like okay


---------89:47----------
i'm sorry that wasn't true i'll like


---------89:49----------
i'll bring it up yeah so


---------89:50----------
people like so yogis and i don't know if


---------89:53----------
really buddhism says this but they say


---------89:54----------
that a lot of your success


---------89:56----------
probably comes from the fact that you


---------89:57----------
don't lie


---------89:59----------
so that means so this is also where this


---------90:02----------
is kind of interesting so there's


---------90:03----------
another ahimsan there's another


---------90:05----------
phrase satya which means truthfulness


---------90:08----------
the interesting thing is that a lot of


---------90:10----------
people are like oh i'm into radical


---------90:12----------
honesty which means i'm going to be an


---------90:13----------
[ __ ] and tell people what i think


---------90:15----------
about


---------90:15----------
how ugly they are and so the interesting


---------90:17----------
thing is that that


---------90:18----------
in in sort of this eastern system of


---------90:20----------
morality


---------90:21----------
satya is actually like secondary to


---------90:24----------
ahimsa


---------90:26----------
so if truth hurts people like


---------90:29----------
that's you shouldn't say it yeah exactly


---------90:32----------
um but yeah you know jason i think


---------90:35----------
there's a lot to your journey that


---------90:38----------
i think is really maps on to like


---------90:41----------
spiritual growth and success


---------90:43----------
sort of this model of like you know


---------90:45----------
adopting these principles like


---------90:46----------
non-violence truthfulness


---------90:48----------
understanding who you are letting


---------90:50----------
yourself become who you are


---------90:52----------
um yeah you know and you kind of make


---------90:54----------
these claims like you didn't really have


---------90:56----------
a personality in high school and i know


---------90:57----------
you


---------90:58----------
felt that way but i think you were there


---------91:00----------
just under the surface


---------91:02----------
you were always there right yeah that's


---------91:05----------
true


---------91:05----------
and even now when it comes to stress and


---------91:08----------
the impacts of social media and stuff


---------91:10----------
like that i think


---------91:11----------
going back to kind of science and kind


---------91:13----------
of tying things up where we started


---------91:15----------
so you know it's been my experience that


---------91:18----------
there aren't a whole bunch of studies


---------91:20----------
but we do have a ton


---------91:21----------
of useful clinical data so we know like


---------91:25----------
how to help people develop


---------91:26----------
healthy social media hygiene we know how


---------91:29----------
to help people deal with stress


---------91:31----------
and burnout and things like that um so


---------91:33----------
we have


---------91:34----------
like the reason that we exist as an


---------91:36----------
organization is because like we're


---------91:37----------
trying to help people with these issues


---------91:39----------
that


---------91:41----------
you know if you go to a therapist and


---------91:42----------
you ask them like i don't know what to


---------91:44----------
do about my tic toc usage like


---------91:48----------
hopefully they'll do a good job but a


---------91:49----------
lot of them don't right


---------91:51----------
because it's so brand new also exactly


---------91:53----------
right


---------91:54----------
so so this is where things like imposter


---------91:56----------
syndrome


---------91:58----------
burnout dealing with stress being on


---------92:01----------
this like


---------92:01----------
everlasting treadmill of success right


---------92:05----------
like you guys


---------92:07----------
you guys win battles after battles after


---------92:09----------
battles but


---------92:10----------
you never win the war like that's what


---------92:13----------
it's like to be a content creator


---------92:15----------
is to have victory after victory after


---------92:16----------
victory and like never be able to stop


---------92:18----------
fighting


---------92:20----------
yeah i guess i feel like i'm just kind


---------92:22----------
of competing against myself though


---------92:23----------
i got because i i like look back at


---------92:26----------
videos that i made


---------92:27----------
five months ago and i cringe at things i


---------92:29----------
go come on did i really do that


---------92:33----------
that's part of the reason that i think


---------92:35----------
you're healthier jason than a lot of


---------92:37----------
content creators or at least in this


---------92:39----------
aspect


---------92:40----------
is that you know the more so it's it's


---------92:42----------
easier to compare your


---------92:44----------
it's less damn it's less suffering for


---------92:47----------
your ego


---------92:48----------
when you compare to your former self as


---------92:50----------
opposed to when you compare to other


---------92:52----------
content creators


---------92:54----------
and this is where if you don't stream on


---------92:56----------
twitch right no


---------92:57----------
no okay so this is where we actually


---------93:01----------
recently


---------93:02----------
um have been working with twitch to


---------93:05----------
actually support their content creators


---------93:07----------
through stuff like this and the program


---------93:08----------
seems to be going really well


---------93:10----------
um but it you know so i i don't think


---------93:13----------
that that's available to you but that's


---------93:14----------
something we're going to have to think


---------93:15----------
about


---------93:16----------
obviously i mean


---------93:21----------
anyway let me let me just think about


---------93:22----------
that i feel kind of bad now


---------93:24----------
about what about not being able to


---------93:27----------
support you in a more substantial way


---------93:29----------
oh i'm fine no i'm good i'm good you're


---------93:32----------
good


---------93:32----------
i know you're good but i'm still allowed


---------93:34----------
to feel bad even if you're okay right


---------93:37----------
okay i don't know what what's the feel


---------93:39----------
about feel bad about


---------93:41----------
i mean yeah it's uh like i said it's


---------93:44----------
just it's just the grind baby


---------93:46----------
it's the grind yeah what you gotta do


---------93:48----------
and i think


---------93:50----------
it all stems from the ptsd of literally


---------93:52----------
not being good at anything in my life


---------93:55----------
so it's it's just it's like um


---------93:59----------
it's kind of like you have someone who


---------94:00----------
is raised in extreme poverty


---------94:02----------
their entire life and all of a sudden


---------94:04----------
you give them all the food in the world


---------94:07----------
they're going to finish the plate and


---------94:08----------
they're going to constantly save food


---------94:10----------
constantly safe food because they don't


---------94:11----------
know they're so inbred with the idea


---------94:13----------
that they don't know when their next


---------94:15----------
meal is going to arrive


---------94:16----------
i'm kind of like the same way yes but


---------94:18----------
jason jason it comes down to suffering


---------94:20----------
man


---------94:22----------
yeah right because here here is someone


---------94:24----------
who has all the food in the world


---------94:27----------
and they still suffer right


---------94:30----------
so i understand that you know whipping


---------94:33----------
yourself


---------94:34----------
towards success because of the


---------94:36----------
desperation like i said some weird


---------94:38----------
you know real cocktail of like coffee


---------94:40----------
and alcohol of like desperation and


---------94:42----------
gratitude all rolled and


---------94:43----------
i've never heard any i mean it's


---------94:45----------
brilliant because it's like 50


---------94:47----------
desperation 50 gratitude


---------94:50----------
and i know you're a resilient guy so you


---------94:52----------
manage it well but there's a part of me


---------94:54----------
that says that like you know that kid is


---------94:56----------
going to be a little bit


---------94:57----------
more peaceful if they didn't hoard food


---------95:01----------
right and i think there's a way for you


---------95:04----------
to like


---------95:05----------
continue being successful


---------95:08----------
without being driven by


---------95:11----------
like the fear of going back to where you


---------95:13----------
were like i also have a past


---------95:15----------
that drives me forward but i don't think


---------95:18----------
i'm


---------95:19----------
ever gonna be back to you know like


---------95:22----------
no one can take it away from me like


---------95:25----------
even if i lose my job


---------95:27----------
lose my license or whatever like i'm


---------95:29----------
going to be a doctor


---------95:30----------
because that's what i am i'm going to be


---------95:33----------
me


---------95:34----------
and and so i think that there is a there


---------95:36----------
is actually like a


---------95:38----------
i think there's a road forward for you


---------95:39----------
i'm not saying you're in a bad place by


---------95:41----------
any means but i think if you really want


---------95:42----------
to understand buddhism like


---------95:44----------
there's always one step closer to


---------95:46----------
freedom from suffering


---------95:49----------
and i think the problem with with your


---------95:51----------
step is that it


---------95:52----------
involves actually giving up something


---------95:54----------
that has become very adaptive for you


---------95:56----------
right yeah what would it mean adaptive


---------96:00----------
well because it's what makes you


---------96:01----------
successful i guess yeah


---------96:04----------
that never wanting to be at the bank


---------96:06----------
again in that fear


---------96:08----------
that pushes you to not take a day off in


---------96:10----------
five years


---------96:13----------
pushes you to you know what like 10


---------96:15----------
million


---------96:16----------
subscribers on youtube i'm almost at 11


---------96:18----------
yeah


---------96:19----------
right and and so like who can say that


---------96:22----------
you're playing the game


---------96:23----------
wrong like you're playing the game


---------96:24----------
fantastically


---------96:26----------
and i'm i'm going to venture that


---------96:28----------
there's a better way to play it because


---------96:30----------
there's still some suffering there


---------96:31----------
yeah you know it's kind of goofy because


---------96:33----------
like i was so lazy about everything in


---------96:34----------
my life


---------96:35----------
and i was so lazy i didn't want to i did


---------96:37----------
the bare minimum for everything


---------96:38----------
even when i worked at the bank i did the


---------96:40----------
bare minimum and then all of a sudden


---------96:43----------
you give me something that i'm actually


---------96:44----------
genuinely good at something i know about


---------96:47----------
i'm more driven than i've ever been my


---------96:49----------
life dude i


---------96:50----------
i love that you said that because that's


---------96:52----------
like that's what i've been trying to


---------96:54----------
explain to like our community


---------96:56----------
is that they describe themselves as like


---------96:58----------
lazy and undisciplined right they're


---------96:59----------
like oh i'm


---------97:00----------
such a fuck-up yeah and and like this is


---------97:02----------
we see this actually


---------97:03----------
in our coaches so


---------97:07----------
um it was interesting we had a we had a


---------97:09----------
really good session


---------97:10----------
yesterday with these parents and then


---------97:12----------
like the parents were talking about how


---------97:14----------
their kids were like


---------97:15----------
the kids thought that they were


---------97:16----------
worthless they were like yeah i'm so


---------97:18----------
worthless


---------97:18----------
i'm such a screw-up um you know i can't


---------97:22----------
succeed at anything and like like our


---------97:23----------
coach was like yeah that used to be me


---------97:25----------
like i used to feel that way


---------97:27----------
and then i started coaching and now it's


---------97:29----------
like


---------97:30----------
i love it like you know i'm i'm


---------97:32----------
independent like i


---------97:34----------
you know i do like i wake up every day


---------97:36----------
and i like make the world a better place


---------97:37----------
and it's awesome and i'm not lazy i'm


---------97:39----------
not undisciplined


---------97:40----------
yeah you got you got to find something


---------97:42----------
that that inspires you


---------97:43----------
you have to have something to look


---------97:45----------
forward to the next day every day


---------97:47----------
you have to look forward to something


---------97:48----------
something that inspires you


---------97:50----------
um like even if it's like that's why a


---------97:52----------
lot of people um


---------97:53----------
you know like with children when they if


---------97:55----------
they have children they'll be inspired


---------97:57----------
to work hard


---------97:58----------
for their child like that their child


---------98:01----------
literally inspires them


---------98:02----------
like where's that where's that uh from


---------98:04----------
from the simpsons you know he's got that


---------98:05----------
picture of a


---------98:07----------
uh why can't i think is his child's name


---------98:09----------
but you know when he's working he's


---------98:10----------
thinking about


---------98:11----------
his little baby yeah


---------98:14----------
absolutely listen jason do you um are


---------98:17----------
you interested in meditation at all


---------98:20----------
i tried it it was the most difficult


---------98:21----------
thing i've ever attempted my life


---------98:23----------
it was so hard i couldn't so what you


---------98:26----------
can go on sorry


---------98:28----------
you're so hard yep what was hard about


---------98:31----------
it


---------98:32----------
um so like just not thinking about


---------98:36----------
anything


---------98:37----------
is the most difficult thing in the world


---------98:39----------
that's maybe


---------98:40----------
what meditation is but okay well well


---------98:44----------
that's that's the goal that the goal is


---------98:46----------
to just sit there focus on your breath


---------98:47----------
and all that stuff


---------98:49----------
um but to really just


---------98:52----------
focu to block out everything else all


---------98:55----------
the outside world is focus on


---------98:57----------
you know uh simple breathing tactics is


---------99:01----------
hard


---------99:03----------
it's very hard yeah so i think this is


---------99:05----------
where you know especially for people who


---------99:06----------
have adhd


---------99:07----------
i recommend particular meditations


---------99:10----------
yeah um because slowing down your mind


---------99:14----------
is not going to work for you


---------99:16----------
so entering a no mind state involves


---------99:18----------
speeding it up


---------99:20----------
so if you have adhd the kinds of


---------99:22----------
meditation techniques that i recommend


---------99:25----------
so if we say like you're saying that the


---------99:27----------
goal of meditation is a no mind state


---------99:28----------
right


---------99:30----------
yeah i guess okay so sure that's a good


---------99:33----------
way to put it so like if we think about


---------99:34----------
a no mind state


---------99:35----------
it's a mind that's still right


---------99:39----------
okay and so what you're saying is i have


---------99:41----------
a lot of trouble staying still


---------99:44----------
well it's not about this thing so like i


---------99:45----------
can sit there i just get bored oh my


---------99:47----------
goodness


---------99:48----------
we're talking about your mind your mind


---------99:49----------
staying still yeah right


---------99:51----------
so you're it's hard for your mind to


---------99:53----------
stay still so there are two ways


---------99:55----------
to get a mind to stay still one is like


---------99:59----------
telling it to stay still and you're like


---------100:01----------
don't move


---------100:02----------
stay right there no moving and then your


---------100:04----------
mind is like [ __ ] that


---------100:06----------
i'm gonna go do all this cool stuff the


---------100:08----------
other way to get your mind to stay still


---------100:10----------
is to have it run instead of telling it


---------100:13----------
to be still


---------100:14----------
actually pushing it to move as fast as


---------100:16----------
it can you run buddy you run run run go


---------100:18----------
mine go go go


---------100:19----------
go go go go go go go go go go and at the


---------100:23----------
end of that running


---------100:24----------
it'll naturally be still yeah


---------100:28----------
does that make sense yeah i mean i love


---------100:30----------
working out i work out every day


---------100:32----------
um it's one of my favorite things to do


---------100:34----------
if i don't work out i feel horrible i


---------100:35----------
feel


---------100:36----------
angry i feel like i don't know i just


---------100:37----------
feel i don't feel good so i always feel


---------100:39----------
better when i after i work out i just


---------100:41----------
feel


---------100:41----------
like a better happier person it's it's


---------100:43----------
like meditation in its own way


---------100:44----------
yes so i think that that's a good form


---------100:46----------
of meditation like physical exercise


---------100:49----------
uh since i can't if you are willing if


---------100:51----------
you're open to trying something i'm


---------100:53----------
gonna try to give you


---------100:55----------
let me just think about what we can do


---------100:56----------
because my favorite adhd meditations you


---------100:58----------
can't do over the internet


---------100:59----------
um but i can try to come up with


---------101:03----------
something that we can try


---------101:05----------
sure just hit or miss


---------101:08----------
sure let me just think about this


---------101:12----------
oh yeah i've got a good one


---------101:18----------
okay can you um can you stand


---------101:21----------
sure let me put my standing desk up okay


---------101:24----------
going up


---------101:27----------
i'm gonna have to stand too


---------101:31----------
all right so we might hear you without


---------101:34----------
my headphones because i don't have


---------101:35----------
speakers


---------101:37----------
okay so why don't you just hang hang


---------101:39----------
tight there for a second


---------101:41----------
uh i'm gonna have to mute the desktop


---------101:42----------
audio for a second okay so don't uh


---------101:44----------
we can't hear you either okay i'm gonna


---------101:46----------
demonstrate


---------101:48----------
oh [ __ ] how am i gonna do this because i


---------101:51----------
do wanna


---------101:52----------
you're standing right but you can


---------101:55----------
you can stand there comfortably okay


---------101:56----------
cool i can still walk you through this


---------101:58----------
okay this is what we're gonna do


---------102:01----------
right


---------102:04----------
so


---------102:07----------
how far let's do this


---------102:13----------
you can stand next to your computer it's


---------102:14----------
totally fine all right what we're gonna


---------102:17----------
do


---------102:18----------
is oh i gotta move this one too


---------102:23----------
so i'm gonna stand


---------102:26----------
like this okay


---------102:31----------
okay so i've got to get here i've got my


---------102:33----------
knee i don't know


---------102:36----------
yep


---------102:40----------
okay okay and


---------102:44----------
i want you to close your eyes


---------102:47----------
just stay stable and now i want you to


---------102:51----------
tell me what


---------102:52----------

---------102:55----------

---------103:07----------
uh well i signed for dinner i had some


---------103:09----------
sort of pasta that was really


---------103:11----------
yummy okay so now i want you to stop


---------103:14----------
talking and just focus on staying still


---------103:17----------
what do you notice hard to balance


---------103:22----------
good i can do this though yeah you can


---------103:25----------
switch legs


---------103:26----------

---------103:29----------
all right that's much easier i have my


---------103:30----------
eyes


---------103:30----------
a lot easier yep okay so


---------103:34----------
now tell me about what you ate two days


---------103:36----------
ago


---------103:41----------
for dinner what do i have i have no idea


---------103:45----------
there's probably some sort of pasta or


---------103:47----------
something


---------103:49----------
i have something called um i got i


---------103:52----------
recently got this like food service


---------103:53----------
things


---------103:53----------
really nice called tavala oven so it's


---------103:55----------
like basically like oven cooked meals


---------103:57----------
but it's like


---------103:58----------
delivered it's really cool okay so i


---------104:01----------
want you to


---------104:02----------
now close your eyes for a moment and


---------104:03----------
let's stop talking and i want you to


---------104:06----------
notice the difficulty yeah it's hard to


---------104:09----------
balance just like yep


---------104:11----------
open your eyes open your eyes easily


---------104:15----------
okay good


---------104:18----------
close


---------104:27----------
when you need to you can open


---------104:31----------
close again


---------104:37----------
open okay you can relax for a moment


---------104:41----------
so let's talk about this okay so okay


---------104:44----------
it gets hot oh i guess people can't hear


---------104:47----------
you because i'm muted


---------104:48----------
um so


---------104:52----------
when your eyes were closed when your


---------104:54----------
eyes were open what were you able to


---------104:56----------
think about


---------104:59----------
uh i i don't know i wasn't really


---------105:02----------
thinking of anything


---------105:03----------
[Music]


---------105:05----------
so you were answering my questions yeah


---------105:08----------
i was answering your questions but i


---------105:09----------
really wasn't thinking of anything


---------105:11----------
okay and when your eyes were closed what


---------105:13----------
were you thinking about um


---------105:17----------
well with the questions you asked me i


---------105:18----------
was struggling with and then


---------105:21----------
um i was focused focused on


---------105:24----------
trying to balance so it was really hard


---------105:28----------
yeah what was your mind doing um


---------105:34----------
like what was it thinking about yeah


---------105:37----------
i don't i don't think i was really


---------105:39----------
thinking much about anything because


---------105:41----------
it was oh so the physical activity that


---------105:44----------
was a distraction got it


---------105:46----------
so let's understand okay let's be


---------105:48----------
precise with our language okay so first


---------105:50----------
thing


---------105:51----------
what is the mind the mind is the


---------105:53----------
presence of thoughts


---------105:55----------
yeah right so when you're adhd like when


---------105:57----------
people say i'm adhd what does that mean


---------105:59----------
practically it means


---------106:02----------
that their mind thinks all kinds of


---------106:04----------
random things


---------106:06----------
and so you're like meditation is the


---------106:07----------
hardest thing in the world because i


---------106:09----------
can't get my mind to focus on one thing


---------106:12----------
that's why it's hard yeah


---------106:15----------
and yet in 60 seconds


---------106:20----------
you've managed to get your mind to not


---------106:23----------
think about anything when was the last


---------106:24----------
time you didn't think about anything


---------106:26----------
it's been a while but um yeah it's been


---------106:29----------
a while


---------106:30----------
yeah right so


---------106:33----------
meditation for you so meditation starts


---------106:35----------
with one pointedness of the mind


---------106:37----------
focusing all of your attention on one


---------106:40----------
thing


---------106:41----------
now your problem is that you [ __ ]


---------106:43----------
probably went to some mindfulness person


---------106:45----------
who told you to observe your breath


---------106:47----------
and you're like your mind is like [ __ ]


---------106:49----------
that so what we're gonna do


---------106:51----------
is try to give your mind as many things


---------106:55----------
to juggle as possible


---------106:56----------
okay and there's nothing wrong with you


---------106:59----------
that that you have trouble balancing


---------107:00----------
with your


---------107:01----------
eyes closed that's just our our body has


---------107:04----------
three


---------107:05----------
balancing mechanisms eyesight


---------107:08----------
our dorsal columns which is like


---------107:10----------
proprioception and then like


---------107:12----------
part of our um our ear canal


---------107:15----------
yeah we have a vestibular apparatus and


---------107:17----------
so when you take one of those away


---------107:19----------
balancing becomes a lot harder


---------107:21----------
so what i did is like try to create a


---------107:23----------
scenario where like your mind has


---------107:25----------
no choice


---------107:28----------
that's cool to focus on one thing


---------107:32----------
because it's like i can't [ __ ]


---------107:34----------
talk about what i ate because i'm busy


---------107:36----------
right now


---------107:37----------
yeah right and so for you what you need


---------107:40----------
to do is like you just


---------107:42----------
and that's what i mean by making your


---------107:43----------
mind run


---------107:45----------
where like your mind is like no i don't


---------107:46----------
this is easy for me i'm like okay fine


---------107:48----------
let's


---------107:48----------
bump up the difficulty baby let's go as


---------107:52----------
hard as you can go like


---------107:53----------
max difficulty so in your case i think


---------107:56----------
this is a balancing exercise now the


---------107:58----------
tricky thing is


---------107:59----------
as you get better at balancing as your


---------108:02----------
body learns your mind is gonna get bored


---------108:04----------
again


---------108:05----------
right okay so you can do this for a


---------108:08----------
little while


---------108:09----------
and then you gotta find something


---------108:10----------
different yes and this is why


---------108:12----------
advanced yoga postures exist people


---------108:14----------
don't understand this


---------108:15----------
yoga has nothing to do with your body i


---------108:17----------
mean that's something to do about it but


---------108:18----------
it's not really about body


---------108:20----------
the reason that people do yoga postures


---------108:22----------
is because


---------108:23----------
the posture should bring your attention


---------108:25----------
to the present


---------108:26----------
it should demand your attention that's


---------108:28----------
why you start with easy ones


---------108:29----------
and as those get easy you get more bendy


---------108:32----------
because the bendier you get


---------108:34----------
the more of your mental attention it


---------108:35----------
demands


---------108:37----------
it's so exhausting during i didn't edit


---------108:39----------
yoga like twice in my life it's so


---------108:41----------
exhausting you're just like mentally


---------108:43----------
exhausted afterwards


---------108:44----------
yes that's the point it's a mental


---------108:48----------
activity not a physical one


---------108:50----------
so in your case you can do this business


---------108:54----------
you know this arms above your head and


---------108:56----------
balancing on one foot


---------108:58----------
um and then like like what you want to


---------109:00----------
do is like basically


---------109:03----------
like make it hard on yourself so in your


---------109:05----------
case so for some people


---------109:07----------
asking them questions becomes easier or


---------109:09----------
harder in your case it seems like eyes


---------109:11----------
is sufficient


---------109:12----------
so eyes open if your eyes are open it


---------109:14----------
becomes easy and then your mind is going


---------109:16----------
to start to wander


---------109:17----------
yeah and then eyes closed oh [ __ ] panic


---------109:21----------
mode


---------109:22----------
panic mode we got to focus everybody on


---------109:24----------
board


---------109:25----------
all the attention in one place and it's


---------109:28----------
automatic


---------109:29----------
if meditation is hard for you that means


---------109:31----------
that you're not learning it the right


---------109:33----------
way meditation isn't supposed to be hard


---------109:35----------
it's supposed to be that was easy that


---------109:37----------
was easy thank you


---------109:39----------
yeah so give that a shot and then you


---------109:41----------
know


---------109:42----------
you can try practicing that and other


---------109:44----------
kinds of physical postures and


---------109:45----------
you know maybe you know we ever meet


---------109:48----------
again or whatever like are you


---------109:49----------
if you have other questions we'll have


---------109:50----------
to figure out some way to like


---------109:52----------
teach you lesson number two sure cool


---------109:56----------
um any questions about the meditation


---------109:58----------

---------109:59----------

---------110:22----------
because i know we're streaming on twitch

from around the world and i put them all


---------110:44----------
into


---------110:46----------
one video twice a week that's only about


---------110:48----------
three minutes long


---------110:49----------
so i only need six minutes of your


---------110:50----------
attention once a week


---------110:53----------
i think about you as the npr of memes


---------110:58----------
yeah yeah it's because i want to be uh i


---------111:00----------
want to be


---------111:01----------
as soon as you do something so the


---------111:03----------
reason why everything is


---------111:05----------
very uh family-friendly


---------111:09----------
is because as soon as you do something


---------111:12----------
you're basically alienating an audience


---------111:14----------
as soon as you swear


---------111:15----------
as soon as you do energy


---------111:18----------
so i try to i try to form it in a way


---------111:20----------
that's family-friendly but doesn't feel


---------111:22----------
family-friendly i could take some


---------111:25----------
pointers from you on that


---------111:26----------
um so people are asking


---------111:30----------

---------111:32----------
