---------00:15----------
now we're gonna dig into a little bit of


---------00:18----------
how to find that competing interest so


---------00:22----------
one of the problems that a lot of gamers


---------00:23----------
feel is when I talk to them they feel


---------00:25----------
powerless like they feel like they can't


---------00:28----------
get control over their lives they feel


---------00:30----------
like they have things that they want to


---------00:32----------
do in life and they're just not able to


---------00:33----------
do them but the deeper thing that


---------00:36----------
affects a lot of gamers is that a lot of


---------00:38----------
y'all actually feel not just powerless


---------00:40----------
but directionless you feel like you're


---------00:43----------
not moving anywhere in life it's not


---------00:45----------
just about not being able to move it's


---------00:49----------
about not even knowing where you want to


---------00:51----------
go and feeling directionless is one of


---------00:54----------
the worst feelings that a gamer can


---------00:56----------
possibly have and one of the problems


---------00:58----------
with gaming is that gaming gives you the


---------01:01----------
sense of false direction if you think


---------01:03----------
about a video game there's a sense of


---------01:05----------
progress right you go to this world and


---------01:07----------
then you do this level and then you go


---------01:09----------
to this other world and you do this


---------01:10----------
level you level your character up you go


---------01:13----------
to the later stages of the game so


---------01:15----------
there's this there's the sense of


---------01:16----------
progress and as human beings we are


---------01:19----------
wired to want to progress in some way


---------01:23----------
the problem is that that sense of


---------01:25----------
progress that you get through the game


---------01:26----------
while it sort of scratches the itch of


---------01:29----------
progressing in a temporary way when you


---------01:33----------
go to sleep at night you feel like you


---------01:35----------
haven't really done anything and I mean


---------01:38----------
that can be one of the most terrifying


---------01:39----------
feelings in the world and that's why


---------01:41----------
gamers play to the point of exhaustion


---------01:43----------
before they go to bed so how is it that


---------01:46----------
you can start to develop a direction in


---------01:48----------
life I think the first thing that you


---------01:50----------
have to do is understand the difference


---------01:53----------
between doing something with meaning and


---------01:57----------
doing something that is a desire so what


---------01:59----------
I mean by that is if I ask a game or


---------02:01----------
like where do you want to be ten years


---------02:03----------
from now most of the answers that they


---------02:06----------
come up with are actually desires


---------02:07----------
they're not actually true interests


---------02:10----------
they're not things that they value so


---------02:12----------
I'll give you an example so if I ask


---------02:14----------
someone you know where do you want to be


---------02:15----------
in ten years they'll say like oh you


---------02:17----------
know I'd like to be a millionaire like


---------02:18----------
I'd like to have my own house you know


---------02:20----------
I'd like to be married I'd like to you


---------02:22----------
know travel internationally and go to


---------02:24----------
video game tournaments they'll say like


---------02:26----------
all this kind of stuff and that's just


---------02:27----------
those are just kind of desires they're


---------02:29----------
just like


---------02:29----------
it's just like stuff you want right you


---------02:30----------
can go down the street and you can ask


---------02:32----------
anyone like what do you want and they'll


---------02:34----------
be able to tell you all kinds of stuff


---------02:35----------
but desires don't actually really Drive


---------02:39----------
your behavior they don't motivate you


---------02:42----------
and you may think that they motivate you


---------02:43----------
but they really don't because if they


---------02:45----------
did motivate you then you'd be moving


---------02:47----------
towards those goals right so by


---------02:49----------
definition that random stuff that's kind


---------02:52----------
of ephemeral and and


---------02:54----------
out in the ether that stuff that you


---------02:55----------
want those kinds of desires are the


---------02:58----------
kinds of things that it would be nice if


---------02:59----------
I had that that's really what that


---------03:02----------
thought is it's not really a true desire


---------03:05----------
stuff that motivates you some stuff that


---------03:09----------
actually gets you out of your out of the


---------03:11----------
chair and gets your ass moving in a


---------03:13----------
direction is what I call a competing


---------03:15----------
interest and those competing interests


---------03:18----------
depend on values and so what is a value


---------03:21----------
values are something that when you move


---------03:24----------
in that direction you feel fulfilled so


---------03:28----------
the first question that I would ask


---------03:29----------
gamers is what makes you feel fulfilled


---------03:32----------
what is it that actually gives you a


---------03:34----------
sense of like wow I really did something


---------03:36----------
good today what is it that makes you


---------03:38----------
feel like you've got the biggest dick on


---------03:40----------
the planet what is that thing that


---------03:42----------
really makes you feel like man I am


---------03:44----------
awesome and the funny thing is that a


---------03:46----------
lot of gamers that I talk to what they


---------03:47----------
actually value is performance in the


---------03:50----------
game and that may not be what you want


---------03:52----------
to value but let's just be clear let's


---------03:54----------
be honest with ourselves about what you


---------03:56----------
care about a lot of the gamers that I


---------03:58----------
work with are actually competitive


---------03:59----------
gamers and they want to be like on the


---------04:02----------
top 100 of the ladder and they want to


---------04:03----------
like compete and they want to be the


---------04:05----------
best in the game and that's actually


---------04:08----------
what they care about that's what they


---------04:09----------
value which is why they practice so hard


---------04:13----------
day after day after day you can see how


---------04:15----------
when you really understand that the


---------04:17----------
value is to be the best person in the


---------04:19----------
game it drives behavior on its own and


---------04:22----------
you may say well then I'm because


---------04:25----------
like if I value playing video games then


---------04:27----------
how can I move forward in life doesn't


---------04:28----------
that just mean I'm gonna play a bunch of


---------04:29----------
video games yes that's kind of true but


---------04:32----------
the good news is that gamers have a lot


---------04:35----------
of people actually have a lot of values


---------04:36----------
that they're not even aware of and this


---------04:39----------
is where introspection comes into play


---------04:41----------
this is where as a


---------04:43----------
or what you can actually sit down and do


---------04:45----------
is a series of exercises to figure out


---------04:48----------
and clarify what your values are and


---------04:50----------
when you start to recognize your values


---------04:54----------
when you start to say like oh actually


---------04:55----------
this is something that I care about I


---------04:57----------
want to do this this is something that's


---------04:59----------
really important to me the motivation


---------05:01----------
will follow that clarification of values


---------05:03----------
the motivation actually kind of comes


---------05:05----------
automatically for example let's say that


---------05:09----------
here in this this Hall you know like


---------05:11----------
someone walks in with a gun and then


---------05:13----------
starts like shooting at people like


---------05:15----------
that's awful and that's been happening


---------05:16----------
in a lot of schools which is absolutely


---------05:18----------
crazy if you look at what those people


---------05:21----------
do they actually value their lives right


---------05:23----------
like like the students in schools that


---------05:25----------
get shot up value their lives which is


---------05:27----------
why they try to preserve them it's


---------05:29----------
something that's really important to


---------05:30----------
them it sounds kind of silly and stupid


---------05:32----------
but if you think about it what motivates


---------05:34----------
that person what motivates someone to


---------05:37----------
escape death is just a value for life


---------05:39----------
and that's a really powerful motivator


---------05:41----------
and it's one of the most powerful


---------05:43----------
motivators you can have the neat thing


---------05:45----------
is that if you can figure out values


---------05:47----------
outside of just a preservation of life


---------05:49----------
which most biological beings have you


---------05:52----------
can also find motivation that'll make


---------05:54----------
you move forward in life so the way that


---------05:58----------
I'd say so let's talk a little bit


---------06:00----------
practically how do you figure out what


---------06:02----------
your values are so I'd start by you know


---------06:05----------
grab a piece of paper and write down


---------06:07----------
like in one-page like write 500 words


---------06:10----------
about a time where you felt fulfilled


---------06:13----------
actually sit down and do the exercise


---------06:16----------
and this is really important because


---------06:17----------
gamers tend to think a lot but they


---------06:21----------
actually don't aren't good at reflecting


---------06:23----------
or criticizing their own thought process


---------06:26----------
and if you think about this this is a


---------06:28----------
little bit tangential but when you play


---------06:30----------
a game a gamer comes up with an idea of


---------06:32----------
what's gonna work and then they go into


---------06:34----------
the game and then they get told based on


---------06:37----------
the game whether the idea works or not


---------06:39----------
right like let's say I have a strategy


---------06:41----------
to take down a boss and when I go in


---------06:43----------
with in with that strategy the reason I


---------06:46----------
know the strategy works or doesn't work


---------06:47----------
is because the game actually tells me I


---------06:50----------
don't have to reflect on my thought


---------06:52----------
process or my strategy myself because


---------06:54----------
the game is gonna provide me with the


---------06:56----------
feedback


---------06:57----------
and since gamers spend so much time


---------06:58----------
coming up with strategies but have an


---------07:01----------
external source of feedback on what they


---------07:04----------
come up with they don't develop the


---------07:06----------
capacity to reflect and objectively look


---------07:09----------
at their strategies even though you guys


---------07:11----------
think you're able to do that you're


---------07:12----------
actually not very good at that so what


---------07:14----------
you need to do is use that get some


---------07:17----------
external source of feedback by putting


---------07:20----------
it on a piece of paper so write down in


---------07:22----------
500 words on one piece of paper what


---------07:25----------
makes you feel fulfilled and when you do


---------07:27----------
that then you'll have the ability it'll


---------07:30----------
be on a piece of paper it'll be external


---------07:32----------
and then you can look at it you can read


---------07:34----------
it and then you can reflect on it and


---------07:36----------
when you do that try to figure out okay


---------07:38----------
what is what is it that I really care


---------07:40----------
about that I've written here why did I


---------07:42----------
feel fulfilled what is it about me that


---------07:46----------
big why does this make me feel fulfilled


---------07:48----------
and then you'll start to get a


---------07:50----------
clarification of what your values are


---------07:52----------
and once you start clarifying what your


---------07:54----------
values are the neat thing is that the


---------07:56----------
motivation will come kind of on its own


---------07:59----------
and we've talked a little bit about


---------08:01----------
motivation and how motivation is not


---------08:02----------
willpower right like when I when I


---------08:05----------
really need to take a I'm motivated


---------08:08----------
to find a bathroom that has nothing to


---------08:09----------
do with willpower it's not like I'm


---------08:11----------
forcing myself to use the bathroom in


---------08:12----------
fact you need willpower to restrain


---------08:15----------
motivation because to not in my


---------08:17----------
pants right now I actually need to use


---------08:19----------
my willpower to like you know keep my


---------08:21----------
anus puckered tight and not myself


---------08:23----------
and so that requires energy but the


---------08:26----------
motivation to find a bathroom is


---------08:28----------
automatic and is gonna drive my behavior


---------08:30----------
so when you find your values when you


---------08:33----------
clarify what your values are you guys


---------08:35----------
will be amazed the motivation is gonna


---------08:36----------
come on its own and then your life will


---------08:38----------
start to change but don't fall into the


---------08:41----------
trap that most gamers fall into which is


---------08:44----------
that I don't need to do this exercise I


---------08:45----------
can just think through it in my head I'm


---------08:47----------
telling you guys you can't do that you


---------08:49----------
actually need to externalize upon a


---------08:51----------
piece of paper because of the way that


---------08:53----------
games shape your brain because games are


---------08:56----------
the ones that give you external sources


---------08:58----------
of feedback on your thought process so


---------09:00----------
you really have to actually sit down and


---------09:02----------
write it out on a piece of paper you'll


---------09:04----------
be surprised at what actually comes out


---------09:06----------
because the first five sentences you can


---------09:09----------
think of in your head


---------09:10----------
but the rest of the stuff I guarantee


---------09:13----------
you is gonna be something that you have


---------09:14----------
not thought about before so just to kind


---------09:17----------
of recap the way that you really get


---------09:19----------
control of your gaming is through


---------09:21----------
developing a competing interest and the


---------09:23----------
way that you really figure out what a


---------09:25----------
competing interest is is to clarify your


---------09:28----------
values and you have to understand that


---------09:30----------
your values are very different from your


---------09:32----------
desires stuff that you just want like


---------09:35----------
yeah I like I want to be President to


---------09:36----------
the United States or I want to own 50%


---------09:39----------
of Amazon or 50% of Google like yeah


---------09:41----------
sure you want that but that's not that's


---------09:43----------
not actually gonna cause you to change


---------09:44----------
your behavior whereas understanding what


---------09:46----------
your values are is gonna evoke emotion I


---------09:49----------
mean a motivation and that motivation is


---------09:52----------
going to come automatically and your


---------09:54----------
behavior will start to change on its own


---------09:56----------
but you've got to clarify your values


---------09:58----------
first we're gonna take a short break but


---------10:01----------
when we come back I'm gonna tell you


---------10:03----------
guys a little bit about something from


---------10:05----------
kind of the eastern side and we'll talk


---------10:07----------
a little bit about this word called


---------10:09----------
Dharma which means duty
