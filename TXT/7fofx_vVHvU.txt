---------00:00----------
it's like going for a jog and when


---------00:01----------
you're you start huffing and puffing


---------00:03----------
your lungs are like oh [ __ ] we need to


---------00:04----------
get in shape that's literally what's


---------00:06----------
gonna happen in in their brain is


---------00:08----------
they're like struggling to keep up with


---------00:10----------
what you're saying


---------00:12----------
okay


---------00:13----------
so let's start with um so you don't want


---------00:15----------
to go home for the holidays so there


---------00:17----------
there are kind of like three or four


---------00:18----------
skills before we start off there are


---------00:20----------
three or four skills that you all need


---------00:22----------
to learn that are going to be really


---------00:23----------
important


---------00:25----------
the first is articulate instead of


---------00:27----------
attack okay so the first thing to


---------00:29----------
understand very important for the


---------00:31----------
narcissistic family member is that you


---------00:33----------
don't want to like as you state your


---------00:36----------
opinion it will be perceived as oh what


---------00:39----------
well maybe this will turn into


---------00:40----------
narcissistic family member


---------00:42----------
um so first like so tip number one is


---------00:46----------
articulate instead of attack


---------00:48----------
so if you don't like something about the


---------00:50----------
holidays like for example


---------00:52----------
you know let's say that like if if your


---------00:54----------
household is like mine


---------00:56----------
you know most of the women are


---------00:58----------
responsible for cooking and cleaning


---------00:59----------
while the men sit around and basically


---------01:01----------
do nothing


---------01:02----------
and so if you were to challenge that in


---------01:04----------
some way and kind of point that out


---------01:06----------
right


---------01:07----------
then chances are like someone will feel


---------01:10----------
attacked


---------01:11----------
and like if they feel attacked they're


---------01:12----------
gonna get defensive and if they feel


---------01:14----------
defensive and if they start to feel


---------01:16----------
guilty then the narcissistic behaviors


---------01:19----------
will pop up right because then they'll


---------01:21----------
like attack you in turn because they're


---------01:23----------
like how dare you make me feel


---------01:25----------
you know lazy and you make me feel like


---------01:27----------
called out you're calling me out for


---------01:28----------
being lazy and not contributing to the


---------01:30----------
holiday so screw you i'm on the attack


---------01:33----------
so the first thing that we need to do is


---------01:35----------
learn how to articulate


---------01:38----------
instead of attack okay


---------01:41----------
second thing


---------01:42----------
i know it's kind of rough don't expect


---------01:44----------
much


---------01:45----------
so understand that when it comes to


---------01:47----------
traditions and dynamics around the


---------01:48----------
holidays


---------01:50----------
i apologize but


---------01:52----------
one two hour stream is not going to give


---------01:53----------
you the magic bullet that will allow you


---------01:55----------
to become a superhuman go into the


---------01:57----------
holidays and transform things overnight


---------02:00----------
okay it definitely is going to help you


---------02:02----------
don't get me wrong but recognize that


---------02:04----------
altering families and especially


---------02:07----------
narcissistic personalities is not done


---------02:10----------
after a two-hour stream it's gonna like


---------02:12----------
take time so what we're gonna be doing


---------02:14----------
is establishing a foundation of


---------02:16----------
communication and boundary setting which


---------02:19----------
you will then build on over time and


---------02:22----------
then a year from now two years from now


---------02:24----------
you'll start to see like real change


---------02:26----------
within your whole family okay


---------02:30----------
next thing


---------02:34----------
is manage your own emotions


---------02:36----------
so


---------02:38----------
if you are trying to create change in


---------02:40----------
any kind of situation you need to be


---------02:43----------
calm cool and collected


---------02:45----------
so like you can't get emotionally


---------02:46----------
invested in what's going on because this


---------02:50----------
is the jedi mind trick


---------02:52----------
when you get emotionally activated the


---------02:53----------
narcissistic family member you're


---------02:55----------
playing their game and they're gonna win


---------02:57----------
they are master manipulators right so


---------03:00----------
the second you get emotional and the


---------03:01----------
second they pull out responses from you


---------03:04----------
that are like emotionally driven like


---------03:06----------
you've lost because they're gonna beat


---------03:08----------
you at that game that's why they are


---------03:11----------
what they are in the family right that's


---------03:13----------
like how they get there is because they


---------03:15----------
are they're diamond level players at


---------03:17----------
emotional manipulation


---------03:19----------
and so if they're emotionally


---------03:20----------
manipulative and you're emotional you've


---------03:23----------
lost that's the counter so what you need


---------03:26----------
to do is like manage your own emotions


---------03:28----------
because the more that you manage your


---------03:29----------
emotions


---------03:31----------
then they're not gonna have like


---------03:32----------
anything to attack right it's like


---------03:34----------
you're gonna have like you know you have


---------03:36----------
like emotion vulnerability like that


---------03:38----------
that's what they attack with so you just


---------03:39----------
have to be you have to manage your your


---------03:41----------
own emotions so how do you do that


---------03:44----------
we're gonna teach all a little bit of


---------03:45----------
meditation today we're going to actually


---------03:47----------
do it today so i'm going to share


---------03:49----------
scenarios with you that are going to


---------03:51----------
make you feel validated and then you'll


---------03:53----------
process some of those emotions and


---------03:55----------
hopefully you'll feel a little bit


---------03:56----------
better off you can also do something


---------03:58----------
like i think group coaching is fantastic


---------03:59----------
for this kind of thing where you can


---------04:01----------
join like one of our groups do some


---------04:03----------
group coaching talk about the holidays


---------04:04----------
[ __ ] about the holidays commiserate


---------04:06----------
with other people who are also bitching


---------04:08----------
about the holidays process your emotions


---------04:10----------
so that you can go into the the holidays


---------04:12----------
calm cool and collected okay so these


---------04:14----------
are our three skills articulate instead


---------04:16----------
of attack don't expect much change is


---------04:19----------
slow within families and manage your own


---------04:21----------
emotions


---------04:22----------
okay


---------04:23----------
and that's not i'm not really debating


---------04:25----------
you guys so you guys like we're talking


---------04:27----------
about narcissism okay it's going to be


---------04:28----------
the common thread here so we're going to


---------04:30----------
take narcissism and we're going to run


---------04:32----------
it through the other two and then we'll


---------04:33----------
sort of conclude with it


---------04:35----------
okay


---------04:36----------
so you don't want to go home for the


---------04:37----------
holidays so let's start with this


---------04:39----------
scenario what does this look like


---------04:41----------
i need a name chat what's a name


---------04:44----------
okay


---------04:46----------
nick


---------04:48----------
okay so me perfect so


---------04:52----------
hold on stop scroll okay


---------04:54----------
okay so we've got pepolini


---------04:56----------
okay so we're gonna have pepolini


---------04:58----------
so pepolini calls their parents


---------05:01----------
and says


---------05:02----------
dear parents of pepolini


---------05:04----------
i'm sorry but i don't want to come home


---------05:06----------
for the holidays and then the parents


---------05:08----------
say what


---------05:09----------
they say


---------05:11----------
but honey we miss you so much little


---------05:12----------
peppalini it's just without you or who's


---------05:15----------
going to be our pepolini like we need


---------05:17----------
our little peppalini it's such a


---------05:19----------
wonderful time and we miss you so much


---------05:21----------
and we love you so much


---------05:23----------
and and like it's it's a time for the


---------05:25----------
family to be together


---------05:27----------
we miss you darling please come home


---------05:30----------
you know we're just it's not the same


---------05:32----------
without you it won't be the same you


---------05:34----------
know they'll say all these kinds of


---------05:36----------
things right


---------05:37----------
and so like what are they actually


---------05:38----------
saying


---------05:39----------
they're talking about why the holidays


---------05:41----------
are good for them


---------05:42----------
we will miss you


---------05:45----------
it's tradition it's something that we


---------05:47----------
value


---------05:48----------
it's all about their perspective and


---------05:50----------
what they gained from the holidays


---------05:53----------
and so this is what how you respond okay


---------05:55----------
so this is like 101 you say okay so i'm


---------05:57----------
hearing that if i don't come home from


---------05:59----------
the holidays


---------06:01----------
you'll miss me it won't be the same and


---------06:03----------
you kind of like really value everyone


---------06:05----------
being together for the holidays because


---------06:07----------
that is important to you it'll hurt me


---------06:09----------
beautifully put oh it'll hurt


---------06:12----------
it'll hurt me therefore if you don't


---------06:14----------
come home for the holidays you are


---------06:16----------
damaging me


---------06:17----------
you are hurting me by not coming


---------06:20----------
right so if we really pay attention to


---------06:22----------
that


---------06:23----------
is there any


---------06:25----------
understanding or anywhere in like is


---------06:28----------
there room for pepolini in any of those


---------06:30----------
statements


---------06:32----------
are the parents even asking


---------06:34----------
why don't you want to come home


---------06:37----------
right


---------06:38----------
is that even like happening at all no


---------06:40----------
it's all about tradition


---------06:43----------
and you're just a possession very well


---------06:45----------
said


---------06:46----------
right it's all about like how you will


---------06:48----------
affect them it'll hurt you


---------06:50----------
so this is where you reflect back and


---------06:52----------
you can say oh dad i i get that you guys


---------06:55----------
miss me a lot i get that like you know


---------06:56----------
you really want me to be there


---------06:59----------
and um i would hope


---------07:02----------
i too enjoy being spending time with


---------07:04----------
family up to a point you know i can


---------07:06----------
definitely see the value so you want to


---------07:09----------
acknowledge i can see the value in


---------07:11----------
coming home for the holidays


---------07:13----------
i'm curious and this is where you sucker


---------07:16----------
punch him okay so get ready for this


---------07:17----------
this is where you say what's your


---------07:19----------
understanding of what my experience of


---------07:22----------
the holidays is like


---------07:26----------
so ask them don't tell them hey it sucks


---------07:28----------
for me because abc


---------07:31----------
it sucks for me because all you'll ever


---------07:33----------
ask me is when am i going to get married


---------07:35----------
that's all you ever ask


---------07:37----------
all you ever do is like talk about how


---------07:39----------
you're so disappointed and how much


---------07:41----------
potential i have and i've never lived up


---------07:43----------
to it i it you know like you don't you


---------07:45----------
don't because if you do that what is


---------07:47----------
that doing chat is that articulating or


---------07:48----------
attacking


---------07:50----------
it's attacking right so we're not gonna


---------07:52----------
do that we don't actually tell them


---------07:56----------
you know like what


---------07:57----------
we feel


---------07:58----------
okay so don't attack chat i know you


---------08:01----------
want to that's why you have to get your


---------08:02----------
emotions in check okay


---------08:04----------
no attacking


---------08:06----------
i know you want to i really i i know you


---------08:08----------
do but we don't want to do it get your


---------08:09----------
emotions in check don't attack


---------08:11----------
so instead of saying all those things


---------08:12----------
you're gonna ask hey what's your


---------08:13----------
understanding of like what it's like for


---------08:15----------
me when i come home for the holidays


---------08:17----------
and then the parents are gonna be


---------08:18----------
confused they're gonna be like what


---------08:21----------
because what you're


---------08:22----------
asking them to do is you're like asking


---------08:24----------
a question that requires them to use


---------08:27----------
empathy you're asking them put yourself


---------08:29----------
in my shoes you can say put yourself in


---------08:32----------
my shoes but no one ever actually does


---------08:34----------
that right that's not actually how you


---------08:37----------
engage the empathic circuits of the


---------08:38----------
brain what you actually do is you ask


---------08:42----------
them a question what's your


---------08:43----------
understanding of what my experience is


---------08:44----------
like


---------08:45----------
and then like they have to put


---------08:48----------
themselves in your shoes to answer it


---------08:50----------
and they'll say i don't know why don't


---------08:52----------
you tell me


---------08:53----------
and that's where you kind of take a step


---------08:54----------
back


---------08:56----------
and then you kind of once again


---------08:57----------
articulate instead of acknowledge i mean


---------09:00----------
instead of attack right and then you can


---------09:01----------
say oh i can see now it's making a lot


---------09:04----------
of sense


---------09:05----------
that


---------09:06----------
understanding my perspective is not


---------09:08----------
something that like


---------09:10----------
you it's not like you really understand


---------09:12----------
what my experience is like and you need


---------09:14----------
me to explain it to you i now understand


---------09:16----------
why it's like been hard for me to come


---------09:18----------
home for the holidays because i now get


---------09:21----------
that like it seems like you don't


---------09:22----------
actually understand what my experience


---------09:24----------
is like and that's also why we have


---------09:26----------
differing ideas of the holidays right


---------09:27----------
because you seem to think it's like


---------09:28----------
wonderful and fun and all these kinds of


---------09:30----------
things but i get it now


---------09:32----------
you actually don't understand what my


---------09:34----------
experience is like and that's why you're


---------09:36----------
confused why i don't want to come home


---------09:37----------
for the holidays it makes sense to me


---------09:40----------
and so that's like sort of an attack but


---------09:41----------
what you really want to do is articulate


---------09:44----------
that they don't understand what your


---------09:45----------
perspective is like


---------09:47----------
okay so it's kind of passive aggressive


---------09:49----------
yeah because [ __ ] them right


---------09:52----------
this is really hard to execute you're


---------09:53----------
damn right it is that's why we're


---------09:55----------
training you line by line okay and we're


---------09:58----------
gonna give you guys a lot of training


---------09:59----------
here


---------10:00----------
i'm with you


---------10:02----------
so you could say oh i i understand that


---------10:04----------
you don't know what it's like for me and


---------10:07----------
that makes sense to me like now i


---------10:09----------
understand why we have differing


---------10:10----------
opinions because you have this one


---------10:12----------
understanding of the holidays and it


---------10:14----------
seems like you're not really aware of


---------10:15----------
mine


---------10:16----------
okay so then they're gonna feel attacked


---------10:19----------
and they're like oh just tell us what


---------10:21----------
are we doing wrong so this is this is


---------10:23----------
pitfall number one


---------10:25----------
where they tell you tell us what we're


---------10:27----------
doing wrong and we will fix it they want


---------10:29----------
to jump right to the solution okay


---------10:32----------
because here's what's going to happen if


---------10:33----------
they if they ask you okay so let's see


---------10:34----------
chat let's see what your predictive what


---------10:36----------
your you know predictive capabilities


---------10:38----------
are if they say tell us what we're doing


---------10:40----------
wrong and we'll fix it


---------10:41----------
what happens if you tell them what


---------10:43----------
they're doing wrong what are they going


---------10:44----------
to say let's say that you guys always


---------10:46----------
just ask me when am i gonna get married


---------10:48----------
and when am i gonna live up to my


---------10:50----------
potential


---------10:51----------
what are they gonna say if you say that


---------10:53----------
oh beautiful that's correct


---------10:56----------
oh so good so good two or three things


---------11:00----------
okay so this is the problem the first is


---------11:02----------
they'll start arguing with you they're


---------11:03----------
like oh no like they'll deny they'll say


---------11:05----------
like oh i we don't do that like you're


---------11:07----------
crazy [ __ ]


---------11:09----------
why are you


---------11:10----------
thinking that that's not what we mean


---------11:12----------
it's not what we mean


---------11:15----------
don't you understand that's not what we


---------11:17----------
mean we say it for your benefit it's


---------11:20----------
because we love you we'll get denials


---------11:22----------
we'll get justifications we'll get


---------11:25----------
you're an idiot for not understanding


---------11:28----------
right


---------11:30----------
all of those that's bucket number one


---------11:31----------
that's a pretty big bucket


---------11:34----------
it's not what we mean


---------11:36----------
the next thing that they'll do or if you


---------11:39----------
guys are like i don't know if that's


---------11:40----------
lucky or unlucky the other thing is


---------11:42----------
empty promises someone said it like that


---------11:45----------
very good


---------11:46----------
okay


---------11:48----------
they'll be like oh


---------11:49----------
we won't do that


---------11:52----------
we'll do whatever you want little one


---------11:55----------
oh pepelini please come back we promise


---------11:57----------
we won't ask you about your marriage


---------12:00----------
and here's the thing they can promise it


---------12:01----------
in that moment but i want y'all to


---------12:03----------
understand this like their brain has not


---------12:05----------
transformed in that moment that's not


---------12:07----------
how behavioral change happens


---------12:09----------
like


---------12:10----------
in that moment they're not going to


---------12:12----------
remember their promise it's not about


---------12:13----------
remembering the promise it's about


---------12:15----------
rewiring their brain it's about like


---------12:17----------
because giving a promise does not teach


---------12:19----------
them empathy do you guys get that what


---------12:20----------
they need to do is have empathy for your


---------12:22----------
situation but it's not like you just


---------12:24----------
like make a promise and it's like your


---------12:25----------
brain is like boom we're just gonna


---------12:27----------
build this empathy circuit up over here


---------12:29----------
and it's gonna be easy done finished


---------12:31----------
right so they'll promise whatever they


---------12:33----------
need to to get you to come


---------12:35----------
and they'll say oh we promise we won't


---------12:37----------
do that


---------12:38----------
okay so either way pepoliti don't trust


---------12:41----------
them your parents are evil no your


---------12:43----------
parents are not evil remember the goal


---------12:44----------
of this is to develop healthy


---------12:46----------
relationships with your family that's


---------12:49----------
the goal of this okay but we have to


---------12:50----------
understand what's going on in order to


---------12:52----------
develop a healthy relationship with them


---------12:56----------
so


---------12:56----------
this is where remember you have to


---------12:58----------
manage your expectations okay don't


---------13:00----------
expect much and you can say so this is


---------13:02----------
where like if they say whatever they say


---------13:04----------
you can kind of articulate back so if


---------13:07----------
they're very resistant


---------13:09----------
you can just reflect back to them you're


---------13:10----------
saying okay so like what you're saying


---------13:12----------
is that you know my feelings and my


---------13:14----------
reaction to your situation is


---------13:17----------
it to the holidays is like a


---------13:18----------
misinterpretation of your intention


---------13:21----------
so because you don't mean to hurt my


---------13:23----------
feelings


---------13:25----------
there's really nothing wrong with what


---------13:27----------
y'all are doing am i hearing that


---------13:28----------
correctly


---------13:30----------
and they're gonna be like wait a minute


---------13:31----------
so this is the key thing right so if you


---------13:33----------
don't argue you just articulate to them


---------13:35----------
what they said just articulate it just


---------13:37----------
be like hey so you're saying like


---------13:39----------
basically you don't want to say like and


---------13:41----------
you don't want to get emotional because


---------13:42----------
if you get emotional you're going to say


---------13:43----------
something like you're basically telling


---------13:44----------
me to go [ __ ] myself right you don't


---------13:46----------
want to say that but you want to say


---------13:47----------
that you want to just articulate so what


---------13:49----------
i'm hearing is that the reason that i


---------13:51----------
don't enjoy the holidays is because i


---------13:53----------
don't understand your intention behind


---------13:55----------
the words that you say


---------13:56----------
is that fair to say


---------13:58----------
just ask them is that what you mean


---------14:00----------
or that are you saying that the reason i


---------14:02----------
don't enjoy the holidays is because i'm


---------14:04----------
confused about what y'all are saying


---------14:06----------
because you never say it


---------14:07----------
so if they use denial


---------14:09----------
if they use we love you


---------14:11----------
um even though i feel hurt you're set


---------14:14----------
you're basically telling me that since


---------14:15----------
it's coming from a place of love like


---------14:17----------
you're going to continue doing it or i'm


---------14:19----------
confused so you can just ask them to


---------14:21----------
play the tape through to the end and


---------14:22----------
this is where like once again there's


---------14:24----------
going to be like an empathic lurch in


---------14:26----------
their brain because if you're attacking


---------14:28----------
them they can get defensive right but if


---------14:30----------
you're like just asking them questions


---------14:32----------
and like asking them to confirm the


---------14:33----------
idiocy that comes out of their mouth


---------14:35----------
they're gonna get like kind of confused


---------14:37----------
and then like you'll see there's like a


---------14:39----------
calculation error it's gonna be like the


---------14:41----------
debugging process before you run the


---------14:42----------
script like comes up with an error and


---------14:44----------
it won't run properly and they'll kind


---------14:46----------
of get confused and the good news is


---------14:48----------
you're already winning at that point


---------14:49----------
because their empathic brain is like


---------14:51----------
struggling it's like going for a jog and


---------14:53----------
when you're you start huffing and


---------14:54----------
puffing your lungs are like oh [ __ ] we


---------14:56----------
need to get in shape that's literally


---------14:58----------
what's gonna happen in in their brain is


---------15:00----------
they're like struggling to keep up with


---------15:02----------
what you're saying because deep down


---------15:04----------
they know that you're laying a trap for


---------15:05----------
them right you're like they're like they


---------15:07----------
can tell because you're not


---------15:09----------
you're not folding they can tell that


---------15:12----------
like oh my god there's a trap in here


---------15:14----------
but they don't know how to dodge it


---------15:15----------
because the trap is like literally their


---------15:17----------
words and so they get like kind of


---------15:18----------
confused like oh crap


---------15:20----------
right you guys get that


---------15:23----------
and so


---------15:25----------
you can ask them to articulate and then


---------15:27----------
this is where you can


---------15:29----------
like pull like kind of a jiu jitsu move


---------15:31----------
so like they make flounder


---------15:33----------
and so this is where they'll also


---------15:35----------
default to the second one they'll be


---------15:36----------
like just tell us what you want just


---------15:38----------
tell us how to fix it once they get


---------15:39----------
confused and they don't know how to read


---------15:41----------
you anymore they'll just be like just


---------15:42----------
tell me what you want


---------15:44----------
just tell me whatever you want i'll do


---------15:46----------
it whatever whatever just tell me what


---------15:47----------
do you what do you want from me have you


---------15:49----------
guys heard that what do you want from me


---------15:51----------
what do you want from me


---------15:53----------
like what i want from you is


---------15:54----------
understanding well how do i get explain


---------15:56----------
to me how to understand tell me how to


---------15:58----------
understand right it's confusing for them


---------16:00----------
because you can't make them understand


---------16:01----------
they have to make the effort to


---------16:03----------
understand themselves


---------16:05----------
and so you can say okay so this is where


---------16:07----------
you've got an option if you're gonna go


---------16:08----------
home for the holidays


---------16:11----------
you can lay a specific boundary and i'd


---------16:13----------
start small


---------16:14----------
so you can say yeah so what would it


---------16:17----------
would help if you guys did not mention


---------16:20----------
when i'm getting married or what my


---------16:21----------
dating status is


---------16:23----------
like


---------16:24----------
what do you how do y'all feel about and


---------16:26----------
then ask them like so lay your boundary


---------16:27----------
and then ask them how do y'all feel


---------16:29----------
about that


---------16:30----------
can i come home for the holidays without


---------16:32----------
talking about dating at all


---------16:34----------
are you guys gonna do are y'all willing


---------16:36----------
to do that


---------16:37----------
and then this is where they say oh of


---------16:38----------
course we'll do it like we're totally


---------16:40----------
fine with that


---------16:41----------
and so then you'll kind of ask them okay


---------16:43----------
so like let's just be clear so you guys


---------16:45----------
are saying that you're not gonna mention


---------16:47----------
this


---------16:48----------
and if it gets mentioned so this is this


---------16:51----------
is the key part okay


---------16:53----------
so you've got to prep them so here's the


---------16:54----------
other thing okay so like here's a tip


---------16:56----------
for narcissistic family members if you


---------16:58----------
want to deal with like not just


---------16:59----------
narcissism but just generally speaking


---------17:01----------
family members


---------17:02----------
you got to treat them kind of like kids


---------17:04----------
in terms of like giving them warnings


---------17:06----------
right so like when i'm dealing with my


---------17:07----------
kids and it's like time to go in 15


---------17:09----------
minutes


---------17:10----------
if i if it's time to go and i walk over


---------17:12----------
i turn off the television or like i take


---------17:14----------
away the ipad the kids throw a fit


---------17:16----------
they're like ah


---------17:18----------
but if i tell them hey in 15 minutes


---------17:19----------
we're going to turn off the ipad and the


---------17:21----------
kids like yeah okay whatever


---------17:23----------
in 10 minutes we're going to turn off


---------17:24----------
the ipad it's like yeah yeah whatever


---------17:26----------
in five minutes we're going to turn off


---------17:28----------
the ipad they're like yeah whatever


---------17:30----------
and then when i actually take it away


---------17:32----------
they still like throw a little bit of a


---------17:33----------
hissy fit but they sort of get it


---------17:34----------
because they saw it coming you got to


---------17:36----------
give them a chance to see it coming you


---------17:37----------
got to let them see the reaction coming


---------17:39----------
so in terms of setting the limit about


---------17:41----------
don't talk about marriage what you do


---------17:43----------
is you say so just to be clear you guys


---------17:45----------
are agreeing to not talk about this


---------17:47----------
right


---------17:48----------
and then the parents are like yes and so


---------17:50----------
then this is you say okay so if it gets


---------17:52----------
talked about y'all will understand why


---------17:54----------
i'm not coming home for christmas


---------17:57----------
so just let them know there's going to


---------17:59----------
be a consequence to their behavior


---------18:01----------
let them see it don't spring it on them


---------18:03----------
after they screw up oh i'm sorry we


---------18:05----------
didn't know no because then you get back


---------18:06----------
to square one do you all get that like


---------18:08----------
if you spring the punishment


---------18:10----------
on them after they screw up which


---------18:12----------
they're gonna do


---------18:14----------
then it's like they're gonna be mad at


---------18:15----------
you again they're gonna be like oh give


---------18:17----------
us another chance like give us another


---------18:18----------
chance like oh we promise we won't do it


---------18:20----------
this time like we just made a mistake


---------18:22----------
like just not just this time like


---------18:25----------
right so you gotta let them know so


---------18:26----------
you're gonna say okay so just so we're


---------18:28----------
all on the same page


---------18:30----------
i'm gonna come home for the holidays you


---------18:31----------
guys are not gonna mention the marriage


---------18:32----------
stuff and if you do you'll totally


---------18:35----------
understand why i'm not coming home for


---------18:36----------
christmas right so then like we don't


---------18:37----------
need to have this discussion again


---------18:40----------
let them know what's coming down the


---------18:42----------
pipeline that's how you set a boundary


---------18:44----------
right you say like hey here's the


---------18:46----------
boundary


---------18:47----------
i'm gonna play this game with you but if


---------18:48----------
you cross it there are gonna be


---------18:50----------
consequences and you let them know what


---------18:52----------
the boundary and the consequences are


---------18:53----------
ahead of time does that is this is very


---------18:56----------
important how to set boundaries 101


---------18:59----------
right it's not a threat it's not even


---------19:01----------
it's just like this is law


---------19:03----------
right it's not it's a law of physics if


---------19:06----------
this gets talked about don't expect me


---------19:07----------
for christmas


---------19:10----------
and then when it gets talked about which


---------19:12----------
inevitably will don't once again don't


---------19:14----------
attack


---------19:15----------
don't articulate i mean you want to


---------19:17----------
articulate right so you can say hey i


---------19:19----------
thought we agreed not to talk about this


---------19:22----------
and if they like they're like oh yeah


---------19:24----------
we're sorry


---------19:26----------
and then don't say anything else


---------19:28----------
right and then like you can decide


---------19:30----------
afterward because now you've like now


---------19:32----------
that you've like set them up like


---------19:35----------
so now you've got a reason you can say


---------19:36----------
hey i'm just gonna like take a pass on


---------19:38----------
christmas


---------19:40----------
you know just like tell them like you


---------19:42----------
have to tell them there i wouldn't tell


---------19:43----------
them right then i would wait till


---------19:44----------
thanksgiving is over


---------19:46----------
and see if they continue to respect the


---------19:47----------
boundary if they do you can sort of be


---------19:49----------
like hey i know y'all like i appreciate


---------19:52----------
that you guys brought it up and i


---------19:53----------
brought it up with you and then you guys


---------19:54----------
like steered clear of it thank you very


---------19:56----------
much


---------19:57----------
um i know that like y'all care about me


---------20:00----------
and stuff like that so that's totally


---------20:01----------
fine


---------20:02----------
uh you know if you guys if like if we


---------20:04----------
can keep this up that actually made the


---------20:05----------
experience a lot more enjoyable for me


---------20:07----------
i'm happy to come home for christmas if


---------20:09----------
we can keep this up


---------20:11----------
and then if they did if they don't


---------20:13----------
continue to respect your boundary then


---------20:15----------
you could say yeah afterward you can be


---------20:16----------
like hey i sort of had fun but


---------20:19----------
you know i kind of like we discussed


---------20:21----------
something and we weren't going to talk


---------20:22----------
about like marriage and stuff like that


---------20:24----------
you guys kind of like didn't respect


---------20:25----------
that so i'm not going to be coming home


---------20:27----------
for christmas like we discussed


---------20:29----------
just let him know ahead of time


---------20:31----------
and just boom


---------20:34----------
right


---------20:35----------
does that make sense


---------20:38----------
so


---------20:39----------
um so just to kind of summarize a couple


---------20:42----------
of things


---------20:43----------
so the first thing is


---------20:45----------
if you don't want to go home for the


---------20:46----------
holidays


---------20:47----------
ask them to articulate


---------20:50----------
your perspective first ask them what do


---------20:52----------
you think my experience is like that's


---------20:55----------
going to be engaging their empathic


---------20:56----------
circuitry getting them to like think a


---------20:58----------
little bit about it right


---------21:00----------
don't attack them whatever they come up


---------21:01----------
with they may result in denial or like


---------21:03----------
whatever like just tell us whatever


---------21:05----------
they'll like try to like fast forward


---------21:06----------
the conversation at the end they're like


---------21:08----------
i don't know how to play this game


---------21:10----------
let's get to the game just tell me what


---------21:12----------
i need to say and i'll i'll say it and


---------21:14----------
then just come home because i want you


---------21:15----------
home to get my emotional needs met


---------21:17----------
because i'm your parent and i love you


---------21:19----------
right they're not coming from a bad


---------21:20----------
place hopefully let's assume not


---------21:23----------
so ask them to articulate your


---------21:24----------
perspective


---------21:26----------
whatever they do try to hypothesize


---------21:29----------
repeat it back to them especially if


---------21:30----------
they give you denial or like it's not


---------21:32----------
our fault and things like that and so


---------21:34----------
you can kind of like you can sort of


---------21:36----------
make it not really an attack but you're


---------21:37----------
just pointing out to them what they're


---------21:38----------
saying so you're saying oh it's not my


---------21:40----------
fault but i so since it's not your fault


---------21:42----------
because it's driven by love what i'm


---------21:43----------
hearing from you is that i can't really


---------21:45----------
expect that to change at all right


---------21:47----------
because you're never going to stop


---------21:48----------
loving me which i appreciate and this is


---------21:49----------
just how your love is going to manifest


---------21:51----------
so i basically have a choice between


---------21:52----------
like coming home and dealing with this


---------21:54----------
or not coming home and then not dealing


---------21:56----------
with it it seems like the choice that i


---------21:58----------
have to make is like the two are tied


---------22:00----------
together so if i don't want to hear that


---------22:02----------
the only solution i've got is to like


---------22:03----------
not come home for the holidays


---------22:05----------
so lay it out for them whatever they


---------22:07----------
tell you you're going to just jiu jitsu


---------22:09----------
at the aikido up in here okay whatever


---------22:11----------
they throw at you you're just gonna


---------22:13----------
throw right back at them in a


---------22:15----------
non-emotional non-confrontational way


---------22:17----------
hey let's just get on the same page


---------22:19----------
about what are the rules of the game


---------22:21----------
and as you pointed out to them they're


---------22:22----------
gonna panic they're gonna start


---------22:23----------
promising that's when you lay the


---------22:25----------
boundary you figure out what's my


---------22:26----------
boundary


---------22:28----------
if your boundary is not respected you


---------22:30----------
can give them feedback right then and


---------22:31----------
there but that's usually comes across as


---------22:33----------
emotional or you can give them feedback


---------22:36----------
afterward that can be far healthier so


---------22:38----------
once you've calmed down emotionally like


---------22:40----------
the next day be like hey you all asked


---------22:42----------
me a couple questions about marriage i


---------22:44----------
just wanted to understand is that


---------22:45----------
something that you're all going to


---------22:46----------
continue to do because i was under the


---------22:47----------
impression we talked about this and


---------22:50----------
you know you had sort of agreed not to


---------22:53----------
yeah but


---------22:54----------
but we just care so much and we're so


---------22:57----------
you're we're so worried and you're so


---------22:59----------
handsome and they're all these wonderful


---------23:01----------
and we know that but and we know and we


---------23:04----------
love you and but


---------23:06----------
yeah right and so then you're going to


---------23:09----------
articulate back and you can say okay


---------23:11----------
fine


---------23:12----------
i understand that it's going to be hard


---------23:14----------
for you understood


---------23:16----------
and then if you get up and leave if


---------23:17----------
you're like me


---------23:20----------
you broke you made a promise you broke


---------23:22----------
with that promise


---------23:26----------
then what's gonna happen in their mind


---------23:28----------
they're gonna think oh my god he is so


---------23:31----------
he's hurting so much on the inside he


---------23:33----------
needs love we don't have to respect him


---------23:35----------
because he's acting emotionally and like


---------23:37----------
a child you know he's like oh


---------23:40----------
like so they're not going to take you


---------23:41----------
seriously if you act emotionally so you


---------23:43----------
can say okay fine so you ride out the


---------23:45----------
rest of the holidays heaven knows that


---------23:46----------
you've written out so many so far and


---------23:48----------
then after it ends you just circle back


---------23:49----------
and say hey like


---------23:51----------
you know we talked about this i mention


---------23:53----------
it to you again and you all basically


---------23:54----------
said that like


---------23:56----------
because it's so important to you you're


---------23:58----------
gonna bring it up and you're not really


---------24:00----------
interested in like


---------24:01----------
what my perspective is so


---------24:03----------
if i don't come home for christmas now


---------24:05----------
you understand why


---------24:06----------
right so you can leave an if there if


---------24:08----------
you want to you don't have to like


---------24:10----------
punish them then and there you can just


---------24:11----------
say like okay i now understand that


---------24:13----------
anytime i come home like this


---------24:14----------
conversation is gonna be had and if i


---------24:16----------
try to tell y'all to not talk about it i


---------24:19----------
basically am going to get ignored which


---------24:20----------
is fine so then i just have to make the


---------24:22----------
decision about whether i want to like if


---------24:24----------
i really don't want to have the


---------24:25----------
conversation then i just won't come home


---------24:27----------
which is totally cool they're like oh no


---------24:28----------
no no we didn't mean it we promise we'll


---------24:30----------
change you'll be like okay i we had that


---------24:32----------
conversation last time though


---------24:34----------
easy so i'll just let me like stew on it


---------24:36----------
and i'll let you know whether i'm coming


---------24:38----------
home for christmas


---------24:39----------
okay


---------24:40----------
so if the boundary isn't respected you


---------24:42----------
can give feedback either in the moment


---------24:44----------
or later and the main thing is to let


---------24:46----------
them see the consequence coming


---------24:48----------
and like as long as you remain like


---------24:51----------
set in yourself manage your own emotions


---------24:54----------
don't expect too much lay a boundary let


---------24:56----------
them see the consequence coming


---------24:58----------
over time


---------24:59----------
so once


---------25:01----------
one person saying adults will never


---------25:02----------
change i completely disagree


---------25:05----------
so they will change and i've seen it


---------25:07----------
time and time and time again the problem


---------25:09----------
is that we are just not educated in how


---------25:12----------
to get adults to change right we're not


---------25:14----------
like we're just like operating like


---------25:16----------
think about how do you approach family


---------25:18----------
situations


---------25:19----------
like how like where is the wiki on


---------25:22----------
family situations


---------25:24----------
where is the walk through on family


---------25:26----------
situations


---------25:29----------
where is the class on like how to deal


---------25:31----------
with family situations


---------25:34----------
where is the class on like how to manage


---------25:36----------
your emotions


---------25:40----------
right so like


---------25:44----------
so i i don't blame you for believing


---------25:46----------
that adults will never change


---------25:48----------
because let's be honest the majority of


---------25:50----------
times that's true


---------25:52----------
and yet


---------25:53----------
just because you know no human has ever


---------25:56----------
flown doesn't mean that no human will


---------25:58----------
ever fly it just requires the right kind


---------26:01----------
of technology so what we're offering


---------26:03----------
y'all is an interpersonal technology


---------26:06----------
that if you learn how to use properly it


---------26:08----------
is our hope that you will start to


---------26:10----------
change the relationships in your life


---------26:13----------
and it's not your fault you're not


---------26:14----------
stupid or anything and it's kind of not


---------26:16----------
their fault because they weren't taught


---------26:18----------
either do you all get that


---------26:20----------
like they didn't


---------26:21----------
like the reason they can't answer the


---------26:23----------
question what is your understanding of


---------26:24----------
my experience is because their empathic


---------26:26----------
circuits haven't been developed


---------26:30----------
right does that make sense so like we


---------26:31----------
want to have compassion for them they're


---------26:33----------
not i mean we're kind of membing them a


---------26:34----------
little bit but that by the way is to


---------26:36----------
validate your emotions if you guys


---------26:38----------
haven't figured that out


---------26:40----------
right we don't actually think your


---------26:41----------
parents are bad like we're the goal of


---------26:43----------
this is to try to make things work


---------26:45----------
okay


---------26:46----------
as as


---------26:49----------
saying they didn't know better


---------26:50----------
absolutely


---------26:52----------
all right


---------26:54----------
so


---------26:56----------
that's if you don't want to go home for


---------26:57----------
the holidays


---------26:59----------
okay


---------27:01----------
what if they still feel attacked and get


---------27:02----------
defensive we'll get to that in a second


---------27:04----------
all right we'll get to that with the


---------27:06----------
narcissism


---------27:08----------
where do i buy this flying technology


---------27:10----------
it's right here on stream for the low


---------27:12----------
low price of zero dollars and zero cents


---------27:14----------
all it costs is two hours of your time


---------27:18----------
okay


---------27:19----------
so the second thing is how to challenge


---------27:21----------
tradition all right


---------27:24----------
so i'm going to give you all a scenario


---------27:25----------
and we'll sort of see like the


---------27:26----------
narcissism coming out you guys see what


---------27:28----------
i mean now like it's just that like i


---------27:30----------
want to i want to like give you guys


---------27:31----------
like good scenarios so that we can see


---------27:33----------
like the defenses and stuff start to


---------27:34----------
come out


---------27:36----------
okay


---------27:36----------
so


---------27:38----------
how to challenge tradition so this is


---------27:40----------
the tradition that i'm gonna use all


---------27:41----------
right


---------27:42----------
so like i don't know about y'all but in


---------27:44----------
my family generally speaking for the


---------27:45----------
holidays the women will cook and clean


---------27:49----------
which is like quite


---------27:50----------
a endeavor okay so it involves like


---------27:53----------
grocery shopping a day or two before


---------27:57----------
the preparation of cooking and the


---------27:58----------
marinating of things


---------28:00----------
and whatever like the day before


---------28:02----------
and then like you know you start cooking


---------28:04----------
at like


---------28:05----------
like 8 a.m in the morning and it's like


---------28:07----------
a marathon thing because we're gonna


---------28:08----------
like do a wonderful meal


---------28:11----------
and then the men in my family tend to


---------28:12----------
just hang out right so oftentimes there


---------28:15----------
is football involved or cricket or


---------28:17----------
whatever but there's just this very like


---------28:19----------
simple like dynamic of like


---------28:22----------
the women cooking clean and like the men


---------28:24----------
just kind of sit around


---------28:26----------
and and i i don't want to get into


---------28:30----------
i'm not trying to make this about like


---------28:31----------
gender or the patriarchy or like women


---------28:34----------
being oppressed or things like that like


---------28:36----------
it's not my place to kind of pass


---------28:37----------
judgment on that i mean i'm gonna i'm


---------28:39----------
gonna sort of pass judgment but not from


---------28:41----------
like a political way it's just like


---------28:42----------
that's not really like fair


---------28:44----------
so i think that some of this stuff if we


---------28:46----------
kind of think about the origins


---------28:48----------
you know i think this sort of made sense


---------28:50----------
when like gender roles were a little bit


---------28:52----------
more clear right so


---------28:55----------
like maybe 50 60 70 80 years ago 100


---------28:57----------
years ago


---------28:59----------
men had a pretty particular like role


---------29:00----------
which is that they left the house and


---------29:02----------
they like hunted or chopped wood or


---------29:04----------
worked and then women would sort of take


---------29:05----------
care of the home right this is like the


---------29:07----------
traditional like 100 year old sort of


---------29:10----------
gender role divide and even that at that


---------29:12----------
point i don't i don't know if women did


---------29:14----------
more


---------29:15----------
uh you know less work than women i'm


---------29:16----------
sure that someone out there more


---------29:17----------
educated than i am will be able to give


---------29:19----------
me an answer to that but


---------29:21----------
i think at that point it was about a


---------29:22----------
division of labor where like men worked


---------29:24----------
and women


---------29:26----------
manage the household


---------29:28----------
and so i think that even in a sense like


---------29:29----------
that tradition was probably


---------29:31----------
understandable or came from somewhere


---------29:32----------
because it evolved right so it like


---------29:34----------
evolved for a reason and chances are


---------29:36----------
that like the reason that it evolved


---------29:38----------
that way was because of that division of


---------29:40----------
labor so like if you know if if the man


---------29:43----------
was planning like a work event i would


---------29:44----------
imagine that they would do the heavy


---------29:46----------
lifting for that but maybe not


---------29:48----------
i don't want to get this into gender


---------29:49----------
dynamics but i do want to sort of


---------29:51----------
acknowledge that there are traditions


---------29:53----------
which may be unhealthy or unfair to some


---------29:56----------
people this is the one that i'm going to


---------29:57----------
use because it's the one that i


---------29:58----------
understand the best it's the one that i


---------30:00----------
grew up with and it's the one that i


---------30:01----------
think a lot of people can relate to


---------30:04----------
so that sort of used to work because


---------30:06----------
like women didn't used to have jobs


---------30:08----------
right but now like women have jobs so


---------30:10----------
the division of financial labor tends to


---------30:13----------
be like more even than it used to be


---------30:16----------
but our traditions right because their


---------30:18----------
traditions seem to be lagging behind


---------30:21----------
so if you were like in my household you


---------30:23----------
would see what i saw which is that you


---------30:25----------
know my dad was a doctor and he worked


---------30:26----------
more than my mom and my mom was a doctor


---------30:29----------
so they were both practicing physicians


---------30:30----------
my dad probably worked on average five


---------30:32----------
hours more per day than my mom did maybe


---------30:36----------
even more because he would oftentimes


---------30:37----------
like work saturdays as well so he may


---------30:39----------
have worked like 30 hours more per week


---------30:42----------
than my mom even though they were both


---------30:44----------
practicing physicians but what i sort of


---------30:46----------
noticed is that like on balance my mom


---------30:48----------
did more than 30 hours of like housework


---------30:50----------
per week


---------30:52----------
that includes like picking us up and


---------30:53----------
dropping us off and going grocery


---------30:55----------
shopping and like all that kind of stuff


---------30:58----------
so you know if you're in this kind of


---------31:00----------
situation how do you challenge this sort


---------31:03----------
of like dynamic


---------31:04----------
so this is where once again if you


---------31:06----------
criticize it


---------31:08----------
which may be fair so like if you get


---------31:10----------
like emotional about it you criticize it


---------31:12----------
you're like oh the patriarchy and like


---------31:14----------
women are oppressed like you can say


---------31:16----------
that and i think you've got a valid


---------31:18----------
argument but i don't think you're gonna


---------31:20----------
win any points in a family situation


---------31:22----------
like i don't think that people are gonna


---------31:24----------
walk away from that and be like


---------31:26----------
you know oh you're right like this


---------31:28----------
should change i think what's gonna


---------31:30----------
happen if you start like criticizing


---------31:31----------
them is they're gonna feel attacked when


---------31:33----------
they feel attacked they they get


---------31:35----------
defensive and when they get defensive


---------31:37----------
they're gonna call you a [ __ ]


---------31:40----------
right they're gonna that's what's gonna


---------31:41----------
happen


---------31:42----------
so i'm not saying that that's even that


---------31:45----------
is fair i'm not saying that your


---------31:46----------
criticisms aren't legit but what i'm


---------31:49----------
saying is like it's easier to catch more


---------31:51----------
flies than honey than it is with vinegar


---------31:52----------
like that's my style right


---------31:54----------
and that's what happens


---------31:57----------
so if you've got a traditional family


---------31:58----------
structure like that's how you're going


---------31:59----------
to be received and be judged


---------32:01----------
so here's the first thing so if you are


---------32:04----------
a dude and there is an unhealthy


---------32:06----------
tradition


---------32:08----------
you should like do what you think is


---------32:10----------
right so act in accordance to your


---------32:12----------
dharma


---------32:13----------
so like when i so this is something that


---------32:15----------
i do now right which i'm sure that once


---------32:17----------
again i'll give you guys an example but


---------32:19----------
so like i try to help out during


---------32:21----------
holidays because i remember so what


---------32:22----------
would happen in my household is like we


---------32:25----------
would have a big holiday and my brother


---------32:26----------
was older and i was younger and so


---------32:28----------
therefore for some reason i fell into


---------32:31----------
the women's camp and so my brother got


---------32:33----------
to chill but i got to like i had to like


---------32:35----------
cook and clean all day and i was like


---------32:36----------
what the f is this


---------32:38----------
like why like so somehow like


---------32:40----------
subconsciously my mom like put me in the


---------32:42----------
role of a daughter because she didn't


---------32:43----------
have a daughter she needs someone so


---------32:45----------
like i guess it's the younger kid is the


---------32:47----------
daughter


---------32:48----------
so i had to like cook and cleo i was


---------32:49----------
like this is bs like f this right my


---------32:52----------
brother helped out too and stuff like


---------32:53----------
that but


---------32:55----------
you know it just felt really unfair to


---------32:56----------
me so now so if if you're a dude and


---------32:58----------
there's an unhealthy tradition here's


---------33:00----------
how you challenge it so if you're the


---------33:02----------
man in this situation i would go and


---------33:03----------
help out in the kitchen and this is


---------33:05----------
going to create all kinds of problems


---------33:08----------
right so then like what's gonna happen


---------33:10----------
is like you're gonna start helping out


---------33:12----------
and then like the other men in your


---------33:13----------
family are gonna be like oh like stop


---------33:15----------
doing that hahaha that's woman's work


---------33:18----------
lol and we mean that as a joke


---------33:21----------
it's clearly not women's work because we


---------33:23----------
know that gender equality and all that


---------33:25----------
but


---------33:29----------
right so if you start helping out like


---------33:31----------
what's gonna happen like even if you


---------33:32----------
don't say anything here's the thing you


---------33:34----------
don't need to say anything you don't


---------33:35----------
need to be like this is unfair this is a


---------33:38----------
relic of the patriarchy and down with


---------33:41----------
whatever blah


---------33:43----------
then they're going to just write you off


---------33:44----------
as like some crazy political person


---------33:46----------
right instead just let your actions do


---------33:48----------
the talking you're not going to


---------33:49----------
criticize anyone you're not going to say


---------33:51----------
that anything that they're doing is


---------33:52----------
wrong


---------33:53----------
right you just act in accordance with


---------33:55----------
your dharma so you go and you help out


---------33:58----------
you go to the women you say hey what can


---------33:59----------
i do you want me to pick up this you


---------34:01----------
want me to do this you want me to do


---------34:02----------
this you want me to do this at some


---------34:03----------
point someone's going to excite comment


---------34:05----------
on it right and this is when once again


---------34:07----------
you want to articulate you don't want to


---------34:09----------
attack but you're going to attack


---------34:11----------
people are going to feel attacked


---------34:13----------
you're not going to expect much from


---------34:14----------
them you're going to manage your own


---------34:15----------
emotions and if if you're like me this


---------34:17----------
will happen well someone will start


---------34:18----------
making fun of you and they'll be like


---------34:20----------
what do you like are you doing women's


---------34:22----------
work


---------34:23----------
and so my response would be


---------34:25----------
you know thanksgiving is about gratitude


---------34:27----------
and like i really appreciate all the


---------34:29----------
work that they're doing so this is the


---------34:30----------
way that i show my gratitude


---------34:36----------
and then you just walk away and continue


---------34:38----------
helping in the kitchen and then people


---------34:40----------
are going to be like well [ __ ]


---------34:42----------
right


---------34:44----------
like how do they argue against that


---------34:47----------
so this is where like if you guys


---------34:49----------
wanna like don't tell people that


---------34:51----------
they're doing bad things


---------34:54----------
just articulate instead of attack hey


---------34:57----------
all you all [ __ ] should not be


---------34:58----------
sitting on the couch this is unfair


---------35:00----------
don't do that


---------35:03----------
right you just act in accordance with


---------35:04----------
your dharma you articulate why you're


---------35:06----------
doing it


---------35:07----------
and then even if they continue making


---------35:08----------
fun of you like because they they don't


---------35:10----------
know what to like people don't know how


---------35:12----------
to respond to that right like because


---------35:13----------
people don't say [ __ ] like that which is


---------35:15----------
exactly why you guys need to learn how


---------35:17----------
to say it


---------35:20----------
so like you just say like this is the


---------35:21----------
way that i show my gratitude


---------35:24----------
you're not saying hey


---------35:26----------
and they're like what you don't so this


---------35:28----------
is what's gonna happen like they're


---------35:29----------
gonna feel attacked right so they're


---------35:30----------
gonna come at you


---------35:31----------
and they're gonna be like look what you


---------35:33----------
don't think we're grateful and you're


---------35:34----------
like hey i never said that


---------35:36----------
i'm sure you show your gratitude in


---------35:38----------
whatever way is appropriate to you this


---------35:40----------
is just how i show mine


---------35:42----------
i'm not judging you you do you bro


---------35:46----------
right so like roll with that resistance


---------35:48----------
don't attack don't articulate say i


---------35:50----------
never said that


---------35:52----------
now if you want to go on the attack you


---------35:54----------
can be like how do you show your


---------35:55----------
gratitude [ __ ]


---------35:59----------
you ungrateful oh i raised you and


---------36:00----------
you're like cool i'm grateful for that


---------36:03----------
so they attack you and they're like oh i


---------36:04----------
raised you like i can't believe you're


---------36:06----------
so ungrateful and you're like bro that's


---------36:08----------
why i'm not sitting on on the couch and


---------36:10----------
[ __ ] watching football and i'm


---------36:11----------
cooking you a pie it's my way of showing


---------36:13----------
gratitude what are you getting mad at me


---------36:14----------
for


---------36:16----------
right


---------36:17----------
it's like you stay aligned with your


---------36:19----------
dharma


---------36:21----------
and you just like throw it back at them


---------36:23----------
and you're like if you think i'm like


---------36:24----------
why the [ __ ] am i making a pie for you


---------36:26----------
it's because i'm grateful


---------36:28----------
and then like they can't they'll


---------36:31----------
they


---------36:31----------
it's you're gonna you're gonna ko it's a


---------36:33----------
ko that's like the advantage of living


---------36:35----------
in accordance with your dharma


---------36:39----------
you guys get that


---------36:42----------
okay


---------36:43----------
excellent question what to do if you


---------36:45----------
were a woman moving on


---------36:47----------
so if you're a woman


---------36:49----------
and you're unhappy and you think this is


---------36:50----------
unfair


---------36:53----------
get people to articulate


---------36:55----------
right let them lay the trap themselves


---------36:57----------
so you talk to ideally another woman or


---------36:59----------
man like so you talk to your parents


---------37:01----------
let's say let's say you're the daughter


---------37:02----------
of the family so you talk to your


---------37:03----------
parents and say hey i'm thinking about


---------37:05----------
coming home for thanksgiving


---------37:07----------
help me understand what i should expect


---------37:09----------
get him to say it


---------37:11----------
what's gonna happen


---------37:13----------
like what should i expect


---------37:16----------
we're trying to plan


---------37:18----------
and then your mom will be like well


---------37:19----------
we're gonna start cooking like on


---------37:20----------
wednesday morning and we'll serve dinner


---------37:22----------
on thursday afternoon


---------37:24----------
and so then


---------37:27----------
so like just like so i'm coming with my


---------37:29----------
husband let's say


---------37:30----------
and so so what is he going to be doing


---------37:32----------
for


---------37:33----------
24 or 36 hours just


---------37:36----------
get them to articulate it they're gonna


---------37:37----------
be like he's gonna be hanging out with


---------37:39----------
with your dad


---------37:41----------
okay like what am i gonna be doing


---------37:42----------
you're gonna be in the kitchen [ __ ]


---------37:43----------
cooking and cleaning


---------37:45----------
and so then you can articulate it to


---------37:46----------
them so you can say okay so just so i


---------37:48----------
understand this mom and i are going to


---------37:49----------
be cooking and cleaning for about 36


---------37:52----------
hours


---------37:53----------
and then


---------37:56----------
my husband is going to be like just kind


---------37:57----------
of hanging out


---------37:58----------
and they're going to be relaxing


---------38:00----------
and so then this is where like your


---------38:02----------
parents are gonna be like


---------38:05----------
this is where the defense has come out


---------38:06----------
you all ready


---------38:07----------
it's tradition


---------38:09----------
oh beta it's tradition


---------38:12----------
it's okay


---------38:13----------
it's tradition


---------38:15----------
now sometimes like if you if you end up


---------38:17----------
doing well like


---------38:19----------
like


---------38:20----------
i've seen this happen before where like


---------38:21----------
the dad is sort of like oh wow like


---------38:23----------
that's actually insane so if you just


---------38:24----------
like talk to people without sort of


---------38:27----------
attacking them sometimes they'll realize


---------38:29----------
they'll be like yeah that's kind of


---------38:30----------
[ __ ] and so you know maybe like i've


---------38:33----------
seen this before where dads will be like


---------38:35----------
we'll just order out because it's not


---------38:36----------
really fair for you all to be cooking


---------38:37----------
and cleaning and then what'll happen


---------38:39----------
we'll get to this i don't know if we can


---------38:40----------
get to this today but then there's an


---------38:41----------
enabler


---------38:43----------
this is the flip side to the


---------38:44----------
narcissistic family member and this is


---------38:45----------
why we got to go through the scenarios


---------38:47----------
first there's the enabler where dad's


---------38:49----------
like we can just order out and who's


---------38:51----------
gonna screw you in that situation


---------38:53----------
huh


---------38:55----------
who's gonna screw you


---------38:57----------
you're making so much progress things


---------38:59----------
are even


---------39:01----------
mom


---------39:02----------
mom is gonna screw you oh no honey


---------39:05----------
we don't have to do that


---------39:07----------
it's our way of showing


---------39:09----------
love


---------39:10----------
right because then there's all kinds of


---------39:12----------
things that happens in mom's mind and


---------39:14----------
this isn't her fault because she's been


---------39:16----------
culturally conditioned


---------39:18----------
that on thanksgiving you don't order out


---------39:20----------
like what the


---------39:22----------
right


---------39:23----------
like that's the antithesis of


---------39:25----------
thanksgiving thanksgiving is about


---------39:27----------
showing your gratitude and love by


---------39:29----------
laboring away in the kitchen like what


---------39:31----------
kind of rejects grandma or mom


---------39:35----------
like orders pizza for thanksgiving like


---------39:36----------
that's a failure like we've been


---------39:38----------
societally conditioned to think that


---------39:40----------
women will be failures if they don't


---------39:42----------
cook for thanksgiving you all get that


---------39:45----------
and so mom's gonna sandbag you


---------39:47----------
she's gonna torpedo


---------39:49----------
because she's gonna feel bad so this is


---------39:51----------
where if you really wanna this is really


---------39:53----------
getting to the next level but you to


---------39:55----------
like deal with that guilt right so mom's


---------39:57----------
feeling guilty she's feeling like she's


---------39:58----------
letting you down


---------40:01----------
and so you got to be like okay so mom if


---------40:03----------
you really want to do that i know it's


---------40:04----------
kind of weird but


---------40:05----------
this is where you've got a couple of


---------40:06----------
different plays but one is you can just


---------40:08----------
a seed to that and say like you know


---------40:12----------
okay if you really want to cook like we


---------40:13----------
can do that if that's really important


---------40:15----------
to you and that's where like once again


---------40:17----------
you're acting in accordance with your


---------40:18----------
dharma because you're you're sort of


---------40:20----------
like you're taking one for the team


---------40:21----------
right you're doing it to help your mom


---------40:23----------
feel better but you know that dad's on


---------40:24----------
your side


---------40:25----------
and so maybe then you have a second


---------40:26----------
conversation with your husband or your


---------40:28----------
dad and say like hey like you know mom


---------40:30----------
is like the one who's like sacrificing


---------40:32----------
all this time for our benefit so like we


---------40:33----------
should all help out or let's do


---------40:35----------
something nice for her so that's another


---------40:37----------
thing that you can do like you can like


---------40:38----------
go out of your way to really make them


---------40:40----------
feel appreciated


---------40:41----------
right so you can do things that lets mom


---------40:43----------
sort of be a good woman in her mind


---------40:45----------
because that's the way that she's been


---------40:46----------
conditioned or even it's not


---------40:47----------
conditioning that's sort of like


---------40:48----------
actually kind of condescending she may


---------40:51----------
actually value that right like that may


---------40:53----------
be like what she views as her thought


---------40:55----------
about this is something that i want to


---------40:56----------
do for my family


---------40:58----------
so it's actually quite condescending for


---------41:00----------
us to assume that she's conditioned oh


---------41:02----------
she can't think by on her own she is a


---------41:04----------
woman she has been conditioned by the


---------41:06----------
patriarchal society like that's actually


---------41:08----------
really [ __ ] condescending now that i


---------41:10----------
think about it


---------41:11----------
right so maybe that's just how she does


---------41:13----------
her dharma


---------41:15----------
and so it's just about sort of having


---------41:17----------
that conversation


---------41:19----------
and you know like


---------41:21----------
you you could sort of see where like


---------41:23----------
where that conversation goes so maybe it


---------41:25----------
is ordering out


---------41:27----------
maybe it is like you know having a


---------41:28----------
conversation then with your husband or


---------41:30----------
dad about hey we're gonna chip in and


---------41:32----------
we're all going to help or


---------41:35----------
we're going to do something super


---------41:36----------
awesome for mom


---------41:37----------
like we're going to do something for mom


---------41:39----------
that like repays the karmic debt that


---------41:42----------
she is doing for us


---------41:44----------
okay


---------41:46----------
and if you're a spouse so this is the


---------41:47----------
third scenario we're going to talk about


---------41:48----------
this one is arguably the most


---------41:50----------
challenging


---------41:52----------
because you have a lot of power in the


---------41:53----------
other two the third the third one this


---------41:55----------
is the hardest


---------41:56----------
is if your in-laws have an unhealthy


---------41:58----------
tradition and you're the spouse of


---------42:00----------
someone else so this is like if you're


---------42:03----------
the wife


---------42:04----------
your husband's family has all these like


---------42:07----------
traditions that you think are unhealthy


---------42:09----------
or unfair


---------42:10----------
and you are like


---------42:12----------
you know it's like 1v5 kind of situation


---------42:15----------
because like your your spouse has grown


---------42:17----------
up with these traditions so they think


---------42:19----------
it's normal


---------42:20----------
like the in-laws are doing it like you


---------42:21----------
have to maintain some kind of like you


---------42:23----------
know relationship with your in-laws so


---------42:25----------
you don't want to be like one of these


---------42:26----------
like spouses who's like a [ __ ] to deal


---------42:27----------
with you know


---------42:29----------
um and i don't mean that from a gender


---------42:30----------
standpoint i mean just like just a


---------42:32----------
general word


---------42:34----------
and so like that's where you have to


---------42:35----------
have a conversation with your your


---------42:37----------
spouse about hey like what do you think


---------42:38----------
about these traditions right get them to


---------42:40----------
articulate like what am i what are you


---------42:42----------
signing me up for when we go to your


---------42:44----------
parents house for thanksgiving like what


---------42:46----------
are you signing me up for and what are


---------42:48----------
you signing yourself up for also you can


---------42:50----------
attack a little bit when it comes to


---------42:52----------
your spouse because they're your spouse


---------42:53----------
and it's like you know


---------42:55----------
no holds and or holes bart you know so


---------42:57----------
it's like it's your spouse


---------42:59----------
so go for it


---------43:01----------
so just have a have a conversation


---------43:04----------
and


---------43:05----------
you know like like just kind of get


---------43:07----------
people to articulate it


---------43:09----------
so


---------43:12----------
um that that's kind of okay i'm i'm


---------43:14----------
assuming that


---------43:16----------
that


---------43:18----------
you can uh you can have a conversation


---------43:20----------
with your spouse


---------43:22----------
okay so questions about challenging


---------43:24----------
traditions


---------43:30----------
okay


---------43:32----------
let's move on narcissistic family


---------43:33----------
members all right


---------43:38----------
okay so i use the term narcissistic but


---------43:42----------
that's not really


---------43:47----------
that's not really fair but


---------43:49----------
so


---------43:50----------
what we're going to talk about now is


---------43:52----------
like


---------43:53----------
family members who are like emotionally


---------43:55----------
manipulative


---------43:57----------
and we're gonna lay out their move set


---------43:59----------
okay so like we're gonna like put


---------44:00----------
ourselves like imagine you're like


---------44:02----------
trying to find a boss in dark souls


---------44:04----------
and like you have to understand what


---------44:05----------
their move set is in order to like see


---------44:07----------
their different attacks and like how to


---------44:08----------
dodge it


---------44:09----------
so we're almost gonna like give you a a


---------44:12----------
like a a boss fighting guide for like


---------44:14----------
the narcissistic family member so


---------44:16----------
they've got a couple of good moves so


---------44:17----------
you got to be careful okay


---------44:19----------
the first is that they're emotionally


---------44:21----------
manipulative


---------44:22----------
so the way that they get their needs met


---------44:26----------
is through


---------44:27----------
provoking particular reactions out of


---------44:29----------
other people


---------44:31----------
so that's move number one


---------44:33----------
move number two is they make you


---------44:35----------
responsible for their behavior they do


---------44:38----------
this weird like


---------44:39----------
mind-meld


---------44:42----------
psychic thing where they make you


---------44:43----------
responsible for their behavior


---------44:45----------
so a good example of this is like let's


---------44:47----------
say that


---------44:50----------
um let's say that you make a dish for


---------44:52----------
thanksgiving and your cousin makes a


---------44:54----------
dish for thanksgiving


---------44:56----------
and you make a dish that's better than


---------44:58----------
your cousin's and your cousin notices


---------45:00----------
that and they feel hurt


---------45:03----------
and so then your cousin is like okay


---------45:04----------
fine if no one wants to eat my dish


---------45:07----------
i i'll just eat it all


---------45:09----------
because i don't want it to go to waste


---------45:11----------
and they're like sacrificing themselves


---------45:13----------
by eating this crappy dish that they've


---------45:14----------
made and they like


---------45:16----------
they they like go and they buy


---------45:18----------
across from the grocery store and then


---------45:20----------
they start lugging it around okay


---------45:22----------
you guys get what i'm saying let there


---------45:23----------
that like they make you responsible for


---------45:25----------
their actions and then everyone feels


---------45:27----------
bad


---------45:28----------
right so they like


---------45:29----------
and then like suddenly


---------45:30----------
their choice


---------45:32----------
to eat crappy food


---------45:34----------
is like somehow your fault it's like no


---------45:36----------
they don't have to eat their crappy food


---------45:38----------
they can eat the good food that you made


---------45:40----------
but they're somehow like making you


---------45:42----------
responsible for their stupid choice


---------45:44----------
right and so that it's it's martyrdom so


---------45:46----------
they like look they like go find this


---------45:48----------
cross somewhere and they start lugging


---------45:50----------
it around


---------45:51----------
so other examples of this are people who


---------45:53----------
like will go on like hunger strikes


---------45:54----------
right


---------45:55----------
so you see this a lot like this was like


---------45:57----------
acting out kind of behaviors where you


---------46:00----------
know like if you say something like if


---------46:02----------
you point out let's say let's use our


---------46:03----------
earlier example of unhealthy traditions


---------46:05----------
that you challenge


---------46:07----------
right and then like your dad gets


---------46:09----------
offended because you point out that he


---------46:10----------
doesn't do anything whereas your mom


---------46:12----------
works a lot and then he gets hurt


---------46:14----------
so then what he does is like you know


---------46:16----------
what


---------46:18----------
if you don't feel like i'm like doing it


---------46:20----------
i don't have to eat any of the food i'll


---------46:21----------
just get mcdonald's


---------46:23----------
you guys can cook whatever and i won't


---------46:25----------
touch it because i'm not helping making


---------46:26----------
it right so you don't want me to eat it


---------46:28----------
right because you think that's unfair


---------46:29----------
and i'm taking advantage of your mother


---------46:31----------
i'm just going to order takeout


---------46:35----------
then you guys can have this luxurious


---------46:37----------
meal and i'll make myself a sandwich


---------46:39----------
i'll eat a bowl of cereal


---------46:42----------
right you guys know what i mean so they


---------46:44----------
like they somehow like they they like


---------46:45----------
make you responsible


---------46:47----------
for


---------46:48----------
their stupid behavior


---------46:51----------
so in the most extreme situations


---------46:52----------
usually this doesn't happen at


---------46:54----------
thanksgiving but another example of this


---------46:56----------
is if you don't break if you break up


---------46:58----------
with me if you leave me i'mma kill


---------47:00----------
myself


---------47:02----------
and it's gonna be your fault


---------47:05----------
i'm gonna commit suicide if you ever


---------47:07----------
leave me


---------47:09----------
right so it's like you making like it's


---------47:11----------
very emotionally manipulative


---------47:14----------
so it's holding you responsible for


---------47:16----------
their behavior now why does this work so


---------47:18----------
much in family situations


---------47:21----------
it's because in family situations


---------47:22----------
there's going to be one weak link


---------47:24----------
okay so in the in an individual


---------47:26----------
relationship like let's say you're in a


---------47:28----------
controlling relationship where someone


---------47:30----------
is holding you emotionally hostage


---------47:32----------
and they say if you break up with me


---------47:34----------
i'm going to kill myself


---------47:36----------
all you really have to do i'm not saying


---------47:38----------
that that situation is easy but all you


---------47:40----------
really have to do is like you have to


---------47:42----------
make the decision to hold the boundary


---------47:43----------
you just have to break up with them and


---------47:45----------
then you're out right you just have to


---------47:47----------
get one person to hold the line it's 1v1


---------47:50----------
the problem with families is that you


---------47:52----------
have to get a bunch of people to hold


---------47:54----------
the line


---------47:55----------
so if like if your dad is like oh i'm


---------47:58----------
just gonna eat


---------48:00----------
a sandwich that's fine i won't touch the


---------48:02----------
turkey i won't touch the pie i won't


---------48:04----------
touch the stuffing i won't touch the


---------48:06----------
salad


---------48:07----------
then what's gonna happen is if you're


---------48:08----------
okay with that you're like okay so like


---------48:10----------
i made it it's there for you to eat so


---------48:12----------
that's the right move right so we'll get


---------48:13----------
to that in a second you say like it's


---------48:14----------
right here i made enough for you if you


---------48:16----------
don't want it we can throw it away at


---------48:18----------
the end of the night it's your choice


---------48:19----------
right just give it right back to them


---------48:20----------
like be like okay like look dad whatever


---------48:23----------
you want to do if you feel more


---------48:24----------
comfortable eating like a bowl of cereal


---------48:26----------
when we've made this food that's totally


---------48:28----------
fine we can pack it up for leftovers


---------48:29----------
donate donate to the homeless or we can


---------48:31----------
throw it away like whatever you prefer


---------48:34----------
right so you like empower them so this


---------48:37----------
is the the counter move to them making


---------48:39----------
you responsible for their behavior


---------48:41----------
you push it back you say no no i'm not


---------48:43----------
responsible for your behavior you're


---------48:45----------
responsible for your behavior you push


---------48:46----------
that responsibility back over there


---------48:48----------
say whatever you want dad whatever makes


---------48:50----------
you happy if that makes you more


---------48:52----------
comfortable remember do your dharma


---------48:54----------
well you're like dad i'm here to make


---------48:55----------
you happy so i made this for you because


---------48:57----------
you know


---------48:59----------
it's available but if you don't feel


---------49:00----------
comfortable eating it or you feel it's


---------49:02----------
unfair like i'm okay with that too i'll


---------49:03----------
make sure it doesn't go to waste


---------49:06----------
and then what is he supposed to say like


---------49:08----------
man


---------49:11----------
but that's hard to do as one person


---------49:13----------
because someone there is gonna do what


---------49:15----------
chat


---------49:17----------
you say that and then what does mom say


---------49:20----------
what does brother say


---------49:23----------
what do they say huh


---------49:29----------
yeah don't do oh don't do that no no no


---------49:32----------
no honey like no please eat the food


---------49:34----------
please eat the food please please we


---------49:37----------
made it with so much love please


---------49:39----------
oh


---------49:40----------
i know that you're acting like a little


---------49:42----------
[ __ ] but if i'm extra nice to you and i


---------49:45----------
i turn into a doormat would that make


---------49:47----------
you feel better


---------49:49----------
does your ego need some stroking do you


---------49:51----------
need do you need us to know how much we


---------49:53----------
love you and how much we care about you


---------49:56----------
did little baby have a boo-boo for his


---------49:58----------
ego or not poor with the baby don't eat


---------50:01----------
the sandwich with the baby


---------50:03----------
oh


---------50:04----------
not for the baby i love you so much with


---------50:06----------
the baby


---------50:08----------
please eat the food


---------50:09----------
please don't make me don't hurt my mom


---------50:14----------
right that's what happens


---------50:16----------
no boundary setting one person caves


---------50:19----------
there's a problem with families one


---------50:22----------
person's gonna cave


---------50:24----------
and this is why the narcissistic person


---------50:27----------
gets to where they are


---------50:29----------
because this behavior gets tolerated


---------50:32----------
over time


---------50:33----------
right because like someone is going to


---------50:35----------
cave


---------50:36----------
because then what they'll start to do if


---------50:37----------
you're not careful is they'll start to


---------50:38----------
escalate


---------50:42----------
you know like they're like okay i'ma eat


---------50:44----------
cereal and then y'all are like


---------50:46----------
okay bro you do you


---------50:49----------
and they're like hey that didn't work


---------50:52----------
so then they're like i'm not hungry i'm


---------50:54----------
not gonna eat at all


---------50:56----------
and they're like


---------50:57----------
and then like oh my god so what they do


---------50:58----------
is they like they like they're trying to


---------51:00----------
break the line right and they're gonna


---------51:01----------
start escalating


---------51:03----------
and they start to get really upset


---------51:05----------
and then if no one's like oh no no no


---------51:07----------
please eat please eat please eat


---------51:10----------
if no one does that then they're like


---------51:12----------
they're not gonna say screw you because


---------51:13----------
they know they're in the wrong that's


---------51:15----------
what's so hard about this is like this


---------51:17----------
is a grave that they've dug for


---------51:18----------
themselves and they're jumping into it


---------51:20----------
and they're like whining when no one is


---------51:21----------
letting them like helping them out


---------51:23----------
even though like they can climb out on


---------51:25----------
their own it's like a one-foot grave in


---------51:27----------
their state like you just stand up and


---------51:28----------
step out it's like one step but they're


---------51:30----------
like no


---------51:32----------
right


---------51:33----------
and so they can try to escalate and you


---------51:35----------
have to be careful because generally


---------51:37----------
speaking like the family will crack at


---------51:38----------
some point


---------51:39----------
and so this is also where you see the


---------51:41----------
enablers


---------51:43----------
mantra


---------51:44----------
okay so if you want to understand who is


---------51:47----------
enabling within your family it is this


---------51:49----------
phrase


---------51:50----------
that's just how they are


---------51:54----------
that's just how they are


---------51:56----------
you know uncle billy


---------51:59----------
he just likes fondling little boys


---------52:00----------
that's just how he is


---------52:03----------
you know boys will be boys


---------52:05----------
[Laughter]


---------52:09----------
that's just little that that's just how


---------52:11----------
they are


---------52:13----------
so that is the the response of an


---------52:15----------
enabler


---------52:17----------
right


---------52:19----------
seriously that's just how you know how


---------52:21----------
dad is


---------52:23----------
you know he's not gonna eat unless we do


---------52:25----------
this


---------52:26----------
and it's like think about that statement


---------52:28----------
for a second


---------52:30----------
you are now responsible


---------52:32----------
for their eating like how the hell does


---------52:35----------
that work


---------52:36----------
like unless you do particular things


---------52:39----------
like your dad isn't gonna eat


---------52:41----------
like what the hell


---------52:44----------
you guys get that that's absurd but like


---------52:46----------
when you have an emotionally


---------52:48----------
manipulative person in the family


---------52:50----------
that's what they do


---------52:52----------
they like train other people to be


---------52:54----------
responsible for their crappy behavior


---------52:58----------
right and so then it's like it's sort of


---------53:00----------
like well if i'm not going to eat it's


---------53:01----------
your fault


---------53:04----------
if you were nicer to me if you hadn't


---------53:06----------
brought up all this stuff and made me


---------53:08----------
feel bad


---------53:09----------
then you wouldn't have to deal with this


---------53:11----------
but now you have to deal with this so


---------53:13----------
what are you gonna do about it


---------53:14----------
yeah yeah and i'm gonna escalate if you


---------53:17----------
don't like make my emotional needs met


---------53:19----------
like


---------53:20----------
i'm gonna i'm gonna hurt you because you


---------53:22----------
hurt me


---------53:24----------
so this is the other thing that they do


---------53:25----------
so this is the like now like we've done


---------53:27----------
a couple of move sets how to counter


---------53:29----------
them so now we have to understand like


---------53:31----------
generally speaking what's going on with


---------53:32----------
this boss


---------53:33----------
so what's going on is that they have


---------53:35----------
emotional needs that need to be met


---------53:38----------
and unfortunately through conditioning


---------53:40----------
or upbringing or whatever


---------53:42----------
they have learned this is the way i get


---------53:44----------
my emotional needs met


---------53:47----------
okay


---------53:48----------
so they feel like so now now this is


---------53:50----------
where like we have to tie in the other


---------53:52----------
two examples if something happens in the


---------53:54----------
holidays that makes them feel hurt


---------53:57----------
they're going to engage in behaviors


---------54:00----------
that cause other people to shower them


---------54:02----------
with love


---------54:04----------
do you guys get that so like if i feel


---------54:07----------
hurt i can't process that on my own so


---------54:10----------
i'm gonna escalate and people are gonna


---------54:12----------
be like oh poor baby


---------54:15----------
oh little baby


---------54:18----------
oh i'm so sorry and then i feel that


---------54:20----------
love so this is why these people are so


---------54:22----------
freaking frustrating to deal with


---------54:25----------
because they artificially create


---------54:27----------
situations


---------54:29----------
that cause people to react and give them


---------54:32----------
the


---------54:33----------
emotional support that they need for an


---------54:36----------
unrelated problem


---------54:39----------
so they can't say


---------54:41----------
hey


---------54:42----------
i felt


---------54:45----------
shame ashamed when my son started


---------54:47----------
helping out in the kitchen


---------54:49----------
and like it made me realize oh man like


---------54:52----------
i've actually been kind of a [ __ ]


---------54:54----------
dad for like 10 years because i never


---------54:56----------
help out at thanksgiving there's a lot


---------54:58----------
of shame that comes up and comes with


---------54:59----------
that and that's really hard for me to


---------55:01----------
process


---------55:02----------
because now i feel bad about myself


---------55:05----------
the healthy thing to do


---------55:07----------
is to like go to people and say like hey


---------55:09----------
i feel like kind of ashamed that i


---------55:10----------
haven't helped out right because if you


---------55:12----------
say that


---------55:13----------
like i never realized that like i should


---------55:15----------
be helping out and like now i kind of


---------55:16----------
feel like a dumb ass if you go to your


---------55:18----------
family and you say that like what is


---------55:19----------
your family going to do they're going to


---------55:20----------
be like no it's totally fine


---------55:23----------
and then like they'll like one or two


---------55:24----------
things will happen so you got to watch


---------55:25----------
out because there's an enabler move and


---------55:27----------
then there's like a disabled move the


---------55:29----------
enabler move is don't worry about it


---------55:30----------
honey it's okay you don't have to feel


---------55:32----------
that way go sit down on the couch that's


---------55:33----------
the enabler move


---------55:35----------
the disabler move is cool


---------55:37----------
let can you help us out


---------55:39----------
because then it's like you don't have to


---------55:40----------
feel that way anymore and you fix the


---------55:42----------
behaviors you got to be very careful


---------55:44----------
because that's sort of like that's sort


---------55:46----------
of like the the end of the boss fight


---------55:47----------
where you have to like hit one button


---------55:48----------
and if you if you hit the button right


---------55:50----------
the boss is defeated but if you miss


---------55:52----------
that window they get like 30 of their


---------55:54----------
health back and they're like back to


---------55:55----------
square one


---------55:56----------
you got to watch out right so that's


---------55:58----------
that that's in the wiki at the bottom


---------55:59----------
it's like the final phase of the boss


---------56:01----------
fight you have to do this mechanic which


---------56:02----------
if you don't know about it's gonna wipe


---------56:04----------
your raid


---------56:05----------
okay


---------56:08----------
so you gotta gotta be careful about that


---------56:10----------
but that's what you should do you should


---------56:11----------
just like articulate your feelings about


---------56:13----------
this problem but like some people who


---------56:16----------
are emotionally manipulative and it's


---------56:17----------
not their fault really


---------56:18----------
because the reason they learned to do


---------56:20----------
this is because people did this [ __ ]


---------56:21----------
with them


---------56:22----------
right like your grandparents are like


---------56:24----------
very manipulative and that's how they


---------56:25----------
learned it that's how they learned how


---------56:27----------
to get their emotional needs met


---------56:29----------
and so this is where the the you know


---------56:31----------
picking up your cross comes from because


---------56:33----------
if they feel hurt


---------56:34----------
and they want to feel loved they'll


---------56:36----------
create these other artificial situations


---------56:38----------
which drive people insane


---------56:40----------
like it drives the family like


---------56:41----------
absolutely insane because everyone knows


---------56:43----------
subconsciously that this has nothing to


---------56:45----------
do with like you know the parent like oh


---------56:48----------
like you didn't get your tires rotated i


---------56:50----------
asked you to get your tires rotated


---------56:52----------
i can't believe you didn't get your


---------56:54----------
tires rotated it's so disrespectful


---------56:56----------
don't you understand that your mom and i


---------56:58----------
could die in that car if you didn't get


---------57:00----------
your tires rotated they just like unload


---------57:03----------
on the sun because the sun is like


---------57:05----------
helping out in the kitchen it's like


---------57:06----------
what the hell where's this coming from


---------57:09----------
and so it's very confusing for people


---------57:11----------
but like once a narcissistic person


---------57:14----------
feels hurt they're gonna do one or two


---------57:16----------
things they're gonna lash out at you


---------57:18----------
or they're gonna guilt you into loving


---------57:21----------
them


---------57:23----------
you guys got that does that make sense


---------57:25----------
so that's the narcissistic person


---------57:29----------
so just to kind of summarize


---------57:31----------
they're emotionally manipulative


---------57:33----------
they like to play the martyr


---------57:35----------
they make you responsible for their bad


---------57:37----------
behavior


---------57:39----------
and the reason that they do so well in


---------57:41----------
families is because it's not just one


---------57:43----------
person that they have to manipulate they


---------57:45----------
just have to find one [ __ ] in the armor


---------57:48----------
right because here's the other thing


---------57:50----------
like you guys want to know like how good


---------57:51----------
this is like how good they are at this


---------57:53----------
so let's say let's go back to the hunger


---------57:55----------
strike right oh like if you don't if i


---------57:57----------
didn't help out in the kitchen i won't


---------57:58----------
eat the food


---------58:00----------
and then there's like i'm just i'll make


---------58:02----------
myself a sandwich and then everyone's


---------58:04----------
sitting at the table they're sitting


---------58:05----------
there defiant


---------58:06----------
and completely neutral


---------58:08----------
not participating in the conversation


---------58:11----------
with their bologna sandwich and everyone


---------58:13----------
else is eating like turkey and pie and


---------58:15----------
stuff like that people like hey do you


---------58:16----------
want some pie and they're like no


---------58:20----------
i didn't help make it so i don't get to


---------58:21----------
eat it right they even give you some of


---------58:23----------
that attitude


---------58:24----------
no


---------58:25----------
no i don't deserve to eat that i didn't


---------58:27----------
help make it


---------58:29----------
and then what happens is one person


---------58:31----------
cracks they don't do it right there


---------58:32----------
publicly


---------58:34----------
but after dinner everyone goes to


---------58:36----------
whatever and then mom shows up and


---------58:38----------
they're like honey please make this pie


---------58:39----------
i i ate it with love and then the parent


---------58:42----------
eats it right he eats the pie and then


---------58:44----------
it's dad and mom


---------58:46----------
in the kitchen eating pie by themselves


---------58:48----------
whereas everyone else is laughing and


---------58:50----------
having fun out there


---------58:52----------
and that's when you're screwed the worst


---------58:56----------
because then one person is there and


---------58:58----------
then like the parent is like oh at least


---------59:00----------
one person understands me at least one


---------59:02----------
person cares everyone else is so callous


---------59:07----------
everyone else is so


---------59:09----------
oh my god they're so callous i can't


---------59:11----------
believe at least i've got one person in


---------59:13----------
this family who cares about me and how


---------59:15----------
did this whole thing [ __ ] start it


---------59:17----------
started because other people were


---------59:18----------
helping in the kitchen and you weren't


---------59:20----------
and somehow you end up feeling like the


---------59:22----------
rest of the family is callous


---------59:24----------
and then what happens is the rest of the


---------59:25----------
family realizes mom snuck down a piece


---------59:28----------
of pie and then everyone in the living


---------59:29----------
room feels like [ __ ]


---------59:30----------
they're like you know at the end of the


---------59:32----------
day like how petty am i being that like


---------59:34----------
i couldn't just encourage the dude to


---------59:36----------
eat a piece of pie like how heartless am


---------59:37----------
i


---------59:38----------
that like


---------59:39----------
dad is just dad


---------59:41----------
and like i should have just gotten him


---------59:43----------
to eat a piece of pie


---------59:45----------
right you guys get that like that that


---------59:47----------
final thing is like that's when you get


---------59:49----------
ko'd


---------59:50----------
wiped in back to the bonfire boys and


---------59:51----------
girls


---------59:53----------
time to time to respawn


---------59:55----------
because it's like i can't believe


---------59:56----------
they're so callous and then everyone out


---------59:58----------
there feels like an [ __ ]


---------59:59----------
because one person has shown compassion


---------60:02----------
right and then everyone else is like


---------60:03----------
well [ __ ] we should have shown


---------60:05----------
compassion too


---------60:07----------
and then next thanksgiving what happens


---------60:11----------
next thanksgiving the boss is stronger


---------60:14----------
and your equipment is busted because you


---------60:17----------
lost that move like you know


---------60:19----------
it's like it carries over


---------60:22----------
and so like then no one throws down with


---------60:24----------
dad after that


---------60:26----------
right


---------60:27----------
it's not


---------60:28----------
oh god it's gonna happen again and then


---------60:30----------
it happens again and again and that's


---------60:32----------
when you end up with that's just how he


---------60:36----------
is


---------60:37----------
you know your dad that's just how he is


---------60:40----------
how do you guys think people get that


---------60:42----------
impression of a person because it


---------60:43----------
happens over and over and over again


---------60:53----------
so just to summarize if you're dealing


---------60:54----------
with the narcissistic parent


---------60:57----------
or family member recognize that at the


---------60:59----------
core of it they want to be loved and if


---------61:02----------
you do anything that is perceived as an


---------61:04----------
attack or they feel hurt they will they


---------61:06----------
will activate right it's like one of


---------61:08----------
these bosses that's asleep


---------61:10----------
and how do you start the boss fight you


---------61:12----------
walk over and you you like charge slash


---------61:15----------
and credit in the face and then it like


---------61:17----------
wakes up and it's like ah


---------61:19----------
and then once it activates by being like


---------61:21----------
attacked in some way and it's not even


---------61:24----------
that you're attacking it it's just like


---------61:25----------
hey this is my way of showing gratitude


---------61:28----------
i'm gonna help out in the kitchen even


---------61:29----------
though i'm a dude it's my way of showing


---------61:31----------
gratitude they're like ah that's like a


---------61:33----------
critical hit to the face for a


---------61:34----------
narcissist you guys get that


---------61:38----------
they're like oh my god like i've lost 20


---------61:39----------
percent of my health like i'm gonna


---------61:41----------
enrage now i'm gonna show you who's boss


---------61:44----------
hunger strike go hunger strike move


---------61:48----------
the silent treatment emotionally


---------61:50----------
manipulative


---------61:52----------
all of these like modes start activating


---------61:55----------
and they look for chinks in the armor


---------61:56----------
they're gonna find one person they make


---------61:58----------
you feel responsible for their behavior


---------62:01----------
and then suddenly whether oh my god can


---------62:03----------
you think about how sad this is your dad


---------62:05----------
did not eat a single bite for


---------62:06----------
thanksgiving


---------62:08----------
and it's just because you were so


---------62:09----------
egotistical i can't believe you how dare


---------62:13----------
you


---------62:15----------
he didn't eat even a single bite


---------62:21----------
i can't believe you're like this


---------62:23----------
you know how he is


---------62:27----------
how dare you ruin thanksgiving


---------62:28----------
absolutely


---------62:30----------
right


---------62:31----------
oh my god


---------62:33----------
you with your social justice like


---------62:35----------
patriarchal oh my god and your dad


---------62:37----------
didn't even abide eat a bite for


---------62:38----------
thanksgiving


---------62:41----------
so that's how they work


---------62:43----------
so how to deal with the narcissistic


---------62:45----------
parent in short okay


---------62:49----------
i feel like we should there's probably


---------62:50----------
enough for today but we'll think about


---------62:52----------
the enabler and strategies to defeat the


---------62:54----------
narcissistic parent the first thing is


---------62:55----------
to recognize what's going on okay you


---------62:58----------
just have to understand these dynamics


---------62:59----------
the other thing is that the key to


---------63:01----------
dealing with a narcissist is if you can


---------63:03----------
meet the emotional needs


---------63:07----------
then


---------63:09----------
everything comes tumbling down so all


---------63:11----------
the problems they create all the acting


---------63:13----------
out they do all of the victimhood and


---------63:15----------
stuff like that is because they're


---------63:16----------
hurting all they're looking for is love


---------63:19----------
so all you have to do is give them love


---------63:21----------
and you can do it with a boundary


---------63:23----------
right you can say like


---------63:26----------
like i know it's kind of weird but you


---------63:27----------
just have to like be nice to them


---------63:29----------
basically but don't play their game


---------63:31----------
because you don't want to reinforce


---------63:32----------
their behavior you want to give them


---------63:34----------
compassion outside of that thing


---------63:37----------
and so even if you're like playing with


---------63:38----------
your dad and like you guys do board


---------63:39----------
games and they've thrown this hissy fit


---------63:41----------
i know it's kind of weird but like even


---------63:42----------
three hours before the meal if you're


---------63:44----------
like i'm i want to be on dad's team


---------63:47----------
you know like it's gonna be like


---------63:49----------
it's gonna be like


---------63:50----------
dad and daughter versus like mom and son


---------63:53----------
let's go


---------63:54----------
good job dad like you did awesome


---------63:56----------
man this is really fantastic i like what


---------63:58----------
you've done with the place just like


---------63:59----------
show them that you love them and then


---------64:01----------
like if they feel loved then they're


---------64:02----------
kind of confused because they're like


---------64:04----------
they're feeling love and they no longer


---------64:05----------
need to pick up the cross


---------64:08----------
the other thing that you can do is like


---------64:09----------
i know it's kind of weird but if you


---------64:10----------
have a narcissist ask them for help


---------64:13----------
that's the second thing that you can do


---------64:15----------
because when you ask someone for help


---------64:17----------
you like elevate them into the role of


---------64:19----------
like a helper who's powerful right and


---------64:22----------
if they're powerful like they don't like


---------64:23----------
it's hard to play the victim


---------64:26----------
so if you're the son in that situation


---------64:28----------
i'd go over dad and i'd say hey like how


---------64:29----------
did you feel about that conversation and


---------64:31----------
he's gonna be like oh it was totally


---------64:33----------
fine like


---------64:34----------
you know like i don't have to eat the


---------64:35----------
food and you can be like dad i think it


---------64:36----------
would be really awesome if like we could


---------64:38----------
all do this together as a family will


---------64:40----------
you please come and like at least help


---------64:41----------
out a little bit


---------64:44----------
just ask them for help and then like


---------64:46----------
disarms the whole damn thing they're not


---------64:48----------
gonna say like no because what does that


---------64:49----------
make and that makes them the [ __ ] do


---------64:51----------
you guys get their whole entire thing is


---------64:53----------
to make you the [ __ ] and them the


---------64:55----------
victim


---------64:56----------
but if you create a situation where you


---------64:58----------
allow them to be the hero


---------65:00----------
instead of the [ __ ] they're going to


---------65:01----------
take it in a heartbeat


---------65:05----------
you guys get that


---------65:06----------
so ask them for help


---------65:08----------
and give them like compassion


---------65:10----------
and that's how you do it


---------65:12----------
it's hard but it's actually not


---------65:14----------
you know


---------65:16----------
someone's asking isn't this just


---------65:18----------
manipulation though


---------65:20----------
i don't know


---------65:21----------
i'd call it education


---------65:23----------
right because i think this is the key


---------65:25----------
thing like manipulation i think is about


---------65:27----------
an uh an unhealthy end


---------65:30----------
what's the goal of all of this


---------65:31----------
information


---------65:32----------
it's to create harmony during the


---------65:34----------
holidays


---------65:35----------
right and once we once we find a


---------65:37----------
narcissistic family member like what's


---------65:39----------
my answer about what you should do is


---------65:42----------
treat them with love and then ask for


---------65:43----------
their help


---------65:45----------
like


---------65:46----------
you could call that manipulation i guess


---------65:51----------
it's just playing the game on their


---------65:52----------
level let's call it back


---------65:55----------
right but do it like like act in


---------65:56----------
accordance with your dharma that's why


---------65:58----------
like these techniques you know a blade a


---------66:01----------
sword is neither good nor evil it's what


---------66:03----------
you use it for


---------66:05----------
right so like i know it's kind of weird


---------66:07----------
but one of my supervisors


---------66:10----------
once realized that i was like very good


---------66:12----------
at this kind of stuff


---------66:13----------
and so


---------66:14----------
she


---------66:15----------
in in her final feedback from me she was


---------66:17----------
like you did a great job working with me


---------66:19----------
these past three months i have one one


---------66:22----------
piece of feedback for you or one thing


---------66:23----------
that you should do going forward and i


---------66:24----------
said what is that she's like use your


---------66:26----------
power for good instead of evil that was


---------66:28----------
literally


---------66:29----------
the feedback that i got from like a 55


---------66:31----------
year old or 50 year old psychiatrist


---------66:33----------
she was like use your power for good not


---------66:35----------
evil i was like all right


---------66:38----------
i will do that


---------66:40----------
if you tell me to fine


---------66:43----------
right


---------66:44----------
and so i think it's just a technique the


---------66:47----------
question is what are you using it for


---------66:49----------
i'm not suggesting that you use these


---------66:50----------
techniques to start a crypto coin and


---------66:52----------
manipulate people into investing


---------66:55----------
i'm not suggesting you use these


---------66:56----------
techniques to create a monetization


---------66:58----------
structure for a video game


---------67:00----------
i'm suggesting that you use these


---------67:02----------
techniques to create more harmony and


---------67:04----------
peace within your family structure over


---------67:06----------
the holidays so that you can survive


---------67:08----------
your holidays if you need to you can set


---------67:11----------
healthy boundaries with your parents so


---------67:13----------
that you retain your own sanity and you


---------67:15----------
educate them and like help them


---------67:16----------
understand like how to be a functioning


---------67:18----------
family unit


---------67:22----------
right that's why we're doing it


---------67:25----------
but do you call it manipulation yes and


---------67:27----------
i think the other big problem about that


---------67:29----------
term if we think about it is this goes


---------67:31----------
back to like why we're not taught this


---------67:33----------
stuff in the first place


---------67:35----------
the fact that like interpersonal skills


---------67:37----------
gets labeled as manipulation


---------67:40----------
is like absolutely insane the only


---------67:42----------
people who practice this stuff are con


---------67:44----------
artists


---------67:46----------
like that's the whole problem


---------67:48----------
is that everyone should learn this stuff


---------67:53----------
it's it's interpersonal relationships


---------67:56----------
right so like even as a psychiatrist


---------67:58----------
like i do this stuff with my patients


---------68:00----------
but it's not like to you know be


---------68:02----------
nefarious with them it's like holding


---------68:04----------
healthy boundaries


---------68:06----------
so for example


---------68:08----------
if i have a patient who's chronically


---------68:10----------
late for appointments they show up 20


---------68:11----------
minutes late i still stop on time


---------68:13----------
because i have another patient or even


---------68:15----------
if i don't have another patient i still


---------68:17----------
stop on time


---------68:19----------
because it's like when they're like you


---------68:20----------
know


---------68:21----------
like is that manipulating it's like


---------68:22----------
shaping behavior absolutely because i've


---------68:24----------
seen the opposite which is that when you


---------68:26----------
let your patients show up late they're


---------68:28----------
going to show up late if there's no cost


---------68:30----------
to them they're going to show up late


---------68:32----------
so this is kind of bizarre so at one


---------68:34----------
point in my practice


---------68:35----------
70


---------68:36----------
of the people in my of my patient panel


---------68:39----------
was free i didn't charge him a penny


---------68:42----------
okay


---------68:45----------
and guess who never showed up


---------68:46----------
what do you guys think like my


---------68:48----------
my um you know show up rate was


---------68:53----------
for


---------68:54----------
people who paid to see me versus people


---------68:56----------
who got it for free


---------68:58----------
people who pay show up absolutely hey


---------69:00----------
wyvern good to see you man


---------69:04----------
right so i had something like a 95


---------69:06----------
attendance rate for my paying clients


---------69:09----------
maybe even higher and something like an


---------69:11----------
80 attendance rate for my free clients


---------69:18----------
sure so so stoinky goyle is saying i'm


---------69:20----------
chronically late because of adhd that's


---------69:22----------
totally fine i had patience with adhd


---------69:24----------
too


---------69:27----------
and they actually tended to be pretty


---------69:28----------
good about it


---------69:30----------
because like they like if you value it


---------69:32----------
like


---------69:33----------
it works pretty well and that's where as


---------69:34----------
a psychiatrist you've got to be


---------69:35----------
understanding right so if someone like


---------69:38----------
skips to session like if someone is


---------69:40----------
usually attending and then skips two


---------69:41----------
sessions and it turns out that they're


---------69:43----------
depressed like you have to be


---------69:44----------
compassionate towards that i'm not


---------69:45----------
saying that i'm firing people from my


---------69:46----------
practice left and right but setting good


---------69:48----------
boundaries helps them


---------69:50----------
so like creating a situation which an


---------69:52----------
adhd patient


---------69:54----------
that like sort of helps them deal with


---------69:56----------
their adhd and also like doesn't let


---------69:59----------
their adhd run wild


---------70:01----------
is like really important it's actually


---------70:03----------
therapeutic for them to try to hold some


---------70:05----------
kind of limits so sometimes with my adhd


---------70:07----------
patients i would even do things like


---------70:09----------
okay so


---------70:11----------
you have a 4 pm appointment and i


---------70:12----------
actually have an hour long break so like


---------70:15----------
if i know that i've got an adhd patient


---------70:17----------
who sometimes runs late and stuff i'll


---------70:19----------
do things like send them a reminder at


---------70:20----------
three o'clock and be like hey you're


---------70:21----------
going to make it for your 4 p.m


---------70:24----------
and they'll even say like oh i'm running


---------70:25----------
late and i'll be like okay 4 15. no


---------70:27----------
biggie let's i'll push my next i'll hold


---------70:30----------
the slot until 5 15. so you should


---------70:32----------
absolutely accommodate that's the tricky


---------70:34----------
thing about you know being a


---------70:35----------
psychiatrist is that you have patients


---------70:37----------
who fundamentally are going to have


---------70:39----------
challenges with like showing up on time


---------70:41----------
either they'll be depressed


---------70:43----------
they'll be high


---------70:44----------
you know they'll have adhd


---------70:46----------
they'll be anxious


---------70:48----------
so there are all kinds of things oh like


---------70:50----------
i've had like i had a patient who had an


---------70:52----------
addiction who was like very anxious


---------70:54----------
and they were like i relapsed and i was


---------70:56----------
terrified to tell you so like even


---------70:58----------
though i got sober like i couldn't like


---------71:00----------
i was terrified of how you'd respond so


---------71:02----------
they like didn't show up to the


---------71:03----------
appointment we like talked about it next


---------71:05----------
week right


---------71:06----------
it's sort of like bro like i get that


---------71:08----------
you're terrified and like you know i


---------71:09----------
want to have compassion for that but


---------71:11----------
also like i deserve better


---------71:13----------
right like i spent a week worrying about


---------71:15----------
you i didn't know where you were you


---------71:17----------
weren't answering my texts like that's


---------71:18----------
not fair to me


---------71:21----------
and so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------71:22----------
but like that actually is very healthy


---------71:24----------
it's like respecting this person and


---------71:25----------
saying hey you actually have agency you


---------71:27----------
have responsibility you have an impact


---------71:29----------
in the world i understand you have


---------71:30----------
anxiety but like there are other people


---------71:32----------
out there that could be affected by that


---------71:37----------
right and i think that's where i got the


---------71:38----------
best outcomes which is like not like oh


---------71:40----------
my poor baby


---------71:42----------
you have adhd that means you're


---------71:43----------
completely incapable of anything


---------71:46----------
and everything is forgivable and


---------71:48----------
acceptable it's like dude i i forgive


---------71:49----------
you for it


---------71:50----------
but like try to do better next time


---------71:52----------
because i'm a person


---------71:56----------
you know and i think that's when like


---------71:57----------
that's when my patients do really well


---------71:59----------
because when you like it's kind of


---------72:00----------
interesting but in psychiatry what's


---------72:02----------
happening is we're


---------72:04----------
disempowering people by making excuses


---------72:06----------
for them


---------72:08----------
so like it goes back to you know


---------72:10----------
something that i've heard several times


---------72:11----------
which is like it's not your fault but


---------72:13----------
you're responsible


---------72:15----------
and i think that's like the best


---------72:16----------
attitude


---------72:18----------
for all my patients in order for them to


---------72:20----------
do well i have to help them understand


---------72:22----------
that they have power over the illness


---------72:25----------
and having power over their illness in


---------72:27----------
turn means having responsibility for


---------72:28----------
their illness


---------72:30----------
so if you're like manic


---------72:32----------
so i once had a patient who


---------72:35----------
took all their was like adherent with


---------72:37----------
bipolar treatment


---------72:40----------
went to an international conference to


---------72:42----------
present a paper


---------72:43----------
during their period of jet lag their


---------72:45----------
sleep got messed up and they became


---------72:46----------
manic


---------72:48----------
i don't blame them an iota for that


---------72:52----------
because


---------72:53----------
kind of not their fault right like they


---------72:55----------
didn't realize that they didn't think


---------72:56----------
about it i didn't think about it they


---------72:58----------
kind of became manic because their sleep


---------72:59----------
got messed up


---------73:01----------
totally fine


---------73:02----------
next time around though it is their


---------73:04----------
fault right so next time around hey i've


---------73:06----------
got an international conference okay


---------73:07----------
let's think about this


---------73:09----------
maybe you should go a day early so you


---------73:11----------
can like adjust to your sleep schedule


---------73:13----------
maybe what i need to do is prescribe you


---------73:15----------
some sleep medicine so it helps you get


---------73:16----------
on your circadian rhythm and doesn't


---------73:18----------
trigger your mania it is our


---------73:19----------
responsibility


---------73:24----------
yeah they should take melatonin


---------73:26----------
absolutely


---------73:29----------
oh walls of corn irvine yalum talks


---------73:31----------
about this in this relational way to


---------73:33----------
conduct therapy sounds like we have a


---------73:35----------
real student


---------73:37----------
of the psychological sciences in chat


---------73:44----------
ah


---------73:45----------
this is a great question okay dr k in


---------73:47----------
case someone me has these manipulative


---------73:49----------
actions if you're the one doing the


---------73:50----------
manipulating how do we get better


---------73:53----------
fantastic question


---------73:55----------
so


---------73:56----------
if you are the one


---------73:58----------
who is the narcissistic family member


---------74:03----------
the main thing to understand is watch


---------74:05----------
what you're


---------74:06----------
why you're doing what you're doing


---------74:09----------
so like when you start manipulating


---------74:11----------
people


---------74:13----------
right like understand


---------74:15----------
what you're trying to get out of it


---------74:16----------
what's your end goal and just pay


---------74:18----------
attention to that process that's the


---------74:19----------
first thing


---------74:20----------
is to recognize that like you know if


---------74:23----------
for example you feel ashamed


---------74:25----------
so another good example that i'll give


---------74:26----------
you guys is i once had a patient


---------74:30----------
who


---------74:32----------
so two twin sisters fraternal twins okay


---------74:35----------
so not monozygotic so not like


---------74:37----------
genetically identical


---------74:40----------
they're around 25 years old one of the


---------74:41----------
twins is my patient


---------74:44----------
so


---------74:45----------
they're both like pretty much the same


---------74:46----------
through college and then after college


---------74:48----------
one twin decides to get healthy


---------74:51----------
so she loses like 10 or 15 pounds like


---------74:53----------
starts to get super fit starts to take


---------74:55----------
care of herself


---------74:56----------
my patient


---------74:57----------
lets herself go


---------75:00----------
so over the course of three years like


---------75:02----------
every you know because they they like


---------75:04----------
look alike right because they're twins


---------75:06----------
and then over like the next three years


---------75:07----------
like one of them is gaining weight and


---------75:09----------
one of them is losing weight


---------75:11----------
and boy does that create problems


---------75:13----------
because it's sort of like


---------75:15----------
you know like so they they go to


---------75:16----------
thanksgiving and then one you know their


---------75:18----------
cousins and stuff will be like oh you


---------75:20----------
look great like what are you doing like


---------75:22----------
you look like you're super in shape to


---------75:24----------
her sister they just don't say anything


---------75:25----------
to her right they don't say like hey


---------75:26----------
you're fat like she's not actually fat


---------75:28----------
but


---------75:30----------
and so then like my patient is like


---------75:32----------
super


---------75:33----------
you know does like all these like weird


---------75:34----------
toxic things and it turns out like i


---------75:36----------
didn't even realize


---------75:37----------
but she's got all these other problems


---------75:40----------
like in her workplace and in her


---------75:41----------
relationships and and things like that


---------75:43----------
with her parents


---------75:44----------
and the more we kind of talk about it


---------75:45----------
she's like oh my parents are so mean to


---------75:47----------
me my parents are so mean to me they


---------75:48----------
like this sister so much they like the


---------75:50----------
sister they play favorites a lot that


---------75:52----------
was her chief complaint when she came in


---------75:53----------
the more we talk about it the more we're


---------75:55----------
like no they don't actually play play


---------75:56----------
favorites it's just you feel


---------76:00----------
like less worthy than your sister so


---------76:03----------
what happens is there's a cognitive bias


---------76:05----------
in her mind that like amplifies any kind


---------76:07----------
of insult


---------76:09----------
right so it's not even an insult it's


---------76:10----------
just like oh like she'll come in after


---------76:12----------
thanksgiving she'll say my family


---------76:14----------
ignores me


---------76:16----------
and it's not that they actually ignore


---------76:17----------
her it's just like in that moment the


---------76:19----------
sister sees oh they're complimenting my


---------76:21----------
sister on her weight loss and they're


---------76:22----------
not saying anything to me therefore i


---------76:25----------
feel ignored therefore i'm gonna go


---------76:27----------
complain to my psychiatrist that i am


---------76:29----------
ignored


---------76:31----------
and so it's great i mean we worked on it


---------76:33----------
for a while and we kind of challenged


---------76:34----------
that right like why do you feel that way


---------76:36----------
where does that come from what happens


---------76:38----------
and the more that we tunnel down into it


---------76:40----------
i would ask her this question when do


---------76:41----------
you feel ignored so this kind of goes


---------76:43----------
back to like what do you do about it you


---------76:45----------
notice the feelings as they arise don't


---------76:47----------
worry about fixing it or stopping the


---------76:49----------
manipulative behavior don't worry about


---------76:51----------
that yet


---------76:52----------
you have to understand where it arises


---------76:54----------
and the more that we understand where it


---------76:55----------
arises that's when we uncovered oh like


---------76:58----------
i felt it because my you know they


---------76:59----------
complimented my sister


---------77:01----------
and then how then i'd ask like how do


---------77:02----------
you feel about them complimenting your


---------77:04----------
sister well like she deserves it and i'd


---------77:05----------
be like i'm confused and i'd be like


---------77:06----------
what do you mean she deserves it well


---------77:08----------
she's like 30 pounds lighter than i am


---------77:10----------
i'm like okay well tell me about that


---------77:12----------
and so then we uncovered this story


---------77:13----------
about how like her sister has been like


---------77:15----------
taking care of herself and then she in


---------77:17----------
in turn feels ashamed right so then what


---------77:19----------
she does is she since she feels ashamed


---------77:22----------
she starts acting out and manipulating


---------77:24----------
people into helping her feel better


---------77:27----------
so she'll start like throwing tantrums


---------77:29----------
and stuff like that


---------77:30----------
she'll start like crying and like like


---------77:33----------
other things like very publicly but


---------77:34----------
trying to hold it in and then when she


---------77:36----------
starts crying like people like give her


---------77:38----------
attention


---------77:39----------
and that that kind of creates conflict


---------77:41----------
because like her sister is like you know


---------77:43----------
what are you doing


---------77:46----------
and so if you're the person who is doing


---------77:49----------
the manipulation understand


---------77:52----------
that you have particular needs that need


---------77:54----------
to be met


---------77:56----------
and for whatever reason the way that you


---------77:59----------
were taught or conditioned to have those


---------78:01----------
needs needs met is by expressing these


---------78:04----------
like


---------78:07----------
hyperbolic things for lack of a better


---------78:09----------
turn


---------78:10----------
turn so you'll kind of create conflict


---------78:14----------
or have like attention seeking behavior


---------78:17----------
another good example of this is


---------78:18----------
something called parasuicidal gestures


---------78:22----------
so like your parasital gesture is like a


---------78:24----------
good example of this so there's a lot of


---------78:26----------
research into why men kill themselves


---------78:28----------
more often than women so women attempt


---------78:30----------
suicide more men kill themselves way


---------78:33----------
more than women so it's like four to one


---------78:35----------
ratio of completed suicides for for


---------78:37----------
every one woman who kills herself four


---------78:39----------
men kill themselves but for every one


---------78:41----------
man who commits suicide tries to commit


---------78:44----------
suicide it's arguable that maybe four


---------78:46----------
women attempt suicide


---------78:49----------
so then when you kind of tunnel down


---------78:50----------
into it what you see is that there's a


---------78:52----------
lot of parasuicidal gestures


---------78:54----------
so this is where like


---------78:55----------
uh


---------78:56----------
i mean it's not always this way but


---------78:58----------
women for example you prefer overdoses


---------79:01----------
men like prefer firearms so what what


---------79:03----------
will happen is a woman will say like


---------79:05----------
okay so they'll take a bunch of pills


---------79:07----------
and they'll text someone they'll say


---------79:08----------
like i'm saying goodbye


---------79:10----------
and then the person will be like


---------79:12----------
what do you mean you're saying goodbye


---------79:13----------
you're freaking me out she's like don't


---------79:14----------
worry you'll understand soon they'll be


---------79:16----------
like super like vague about it this is a


---------79:18----------
pair of suicidal gestures it doesn't


---------79:19----------
have to be a woman


---------79:20----------
and so they'll like do something that is


---------79:21----------
suicidal but like have a high visibility


---------79:24----------
of it they'll tell let the whole world


---------79:25----------
know goodbye world i'll see you tomorrow


---------79:28----------
or i'll never see you again i hope the


---------79:30----------
rest of you have wonderful lives


---------79:33----------
and then like people will like rescue


---------79:35----------
them right so the attempt is low


---------79:36----------
lethality high visibility


---------79:39----------
so if you talk to those people why are


---------79:40----------
they doing that it's because they


---------79:42----------
they're trying to get an emotional need


---------79:43----------
met and sometimes people who just aren't


---------79:46----------
taught how to articulate their feelings


---------79:48----------
the only way they've learned because


---------79:50----------
when they were 15 or 16


---------79:52----------
they said


---------79:53----------
i want to kill myself and then people


---------79:55----------
started paying attention


---------79:57----------
right it's not their fault it's like


---------79:58----------
this is a 15 year old who's been ignored


---------80:00----------
for the last five years


---------80:02----------
abused and they say like i want to kill


---------80:05----------
myself because that's actually how they


---------80:06----------
feel they don't want to live this life


---------80:07----------
anymore and then suddenly everyone comes


---------80:09----------
swooping in


---------80:11----------
and suddenly we care


---------80:13----------
right like suddenly we care if you're


---------80:15----------
suicidal and that's the lesson that they


---------80:17----------
learn


---------80:18----------
is the only time people care is if


---------80:20----------
you're suicidal and that's how you get


---------80:21----------
pair of suicidal gestures


---------80:24----------
right and then we get that sort of like


---------80:26----------
even in relationships oh if you leave me


---------80:28----------
i'm going to kill myself because that's


---------80:29----------
how that person has learned that's how


---------80:31----------
society and people have taught


---------80:35----------
this person how you can get your needs


---------80:36----------
met


---------80:37----------
how can you guarantee that this person


---------80:39----------
won't abandon you because what you're


---------80:41----------
really afraid of is being left alone


---------80:43----------
you're afraid of abandonment well i can


---------80:45----------
get him to stay if i tell him i'm gonna


---------80:46----------
kill myself


---------80:53----------
hello


---------80:58----------

---------83:59----------
meditations


---------84:00----------
one is going to be like a processing


---------84:02----------
your emotions in the moment while you're


---------84:04----------
interacting with family members


---------84:06----------

---------84:07----------
meditation that's geared towards


---------84:09----------
improving interpersonal relationships


---------84:11----------
okay


---------84:13----------
so this is going to be a


---------84:15----------
manipura chakra meditation


---------84:18----------
there we go


---------84:19----------
so that involves so first thing that


---------84:21----------
we're going to do is sit up


---------84:23----------
okay so we're going to sit up straight


---------84:27----------
try not to


---------84:28----------
swivel and then


---------84:31----------
oh no


---------84:33----------
oh no chat


---------84:34----------
we're swiveling


---------84:38----------
okay


---------84:39----------
so what manipura


---------84:42----------
m-a-n-i-p-u-r-a so i want y'all to sit


---------84:45----------
up straight and close your eyes okay


---------84:46----------
this is gonna be a little bit more of a


---------84:48----------
guided meditation


---------84:51----------
no chatting chat


---------84:53----------
eyes closed


---------84:55----------
okay so we're gonna put ourselves


---------84:58----------
in the situation of your at


---------85:01----------
your home for the holidays


---------85:03----------
and the stuff that pisses you off is


---------85:06----------
pissing you off


---------85:09----------
okay whatever that may be


---------85:11----------
it may be that your cousins are making


---------85:13----------
fun of you


---------85:14----------
it may be that one of your parents is


---------85:16----------
throwing a temper tantrum


---------85:18----------
it may be that your grandmother is


---------85:20----------
asking you when you're going to get


---------85:22----------
married


---------85:23----------
because you're indian


---------85:25----------
and all your life you've been told no


---------85:26----------
dating no dating no dating and then


---------85:28----------
suddenly it's when are you getting


---------85:29----------
married and having kids why aren't you


---------85:31----------
married yet


---------85:33----------
no girlfriend


---------85:35----------
why aren't you married


---------85:37----------
your cousin in india is married


---------85:40----------
so whatever it is


---------85:44----------
whatever is going on


---------85:46----------
that pisses you off


---------85:48----------
so try to think about that recall that


---------85:51----------
feeling


---------85:52----------
what do they say that annoys you


---------85:58----------
maybe you've got a career outside of


---------85:59----------
medicine why don't you be doctor doctor


---------86:02----------
is good


---------86:03----------
it is noble profession but the reason we


---------86:06----------
value is because of the financial


---------86:08----------
we all call it our noble profession but


---------86:10----------
we care about the money


---------86:13----------
right


---------86:14----------
maybe it's politics


---------86:22----------
whatever it is just call up recall that


---------86:25----------
memory prepare mentally in your mind for


---------86:27----------
that situation


---------86:29----------
and now what we're going to do is take a


---------86:31----------
deep breath in and we're going to expand


---------86:32----------
our belly out


---------86:35----------
so we're gonna take that cool air and


---------86:37----------
put it all the way down into our belly


---------86:39----------
button and then as we breathe out


---------86:43----------
we're gonna breathe out that heat and


---------86:45----------
that tension


---------86:47----------
so feel that toxicity that swirls up


---------86:49----------
inside you in your in your chest in your


---------86:52----------
throat


---------86:53----------
and how it creates tightness


---------86:57----------
anger sweatiness


---------87:00----------
and as we breathe in expand the throat


---------87:04----------
expand the chest


---------87:06----------
expand the belly


---------87:08----------
and then let it all relax


---------87:11----------
and as you let it relax the recoil


---------87:13----------
happens in your belly the recoil happens


---------87:16----------
in your intercostal muscles or chest


---------87:18----------
your throat relax and you feel that hot


---------87:21----------
air come out


---------87:24----------
that is the tension and the negativity


---------87:28----------
so again take a deep breath in


---------87:30----------
feel the throat expand chest expand


---------87:33----------
abdomen expand


---------87:37----------
and as you exhale


---------87:42----------
notice the transience of things


---------87:45----------
you can continue to breathe


---------87:47----------
expanding the throat expanding the chest


---------87:50----------
expanding the abdomen


---------87:53----------
and feel that cool air


---------87:55----------
envelop the inside of your body


---------87:59----------
and as you relax


---------88:01----------
notice the heat and the tension leave


---------88:08----------
that the tightness in your chest and the


---------88:09----------
tightness in your throat is relaxing


---------88:18----------
and take for a moment


---------88:20----------
notice for a moment


---------88:23----------
that all breaths come to an end


---------88:27----------
that each inhalation stops and becomes


---------88:29----------
exhalation


---------88:31----------
and that each


---------88:32----------
exhalation stops and becomes inhalation


---------88:37----------
that any given sensation of opening of


---------88:40----------
your throat


---------88:42----------
or relaxing of your throat


---------88:44----------
of tightening in the chest or expanding


---------88:46----------
the chest


---------88:48----------
of the belly moving out or in


---------88:52----------
all of these things are transient


---------88:58----------
and now say to yourself this too shall


---------89:00----------
pass


---------89:03----------
this too shall pass


---------89:15----------
that all things that happen with your


---------89:17----------
family will come to a close


---------89:23----------
that despite the whirlwind that is your


---------89:25----------
family's holiday situation


---------89:28----------
despite all the tensions the joys the


---------89:31----------
frustrations the comparisons the


---------89:34----------
embarrassments


---------89:37----------
all of those feelings are transient


---------89:40----------
that if you need to you can take a dip


---------89:43----------
into this place within yourself


---------89:55----------
this too shall pass


---------90:14----------
you can continue the practice


---------90:17----------
expanding the throat


---------90:20----------
expanding the chest


---------90:22----------
expanding the abdomen


---------90:27----------
or you can let your breathing


---------90:29----------
return to normal


---------90:36----------
with a full


---------90:38----------
inhalation in that moment repeat to


---------90:40----------
yourself this shall pass


---------90:44----------
and as you expel all of the air out


---------90:47----------
repeat to yourself


---------90:48----------
this shall pass


---------90:56----------
in the spaces between inhalation and


---------90:59----------
exhalation find your stillness


---------91:09----------
and in that way


---------91:11----------
with all the ups and all the downs


---------91:14----------
in the in between spaces you shall also


---------91:17----------
find your stillness


---------91:24----------
we'll practice for about another minute


---------92:17----------
now let your eyes remain closed


---------92:21----------
wiggle your toes wiggle your fingers


---------92:24----------
shrug your shoulders a little bit


---------92:27----------
stretch your neck


---------92:30----------
and let yourself start to return back to


---------92:32----------
the world


---------92:37----------
and notice for a moment that the


---------92:38----------
holidays may not be the best time


---------92:42----------
that there may be all of these dynamics


---------92:44----------
going on that they may be challenging


---------92:46----------
for you to deal with


---------92:49----------
and have some compassion for yourself


---------92:51----------
they don't need to be fixed right away


---------92:53----------
you will survive whatever comes you will


---------92:56----------
enjoy whatever you can


---------92:58----------
in what comes next


---------93:02----------
and have some compassion for your family


---------93:05----------
that despite all the tension despite all


---------93:08----------
the difficulty


---------93:12----------
it isn't necessarily their fault


---------93:15----------
that things are the way that they are it


---------93:17----------
isn't your fault that things are the way


---------93:20----------
they are


---------93:22----------
and yet in the smallest way possible


---------93:25----------
try to take some responsibility


---------93:28----------
what can you change what can you affect


---------93:35----------
and as best as you can have faith in


---------93:37----------
your family


---------93:40----------
that if you start to treat them with


---------93:42----------
compassion


---------93:44----------
and start to articulate what is


---------93:46----------
happening


---------93:47----------
as you raise awareness


---------93:49----------
that they'll start to move in the right


---------93:51----------
direction as well


---------93:55----------
it's fine to be skeptical


---------93:58----------
but try to cultivate within yourself a


---------94:00----------
tiny amount of hope


---------94:03----------
because at the end of the day your


---------94:04----------
family are probably decent people


---------94:07----------
who are not always bad


---------94:10----------
so you can count on them too


---------94:17----------
it may just take a little bit of time


---------94:20----------
with that go ahead and come back


---------94:31----------
and have a happy thanksgiving chat
