---------01:35----------

---------01:37----------
after we're done


---------01:39----------
so just to let you guys know a little


---------01:41----------
bit about why I call this kind of the


---------01:44----------
healthy gaming lecture series a few


---------01:46----------
years ago when I was training I got kind


---------01:49----------
of curious about video game addiction


---------01:50----------
and the more people that I talk to the


---------01:53----------
more I realized that like the


---------01:55----------
psychiatric community doesn't actually


---------01:56----------
know much about video game addiction and


---------01:59----------
I realized that the reason for that is


---------02:01----------
because most people who are kind of at


---------02:03----------
the forefront the leaders of thought


---------02:05----------
within the field of psychiatry and


---------02:07----------
psychology are like experts right so


---------02:10----------
they're like people in their 50s and 60s


---------02:12----------
if you look at people who are like


---------02:14----------
Chiefs of Psychiatry so for example I


---------02:16----------
trained at this place called


---------02:17----------
Massachusetts General Hospital in


---------02:19----------
another place called McLean Hospital and


---------02:21----------
the chief of psychiatry at MGH is this


---------02:24----------
guy named Jerry Rosenbaum he's off he's


---------02:26----------
an awesome guy but he's like he's like


---------02:27----------
older and I don't know if he's ever


---------02:29----------
really played


---------02:29----------
video games so all of the people who are


---------02:31----------
kind of leading the field of psychiatry


---------02:34----------
if you look at people like the president


---------02:36----------
of the American Psychiatric Association


---------02:37----------
all of those people are like older and


---------02:40----------
they haven't really had experience


---------02:42----------
playing video games and so they don't


---------02:43----------
actually know what it's like to play


---------02:46----------
video games and they really struggle to


---------02:47----------
help people who struggle with video game


---------02:50----------
addiction


---------02:51----------
so when I started to do is I got kind of


---------02:54----------
curious about it and I realized that


---------02:56----------
actually none of my mentors are leaders


---------02:58----------
in the field could actually tell me much


---------03:00----------
about it because they didn't know much


---------03:01----------
about it so what I started to do is just


---------03:03----------
started working with gamers so I just


---------03:05----------
talked to people on my started out with


---------03:07----------
like kind of my Steam friends list and


---------03:09----------
then over time as I started talking to


---------03:11----------
more and more people I started getting


---------03:13----------
emails and people that I talked to were


---------03:15----------
like hey maybe you should talk to this


---------03:16----------
guy and word of mouth kind of spread and


---------03:18----------
I ended up working with over the last


---------03:20----------
three years


---------03:21----------
you know maybe 50 or 60 gamers and spent


---------03:25----------
hundreds of hours working with these


---------03:26----------
people and then even recently started to


---------03:29----------
get requests to work with some


---------03:30----------
professional video game players in terms


---------03:33----------
of like stress management and things


---------03:34----------
like that and so I just started working


---------03:36----------
with people and trying to figure out


---------03:38----------
like you know why is it that you guys


---------03:40----------
play video games and and what can we do


---------03:42----------
to help you with your addiction one of


---------03:44----------
the first things that I realized when I


---------03:46----------
was working with these people is that I


---------03:47----------
don't think addiction is really a great


---------03:49----------
term you know I think this is part of


---------03:51----------
the problem with the field of Psychiatry


---------03:53----------
is we try to take things that we know


---------03:56----------
like drug addiction and alcohol


---------03:57----------
addiction and we try to apply it to new


---------03:59----------
phenomenon like video game addiction and


---------04:01----------
so we call we sort of all lump those


---------04:03----------
things together but in my mind there's a


---------04:05----------
huge difference between someone who's an


---------04:07----------
alcoholic and someone who's addicted to


---------04:09----------
video games I mean I myself almost


---------04:11----------
failed out of college due to playing way


---------04:13----------
too much way too many video games when I


---------04:15----------
was like in a freshman and sophomore and


---------04:18----------
so I was kind of there and I still feel


---------04:21----------
like I haven't changed it's not like my


---------04:22----------
addiction got cured it's just my help my


---------04:24----------
gaming used to be what I like to call


---------04:26----------
problematic and now it's become


---------04:28----------
healthier so it used to really interfere


---------04:31----------
with the goals that I had for myself


---------04:33----------
and interfere with my life like I was


---------04:35----------
like I remember sleeping through my


---------04:37----------
Spanish final freshman year because I


---------04:40----------
was playing Diablo 3 or Diablo 2 until


---------04:43----------
like 4:00 in the morning and I remember


---------04:45----------
like my alarm going off at 7:30 that I


---------04:47----------
have a final in an hour and I just like


---------04:49----------
turned off my alarm and went back to


---------04:51----------
sleep and then like failed Spanish


---------04:53----------
because I just [ __ ] slept through the


---------04:54----------
final that is a problem right that's


---------04:57----------
when your gaming is a problem and now


---------04:59----------
you know I still play games I still


---------05:01----------
enjoy playing games I'd love to play


---------05:02----------
more games but I'm too busy doing this


---------05:04----------
[ __ ] with you guys instead of actually


---------05:07----------
playing games but that's ok I'm ok with


---------05:09----------
that


---------05:10----------
because I feel like this is something


---------05:11----------
that I find meaningful and fulfilling


---------05:13----------
and so games have become kind of more of


---------05:15----------
a recreation for me and that's what I'd


---------05:18----------
like to help what I'd like to help you


---------05:19----------
guys do so it's not about whether you're


---------05:22----------
a video game addict or not and we will


---------05:24----------
talk a little bit about you know how do


---------05:26----------
you decide if your gaming is a problem


---------05:27----------
how do you decide if you're an addict


---------05:29----------
but what I really like to do today is


---------05:31----------
help you guys learn how to be a healthy


---------05:33----------
gamer and this is another thing so in


---------05:37----------
the addiction world you know there's


---------05:38----------
this idea that it's abstinence only if


---------05:41----------
you're an alcoholic it's like you know


---------05:43----------
10 years sober and you're never allowed


---------05:45----------
to have a single drink my understanding


---------05:48----------
is that video game addiction is


---------05:50----------
different because there are a lot of


---------05:51----------
people I've worked with who used to have


---------05:54----------
really problematic gaming who still


---------05:55----------
enjoy playing games for they're doing


---------05:57----------
fine in life now one of the people that


---------06:00----------
I work with is he's actually a really


---------06:03----------
successful entrepreneur makes like seven


---------06:05----------
figures a year and still plays like


---------06:07----------
video games for like 30 hours a week and


---------06:09----------
I think he's okay with that and I think


---------06:11----------
that's fine too if you're doing


---------06:12----------
everything that you want to do and and


---------06:14----------
you want to play video games for 30


---------06:16----------
hours a week that's fine go for it


---------06:17----------
so today what I'd like to do is kind of


---------06:21----------
just start by reframing a little bit so


---------06:24----------
the first thing is that you know it's


---------06:27----------
not about whether you're an addict or


---------06:29----------
not I think where we need to start is to


---------06:31----------
help you guys understand why you play


---------06:34----------
video games in the first place and what


---------06:36----------
function video games serve for you and


---------06:40----------
then we also need to think about how do


---------06:42----------
video games shape you how do they change


---------06:44----------
your brain how do they affect your neuro


---------06:47----------
chemistry how do they affect your


---------06:48----------
ability to form relationships and your


---------06:51----------
ability to solve problems because they


---------06:53----------
definitely do when a human brain does


---------06:56----------
something for


---------06:57----------
hours a day pretty much every day of the


---------06:59----------
week that whatever whatever activity


---------07:01----------
they do is gonna change their brain if


---------07:04----------
you think about someone who plays music


---------07:05----------
for four hours a day that's gonna change


---------07:08----------
the way their brain works it's gonna


---------07:10----------
change the way that their auditory


---------07:11----------
cortex develops and in that same way


---------07:15----------
gaming shapes you guys so the goals of


---------07:18----------
these lectures are not necessarily to


---------07:20----------
overcome your addiction but to gain


---------07:22----------
understanding about yourself and


---------07:25----------
understanding about how the gaming that


---------07:27----------
you do shapes the person that you are


---------07:29----------
and so today we're gonna cover a couple


---------07:32----------
of different topics so we're gonna talk


---------07:34----------
about some just general things about


---------07:36----------
sort of introduction to gaming and how


---------07:38----------
you know whether it's a problem or how


---------07:39----------
you know whether it's an addiction we're


---------07:41----------
gonna talk about some things involving


---------07:43----------
cognition so how does gaming change the


---------07:46----------
way that you think and change the way


---------07:47----------
that you approach problems we're gonna


---------07:49----------
talk a little bit about neuroscience


---------07:51----------
because one of the things that I found


---------07:53----------
is that gamers are actually really good


---------07:55----------
at dealing with complicated information


---------07:57----------
and one of the reason that I love


---------07:59----------
working with you guys is I can actually


---------08:01----------
talk about technical neuroscience and it


---------08:03----------
bizarrely does not go over your heads


---------08:06----------
you guys are actually able to assimilate


---------08:08----------
and use that information in a way that


---------08:10----------
very few of my patients are so we're


---------08:13----------
going to talk about neuroscience we're


---------08:14----------
gonna talk about cognition we're gonna


---------08:16----------
talk about some general principles we're


---------08:18----------
also going to talk about relationships


---------08:20----------
so we'll talk a little bit about how you


---------08:23----------
form relationships and games how that


---------08:25----------
works how gaming interferes with


---------08:27----------
relationships and we're also going to


---------08:29----------
talk a little bit about emotions I'm


---------08:33----------
gonna sneeze okay and so my hope is that


---------08:37----------
by helping you guys understand a little


---------08:39----------
bit about who you are and how you work


---------08:42----------
how your emotions work how your


---------08:44----------
cognition works how you form


---------08:46----------
relationships what's happening in your


---------08:47----------
brain my hope is to equip you or empower


---------08:51----------
you with this information so that you


---------08:53----------
can get understanding around your gaming


---------08:55----------
and by gaining understanding eventually


---------08:58----------
get control over this person that you


---------09:00----------
are and by getting control over yourself


---------09:03----------
my hope is that you can move in the


---------09:05----------
direction that you want to and stop


---------09:07----------
being a problematic gamer and start


---------09:09----------
being a healthy gamer


---------09:10----------
you
