---------00:40----------

---------00:41----------

---------00:42----------

---------00:47----------

---------00:58----------
all right you you have a a red thread


---------01:01----------
around your right wrist


---------01:04----------
yes this is from my wedding oh how


---------01:07----------
long ago were you married uh well it's


---------01:10----------
it's been replaced since then but uh we


---------01:12----------
had our wedding in um


---------01:14----------
january of 2019. oh interesting


---------01:18----------
in delhi yeah wow


---------01:22----------
that sounds wild man i mean


---------01:26----------
it was interesting because i tried


---------01:28----------
bringing an elephant in because i wanted


---------01:29----------
a way i wanted to ride an elephant into


---------01:31----------
my wedding because i was like listen


---------01:32----------
one of two things either a i have an


---------01:34----------
epic story


---------01:35----------
or b i'm trampled to death by an


---------01:37----------
elephant in my own wedding which is also


---------01:39----------
an awesome story


---------01:40----------
so for me i was like that would be cool


---------01:42----------
but they wouldn't allow us to have an


---------01:44----------
elephant within the city limit so i had


---------01:45----------
to ride a horse in


---------01:47----------
that's you know


---------01:51----------
it's really frustrating that you weren't


---------01:53----------
able to get your elephant


---------01:55----------
you know i figure there'll be another


---------01:56----------
time there'll be another time i'll i'll


---------01:58----------
i'll i'll i'll chalk that one up too is


---------02:00----------
you know a missed opportunity


---------02:02----------
and and um so am i calling you stonk a


---------02:04----------
guy or


---------02:05----------
what do you go by stocky tsg


---------02:09----------
boomer um foxy i don't know there's a


---------02:12----------
million names out there


---------02:13----------
what do you prefer


---------02:17----------
i don't really have a preference i just


---------02:18----------
kind of go with what it is i mean uh


---------02:21----------
well okay no not jim creamer god


---------02:24----------
um uh whatever whatever is comfortable


---------02:27----------
for you stocky tsg stock guy


---------02:30----------
okay uh i'll i guess i'll go with tsg


---------02:32----------
unless


---------02:33----------
should i just use your name or is that


---------02:35----------
secret


---------02:37----------
i mean they know my name it's just


---------02:38----------
awkward because of the character well


---------02:39----------
not character but the


---------02:40----------
the the person i play on stream so okay


---------02:43----------
um i mean if you want to call me jason


---------02:45----------
that's fine


---------02:46----------
okay uh we can go with tsg all right


---------02:50----------
um yeah so tell me tsu what do you want


---------02:52----------
to talk about today


---------02:54----------
anything in particular


---------02:58----------
um i i mean i don't know i mean i


---------03:01----------
i they reached out just to talk i don't


---------03:03----------
know i was told


---------03:04----------
so let me let me orient you okay please


---------03:08----------
okay so oftentimes people come onto the


---------03:11----------
stream because


---------03:12----------
they want to learn about something or


---------03:14----------
they need help with something


---------03:16----------
so i i recognize that


---------03:20----------
so a lot of times people on twitch will


---------03:22----------
like have kind of like you know podcasts


---------03:24----------
or whatever where they'll talk about


---------03:25----------
stuff


---------03:26----------
we usually don't talk about stuff in


---------03:29----------
sort of a third person way although we


---------03:30----------
certainly can


---------03:32----------
um so usually like a lot of streamers


---------03:34----------
you know will


---------03:35----------
will have um particular questions about


---------03:38----------
mental health or they have an issue


---------03:40----------
they're struggling with


---------03:41----------
or things like that that that we'll kind


---------03:44----------
of then explore together


---------03:45----------
using the lens of like um you know


---------03:48----------
actually yourself


---------03:50----------
but some people have you know that


---------03:52----------
they're not entirely comfortable with


---------03:53----------
that


---------03:54----------
or or things like that which is totally


---------03:55----------
cool in which case we can just


---------03:58----------
you know talk if there's if there are


---------03:59----------
any questions that you have that i can


---------04:01----------
answer that's totally fine


---------04:02----------
i think um two of the things that uh


---------04:05----------
had been floated were sort of talking


---------04:07----------
about fomo


---------04:09----------
or financial stress um


---------04:12----------
and i don't know if those topics seem


---------04:14----------
relevant to you or anything like that um


---------04:16----------
we can talk more about your marriage if


---------04:18----------
you want to


---------04:19----------
what it's being like married to an


---------04:20----------
indian woman um


---------04:22----------
you know whatever whatever you whatever


---------04:24----------
you want to talk about


---------04:26----------
so oftentimes people will come here with


---------04:28----------
a particular like goal in mind but if


---------04:30----------
you don't have one that's totally fine


---------04:32----------
we can


---------04:33----------
you know we can roll with it um yeah i


---------04:35----------
know i mean i'm still


---------04:36----------
trying to get this over um as far as me


---------04:38----------
like i'm not really a twitch


---------04:40----------
person it's gonna be weird to say that


---------04:42----------
um i'm not so


---------04:44----------
yeah so so two and a half years ago i


---------04:46----------
never even heard what twitch was


---------04:48----------
uh and even now um after i get done


---------04:51----------
streaming


---------04:51----------
i you know i have to you know i have my


---------04:54----------
newborn so i take care of her give my


---------04:56----------
wife a break i have to take care of the


---------04:57----------
wife the dog


---------04:58----------
business inquiry stuff you know um


---------05:01----------
trades and stuff like that i don't


---------05:02----------
really spend a lot of time on twitch i'm


---------05:04----------
just now starting to network with people


---------05:06----------
after the two years so um i knew who


---------05:10----------
who you were and what what what you do


---------05:12----------
and and the way that you know you


---------05:14----------
you talk with streamers stuff like that


---------05:15----------
i knew of that but i didn't have a lot


---------05:17----------
of like


---------05:18----------
deep understanding of it um so


---------05:21----------
you know but one of my mods also works


---------05:22----------
with your team so i kind of understood


---------05:24----------
so for me um i'm i'm coming into this a


---------05:27----------
little blind


---------05:28----------
but i think that i think that i think


---------05:30----------
that it's a good opportunity since you


---------05:32----------
work with mental health and


---------05:33----------
and helping people understand things i


---------05:35----------
actually think that this is a good time


---------05:37----------
to talk about certain things for people


---------05:39----------
because i think this whole gamestop


---------05:40----------
fiasco um


---------05:43----------
a lot of people got caught up in


---------05:44----------
something they didn't know a lot of


---------05:46----------
people


---------05:46----------
had some misunderstandings a lot of


---------05:47----------
people lost a lot of money or they


---------05:50----------
didn't know what they were doing and i


---------05:51----------
think that i think that it's actually


---------05:53----------
a good conversation to have regarding um


---------05:57----------
fomo whether it's uh chasing get rich


---------05:59----------
quick you know following the trend and


---------06:01----------
stuff like that i think that it's


---------06:02----------
actually a relevant conversation so i


---------06:04----------
thought that was something maybe we


---------06:05----------
could begin with


---------06:06----------
and then kind of easy that's totally


---------06:07----------
cool yeah so tell me about


---------06:09----------
the game stop quote unquote fiasco


---------06:12----------
oh well


---------06:16----------
like from the beginning or like just


---------06:17----------
kind of like what's going on well i mean


---------06:19----------
basically you know there was this


---------06:20----------
there was this thing online where um it


---------06:23----------
started out that we could make money


---------06:24----------
you know there was money that this stock


---------06:26----------
is going to go good and then as it got


---------06:27----------
up there was more hype around it


---------06:29----------
um regarding a short squeeze and gamma


---------06:32----------
squeeze which is in stock terms mean


---------06:34----------
there's a chance that this can


---------06:35----------
exponentially go up um


---------06:38----------
and then it started doing that and the


---------06:39----------
squeeze happened but um


---------06:41----------
i think a lot of people it went from


---------06:44----------
potential to make money to it's gonna


---------06:45----------
make everyone a millionaire and we're


---------06:46----------
gonna take down the big guy and we're


---------06:48----------
gonna get rich doing it


---------06:49----------
and i think a lot of people who didn't


---------06:50----------
really understand what was going on also


---------06:52----------
threw money at it


---------06:54----------
like anything and now they're bag


---------06:56----------
holding


---------06:57----------
from the top and they've lost a lot of


---------06:59----------
money and some people who are


---------07:01----------
maybe more susceptible to sensationalism


---------07:04----------
or


---------07:04----------
or gambling or are in a really bad


---------07:06----------
financial situation thought this was


---------07:08----------
their out


---------07:09----------
and now they're way worse off than they


---------07:11----------
were before


---------07:12----------
and uh you know i'm seeing that around


---------07:15----------
and i'm really it really bothers me and


---------07:17----------
you know um i was very clear with these


---------07:20----------
guys yeah we were having fun we were


---------07:22----------
hyping it up the andrew and we're all in


---------07:24----------
this and it's all great


---------07:25----------
but i tried to make it very clear


---------07:26----------
throughout the time you know guys also


---------07:28----------
don't be in this


---------07:29----------
holding over the weekend more money than


---------07:30----------
you have that you could afford to lose


---------07:32----------
because


---------07:33----------
it is a total gamble it's a complete


---------07:35----------
gamble gamestop is not going to be 300


---------07:37----------
or 400


---------07:37----------
in a year so be careful and a lot of


---------07:40----------
people they get caught up with the


---------07:41----------
emotions


---------07:42----------
um and they lost a lot of money and and


---------07:44----------
i've always been one of those people who


---------07:46----------
you know i hate seeing people in my


---------07:49----------
community lose money or people out there


---------07:51----------
lose money because


---------07:52----------
i try to make it my mission to to help


---------07:54----------
people but i'm also an entertainer so


---------07:56----------
it's a little bit of a mixture


---------07:57----------
there so that's something i've been i've


---------07:58----------
been struggling with a little bit but


---------08:00----------
i feel you know i feel for some of those


---------08:02----------
people what do you what do you mean by


---------08:04----------
you've been struggling with what what


---------08:05----------
exactly has been the struggle


---------08:08----------
um the struggle for me is


---------08:12----------
is that you know you're always gonna i'm


---------08:14----------
i'm one of those guys who always


---------08:15----------
wonder if if if potentially


---------08:20----------
i didn't like you know um


---------08:24----------
i didn't give


---------08:27----------
enough warning because i've always built


---------08:30----------
my stream


---------08:30----------
on the idea that i want to help people


---------08:33----------
make better


---------08:34----------
financial decisions you know teaching


---------08:36----------
them stuff making it fun right so i've


---------08:39----------
we have people that have learned about


---------08:40----------
getting their 401k in their ira or


---------08:42----------
refinancing their house or getting their


---------08:44----------
loan down or


---------08:45----------
you know management fees you know hsa i


---------08:48----------
mean there's so many things


---------08:49----------
that that's so much good and so much


---------08:51----------
awesomeness and


---------08:53----------
and and amazing things that have


---------08:55----------
happened in this community it gives me a


---------08:56----------
purpose every day


---------08:57----------
it's the greatest thing that's ever


---------08:58----------
happened to me but


---------09:00----------
i sometimes like if somebody finally


---------09:02----------
says hey stock guy because of you i


---------09:04----------
started investing


---------09:05----------
that's awesome next day market's down


---------09:06----------
five percent


---------09:08----------
and it's like now i feel guilty you know


---------09:11----------
what i mean like even though i know that


---------09:12----------
this is part of the market like they're


---------09:14----------
looking at me like i did i listened and


---------09:15----------
now i'm losing money like


---------09:17----------
i feel guilt even though i didn't do


---------09:19----------
anything


---------09:20----------
and with the gamestop fiasco it was fun


---------09:23----------
it was engaging i was i was loving it


---------09:25----------
with the hype was great


---------09:26----------
even though i was giving the message


---------09:27----------
along the way of guys don't put it more


---------09:29----------
than you can afford to lose it's a


---------09:30----------
gamble


---------09:31----------
if you have your money now you can sell


---------09:34----------
your shares for a profit


---------09:35----------
sell your original investment let the


---------09:37----------
rest ride hand the torch off


---------09:40----------
and i even though i shouldn't a little


---------09:42----------
bit of part of me is like


---------09:45----------
how clear were you and did you like i


---------09:47----------
mean i can't force somebody to do it but


---------09:48----------
i


---------09:49----------
sometimes i'm like you know yeah i said


---------09:52----------
it but you know i don't know there's


---------09:53----------
just a little bit there so but yeah so


---------09:56----------
that's about it let me see if i kind of


---------09:58----------
understand what you're saying


---------09:59----------
and if the questions get if you want to


---------10:00----------
be a little bit more abstract


---------10:02----------
um and and less personal about your own


---------10:04----------
feelings just let me know okay


---------10:06----------
oh i got i'm just sort of dude on the


---------10:08----------
camera i'm not worried yeah okay


---------10:10----------
so what i'm hearing is that you know in


---------10:13----------
a sense you kind of know you're not


---------10:14----------
responsible right so like you you you're


---------10:17----------
very clear in terms of trying to provide


---------10:19----------
guidance


---------10:19----------
you know there's no such thing as a sure


---------10:21----------
thing um you're being very explicit with


---------10:24----------
people


---------10:24----------
that you're like this is a [ __ ]


---------10:26----------
gamble right absolutely


---------10:28----------
it's it's a gamble it's a meme you've


---------10:30----------
been saying it all along


---------10:33----------
and at the same time i'm noticing that


---------10:36----------
in your head


---------10:37----------
you're doing all the you're actually


---------10:39----------
behaving in a responsible way


---------10:41----------
but that there's a part of you that i it


---------10:43----------
sounds kind of weird


---------10:45----------
feels responsible


---------10:48----------
when people lose money it's something


---------10:51----------
i've struggled with from the beginning


---------10:53----------
you know um i i'm i'm very very clear


---------10:56----------
that you know


---------10:58----------
actively trading the odds are heavily


---------11:00----------
against you


---------11:03----------
you know day trading odds are heavily


---------11:05----------
against you


---------11:06----------
you know the there's no such thing as a


---------11:08----------
sure thing i mean the market itself


---------11:10----------
always goes up historically i mean yeah


---------11:11----------
it goes down but then it goes back up so


---------11:13----------
investing is not so much a gamble but


---------11:15----------
actively trading day trading


---------11:17----------
is a gamble it's a gamble and you're


---------11:19----------
most likely not going to beat the market


---------11:21----------
and even if you do the sweat equity you


---------11:23----------
put in


---------11:24----------
isn't worth the the profit at the end if


---------11:27----------
you and that's why even me i tell them


---------11:28----------
all the time i put


---------11:29----------
90 of my my money in long-term


---------11:32----------
investments


---------11:33----------
10 i trade and i and i make money when i


---------11:36----------
make profit i dump them into my long


---------11:37----------
term


---------11:38----------
and that's that's it and i'm very clear


---------11:40----------
you know i'm not telling anybody they're


---------11:42----------
gonna get rich or i'm not trying to tell


---------11:43----------
them


---------11:44----------
you know follow me and you'll have a


---------11:45----------
yacht i'm very clear um


---------11:47----------
and we talk about a lot of stuff but for


---------11:49----------
some reason


---------11:50----------
i feel like even though it's not my


---------11:53----------
fault


---------11:54----------
you know i sometimes get a little bit of


---------11:56----------
that guilt of


---------11:59----------
you know they lost money because they


---------12:01----------
invested or


---------12:02----------
they invested and they've lost money in


---------12:03----------
the short term


---------12:05----------
you know i can't time it perfectly i


---------12:07----------
just want to get them interested


---------12:09----------
do people blame you


---------12:12----------
not anymore i think people understand


---------12:15----------
more but


---------12:16----------
it's not so much that they blame me i


---------12:17----------
mean they blame me as a meme


---------12:19----------
but um i think i put it on myself more


---------12:23----------
than they put it on me


---------12:25----------
yeah so let me ask you how how much


---------12:32----------
how much does that bot does that guilt


---------12:34----------
sort of bother you


---------12:37----------
like how inconvenient is it because i'm


---------12:40----------
i'm hearing very clearly that like in


---------12:42----------
your head


---------12:42----------
i i think you're doing all the right


---------12:44----------
stuff and you've really thought this


---------12:46----------
you thought the ethics of it kind of


---------12:48----------
threw pretty heavily is what i'm i'm


---------12:50----------
getting from you


---------12:52----------
um is that the sec


---------12:58----------
no um uh so so i'm sort of getting the


---------13:02----------
sense that that you really


---------13:03----------
you know have thought through not taking


---------13:05----------
advantage of people


---------13:06----------
not promising any yachts and things like


---------13:09----------
that you know


---------13:09----------
teaching basic financial literacy being


---------13:12----------
open with the fact that


---------13:13----------
ninety percent of your investments are


---------13:15----------
in like long term not unexciting stuff


---------13:18----------
and that ten percent is kind of what you


---------13:19----------
play around with


---------13:21----------
and so i i'm i'm hearing that you've


---------13:23----------
been very very judicious with that


---------13:25----------
and i'm still kind of curious from like


---------13:27----------
a personal standpoint


---------13:29----------
how much does it bother you to have


---------13:31----------
these feelings of guilt


---------13:34----------
i mean my wife has to tell me all the


---------13:36----------
time she's like you literally tell these


---------13:38----------
people


---------13:40----------
everything but like you put it not even


---------13:41----------
a disclaimer you just tell these guys


---------13:42----------
hey listen this is this this this this


---------13:44----------
don't do don't do anything don't chase


---------13:45----------
it you're not gonna get rich


---------13:46----------
there's a difference between making


---------13:47----------
money and building wealth there's you go


---------13:49----------
through this


---------13:50----------
but newer people see the excitement they


---------13:53----------
see the money you make real quick when


---------13:55----------
you make a big share trade or when


---------13:56----------
something like that


---------13:57----------
they see all this and they want to get


---------13:59----------
in on it too and and they fomo


---------14:01----------
in and then they lose money and it's


---------14:02----------
like if you didn't have this this this


---------14:04----------
or you didn't have the gains channel


---------14:05----------
like in my discord have a gains channel


---------14:07----------
and people post their gains right they


---------14:08----------
never post their losses but they post


---------14:10----------
their gains sometimes they're up


---------14:12----------
7 000 in a week or like a thousand you


---------14:14----------
know percent a day


---------14:16----------
and it's like they go in there and they


---------14:17----------
see that and people like oh i can do


---------14:18----------
that too


---------14:19----------
and it's like you know i know that


---------14:21----------
that's just what people are doing


---------14:22----------
they're showing their stuff but at the


---------14:23----------
end of the day like


---------14:24----------
i don't know there's a small part of me


---------14:27----------
sometimes bigger than i think


---------14:28----------
that just i i don't want to see people


---------14:31----------
get hurt


---------14:32----------
i really don't want to see people get


---------14:33----------
hurt why do you say bigger than you


---------14:35----------
think


---------14:37----------
because i know that i it's not my fault


---------14:41----------
and that i've done


---------14:41----------
everything in my power to make it very


---------14:43----------
clear but


---------14:45----------
these people started doing this because


---------14:47----------
of me


---------14:49----------
and so a small part of me is like hey


---------14:52----------
you know i stopped doing options on


---------14:54----------
stream i i mean i still do a few here


---------14:56----------
but i used to do mostly options on


---------14:57----------
stream because it's exciting it's fun


---------14:59----------
it's content lots of money to be made or


---------15:00----------
lost quickly


---------15:01----------
but then i started noticing lots of


---------15:03----------
people that were new we're like oh i can


---------15:04----------
do that too i'm just going to copy


---------15:05----------
everything he does or everything


---------15:06----------
everybody else is doing


---------15:07----------
and they lose everything so i was like i


---------15:09----------
have more responsibility with a bigger


---------15:10----------
platform now


---------15:12----------
let me kind of bring it back to a little


---------15:14----------
bit more responsible


---------15:15----------
and still make content out of it okay


---------15:18----------
yeah and and so


---------15:22----------
i'm still i'm still feeling like i i


---------15:25----------
didn't get a clear answer to my question


---------15:27----------
how much does the guilt bother you


---------15:33----------
i mean like if i could take a a magic


---------15:36----------
wand and and wave it away


---------15:39----------
how appealing would that be


---------15:43----------
i mean it's not the biggest issue in my


---------15:46----------
life it's not


---------15:46----------
it's not it's not it's not like in the


---------15:48----------
top five issues in my life


---------15:51----------
but i think about it i spend all my time


---------15:54----------
outside stream that i'm not doing with


---------15:55----------
family dealing with the business and


---------15:58----------
with the stream and with the community


---------15:59----------
and stuff like that so


---------16:00----------
it does it does affect me but it's not


---------16:02----------
like you know i'm i'm i'm not able to


---------16:04----------
eat dinner because of it yep


---------16:06----------
yeah yeah so so well said so i i'm not


---------16:08----------
getting the sense that it is a big issue


---------16:12----------
so i guess um tsg what i'm kind of


---------16:15----------
digging for is essentially like a topic


---------16:17----------
for us to dive into because in my


---------16:19----------
experience the most useful thing is to


---------16:22----------
like


---------16:22----------
pick one thing and explore it thoroughly


---------16:25----------
right


---------16:26----------
and so by doing that we sort of


---------16:27----------
understand the nuance i think a big part


---------16:29----------
of your stream is like


---------16:31----------
helping people understand that it's not


---------16:32----------
simple


---------16:34----------
right yeah and helping people just get


---------16:37----------
to a better life because i come from


---------16:38----------
such poverty and such [ __ ] life


---------16:41----------
that you know this is something i'm


---------16:42----------
passionate about this is something i


---------16:43----------
love


---------16:44----------
and i want to share with people and the


---------16:46----------
fact that these guys are


---------16:47----------
so much positivity is coming out of it


---------16:49----------
just gives me this purpose of like


---------16:51----------
[ __ ] yeah i love this this is addicting


---------16:53----------
you know


---------16:54----------
yeah so can you tell us a little bit


---------16:56----------
about where you come from


---------16:58----------
uh sure so um basic tldr


---------17:01----------
uh both my parents were were drug


---------17:03----------
addicts uh my mom was a stripper


---------17:06----------
um they uh they moved to hawaii i was


---------17:08----------
born there


---------17:09----------
um they divorced shortly after i stayed


---------17:12----------
with my mom


---------17:14----------
mom was not right in in a lot of ways um


---------17:16----------
dealt with a lot of problems


---------17:18----------
uh lived in a shack in the on a mountain


---------17:20----------
side in


---------17:21----------
hawaii uh no electricity no running


---------17:23----------
water um


---------17:25----------
basically rain water with a fire for


---------17:26----------
showers in an outhouse and just running


---------17:28----------
around barefoot


---------17:30----------
um kind of went to school had a lot of


---------17:31----------
medical issues as a kid because of the


---------17:33----------
unsanitary conditions


---------17:35----------
um slept back and forth between her and


---------17:37----------
other other people


---------17:39----------
uh was taken out of the home my home


---------17:40----------
several times by the state


---------17:42----------
always returned um very very


---------17:46----------
um very bad abuse um in a lot of ways


---------17:49----------
there um


---------17:50----------
you know eating out of dumpsters because


---------17:52----------
she was trading you know


---------17:53----------
um food stamps for drugs and stuff like


---------17:56----------
that so it was really rough


---------17:58----------
i went back and forth between my dad on


---------18:00----------
the mainland panhandling for money with


---------18:02----------
him


---------18:03----------
so they could buy more drugs it was just


---------18:04----------
a really [ __ ] situation


---------18:06----------
um then when i was 10 taken out


---------18:09----------
brought to the mainland put in a


---------18:11----------
children's home um


---------18:12----------
was there by myself until i uh i


---------18:15----------
graduated high school


---------18:16----------
um went into the military was the only


---------18:19----------
opportunity i had because i was


---------18:20----------
i had a hard time in school uh went uh


---------18:23----------
went to war


---------18:24----------
came back uh did katrina recovery came


---------18:26----------
out


---------18:27----------
um didn't really have qualifications did


---------18:29----------
some jobs got into transit officer


---------18:31----------
did some other things got into hotels


---------18:33----------
eventually


---------18:34----------
playing poker learned how to gamble


---------18:37----------
which got me into the stock market which


---------18:38----------
got me into penny stocks which was


---------18:39----------
stupid blew up all my accounts


---------18:42----------
um then ended up learning about actual


---------18:44----------
stocks and actual investing and trading


---------18:46----------
and


---------18:47----------
that grew a passion learned about


---------18:49----------
economics and finance


---------18:50----------
and grew a huge passion started getting


---------18:52----------
good at trading and investing started


---------18:54----------
making good money off of it uh really


---------18:56----------
good money off of it


---------18:57----------
um then i had a really bad year lost my


---------18:59----------
uh my mother my father my brother and


---------19:02----------
another family member in one year but


---------19:04----------
before that they were sick so a lot of


---------19:05----------
money went to helping


---------19:07----------
um so i had to decide do i go back to


---------19:08----------
work and go back to trading so i did


---------19:10----------
both


---------19:11----------
and then um started streaming just for


---------19:14----------
fun because i was tired of


---------19:15----------
going online looking for community uh to


---------19:18----------
trade stocks


---------19:18----------
and talk stocks but everything was


---------19:20----------
either pump and dump or a scam or


---------19:21----------
selling courses or just idiots so i was


---------19:24----------
like let me create my own


---------19:25----------
started out with the fun djen stuff


---------19:27----------
found that people really really enjoyed


---------19:29----------
um d-gen stuff like just yoloing


---------19:32----------
like taking ten thousand dollars and


---------19:34----------
gambling it on a


---------19:36----------
wild stock you know for fun for content


---------19:38----------
um


---------19:39----------
but then i realized that people actually


---------19:41----------
wanted to learn this stuff


---------19:42----------
and i was able to teach it in a manner


---------19:44----------
that people understood it


---------19:46----------
and it just kind of grew from there and


---------19:48----------
now here we are


---------19:54----------
that's quite the story yeah i left a lot


---------19:56----------
out because i don't want to drag it out


---------19:58----------
but yeah


---------20:01----------
that's horrifying


---------20:04----------
oh i got married had a kid too yeah i


---------20:07----------
think we figured that part out


---------20:09----------
yeah yeah um but you know if you left a


---------20:12----------
lot out


---------20:13----------
i mean what what you put in didn't seem


---------20:17----------
seemed like quite the painful ride


---------20:22----------
yeah it sucked


---------20:28----------
let me think about how to ask this can i


---------20:30----------
think for a second yeah go for it go for


---------20:32----------
it


---------20:32----------
i'm usually not this open but i i mean


---------20:34----------
it my chat knows my backstory


---------20:36----------
for the most part


---------20:41----------
while you're thinking i'm gonna go turn


---------20:42----------
down the ac is that cool sure yeah go


---------20:45----------
for it


---------21:00----------
me


---------21:08----------
man i have no idea where to go from here


---------21:10----------
so much


---------21:14----------
sorry about that okay cool no that's


---------21:16----------
totally fine um so uh


---------21:18----------
tsg i find myself being incredibly


---------21:22----------
curious and fascinated about your


---------21:24----------
personal journey


---------21:26----------
um you know there's a lot of stuff in


---------21:29----------
there that sounds


---------21:30----------
absolutely like devastating to live


---------21:32----------
through


---------21:34----------
i think that there's a really


---------21:35----------
interesting like dichotomy between


---------21:38----------
the background that you share in the


---------21:40----------
person that you are today


---------21:42----------
like you seem happy to me


---------21:48----------
i mean we all have our personal


---------21:49----------
struggles um


---------21:51----------
you know stream i like what i do


---------21:54----------
and this is why i'm so passionate about


---------21:56----------
streaming because it's a moment for me


---------21:58----------
to forget


---------21:59----------
any other issue and to


---------22:02----------
to to to give other people happiness joy


---------22:05----------
or


---------22:06----------
um you know um help them


---------22:09----------
better their lives or you know i mean it


---------22:11----------
gives you that purpose like you go


---------22:13----------
through your life


---------22:14----------
never having a real purpose feeling like


---------22:16----------
you're just kind of like running a race


---------22:17----------
but you don't know where the finish line


---------22:18----------
is


---------22:20----------
and now it's like hey i found a path it


---------22:22----------
might not be the right path but


---------22:23----------
if i follow it maybe that's where the


---------22:25----------
finish line is you know i'm saying so at


---------22:26----------
least i'm


---------22:27----------
it's kind of given me that purpose and i


---------22:29----------
and i'm really passionate about it yeah


---------22:31----------
yeah and i've built a great community


---------22:34----------
well i haven't built it they've built it


---------22:35----------
but it's an amazing community


---------22:39----------
okay so i'm gonna


---------22:42----------
say this again so you seem happy


---------22:48----------
i mean i try to be i try to be i i've


---------22:52----------
got my own demons i deal with you know i


---------22:54----------
mean


---------22:55----------
and and i tell these guys all the time


---------22:56----------
you know everything you see stuff online


---------22:58----------
it's usually


---------22:59----------
a highlight reel right people put up


---------23:00----------
their highlight reels everybody i had a


---------23:01----------
conversation about this today


---------23:03----------
you know everybody sees the highlight


---------23:04----------
reel so yeah i mean i i struggle with


---------23:07----------
certain things but


---------23:08----------
um i think that um i'm in a better place


---------23:11----------
now than i have been in other times in


---------23:13----------
my life


---------23:15----------
so i want to highlight a couple of


---------23:16----------
things so one is that


---------23:19----------
you know the relationship i want to be


---------23:21----------
like a little bit precise with our


---------23:22----------
language


---------23:23----------
so one is that you know it sounds to me


---------23:25----------
like


---------23:26----------
you have your struggles you have your


---------23:28----------
demons that you fight


---------23:30----------
but that really having purpose is what


---------23:33----------
allows you to have the strength to deal


---------23:36----------
with those struggles


---------23:37----------
what would you say to that i'd say it's


---------23:40----------
more of a distraction


---------23:42----------
interesting can you say more about that


---------23:46----------
oh we're gonna get deep here okay um i


---------23:49----------
don't usually talk about my stuff but


---------23:51----------
i'll i'll do it sorry because it's


---------23:52----------
just pausing for a second so we're


---------23:55----------
hitting the border of my guilt okay


---------23:58----------
so we're here to learn about you and to


---------24:01----------
try to help you but also


---------24:02----------
i don't want you to say anything that


---------24:04----------
you don't feel comfortable saying


---------24:06----------
oh no no i'm not going to push into that


---------24:07----------
i'm just i'm just i'm just i mean


---------24:09----------
for the for for the purpose of this you


---------24:11----------
know it's good because i'm a very big


---------24:13----------
um advocate of of seeking or talking


---------24:16----------
about things and not bottling them up


---------24:18----------
obviously though i'm on a platform where


---------24:19----------
there's a lot of people so i have to be


---------24:20----------
careful


---------24:21----------
um but um what i mean by distraction so


---------24:24----------
i think that


---------24:25----------
and i say this a lot i feel like a lot


---------24:27----------
of the funniest people do it because


---------24:28----------
they're hiding pain


---------24:30----------
um and it's it's a way of of of of


---------24:33----------
dealing with that right so for me um


---------24:36----------
i think it's a distraction because not


---------24:38----------
only does it give me a purpose but when


---------24:39----------
i'm doing this


---------24:40----------
i'm not focusing on the other stuff this


---------24:43----------
is my focus


---------24:45----------
and so the other issues of not sleeping


---------24:47----------
a lot or having you know physical pains


---------24:49----------
or


---------24:50----------
you know potential mood swings or


---------24:54----------
anxiety or depression or whatever else


---------24:55----------
you deal with


---------24:56----------
this right here is you're on stage


---------24:59----------
there's the lights


---------25:00----------
you know that's it you know the crowd is


---------25:02----------
darkened it's you


---------25:03----------
and you're focusing on what you do and


---------25:05----------
you know that there's good feedback


---------25:06----------
you're doing a good thing


---------25:08----------
it's a great distraction it doesn't take


---------25:11----------
away but it does a good job of


---------25:12----------
distracting it's kind of like when you


---------25:14----------
deal with


---------25:14----------
horrible trauma whether it's in as a


---------25:16----------
childhood or in war


---------25:18----------
your brain sometimes compartmentalizes


---------25:20----------
that


---------25:22----------
and and and you'll block out certain


---------25:24----------
things that you would normally remember


---------25:26----------
your brain does that or


---------25:27----------
it'll compartmentalize it and let it


---------25:30----------
surface when you're sleeping and you


---------25:31----------
have night terrors or whatever


---------25:33----------
so i think that this is it it helps with


---------25:35----------
what issues i do face with i think it's


---------25:37----------
a great distraction


---------25:38----------
um not a cure but a distraction


---------25:42----------
and what about the cure


---------25:47----------
um i'm not a doctor so i mean i'm not


---------25:50----------
going to say that there is no cure for


---------25:51----------
these things i mean i'm sure that


---------25:53----------
therapy helps i'm sure that uh oh [ __ ]


---------25:56----------
tesla thank you


---------25:57----------
um i'm sure that medication stuff like


---------26:00----------
that you know which i've i've i've


---------26:01----------
talked and i've gotten some issues


---------26:03----------
or help with the issues i've had um and


---------26:05----------
i'm and you know


---------26:06----------
um but at this point i'm at that age


---------26:08----------
where it's like


---------26:10----------
you know i'm not cynical or apathetic to


---------26:13----------
the idea of curing it but i've just kind


---------26:15----------
of


---------26:16----------
dealt with it so long i'm just kind of


---------26:17----------
used to it


---------26:22----------
i think that makes a lot of sense let me


---------26:24----------
just


---------26:27----------
let me just repeat back what i heard so


---------26:30----------
as you said


---------26:32----------
i'm not a doctor so i can't say that


---------26:34----------
there's no cure


---------26:36----------
but basically there's no cure


---------26:39----------
that's why no no no no i believe that


---------26:42----------
there


---------26:42----------
there definitely is something out there


---------26:45----------
or there are


---------26:46----------
opportunities but for me i'm just like


---------26:49----------
why do what why do you believe that


---------26:53----------
well because i've been able to


---------26:56----------
get certain things that have helped me


---------26:58----------
move away from certain things


---------27:01----------
but at the same time i'm not one of


---------27:03----------
those guys who i'm a veteran


---------27:05----------
i've dealt with other veterans and i've


---------27:07----------
seen veterans dealing with stuff and the


---------27:08----------
cure was


---------27:09----------
them medicating them until they're a


---------27:10----------
zombie i can't live that kind of life i


---------27:12----------
would rather


---------27:13----------
live who i am in pain than live as a


---------27:16----------
zombie but not deal with


---------27:18----------
certain issues not that i'm against


---------27:21----------
medication i'm just saying i saw that


---------27:23----------
now


---------27:23----------
that doesn't sound like so as a


---------27:25----------
psychiatrist and a medical doctor


---------27:28----------
medicating someone to the point of being


---------27:30----------
a zombie is not what i would consider a


---------27:32----------
cure


---------27:32----------
i would consider that a bad thing as


---------27:34----------
someone who prescribes medication


---------27:36----------
for people to help with their mental


---------27:38----------
health i mean that's not a cure dude


---------27:41----------
that's


---------27:41----------
everything that is wrong with our mental


---------27:43----------
health system


---------27:45----------
is that we sometimes all we do is


---------27:48----------
medicate people until they're zombies


---------27:50----------
um but this is where i'm beginning to


---------27:53----------
think that maybe this conversation is


---------27:55----------
going to be far more important than i


---------27:56----------
thought at the beginning


---------27:59----------
because i i i'm beginning to think


---------28:02----------
that um


---------28:06----------
i'm beginning to think that you don't


---------28:08----------
have to live the way that you do


---------28:11----------
and i think that it's reasonable that


---------28:13----------
you live the way that you do because


---------28:15----------
that's all you've learned like you said


---------28:16----------
i think your your brain learned how to


---------28:18----------
compartmentalize


---------28:19----------
at a very very early age and so what i'm


---------28:22----------
hearing you kind of say is that like


---------28:24----------
this is a distraction


---------28:26----------
but like when the distraction ends


---------28:29----------
you're back to kind of where you were


---------28:31----------
and that your life is sort of filled


---------28:32----------
with these compartments of


---------28:34----------
of suffering basically and and that


---------28:37----------
you've learned how to adapt and live and


---------28:39----------
thrive


---------28:40----------
in spite of all of the things that you


---------28:42----------
have to deal with like you've learned


---------28:43----------
how to cope


---------28:44----------
right and successfully so what do you


---------28:47----------
think about that


---------28:50----------
i think there's i think um sorry i'm out


---------28:53----------
of my element here because normally i'm


---------28:54----------
meaning in chat and talking about this


---------28:56----------
and these guys have never seen me like


---------28:58----------
this i know but these guys have never


---------29:00----------
seen me get this kind of deep with it


---------29:01----------
and


---------29:02----------
it's a little bit out of character and


---------29:03----------
normally we're talking about the market


---------29:05----------
and all this stuff right now but so


---------29:06----------
i'm a little out of my element here so


---------29:08----------
and i'm in front of you know


---------29:10----------
several thousand people so it's uh it's


---------29:11----------
a little bit uh it's a new experience


---------29:13----------
for me so


---------29:14----------
forgive me if i have any trepidations or


---------29:16----------
any kind of like you know um


---------29:17----------
hesitations but um


---------29:22----------
yeah i mean i i it's not so much an idea


---------29:25----------
of just deal with it it's just


---------29:27----------
it's just like for example i had a birth


---------29:29----------
i have a birthmark right i have a


---------29:30----------
birthmark that covers


---------29:32----------
the front half of my chest my arm and


---------29:33----------
half my back right


---------29:35----------
as a child i was very conscious of it i


---------29:37----------
was very self-conscious of it i'd wear a


---------29:39----------
shirt in the pool


---------29:40----------
and i would worry about people staring


---------29:42----------
and stuff like that but as time went on


---------29:44----------
and i got older


---------29:45----------
i forgot i even had it yeah it's still


---------29:47----------
there sure every now and then i'll see


---------29:48----------
it in the mirror and i'll remember it's


---------29:50----------
a thing but i'm not conscious of it


---------29:51----------
anymore i'm not worried about it anymore


---------29:53----------
it's just part of who i am and that's


---------29:55----------
kind of with those issues it's just


---------29:56----------
become part of who i am and it's just


---------29:58----------
normalized for me


---------30:01----------
yeah so i understand that it's


---------30:02----------
normalized so i think um


---------30:05----------
okay can i think for a second please


---------30:10----------
so first thing i want to talk about is


---------30:12----------
trepidation you don't


---------30:14----------
need our forgiveness for your hesitation


---------30:16----------
or trepidation


---------30:18----------
the first thing that we have to


---------30:19----------
acknowledge is you say that i'm not used


---------30:20----------
to being like this


---------30:22----------
the first question is do you want to be


---------30:24----------
like this in this moment


---------30:26----------
or is this uncomfortable for you and you


---------30:29----------
don't want to be like this


---------30:34----------
as far as dealing with the issues that i


---------30:36----------
have the way i have this direction of


---------30:38----------
the conversation how okay with this


---------30:40----------
direction are you oh i'm fine if i'm


---------30:42----------
uncomfortable i'll let you know i mean


---------30:43----------
i'm okay right now yeah


---------30:44----------
i'm not i'm not gonna hide anything here


---------30:46----------
so so the next


---------30:47----------
question then is like okay let me give


---------30:49----------
you a let me give you an analogy okay so


---------30:52----------
uh tsg i was working with a a parent and


---------30:55----------
and she had a special needs child and so


---------30:58----------
she came to me because


---------31:00----------
um you know i'm holistic and all that


---------31:02----------
kind of stuff and


---------31:03----------
and so she had been diagnosed with


---------31:05----------
various stuff that probably wasn't very


---------31:07----------
accurate it really probably had to do


---------31:09----------
with just


---------31:10----------
the difficulties of having a special


---------31:11----------
needs child you know she had


---------31:13----------
and kind of really like when you have a


---------31:15----------
child you i'm sure you sort of


---------31:17----------
understand this a little


---------31:18----------
bit um you know you have expectations


---------31:21----------
uh of what your life is gonna be like


---------31:23----------
and and sometimes you have hopes


---------31:25----------
about what your child is you know what


---------31:27----------
your relationship with your child is


---------31:28----------
gonna be like and


---------31:29----------
and for some people they really build up


---------31:31----------
this this kind of fantasy in their mind


---------31:33----------
of like having children


---------31:35----------
and so for her there was a lot of


---------31:36----------
difficulty because like all these things


---------31:38----------
that she had kind of envisioned


---------31:39----------
doing um like you know teaching her


---------31:42----------
daughter how to dance and teaching her


---------31:44----------
daughter like passing on certain things


---------31:45----------
that she


---------31:46----------
she cared about and just really


---------31:49----------
realizing that like her daughter's never


---------31:51----------
going to be able to do like any of that


---------31:52----------
stuff


---------31:54----------
and and not only is she not going to be


---------31:56----------
able to do that stuff she's going to be


---------31:58----------
like in diapers her entire life


---------32:00----------
yeah and and so it's it's just really


---------32:02----------
challenging


---------32:03----------
and so i was having a conversation with


---------32:05----------
her and we'd worked together for a long


---------32:07----------
time and


---------32:07----------
and you know she was like i'm doing a


---------32:11----------
really good job of like


---------32:12----------
coping but it's it's hard and like every


---------32:15----------
day was about


---------32:16----------
coping coping coping coping coping and i


---------32:18----------
teach her this meditation technique i'd


---------32:20----------
teach her that meditation technique


---------32:22----------
and you know one day we kind of sat down


---------32:24----------
and i just said like this isn't gonna


---------32:25----------
work


---------32:26----------
and she was a little bit taken aback


---------32:28----------
because usually like i'm supposed to be


---------32:29----------
the hopeful one right


---------32:31----------
and and she was like what do you mean


---------32:32----------
this isn't going to work and i was like


---------32:33----------
you can't keep coping for the rest of


---------32:35----------
your life like that's just not


---------32:36----------
a that's not a life like constantly


---------32:39----------
putting out fires and constantly like


---------32:42----------
coping because you're on the verge of


---------32:44----------
breakdown and meditating your way


---------32:46----------
through your anxiety is like that's just


---------32:48----------
not


---------32:49----------
it's not gonna work right you can only


---------32:52----------
cope so much at some point


---------32:54----------
you need to like have relief or


---------32:57----------
like this problem needs to like resolve


---------32:59----------
itself in some way right like you can't


---------33:02----------
you know it's kind of like if your boat


---------33:04----------
is sinking and you're bailing water like


---------33:06----------
you can't


---------33:07----------
sustainably bail water like sure it


---------33:08----------
works in the moment


---------33:10----------
but at some point you got to like plug


---------33:12----------
the holes does that make sense


---------33:14----------
no it makes sense for sure i mean i i'm


---------33:17----------
on board with you there i


---------33:18----------
i mean for me i just i don't know if


---------33:21----------
it's so much


---------33:23----------
i mean i've i've always been this person


---------33:25----------
where like i said


---------33:26----------
um i've had a hard time even building


---------33:30----------
relationships right like i i the reason


---------33:31----------
is is because


---------33:33----------
you know and i don't mean that this is


---------33:34----------
gonna sound so sappy but i'm just gonna


---------33:37----------
say it because it'll move the


---------33:38----------
conversation in the right direction


---------33:40----------
you know i didn't hear the word i love


---------33:41----------
you until i was


---------33:43----------
20. you know mom never


---------33:46----------
dad never never a hug never uh never uh


---------33:49----------
never uh


---------33:50----------
never uh uh how was your day never any


---------33:52----------
of that right


---------33:53----------
so when i was a small child i didn't


---------33:56----------
build that understanding of


---------33:57----------
relationships


---------33:58----------
of longing of of missing of feeling you


---------34:01----------
know wanted and accepted


---------34:03----------
so for me i've always struggled with


---------34:06----------
even


---------34:07----------
i mean i have to rem i have to be


---------34:08----------
reminded to call a family member after


---------34:10----------
three or four weeks just because it's


---------34:11----------
just it doesn't it doesn't register


---------34:14----------
my you know my my friends or my family


---------34:16----------
leave i don't miss people


---------34:17----------
i don't get butterflies in my stomach


---------34:20----------
you know what i'm saying so like


---------34:21----------
for me it's always i've always lived in


---------34:23----------
this instant gratification um


---------34:26----------
lifestyle and it led to a lot of


---------34:27----------
destructive behaviors when i was younger


---------34:29----------
and so that's something that i've dealt


---------34:31----------
with and so when i look at something


---------34:33----------
like that


---------34:34----------
it it makes it more difficult you know


---------34:36----------
to look down the down the path and say


---------34:38----------
hey


---------34:38----------
you know i look forward to having a wife


---------34:40----------
and kids and grandkids in a little


---------34:42----------
cottage


---------34:43----------
for me it's like i just i just see


---------34:44----------
emptiness and i don't know what's what's


---------34:45----------
up and i'm just like ah [ __ ] it you know


---------34:47----------
what i mean let's let's


---------34:48----------
just do the best we can


---------34:53----------
that sounds wonderful it sounds [ __ ]


---------34:55----------
horrible it's terrible


---------34:57----------
that's why i love streaming so much


---------34:58----------
because i just need what's


---------35:00----------
what's horrible about it because


---------35:04----------
because you get jealous looking at other


---------35:06----------
people who have like a


---------35:07----------
this is actually taking i really i'm now


---------35:09----------
i'm just ruining my whole brand because


---------35:11----------
i'm telling people always have a plan


---------35:12----------
and i have a plan i'm just saying like


---------35:14----------
it's not about not having a plan it's


---------35:16----------
about it's about that that that


---------35:18----------
building that through time i just had a


---------35:19----------
daughter so i think that a lot of that's


---------35:21----------
changing


---------35:22----------
because i'm i'm worried about her you


---------35:24----------
see what i'm saying


---------35:25----------
like it's the first time i'm worried


---------35:27----------
about somebody and so i go and i check


---------35:30----------
on her and i hear and stuff like that so


---------35:31----------
i think it's


---------35:32----------
really really um really awesome do i


---------35:34----------
have a plan yeah i have a plan but i


---------35:36----------
think that


---------35:36----------
it's just one of those things where man


---------35:38----------
i'm getting deep in front of a lot of


---------35:39----------
people but um


---------35:41----------
i think it'll help maybe help somebody


---------35:42----------
out there so i wanna i wanna be able to


---------35:43----------
say what i can


---------35:44----------
um you know i i i just it's just that


---------35:47----------
feeling of like


---------35:48----------
of like like i said the whole idea of


---------35:50----------
running the marathon or running the race


---------35:52----------
but not knowing where the finish line is


---------35:53----------
like you're just running around


---------35:55----------
looking for something you think you know


---------35:57----------
what you're looking for


---------35:59----------
but until you see it you don't know


---------36:01----------
where it is you were hoping for a path


---------36:02----------
and i'm trying to give myself that path


---------36:06----------
what's it like to not know where your


---------36:07----------
life is going


---------36:12----------
it's always been [ __ ]


---------36:15----------
but i think that through a lot of


---------36:19----------
a lot of things that have been happening


---------36:23----------
recently in my life they're starting to


---------36:26----------
they're starting to become a path i tell


---------36:29----------
these guys all the time you may be


---------36:30----------
having a really bad year


---------36:32----------
but you can't give up because you never


---------36:34----------
know 2019 right 2019


---------36:36----------
um lost my mother lost my father are you


---------36:39----------
afraid that you're not gonna


---------36:41----------
be able to walk that path even if you


---------36:45----------
can see it


---------36:50----------
can you can you mean like not walk the


---------36:52----------
path if i can i mean are you


---------36:54----------
concerned that like because you kind of


---------36:55----------
talk a little bit about other people


---------36:58----------
right so you like mentioned for a moment


---------37:00----------
so i said that sounds wonderful and you


---------37:02----------
were like


---------37:03----------
it's horrible and then you were like


---------37:05----------
kind of like other people can


---------37:07----------
see where they're going like other


---------37:08----------
people have like things that they


---------37:10----------
want and that they're looking forward to


---------37:13----------
and what i'm hearing from you


---------37:15----------
no no no i'm not i'm not trying to


---------37:16----------
compare myself to other people because i


---------37:18----------
think that comparing yourself to the


---------37:19----------
people is just a keeping up with the


---------37:21----------
joneses and you will


---------37:22----------
spend your entire life trying to have


---------37:24----------
something that not even you you just


---------37:25----------
become


---------37:26----------
the shell and you spend all your money


---------37:27----------
and time i don't mean other people as in


---------37:30----------
as in like all other people i mean like


---------37:33----------
i'll see my wife and her relationship


---------37:35----------
with her mother


---------37:36----------
they talk on the phone four five six


---------37:38----------
hours a day they laugh they talk they


---------37:40----------
they look forward to it every single day


---------37:43----------
i feel like it's a burden no because i


---------37:45----------
like i gotta


---------37:46----------
i gotta remind myself to call people and


---------37:48----------
then as soon as i'm on the phone i'm


---------37:49----------
like looking for an exit


---------37:53----------
and what's it like to be like that


---------37:58----------
lonely


---------38:02----------
frustrating what's frustrating about it


---------38:07----------
well because it's like when you don't


---------38:08----------
want to be in a certain position or


---------38:10----------
certain situation


---------38:12----------
but yet you're there it's frustrating


---------38:14----------
it's like being in traffic right like


---------38:16----------
you want to get to your location you


---------38:18----------
want to go there but you're stuck in


---------38:19----------
traffic


---------38:20----------
and it's the same kind of thing it's


---------38:21----------
like other people in the other lanes are


---------38:23----------
going by


---------38:24----------
and you're just sitting there and you're


---------38:25----------
like what the [ __ ] you know and so


---------38:27----------
that's kind of the analogy i would use


---------38:29----------
yeah that's a beautiful analogy so so


---------38:32----------
where is it that you're stuck what is it


---------38:34----------
that like when you look over to the


---------38:36----------
other lane and you see other people


---------38:37----------
going by what is it that you wish


---------38:39----------
you had that other people seem to have


---------38:42----------
that you seem to not have i don't want


---------38:44----------
what other people have


---------38:46----------
what i just i just i'm just hoping


---------38:49----------
and this is it's starting to happen with


---------38:51----------
the stream and the purpose and the


---------38:52----------
family


---------38:53----------
frustrating because it's so much work


---------38:54----------
but it's i'm a workaholic my wife will


---------38:56----------
tell you i never stop working


---------38:58----------
24 7. anything i do i i just work work


---------39:02----------
work until i get to the top of it


---------39:03----------
whether it was working in


---------39:04----------
you know as an officer working in hotels


---------39:07----------
even streaming she made a joke about it


---------39:08----------
she goes


---------39:09----------
when you started streaming i i didn't


---------39:11----------
realize you know whatever and then you


---------39:12----------
know


---------39:13----------
through a lot of circumstances here we


---------39:14----------
are it's because i don't stop working


---------39:17----------
because


---------39:17----------
i need to be busy and the reason i need


---------39:20----------
to be busy is because if i have idle


---------39:22----------
hands i do destructive things because


---------39:24----------
i'm bored or because i'm just


---------39:26----------
you know i i i need something so i'm


---------39:30----------
always busy


---------39:32----------
so i'm i'm getting a little bit of um


---------39:36----------
dissonance a little bit of cognitive


---------39:38----------
dissonance from you


---------39:40----------
so and let me just lay this out i know


---------39:42----------
it's going to sound [ __ ] weird


---------39:44----------
so you do this beautiful job of talking


---------39:46----------
about an analogy


---------39:48----------
where you're in one lane and you see the


---------39:50----------
other people going by


---------39:52----------
and then when i ask you


---------39:55----------
you know what is it about like you're


---------39:57----------
stuck in traffic and other people are


---------39:59----------
driving freely like


---------40:00----------
help me understand what it is about


---------40:03----------
other people that


---------40:05----------
you know you want and then you've said


---------40:07----------
this twice now where you're like oh i


---------40:09----------
try not to compare


---------40:10----------
myself to other people which i think


---------40:11----------
totally makes sense i'm completely


---------40:12----------
behind


---------40:13----------
what you're saying that it leads to


---------40:15----------
keeping up with the joneses and egos and


---------40:17----------
comparisons and things like that


---------40:19----------
and at the same time i think like so


---------40:21----------
there's one part of your mind that's


---------40:22----------
sort of like i don't compare myself to


---------40:23----------
anyone else i am who i am


---------40:25----------
this is me i have a unique situation


---------40:27----------
totally behind you with you 100


---------40:30----------
and yet there's still this part of you


---------40:31----------
that's sort of like drawing these


---------40:32----------
analogies about like


---------40:34----------
you know you make comparisons because


---------40:36----------
you talk about how your wife


---------40:39----------
talks to her mom for like four hours a


---------40:40----------
day and when you talk to someone on the


---------40:42----------
phone you can't wait to get off the


---------40:44----------
phone


---------40:45----------
so it's sort of weird because like i'm


---------40:47----------
seeing and hearing comparisons but when


---------40:49----------
i


---------40:50----------
when i try to dig into them with you i


---------40:52----------
kind of get


---------40:53----------
blocked


---------40:56----------
does that make sense yeah i i think i'm


---------40:59----------
just i'm just not


---------41:00----------
really good at explaining it because i'm


---------41:02----------
not really used to talking about this


---------41:03----------
stuff


---------41:04----------
um i'm kind of doing it very ambiguously


---------41:07----------
i think not on purpose but i think it's


---------41:09----------
just


---------41:09----------
it's just me trying to put my thoughts


---------41:11----------
together and it's just not coming out


---------41:12----------
clearly


---------41:13----------
so uh that's exactly why we're here


---------41:20----------
i'm sorry one second


---------41:23----------
okay um we work in the ambiguous


---------41:26----------
territory that's where we want yeah


---------41:28----------
absolutely


---------41:28----------
absolutely um no i mean uh you know


---------41:32----------
i think i think back to what i was


---------41:34----------
saying about relationships i think that


---------41:36----------
um i think i want to know what it's like


---------41:40----------
to have those feelings


---------41:42----------
the feeling of longing for someone the


---------41:44----------
feeling of like that love that warm you


---------41:46----------
know


---------41:46----------
you know i'm saying like missing


---------41:47----------
somebody looking forward to seeing


---------41:49----------
somebody


---------41:50----------
and not the idea of oh god i gotta go do


---------41:53----------
this or i gotta do this or you know


---------41:55----------
um oh i gotta you know whatever or


---------41:56----------
whatever i'll do it another time i think


---------41:58----------
that's something that would be


---------42:00----------
is very very uh it's something that i


---------42:02----------
always look at and say you know what


---------42:04----------
i wish i had that it's not that i'm


---------42:05----------
jealous of other people that are having


---------42:07----------
it


---------42:07----------
i just kind of wish i had it in in my


---------42:09----------
own way you know what i mean like i'm


---------42:11----------
not mad at somebody else for having like


---------42:13----------
i'm super happy that my wife


---------42:14----------
has a great relationship with her mother


---------42:16----------
i just like i wonder what that's like


---------42:19----------
and it seems like it's a nice thing yeah


---------42:23----------
so tell me when you're on the phone with


---------42:25----------
someone how do you feel


---------42:31----------
it depends on why i'm on the phone with


---------42:32----------
them


---------42:34----------
that's a good answer so so so let's say


---------42:38----------
like a family member


---------42:40----------
i don't have much family left but like


---------42:42----------
if it's my if it's my grandfather


---------42:44----------
you know i want to check in to make sure


---------42:46----------
he's okay you know he's older


---------42:48----------
um and then sometimes we share stories


---------42:52----------
which are fun but then it's like okay


---------42:53----------
cool


---------42:54----------
you know talk to you later talk to you


---------42:55----------
later if it's uh


---------42:58----------
do you feel satisfied by that


---------42:59----------
interaction


---------43:05----------
i guess to be a level of satisfaction am


---------43:07----------
i satisfied that he's doing better am i


---------43:08----------
satisfied that we had a talk


---------43:12----------
either which one are you satisfied by


---------43:14----------
i'm obviously satisfied that he's he's


---------43:15----------
doing well because he's older and i


---------43:17----------
don't want anything to happen to him but


---------43:19----------
you know um you know i've had a lot of


---------43:21----------
family members


---------43:22----------
that i lost and some of it i didn't feel


---------43:24----------
anything


---------43:26----------
you know what i mean it's like what do


---------43:28----------
you think about that


---------43:30----------
i think it goes back to the whole idea


---------43:31----------
of not having that connection


---------43:33----------
you know it's like it's like when you


---------43:35----------
lose somebody that you have that


---------43:36----------
connection to


---------43:38----------
there's much more you know pain and


---------43:40----------
sorrow and emotional


---------43:42----------
you know draining but when you


---------43:46----------
lose somebody who like for example if


---------43:48----------
you lost the if


---------43:49----------
you if your best friend you grew up and


---------43:50----------
played football with in high school you


---------43:52----------
found out died in a car accident that's


---------43:53----------
going to hit you


---------43:54----------
but a dude who was you're in band camp


---------43:56----------
with that you guys played on the same


---------43:57----------
line


---------43:57----------
you knew him but you know you're like


---------44:00----------
that sucks


---------44:01----------
you know whatever but it's not going to


---------44:03----------
affect your day-to-day life yeah


---------44:08----------
make a lot of analogy so you'll have to


---------44:09----------
forgive me i'm a very visual learner


---------44:11----------
so i always use analogies so that i can


---------44:13----------
see what i'm talking about


---------44:15----------
love it bro i think it's it's a great


---------44:16----------
way to explain


---------44:19----------
we'll get to that too about why you do


---------44:22----------
that


---------44:25----------
um and and so let me ask you something


---------44:27----------
tsg are you do you feel lonely


---------44:34----------
um ah wow


---------44:37----------
um i mean


---------44:42----------
oh god oh that's a hard one to answer


---------44:46----------
do i feel lonely i mean you know


---------44:50----------
[ __ ] uh


---------44:59----------
i don't even know how to answer that


---------45:00----------
it's not a simple yes or no


---------45:04----------
that means that it's the right question


---------45:07----------
oh [ __ ] right so this is this is the


---------45:10----------
barrier of our understanding


---------45:12----------
and it's complicated right and so when i


---------45:14----------
talk about


---------45:15----------
cure cure isn't really the right word


---------45:18----------
but when i talk about resolution so here


---------45:20----------
let me explain for a second okay


---------45:23----------
so i may do a lot of explaining today so


---------45:28----------
let me start by saying that tsg i think


---------45:31----------
you're an awesome


---------45:32----------
guy dude like it's amazing


---------45:35----------
what you've built out of the life that


---------45:38----------
you were given


---------45:38----------
like i'm truly truly impressed um


---------45:43----------
and i think unfortunately like as you've


---------45:46----------
astutely


---------45:47----------
realized you sort of like weren't


---------45:50----------
given some of the basic rule book like


---------45:53----------
growing up


---------45:54----------
right like you said like you weren't


---------45:56----------
told like you don't know what it's like


---------45:58----------
to miss someone or love someone or or


---------46:00----------
whatever


---------46:01----------
i mean you're learning now um and and


---------46:04----------
you know you put your mind to it which


---------46:05----------
is also fantastic


---------46:06----------
but like there are a lot of things that


---------46:08----------
people take for granted which like you


---------46:10----------
haven't been able to take for granted


---------46:12----------
like missing people and so


---------46:17----------
i think when we talk about it not


---------46:19----------
necessarily cure but like what


---------46:20----------
i would call it resolution or


---------46:22----------
integration so this is the other thing


---------46:24----------
is that you've learned how to


---------46:25----------
compartmentalize stuff


---------46:26----------
and so you're kind of a workaholic


---------46:28----------
because like work is your distraction


---------46:30----------
and like what does it distract you from


---------46:33----------
the personal struggles whatever they may


---------46:35----------
be


---------46:36----------
and this is where like when we think a


---------46:37----------
little bit about work-life balance and


---------46:39----------
things like that when we think a little


---------46:40----------
bit about you know what the next decade


---------46:42----------
of your life is going to be like


---------46:44----------
and and what your daughter


---------46:47----------
kid is is going to you know learn from


---------46:50----------
you like what is she going to learn from


---------46:51----------
you about work


---------46:52----------
and and things like that and and how are


---------46:54----------
you going to sort of balance that


---------46:55----------
i think it's worthwhile to think a


---------46:57----------
little bit about you know do you


---------46:58----------
distract yourself


---------47:00----------
so much because the things aren't


---------47:01----------
resolved


---------47:03----------
and in order to resolve those things i


---------47:05----------
think they can be resolved i don't think


---------47:06----------
you have to distract yourself so much


---------47:10----------
what are those things are these like


---------47:12----------
issues of you know loneliness


---------47:14----------
where you know that's just one word but


---------47:16----------
it means so much more


---------47:18----------
it's not just lonely because like you


---------47:20----------
know your family's around


---------47:22----------
and you like you have the community and


---------47:24----------
there are all these things that you have


---------47:26----------
that should be an antidote to loneliness


---------47:29----------
and what i'm hearing from you is that


---------47:30----------
despite you having a lot of stuff


---------47:32----------
that makes it so that you're not


---------47:35----------
shouldn't be lonely


---------47:36----------
and on a day-to-day basis i would even


---------47:38----------
say that like you know you don't really


---------47:39----------
feel


---------47:40----------
lonely like your wife pops in and then


---------47:44----------
you you're with your daughter and you're


---------47:45----------
doing this and you're


---------47:46----------
being a dad and you're being a husband


---------47:48----------
and you're talking to the community and


---------47:49----------
you're supporting people and like so you


---------47:50----------
have a lot of people around


---------47:52----------
and you have like important connections


---------47:53----------
with those people but i also get the


---------47:55----------
sense that you're


---------47:56----------
kind of alone that like even though


---------47:59----------
there are people around and you have


---------48:00----------
these relationships that like


---------48:02----------
there's some kind of like connection


---------48:04----------
that's missing that like you know


---------48:06----------
it's almost like there's a color that


---------48:08----------
you can't see


---------48:10----------
but you know it's there and so when you


---------48:11----------
talk to your grandfather it's like oh


---------48:13----------
i'm happy because my grandfather's doing


---------48:14----------
well but


---------48:15----------
i i feel like i should feel something


---------48:17----------
more i just don't


---------48:18----------
know because i never really have


---------48:23----------
how am i doing no i mean i think i think


---------48:26----------
you're you're on


---------48:27----------
on a decent tractor i mean yeah it's


---------48:30----------
just because like i mean


---------48:31----------
this is gonna sound horrible [ __ ]


---------48:33----------
horrible but at least it


---------48:34----------
understanding if for some reason


---------48:38----------
you know what i have is taken away from


---------48:40----------
me tomorrow


---------48:41----------
i'll be able to continue on


---------48:45----------
okay and i need to say that because i


---------48:47----------
don't want people being like a


---------48:48----------
misunderstanding from from an outside


---------48:50----------
perspective saying oh


---------48:51----------
if you if your wife and child or your


---------48:53----------
house or your job or everything went


---------48:54----------
away you'd be able to continue on


---------48:56----------
i've just been on my own my whole life i


---------48:58----------
would never want that to happen


---------49:00----------
but for the transparency conversation i


---------49:02----------
think it's


---------49:03----------
it's it's important that i say that so


---------49:05----------
people understand what we're talking


---------49:06----------
about because


---------49:08----------
that's that's some deep [ __ ] right there


---------49:09----------
yeah tsg i think we all


---------49:11----------
know that i don't think anyone who's


---------49:13----------
watched this whole conversation


---------49:14----------
is surprised to hear that and i think


---------49:17----------
what you've


---------49:18----------
learned how to do is to be alone to


---------49:20----------
exist


---------49:21----------
alone right and so i have no doubt that


---------49:25----------
that you know it would hurt and on one


---------49:28----------
level you would be devastated


---------49:30----------
but like you're an old hand at being


---------49:32----------
abandoned


---------49:34----------
yeah yeah i mean and and a lot of times


---------49:36----------
it's like


---------49:38----------
i mean veteran from the military or from


---------49:40----------
a veteran being


---------49:41----------
on your own it's a play on words both


---------49:44----------
oh okay as i say because i'm both i


---------49:45----------
didn't know if you were trying to make a


---------49:46----------
connection there or not my bad


---------49:48----------
never yeah but you were saying sorry


---------49:52----------
no i was just agreeing with you yeah for


---------49:55----------
sure yeah


---------49:56----------
so how do you what do we do about that


---------50:02----------
well i mean like i said i've i've i've


---------50:05----------
found two focus in my life that i'm


---------50:07----------
i know it's not it's not a cure and it's


---------50:09----------
not it's it's just transferring the same


---------50:12----------
thing i did before of distracting from


---------50:15----------
uh destructive behavior which was


---------50:18----------
drinking and gambling and smoking and


---------50:20----------
doing crazy stuff


---------50:21----------
and now instead of using that as a


---------50:23----------
distraction i'm using two new things and


---------50:25----------
that's one is the stream the job the


---------50:27----------
helping people which is great feels good


---------50:29----------
and now the idea that i have a sole


---------50:31----------
purpose of two things that my daughter


---------50:33----------
never struggles the way i did


---------50:34----------
and that she can grow up to be proud of


---------50:36----------
her father that's the only two things


---------50:38----------
that are on my mind on a day-to-day


---------50:40----------
basis


---------50:41----------
is building this so that i can build a


---------50:42----------
life for her and


---------50:44----------
and making sure that i am a man that she


---------50:46----------
is proud to call her father


---------50:47----------
those are the two things i give a [ __ ]


---------50:49----------
about now what's it like to have a


---------50:51----------
father that you're not proud of


---------50:54----------
oh okay we're not doing this okay okay


---------50:57----------
um what's it like to have a father


---------50:59----------
you're not proud of


---------51:02----------
hold on when you say we're not doing


---------51:04----------
this does that mean you


---------51:06----------
you're allowed to say we're not doing


---------51:07----------
this and we're not gonna do it oh no no


---------51:09----------
no it's an expression i say


---------51:11----------
like we're like like i'm talking to me


---------51:14----------
and myself like we're not doing this


---------51:15----------
we're not gonna like


---------51:17----------
like show too many emotions here okay


---------51:19----------
not you and i are not doing this like


---------51:21----------
we like like well that sounds


---------51:22----------
schizophrenic that's not what i meant


---------51:24----------
but like


---------51:24----------
it says expression i say like we're not


---------51:26----------
doing this okay so let me let me


---------51:27----------
continue on


---------51:28----------
um uh it sounds like you learned how to


---------51:32----------
talk to yourself because you maybe


---------51:33----------
didn't have other people to talk to


---------51:35----------
no no no no no i i say it to chat all


---------51:38----------
the time and i'm like we're not doing


---------51:39----------
this like we're not gonna move this to


---------51:41----------
level but usually like


---------51:42----------
i'm not going to give you the reaction


---------51:44----------
that you want but that's not what i


---------51:45----------
meant here so just please ignore what i


---------51:46----------
said it's for


---------51:47----------
legal purposes i didn't mean like you


---------51:49----------
and i are not going to do this let's


---------51:50----------
just move on


---------51:51----------
make me sound schizo for a second not


---------51:52----------
that there's anything wrong with that um


---------51:55----------
all right uh my father so the difference


---------51:58----------
between my mother and my father is that


---------52:00----------
i didn't i didn't i knew my father loved


---------52:02----------
me i knew he loved me


---------52:05----------
he had demons inside he dealt with


---------52:07----------
opioid drug addiction his entire life up


---------52:09----------
until


---------52:10----------
he died of a fentanyl overdose a few


---------52:12----------
days a few years ago


---------52:14----------
and i saw him shell away


---------52:18----------
and despite all the pain he caused me


---------52:20----------
because of the things he did i knew that


---------52:22----------
he didn't do it out of


---------52:23----------
malice out of ill intent he was doing it


---------52:26----------
because he was a slave to the drugs and


---------52:29----------
an addiction and he had these demons


---------52:31----------
inside so i knew that he loved me


---------52:34----------
and so i loved him for that i wasn't the


---------52:36----------
best son


---------52:37----------
because obviously my own issues but


---------52:41----------
you know i i


---------52:44----------
i felt horrible and i wish i could have


---------52:47----------
done something to help him but a million


---------52:48----------
times it was


---------52:49----------
let's get into rehab let's get him clean


---------52:50----------
let's do this but it just it just


---------52:52----------
stopped and it was always


---------52:53----------
needing money or robbing and he would do


---------52:55----------
some of the dumbest stuff


---------52:56----------
like he one time asked me when i was a


---------52:58----------
transit officer


---------52:59----------
he was like this guy stole my tv can you


---------53:01----------
go in uniform with your weapon and and


---------53:03----------
knock on his door and get it back i'm


---------53:04----------
like do you realize you just asked me to


---------53:05----------
commit a felony


---------53:06----------
to get your tv back that you probably


---------53:08----------
sold for drugs like he doesn't think you


---------53:10----------
know so


---------53:11----------
that one was tough but i always loved my


---------53:13----------
father i loved my father in a way that


---------53:15----------
well you don't realize you love somebody


---------53:16----------
until they're gone sometimes but like


---------53:18----------
i i don't know if the love was there but


---------53:20----------
i didn't dislike my father my mother on


---------53:22----------
the other hand


---------53:23----------
was an evil person so two different


---------53:26----------
things


---------53:28----------
how did you know your father loved you


---------53:32----------
he never hurt me intentionally


---------53:36----------
and he would try when he was in a sober


---------53:40----------
mind


---------53:41----------
to do good things


---------53:45----------
like what you know like


---------53:49----------
say things you know like like for


---------53:51----------
example like my father would try if he


---------53:53----------
was sober to make sure that i was fed or


---------53:55----------
to make sure


---------53:56----------
that you know i was safe i guess


---------53:59----------
like i mean most of my childhood's been


---------54:01----------
blocked off so


---------54:02----------
a lot of the things i used to remember i


---------54:04----------
don't remember anymore um


---------54:06----------
but uh but yeah you know my father my


---------54:09----------
father was was not a bad person


---------54:11----------
i know that he he everything he did he


---------54:15----------
did


---------54:15----------
for the addiction


---------54:19----------
and so i can see through that as


---------54:20----------
somebody who's dealt with his own demons


---------54:22----------
and say


---------54:23----------
he hurt people not because he wanted to


---------54:26----------
but because it was just


---------54:27----------
who what what what that addiction did


---------54:30----------
and it was never a male intent and you


---------54:32----------
can tell the difference between


---------54:33----------
hurting someone physically or doing


---------54:36----------
something because you're getting your


---------54:37----------
fix


---------54:40----------
no you can i definitely can because i've


---------54:44----------
seen it i've been there you know we've


---------54:45----------
all been you know not all


---------54:47----------
yeah so what i'm hearing is that


---------54:50----------
you know i know it sounds kind of weird


---------54:51----------
because you mentioned like panhandling


---------54:53----------
and heroin use and stuff like that but


---------54:55----------
i'm i'm still getting the sense that you


---------54:56----------
could tell that your father like


---------54:58----------
cared about you like you thought


---------55:02----------
about okay you know before i get high


---------55:04----------
i'm gonna make sure like here's


---------55:06----------
here there's half a pizza in the fridge


---------55:08----------
if you eat it get hungry


---------55:10----------
and yeah i mean i didn't get to spend as


---------55:12----------
much time with my father but


---------55:13----------
um when i would see him you know there


---------55:16----------
he would he would he would come and give


---------55:18----------
me a hug and say stuff you know what i


---------55:19----------
mean like like


---------55:20----------
like later on in life


---------55:24----------
yeah um [ __ ] i don't remember a lot of


---------55:26----------
what he would say um sometimes he would


---------55:28----------
say love you bud


---------55:29----------
later on in life but i'd already been


---------55:32----------
past all that other stuff


---------55:33----------
so that was kind of important to me


---------55:35----------
because it was like hey you know he


---------55:36----------
wouldn't say that


---------55:38----------
in that moment unless he meant it you


---------55:39----------
know what i mean i may not feel it but i


---------55:41----------
i know he meant it


---------55:43----------
yeah yeah so you know just a


---------55:47----------
quick intellectual side point how do you


---------55:49----------
know he means it


---------55:53----------
because when he was high or trying to


---------55:56----------
get something from me


---------55:58----------
versus when he was just he didn't he


---------56:00----------
didn't ask for anything else


---------56:02----------
he did he didn't have any ulterior


---------56:03----------
motives it was just a goodbye hug


---------56:05----------
love you buddy there wasn't a there


---------56:07----------
wasn't a game


---------56:09----------
hey i love you can you do this for me


---------56:11----------
you know i mean there's a big difference


---------56:13----------
between that


---------56:14----------
yeah so so i think that that makes a lot


---------56:16----------
of sense and i'm going to toss something


---------56:17----------
else out


---------56:18----------
that maybe the reason another reason


---------56:20----------
that you knew he loved you is because


---------56:23----------
you did feel something that you were


---------56:25----------
unaware of


---------56:28----------
potentially just something to think


---------56:30----------
about down the road


---------56:32----------
yeah i think that that was you know one


---------56:33----------
of those things where you know


---------56:34----------
especially towards the end of his life


---------56:36----------
i felt a lot of you know i felt i i i


---------56:39----------
deal with guilt for some reason


---------56:40----------
in a lot of things um and of course when


---------56:43----------
somebody


---------56:44----------
dies you're like hey did i do enough to


---------56:45----------
try and save him did i


---------56:47----------
was i good enough to him in his final


---------56:48----------
moments to remember i mean i remember


---------56:50----------
he stayed alive i don't know i don't


---------56:52----------
know if he took his own life or he just


---------56:54----------
accidentally overdosed


---------56:55----------
but you warned them enough about gmb


---------56:59----------
did i warn my dad enough about gme nope


---------57:03----------
did you warn him


---------57:06----------
it's okay so so it's interesting right


---------57:08----------
because i'm noticing a parallel between


---------57:10----------
like


---------57:10----------
what oh okay you're going back to the


---------57:12----------
beginning of the conversation i was like


---------57:14----------
sitting here talking about my dad taking


---------57:15----------
his own life and you're like did you


---------57:16----------
warn him enough about jimmy i'm like is


---------57:17----------
that a [ __ ] sick joke dude like i was


---------57:19----------
about to get pissed okay


---------57:21----------
no okay um go back to what you're saying


---------57:25----------
yeah sorry sorry about that i should


---------57:26----------
have been a little bit no it's not your


---------57:28----------
fault


---------57:28----------
i was i'm a visual person so i was


---------57:30----------
somewhere else when i heard that so i


---------57:31----------
apologize


---------57:32----------
i shouldn't have gotten that go ahead


---------57:34----------
what you're saying no your reactions i


---------57:35----------
think are fair


---------57:36----------
it's just i i i was noticing that that


---------57:40----------
there's actually sort of like a common


---------57:41----------
thread about like guilt and like doing


---------57:44----------
enough for people


---------57:46----------
uh like does that feel connected to you


---------57:50----------
at all


---------57:51----------
yeah i mean sorry i i got a little i was


---------57:54----------
just


---------57:55----------
i really feel bad about what i just did


---------57:57----------
i didn't mean to like like


---------57:58----------
i was really confused in the moment so i


---------58:00----------
apologize again


---------58:01----------
um yeah it goes back to guilt a lot of


---------58:04----------
times and i don't know why because i


---------58:05----------
don't feel like i ever have i'll give


---------58:07----------
you an example my brother was passing


---------58:09----------
was was was had lung cancer and and


---------58:11----------
liver cancer a lot of abuse to his life


---------58:13----------
and i was reached out to and said hey


---------58:17----------
can you be a liver donor we can't get a


---------58:21----------
liver to him


---------58:22----------
can you be a liver donor holy and


---------58:25----------
and they said hey if you don't you know


---------58:28----------
you know we need you to do it and i was


---------58:30----------
like


---------58:30----------
wait a second you my mother who i


---------58:34----------
haven't spoken to in years


---------58:36----------
have reached out to me after 10 years to


---------58:38----------
say


---------58:39----------
your brother's dying can you donate your


---------58:43----------
liver or what part of your liver


---------58:46----------
i'm like wait a second why because they


---------58:48----------
can't find a donor anywhere so now


---------58:50----------
i am like wait a second


---------58:53----------
you're now asking me to be in a


---------58:54----------
situation to give a liver if i say yes


---------58:57----------
it could save if i say no it could kill


---------58:58----------
him and i knew she was a manipulative


---------59:01----------
person but that just [ __ ] with me


---------59:03----------
and so i sat on this for several days


---------59:05----------
and i'm like if i give part of my liver


---------59:08----------
it could save his life but at the same


---------59:10----------
time


---------59:12----------
you know i could i could recover or


---------59:14----------
because i drank a shitload when i was


---------59:16----------
younger and i had fatty liver at one


---------59:17----------
point i could have complications from it


---------59:20----------
and i'm like i have a wife now and i'm


---------59:23----------
trying to have a kid


---------59:24----------
you know what what do i do and so now


---------59:26----------
i'm sitting here making this decision


---------59:28----------
and i'm like holy [ __ ] man you know and


---------59:31----------
then i decided that you know i talked to


---------59:33----------
somebody and they said


---------59:34----------
they said to me they said um don't ever


---------59:37----------
um


---------59:37----------
don't ever make a decision based on


---------59:39----------
guilt and they said are you doing the


---------59:41----------
decision because you want to or because


---------59:42----------
you'll feel guilty if you don't


---------59:44----------
and so i didn't do it and my brother


---------59:47----------
died


---------59:48----------
and i still live with that


---------59:54----------
because i had to make a decision over my


---------59:57----------
blood brother you know whatever even


---------59:58----------
though


---------59:58----------
regardless of our relationship or the


---------60:01----------
chances of me


---------60:02----------
not being there for my wife and


---------60:04----------
potential daughter and that was a really


---------60:05----------
[ __ ] up situation we put in and i had


---------60:08----------
to make that decision so yeah


---------60:10----------
there's always guilt you know what i


---------60:12----------
mean


---------60:16----------
i mean there's no there's no way to make


---------60:17----------
a decision there and not have some kind


---------60:19----------
of feelings


---------60:20----------

---------60:24----------

---------60:26----------

---------62:06----------
probably had lots of mental health


---------62:07----------
issues that i i don't know about um


---------62:10----------
you know we lived in a in a shack no


---------62:12----------
electricity no running water


---------62:14----------
very abusive um you know uh


---------62:18----------
very loved my sister uh for some reason


---------62:21----------
and my sister's a great


---------62:22----------
you know my sister also had to deal with


---------62:24----------
a lot of these problems too but she you


---------62:25----------
know didn't


---------62:26----------
she she was upset when i was born


---------62:27----------
because i was a boy um


---------62:29----------
my older brother dealt with a lot of it


---------62:31----------
a lot of abuse


---------62:33----------
not to get real into details but sure


---------62:35----------
you know


---------62:36----------
sitting on raw rice for hours tying up


---------62:39----------
with a


---------62:40----------
phone cord and cow prodding um you know


---------62:42----------
hitting with a


---------62:45----------
skillet across the face i got stabbed in


---------62:47----------
the face like lots of [ __ ] up things


---------62:49----------
um her boyfriend's everything on raw


---------62:52----------
rice mean


---------62:54----------
kneeling on raw rice so what you would


---------62:56----------
do is if your kid was


---------62:57----------
acting up and you were a psycho you


---------62:59----------
would put raw rice and then make them


---------63:01----------
kneel on it for a couple hours until it


---------63:02----------
brews them


---------63:03----------
really badly oh my god yeah yeah dealt


---------63:07----------
with some crazy [ __ ]


---------63:08----------
so then uh so then um the uh the the


---------63:11----------
state would take away


---------63:12----------
uh take us away for a little while put


---------63:14----------
us with somebody else for a little while


---------63:15----------
then we'd come back so


---------63:16----------
i don't want to get in any more details


---------63:18----------
from that but uh pretty


---------63:20----------
pretty [ __ ] up situation um and uh


---------63:23----------
and uh and uh dealt with a lot of severe


---------63:25----------
abuse


---------63:26----------
um the whole family did uh and so that


---------63:28----------
was it um didn't really see her a lot


---------63:30----------
more after that


---------63:31----------
only saw her whenever she would try to


---------63:33----------
get money from somebody suing somebody


---------63:35----------
or trying to do whatever


---------63:37----------
um no love lost there no love lost there


---------63:41----------
good so so when when we were talking


---------63:43----------
about your dad you kind of mentioned


---------63:44----------
that your mom was like


---------63:46----------
malicious like it seems like she was


---------63:49----------
like


---------63:50----------
a bad yeah i think that i think that she


---------63:52----------
was abused probably when she was younger


---------63:53----------
it was just her way of


---------63:54----------
understanding how to deal with kids and


---------63:56----------
then because you know drugs get involved


---------63:58----------
you don't understand what you're doing


---------63:59----------
and you just kind of


---------64:00----------
do it i i i at this point it doesn't


---------64:02----------
matter the reason behind it should


---------64:04----------
happen it's in the past you know i've


---------64:05----------
moved on from it well


---------64:06----------
tried to do you ever wonder about your


---------64:09----------
upbringing and how that could affect you


---------64:11----------
as a father


---------64:14----------
i think that my upbringing is going to


---------64:17----------
make me


---------64:17----------
make sure that those mistakes that i not


---------64:19----------
mistakes but


---------64:21----------
the things that happen to me will never


---------64:23----------
happen um


---------64:24----------
i've never lifted a hand to anyone


---------64:28----------
you know like in in in a personal com


---------64:30----------
you know issue you know obviously if i


---------64:32----------
different situations but you know i've


---------64:34----------
never even raised a hand to my wife


---------64:36----------
or to a girlfriend or a family member


---------64:38----------
you know in that way


---------64:39----------
that's not who i am um i i i don't even


---------64:42----------
think i could if i wanted to


---------64:44----------
um you know i i i get frustrated as a


---------64:47----------
person who doesn't sleep and have a


---------64:48----------
stream and the baby you know cries but i


---------64:50----------
grab her


---------64:50----------
and i rock her and i sing songs to her


---------64:52----------
and i love feeding her and i love her


---------64:54----------
little smile


---------64:55----------
and her cute little feet and she's she's


---------64:57----------
just adorable when she's not screaming


---------64:58----------
her head off like somebody's trying to


---------65:00----------
murder her


---------65:01----------
um so i i look forward to it and i've


---------65:03----------
already planned on all these little


---------65:04----------
things like i'm like


---------65:05----------

---------65:07----------

---------65:09----------

---------66:48----------

---------66:52----------
i just want to be someone she's proud of


---------66:54----------

---------66:55----------

---------66:58----------
also


---------66:59----------
to i want her to not


---------67:02----------
have to worry what it's like to be


---------67:05----------
hungry


---------67:08----------
to be cold to be sick to have your head


---------67:11----------
shaved because you have lice


---------67:13----------
to have intestinal problems i don't want


---------67:15----------
her to have to


---------67:16----------
be picked up by her hair and punched


---------67:18----------
until she pisses blood when she's seven


---------67:20----------
years old


---------67:21----------
i don't want her to be locked in a


---------67:22----------
generator room until she passes out from


---------67:24----------
gas food you know gas fumes


---------67:26----------
i don't want her to be taken from her


---------67:27----------
home i just want her to be comfortable i


---------67:29----------
want her to be loved i want her


---------67:31----------
i want her to be happy


---------67:34----------
and i want to be the one to give her


---------67:36----------
that happiness and i want to be the


---------67:38----------
right father


---------67:39----------
that's what i want to do i want to give


---------67:40----------
my daughter everything that i wasn't


---------67:42----------
given


---------67:43----------
at the end of the day


---------67:49----------
i'm going to need a second yeah go for


---------67:52----------
it go for it


---------68:09----------
trying to think about how to put these


---------68:12----------
words together


---------68:35----------
this is tricky


---------68:40----------
all right we'll just give this a shot


---------68:43----------
so i want you to think for a second


---------68:48----------
about the life that you want to give her


---------68:52----------
right and and what is it like


---------68:59----------
to have grown up


---------69:03----------
with none of the things that you want to


---------69:05----------
give to your daughter


---------69:08----------
like i want you to take a moment to like


---------69:11----------
imagine


---------69:11----------
what it would be like like imagine how


---------69:13----------
you would feel if your


---------69:15----------
daughter did grow up with all of that


---------69:18----------
stuff


---------69:20----------
how would that make you feel i


---------69:24----------
i don't want to overdo it i don't want


---------69:27----------
to overcompensate i don't want to


---------69:29----------
over spoil her i'm not talking about


---------69:31----------
that let me rephrase


---------69:33----------
so i want you to you know all what you


---------69:35----------
said that you don't want your daughter


---------69:36----------
to live through all of that stuff right


---------69:39----------
right


---------69:40----------
well of course not no okay okay so so


---------69:43----------
how would you feel if she did


---------69:49----------
and i had any ability to prevent it


---------69:54----------
if you couldn't do a damn thing about it


---------69:58----------
i can't even imagine that i can't i all


---------70:00----------
i can think of is that


---------70:02----------
i don't care if i have to sell hot dogs


---------70:05----------
on a corner or


---------70:06----------
boxes in a fedex truck or if i've got a


---------70:10----------
if i've got a you know it doesn't matter


---------70:12----------
what i have to do i will not let that


---------70:14----------
happen so i can't even imagine it


---------70:16----------
okay i will do anything how to make sure


---------70:19----------
how do you feel about those things


---------70:21----------
happening to you


---------70:24----------
it's in the past i can't go back and


---------70:27----------
change the past i can only learn from it


---------70:28----------
and be a better person and help


---------70:30----------
take the lessons or not even lessons


---------70:32----------
because i didn't do anything wrong


---------70:34----------
see what that pain is like know what


---------70:35----------
it's like and make sure that that that


---------70:37----------
that someone else doesn't ever see that


---------70:39----------
pain if i can prevent it


---------70:41----------
so i think that that's a wonderful


---------70:44----------
approach to take and i feel like it's


---------70:47----------
incomplete


---------70:48----------
because this is what i'm gonna try to


---------70:50----------
share with you okay tsg


---------70:52----------
stalking so like i want you to think


---------70:54----------
about the feelings that you would have


---------70:55----------
towards your daughter right and she's a


---------70:58----------
child like she can't you can't protect


---------71:01----------
yourself when you're seven


---------71:03----------
and for those horrible things to happen


---------71:04----------
like it awakens


---------71:06----------
she's eight weeks now yeah yeah so it it


---------71:09----------
awakens within you a profound


---------71:13----------
emotion a profound protective instinct a


---------71:16----------
profound love


---------71:17----------
[Music]


---------71:18----------
and i want you to notice that there's


---------71:20----------
like a huge difference between the way


---------71:22----------
that you


---------71:23----------
view that happening to her in the way


---------71:27----------
that you view it happening to yourself


---------71:31----------
right it's like night and day yeah but


---------71:34----------
i'm looking at it from the point of


---------71:35----------
perspective is that i can prevent that


---------71:36----------
from happening


---------71:38----------
it it it's up to me like like she is


---------71:41----------
she's an innocent


---------71:42----------
i understand that i i and i know you're


---------71:44----------
going to i know this is weird


---------71:46----------
i know it's weird i'm trying to follow


---------71:47----------
you i'm trying to follow you yep yep yep


---------71:49----------
i think it's going to be


---------71:50----------
very foreign to you may not not even get


---------71:53----------
because i think the concept so what i'm


---------71:54----------
essentially talking about is like maybe


---------71:56----------
i'll just put


---------71:57----------
it make it a little intellectual what


---------71:58----------
i'm talking about is self-compassion


---------72:01----------
so what i'm hearing from you is that


---------72:03----------
like painful things have happened to you


---------72:05----------
but you don't really


---------72:06----------
know how to feel pity or love or


---------72:10----------
anything like that like


---------72:11----------
towards your former self


---------72:17----------
i i feel like my former self is is a


---------72:19----------
different person


---------72:21----------
and i don't mean like that a better or a


---------72:22----------
worse person i just feel like


---------72:24----------
good i just feel like you know what i


---------72:25----------
feel like you know those little russian


---------72:27----------
dolls


---------72:28----------
yes good okay it's kind of like that


---------72:30----------
right yeah like like like


---------72:31----------
a little guy is inside but you're no


---------72:33----------
longer he's a shell he's inside that


---------72:34----------
shell and now you became that guy


---------72:36----------
and now you're in the military you were


---------72:38----------
in uh


---------72:39----------
acting you were in this that's what is


---------72:41----------
those people are in there


---------72:42----------
but there's been so many layers over


---------72:44----------
that i don't even recognize them and


---------72:45----------
it's so hard to find them that it's just


---------72:47----------
kind of you know they're there


---------72:48----------
but you got to work your way to get


---------72:49----------
there and i don't really like you


---------72:52----------
okay if it's too much work that's fine


---------72:54----------
if it's too much work that's


---------72:56----------
completely that's an excellent reason to


---------72:58----------
not do it


---------73:00----------
but i think it's it's beautiful because


---------73:02----------
i i think like this is the thing is like


---------73:04----------
that seven year old still needs


---------73:09----------
all of the love that your daughter is


---------73:11----------
gonna need from you


---------73:14----------
yeah but that that part of your brain


---------73:15----------
that is developed during that time you


---------73:17----------
can't go


---------73:18----------
back and rewire that you can re-learn


---------73:20----------
certain


---------73:21----------
you can learn new things but you're not


---------73:24----------
that i mean i'm not a doctor like i said


---------73:25----------
i'm not a doctor but from my under my


---------73:27----------
limited understanding


---------73:28----------
of the human brain and development that


---------73:31----------
zero to


---------73:32----------
three year old of so many emotions being


---------73:35----------
built


---------73:35----------
i mean you can rewire it but you can't


---------73:37----------
like get back that innocence and the


---------73:39----------
understanding of it from that


---------73:41----------
level like it's like okay give an


---------73:42----------
example it's like if you're in a


---------73:44----------
relationship and everything's great


---------73:47----------
but then you're cheated on you can learn


---------73:50----------
to trust


---------73:51----------
in your future relationships but you can


---------73:53----------
never get that innocence back


---------73:55----------
because you'll always remember that


---------73:57----------
always have that small piece in the back


---------73:59----------
of your head so that innocence is gone


---------74:01----------
in your future relationships you can


---------74:02----------
learn to trust again you can forgive and


---------74:04----------
you can be with somebody else and say


---------74:06----------
i trust this person but that innocence


---------74:08----------
is gone


---------74:09----------
and i think that that's what i was


---------74:10----------
trying to get like i can fix i can


---------74:12----------
rewire my brain but that initial


---------74:14----------
thing is never gonna be there and i


---------74:16----------
recognize that at least for me


---------74:18----------
maybe i'm wrong


---------74:25----------
so i'm not so sure that i agree


---------74:28----------
but what i feel really confident in is


---------74:31----------
that there's like some middle ground


---------74:34----------
so when we think about like trauma


---------74:36----------
therapy okay


---------74:37----------
so like a big part of trauma therapy is


---------74:39----------
something that we call processing


---------74:42----------
and so part of that processing is like


---------74:45----------
so there's compartmentalization with


---------74:47----------
distraction


---------74:48----------
there's learning from the past and being


---------74:51----------
a good father like all awesome stuff


---------74:52----------
don't get me wrong


---------74:54----------
but there's also like i get the sense


---------74:56----------
stocky that


---------74:57----------
you know there's actually like a lot


---------75:02----------
of relief to be had for you


---------75:06----------
and and


---------75:09----------
you seem frustrated i'm not frustrated


---------75:12----------
i'm just


---------75:13----------
it's it's i believe you but like at this


---------75:15----------
point in my life it's like


---------75:17----------
i've become so apathetic to the whole


---------75:19----------
thing that


---------75:22----------
like i believe that there is but


---------75:25----------
i'm i'm so i don't know maybe it's maybe


---------75:29----------
it's i try to


---------75:29----------
distract myself maybe i'm just


---------75:31----------
frustrated with it maybe i've just given


---------75:32----------
up maybe it's just


---------75:33----------
it doesn't matter maybe i've got a new


---------75:35----------
new focus in life but like you're saying


---------75:37----------
you're never going to be that good


---------75:38----------
father you're never going to be that


---------75:39----------
really good father unless you can also


---------75:42----------
heal yourself it's like i tell these


---------75:43----------
guys all the time you can't learn they


---------75:45----------
like why am i not in a relationship why


---------75:46----------
can't i find somebody


---------75:47----------
you can't love someone else until you


---------75:49----------
love yourself


---------75:59----------
who said you couldn't be a good father


---------76:02----------
oh no no i'm not saying that i'm saying


---------76:04----------
i could be a better father


---------76:06----------
by by by i feel like i could be a better


---------76:09----------
father


---------76:10----------
how does it oh [ __ ] this is a whole


---------76:15----------
thing


---------76:16----------
so let me let me tell you what i just


---------76:17----------
saw so i saw maybe i maybe i said the


---------76:20----------
wrong words and i was trying to get over


---------76:22----------
something


---------76:22----------
i'm pretty sure you said the right words


---------76:24----------
so i saw frustration


---------76:25----------
so i said stocky there's a way forward


---------76:30----------
and you're like [ __ ]


---------76:36----------
you're not doing anything wrong and


---------76:39----------
there's no misspeaking everything is


---------76:40----------
there i i think it's it's


---------76:42----------
it's it's perfect just the way it is


---------76:44----------
okay you're not


---------76:45----------
so let me explain to you what and like


---------76:47----------
now like this is i'm putting you in a


---------76:48----------
really tough situation stocky


---------76:50----------
i never realized this until this moment


---------76:53----------
because you have i don't think you're


---------76:56----------
apathetic i think you've tried really


---------76:58----------
hard and like you've sort of given up on


---------77:01----------
integrating yourself and really fixing


---------77:03----------
this you're sort of like i can learn


---------77:04----------
from the past i can be a good father i


---------77:06----------
don't have to fix myself


---------77:08----------
i just have to stuff it all to the side


---------77:09----------
i can distract i can do it i can do it


---------77:12----------
and here i come and i tell you you can


---------77:15----------
fix it


---------77:16----------
and now you're like [ __ ] because if i


---------77:19----------
don't fix


---------77:20----------
it then like am i not gonna be like am i


---------77:23----------
letting my daughter down by not fixing


---------77:25----------
it like i'm putting you in one hell of a


---------77:27----------
bind bro


---------77:32----------
i mean it's a two-way street for me i


---------77:34----------
think part of that


---------77:36----------
jadedness i wouldn't call it jadeness


---------77:37----------
but part of that


---------77:39----------
that that


---------77:42----------
that what i went through and what i deal


---------77:44----------
with is motivation to be a better father


---------77:47----------
right but at the same time i don't know


---------77:50----------
if it's just procrastination


---------77:52----------
if it's if it's anxiety it's like i


---------77:55----------
don't know if i


---------77:55----------
want to to work on it like i don't know


---------77:58----------
if i really want to


---------77:59----------
because like i said i'm 35 at this point


---------78:02----------
it's like


---------78:03----------
i don't know if i even want to work on


---------78:04----------
it because it's just part of who i am


---------78:06----------
it's like the birthmark right


---------78:07----------
do i want to you know i mean sure i


---------78:09----------
could probably


---------78:10----------
pay to get this taken off or you know


---------78:13----------
enlightened or whatever like that but


---------78:14----------
it's just who i am i don't even pay


---------78:15----------
attention it doesn't matter to me


---------78:16----------
anymore like i


---------78:17----------
it's it's out of sight out of mind i


---------78:18----------
don't actively think about it anymore


---------78:20----------
yeah it's there and i'll notice it in


---------78:22----------
the mirror sometimes if i'm paying


---------78:23----------
attention but


---------78:24----------
it's like [ __ ] it's just who i am


---------78:27----------
yeah i know it's much deeper than that


---------78:29----------
but i don't all know i don't know


---------78:31----------
i i i i don't think you need to work on


---------78:33----------
it


---------78:34----------
and i don't think you want to work on it


---------78:36----------
which i think is totally fine


---------78:38----------
i think you're gonna be an amazing


---------78:40----------
father whether you work on this or not


---------78:43----------
so i just i wanna i just wanna leave a


---------78:46----------
good impact on the world i wanna i want


---------78:47----------
i wanna i wanna


---------78:48----------
feel like i have a purpose and i wanna


---------78:49----------
leave a good impact i wanna you know i


---------78:51----------
told you with my daughter that's that's


---------78:52----------
what i want to do i want to be that


---------78:54----------
you i don't matter as much anymore like


---------78:58----------
in my mind


---------78:59----------
not to sound dark but i'm not worried


---------79:01----------
about me anymore


---------79:03----------
as in as in not like i don't care i'm


---------79:05----------
nobody


---------79:06----------
i find the fact that i can give so many


---------79:09----------
other people out there


---------79:11----------
so much it feels like


---------79:15----------
i don't know how to explain it you know


---------79:16----------
i don't want to be famous i don't want


---------79:19----------
to be


---------79:19----------
i don't want to be you know them to


---------79:21----------
write you know


---------79:22----------
books or something about me but the fact


---------79:25----------
that


---------79:26----------
i can get satisfaction by helping other


---------79:29----------
people change their lives whether it's


---------79:30----------
through


---------79:31----------
financial education or or or jokes or


---------79:34----------
making them laugh or get them through


---------79:35----------
their work day


---------79:36----------
it feels good you know what i mean it's


---------79:37----------
like and i know this is probably gonna


---------79:39----------
circle back to though well you were


---------79:40----------
never wanted you never felt wanted as a


---------79:41----------
kid and now you feel wanted


---------79:43----------
so this is what you're doing you're


---------79:44----------
making up for it i'm i know that i'm not


---------79:47----------
no but that i feel like that's part of


---------79:48----------
what's going to come from this


---------79:50----------
but do you think that's true oh i knew i


---------79:53----------
knew i'd set myself up for this i knew i


---------79:56----------
said second i said it i knew it i saw


---------79:58----------
the look in your eyes and i knew i set


---------80:00----------
myself i was confused because i was


---------80:01----------
going to make the opposite


---------80:03----------
conclusion oh please go on then go on no


---------80:05----------
no but i'm curious what you think


---------80:06----------
no no please please after you


---------80:11----------
okay we'll just okay fine i'll go first


---------80:14----------
so i what i was actually kind of


---------80:16----------
concerned about stocky was that


---------80:18----------
you know you know when have you mattered


---------80:22----------
you said you you've come to re like you


---------80:24----------
know you've come to put other people


---------80:25----------
first which i totally get


---------80:27----------
good good for you good it's gonna make


---------80:30----------
you a good dad


---------80:30----------
is gonna make you valuable on twitch


---------80:32----------
that you really care about


---------80:34----------
your community like i think that's


---------80:35----------
awesome man but


---------80:38----------
have you ever mattered i put myself


---------80:40----------
first before


---------80:43----------
and i [ __ ] a lot of things up


---------80:46----------
hmm because i'm a selfish son of a [ __ ]


---------80:50----------
if i care about myself only


---------80:52----------
i smoke i drink i gamble i [ __ ] uh i


---------80:55----------
um i do a lot of things that


---------80:58----------
uh that that that that i i i'm not proud


---------81:02----------
of


---------81:03----------
um and so and so


---------81:06----------
you know i try to be busy because i tend


---------81:10----------
to find a purpose and focus


---------81:12----------
on um positive things and and keeping


---------81:15----------
myself busy you know what i mean so i


---------81:17----------
think that that's really really


---------81:19----------
important because when i put myself


---------81:21----------
first it's like


---------81:22----------
i mean i'm working on it i'm trying to


---------81:24----------
like put myself first in healthy ways


---------81:26----------
like oh


---------81:26----------
go do this or go do that or go do this


---------81:28----------
but then i'm just bored and i'm like


---------81:30----------
[ __ ] that i'll just work you know it's


---------81:31----------
more


---------81:32----------
at least i'm working towards something


---------81:33----------
rather than wasting time


---------81:39----------
yeah so stocky i i you doing okay buddy


---------81:42----------
yeah i'm just i'm just sometimes i say


---------81:45----------
very little with a lot of words and i'm


---------81:47----------
like


---------81:51----------
i think sometimes you say a lot with


---------81:52----------
very few words


---------81:55----------
maybe um


---------81:58----------
if you're curious about that all you


---------82:00----------
have to do is go back and watch the


---------82:01----------
vaude about when i asked you if you're


---------82:03----------
lonely


---------82:04----------
you okay yeah my wife grant walked in to


---------82:07----------
grab something and i was just telling


---------82:08----------
her to


---------82:09----------
be careful yeah okay um


---------82:15----------
so saki i'd like to share a couple of


---------82:17----------
thoughts with you and then i'd love to


---------82:18----------
get your thoughts about


---------82:19----------
you know or maybe i should ask well why


---------82:21----------
don't you go first this time


---------82:23----------
because this is going to be but help me


---------82:25----------
understand like what what what did we


---------82:26----------
talk about today


---------82:29----------
i thought we were going to talk about


---------82:31----------
the problems with gambling addiction


---------82:33----------
and finance fatigue and the dangers of


---------82:36----------
doing things


---------82:38----------
and you were probably gonna maybe roast


---------82:39----------
my hairline and then we were gonna talk


---------82:41----------
about boomers joke about our indian


---------82:43----------
wives


---------82:43----------
which now sounds terrible that i said


---------82:44----------
that uh and i didn't have a good time


---------82:46----------
bro


---------82:47----------
um i thought that was gonna be good


---------82:49----------
times uh and then we were gonna make


---------82:51----------
jokes about you know


---------82:53----------
roadies being around i was gonna tell


---------82:54----------
you about first time she cooked the


---------82:55----------
whole nine yards i thought that's what


---------82:56----------
was gonna happen but


---------82:58----------
we got deep but you know what i'm not


---------83:00----------
upset about it not ashamed of any of it


---------83:02----------
not embarrassed of any of it i


---------83:03----------
i i think that i like to tell my story


---------83:06----------
not as in-depth as we did here but i


---------83:08----------
think that it can help inspire people


---------83:11----------
um a lot of people always think that


---------83:13----------
when they think about my


---------83:14----------
one of my big goals is to get people


---------83:15----------
started whether it's investing or


---------83:17----------
whatever getting started and a lot of


---------83:18----------
people don't do it because it's so


---------83:19----------
intimidating


---------83:20----------
it's this big intimidating thing and i


---------83:22----------
tell them it's like the gym right


---------83:24----------
every guy you see throwing up 400 pounds


---------83:25----------
eventually started small and if some guy


---------83:27----------
like me


---------83:28----------
who grew up with absolutely nothing came


---------83:30----------
from conditions that were third world


---------83:33----------
and and went through so many


---------83:34----------
so much pain and struggle can still do


---------83:36----------
it


---------83:37----------
whether it's investing or getting your


---------83:39----------
life or doing something you know


---------83:40----------
maybe that can help somebody else i


---------83:42----------
actually like


---------83:43----------
giving some inspiration if it means me


---------83:45----------
giving my story so that's something good


---------83:48----------
that came out of it


---------83:50----------
will anything change probably not i mean


---------83:52----------
not not to sound like a


---------83:54----------
a dick but i mean i mean i don't know if


---------83:56----------
i if


---------83:57----------
if you know i'm gonna


---------84:00----------
change anything after the conversation


---------84:02----------
but it was nice to have the conversation


---------84:03----------
and


---------84:04----------
you pointed out a couple things that i


---------84:05----------
didn't really think about what did we


---------84:07----------
what did we what did we talk about


---------84:09----------
though and what were the things that i


---------84:11----------
pointed out that


---------84:12----------
you think may be worth thinking about


---------84:17----------
i think that the idea of well maybe it's


---------84:20----------
stuff that i said that i had my own


---------84:21----------
self-realizations maybe maybe um but it


---------84:24----------
came out


---------84:25----------
during during the conversation was


---------84:26----------
something for me to think about um


---------84:29----------
but uh um you know


---------84:33----------
i i just realized i'm gonna be honest


---------84:35----------
with you let me be honest with you


---------84:36----------
because i know this will


---------84:38----------
this will be good i think the one thing


---------84:41----------
i realized


---------84:43----------
out of this entire conversation is that


---------84:45----------
i love my kid more than i thought i did


---------84:47----------
and i don't mean that from a way of like


---------84:49----------
oh i just kind of liked my kid like


---------84:51----------
i think that i just listened to myself


---------84:53----------
talk very open and honestly


---------84:56----------
and that for the first time in my life i


---------84:58----------
found something that i do care about


---------85:00----------
in a deep level and that i have a


---------85:02----------
mission to make sure my daughter has the


---------85:03----------
best father that i could possibly be


---------85:05----------
i think that was kind of cool


---------85:09----------
yeah i i i think you're i agree


---------85:13----------
i love my wife too i'm so sorry i'm


---------85:16----------
talking about my wife at all


---------85:17----------
babe i love you too i love you i'm i'm


---------85:20----------
steering clear of your wife


---------85:21----------
for the health of your marriage that's


---------85:24----------
why we're not talking about oh no


---------85:26----------
okay because because she can watch this


---------85:28----------
one day


---------85:30----------
my mother-in-law and father-in-law in


---------85:32----------
delhi watch it every single day my


---------85:33----------
stream and it's


---------85:34----------
oh my god yeah terrifying well the good


---------85:37----------
thing is that my father-in-law doesn't


---------85:38----------
speak english


---------85:39----------
so so let me uh stocky let me just share


---------85:43----------
what my


---------85:43----------
impression of the conversation is is


---------85:46----------
that okay


---------85:47----------
and then i'd like to leave you with a


---------85:48----------
couple points to think about so the


---------85:49----------
first thing is that uh you know it


---------85:51----------
sounds like you had a super super


---------85:52----------
traumatic upbringing


---------85:54----------
and what happens when people have a


---------85:55----------
traumatic upbringing is they can get


---------85:57----------
taught


---------85:57----------
a lot of weird things so one thing that


---------86:00----------
they


---------86:01----------
learn how to do kind of adaptively is


---------86:03----------
compartmentalize


---------86:05----------
right so you take like negative feelings


---------86:07----------
and sensations you kind of wall them off


---------86:09----------
in a part of your mind


---------86:11----------
and then sometimes even though you've


---------86:13----------
walled them off like


---------86:15----------
the energy is still there and it sort of


---------86:17----------
lies dormant and it can kind of trickle


---------86:20----------
into your mind in other weird ways and


---------86:23----------
can lead to like destructive behaviors


---------86:26----------
and the need to distract yourself okay


---------86:29----------
so


---------86:29----------
and it sounds like you used to distract


---------86:31----------
yourself in unhealthy ways


---------86:33----------
and now you distract yourself in healthy


---------86:35----------
ways


---------86:36----------
and that's medication helps too but yeah


---------86:40----------
that's definitely a step in the right


---------86:42----------
direction


---------86:43----------
um and at the same time in my experience


---------86:47----------
the real goal is to like no longer need


---------86:50----------
to distract yourself


---------86:52----------
now i recognize that that could be


---------86:54----------
putting a burden on you but just


---------86:55----------
just something for you to kind of


---------86:57----------
percolate on


---------86:59----------
so i also think that it's sort of


---------87:01----------
interesting because


---------87:03----------
one of the other things that i wonder a


---------87:04----------
little bit about and it's


---------87:06----------
it this is a super subtle kind of


---------87:09----------
shift is that i think you're super


---------87:12----------
genuine


---------87:13----------
about having a dharma which is the


---------87:15----------
sanskrit word for duty or responsibility


---------87:17----------
to like the people around you


---------87:19----------
and i think you genuinely carry that


---------87:22----------
mantle of like trying to educate people


---------87:24----------
trying to teach people trying to help


---------87:26----------
them you absolutely carry that


---------87:28----------
that burden towards your daughter in


---------87:30----------
terms of like you carry the


---------87:32----------
responsibility of being the best father


---------87:34----------
you can possibly be


---------87:36----------
and so so you know so putting other


---------87:38----------
people


---------87:39----------
first is like absolutely a genuine and


---------87:42----------
good move


---------87:43----------
and then there are also times where you


---------87:46----------
used to put yourself


---------87:47----------
first and that was definitely bad so i


---------87:50----------
get where you're coming from there


---------87:51----------
there's a nuance here


---------87:53----------
though that i think is just worth


---------87:54----------
exploring


---------87:56----------
which is that when kids are traumatized


---------87:59----------
a lot like they get


---------88:00----------
taught that they don't matter like the


---------88:03----------
reason that


---------88:04----------
i think you you know you say your dad


---------88:06----------
cared about you is because like


---------88:07----------
you mattered to him through the haze of


---------88:10----------
addiction and you sort of felt that


---------88:12----------
right


---------88:13----------
and and there's a subtle lingering


---------88:15----------
effect which could be there could not be


---------88:17----------
there


---------88:18----------
which is that i still don't know that


---------88:20----------
you matter


---------88:21----------
to yourself right so so


---------88:26----------
yeah so so there's a difference between


---------88:29----------
saying that other people matter


---------88:31----------
more than i do and


---------88:34----------
i matter like there's a difference


---------88:36----------
between saying


---------88:37----------
my value is a hundred dollars but my


---------88:40----------
child's value is a thousand dollars


---------88:42----------
and sort of saying my value is a zero


---------88:44----------
dollars and my child's value is a


---------88:46----------
thousand dollars


---------88:47----------
and this actually goes back to like the


---------88:50----------
you know the russian dolls


---------88:52----------
which is that like i think each of those


---------88:54----------
people actually exist within you


---------88:56----------
so when when we form memories like those


---------88:59----------
memories get laid down and sort of


---------89:01----------
retain the age at which they were formed


---------89:03----------
so i think within you there's actually


---------89:06----------
like a seven-year-old kid


---------89:08----------
who needs a lot of love because they


---------89:11----------
weren't shown that and that need is


---------89:13----------
there


---------89:14----------
i think this sort of translates into


---------89:16----------
weird ways like


---------89:17----------
sort of feeling lonely or like not being


---------89:19----------
able to like really connect with people


---------89:21----------
like i know you love your wife


---------89:23----------
it's clear that you do it's clear that


---------89:24----------
she loves you i know you love your


---------89:26----------
daughter


---------89:26----------
but that's just that's just stocky


---------89:30----------
right that's the outermost russian doll


---------89:32----------
that is like


---------89:33----------
capable of feeling love and there are


---------89:36----------
all those other dolls as well on the


---------89:38----------
inside that like still


---------89:39----------
like it's hard to fully connect with


---------89:41----------
someone when the only thing that they're


---------89:42----------
connecting with


---------89:43----------
is the current version of you and so i


---------89:46----------
think this sort of gets back to like


---------89:48----------
when you


---------89:48----------
when i ask you are you lonely and you


---------89:50----------
say it's complicated i think the reason


---------89:51----------
for that is because


---------89:53----------
some layers of the doll are lonely and


---------89:55----------
some layers of the doll aren't


---------89:59----------
the last thing that i kind of two other


---------90:01----------
points the three other points actually


---------90:03----------
one is that i think part of the reason


---------90:04----------
that you use analogies and you use them


---------90:06----------
really really well


---------90:07----------
is because you're probably somewhat


---------90:09----------
alexa thymic


---------90:10----------
so lexithymia is the inability to


---------90:13----------
determine what your internal emotional


---------90:15----------
state is


---------90:16----------
and so what that means is you're kind of


---------90:19----------
colorblind


---------90:20----------
to emotions so if you go back and you


---------90:22----------
watch this interview


---------90:24----------
like you can describe


---------90:28----------
things really well with visual imagery


---------90:30----------
but because you don't have the


---------90:31----------
vocabulary for the emotions themselves


---------90:34----------
so you come up with these beautiful


---------90:35----------
analogies of like russian dolls


---------90:37----------
compartmentalized but you don't really


---------90:40----------
know like


---------90:41----------
what the emotion is and so


---------90:45----------
the interesting thing is as you talk


---------90:46----------
about it what'll happen is sort of what


---------90:49----------
happened today


---------90:51----------
is you're gonna like uncover like the


---------90:53----------
emotions underneath and like today it's


---------90:56----------
like wow i really i didn't quite realize


---------90:59----------
like i knew i loved my daughter and i


---------91:01----------
knew that i wanted to


---------91:02----------
make the world awesome for her and make


---------91:04----------
her life awesome but not spoiler


---------91:06----------
so that that's going to hurt her later


---------91:08----------
in life i want her to


---------91:10----------
teach her to be like an independent


---------91:12----------
responsible human being


---------91:13----------
where you're going to support her


---------91:15----------
interests and you're going to support


---------91:17----------
her growth


---------91:18----------
and what you want to do is give her a


---------91:19----------
nest and give her wings


---------91:22----------
right you're not going to hold her back


---------91:23----------
but you're going to do everything that


---------91:24----------
you can to help her build her own life


---------91:27----------
and i get that and it's through talking


---------91:30----------
through things like this that you


---------91:31----------
uncover those emotions you start to


---------91:34----------
recognize your emotions a little bit


---------91:35----------
more


---------91:36----------
you feel a little bit more it tends to


---------91:38----------
feel


---------91:39----------
hopefully generally speaking positive


---------91:41----------
even if it's not a positive emotion


---------91:42----------
which i know is weird


---------91:45----------
so i think it's just something to kind


---------91:46----------
of think about the last two points that


---------91:49----------
i want to share with you one is there's


---------91:50----------
a sunscript concept called


---------91:52----------
a some scar which is sort of like a ball


---------91:55----------
of


---------91:56----------
undigested emotion that you kind of


---------91:58----------
carry with you


---------91:59----------
and that and i think you have a some


---------92:01----------
scar sort of around


---------92:03----------
guilt and what that means is that like


---------92:05----------
you've got this weird like


---------92:06----------
guilt sort of like hiding in a closet


---------92:09----------
that then like


---------92:10----------
manifests in weird ways like it trickles


---------92:12----------
into your conscious mind and then


---------92:14----------
applies to like


---------92:15----------
other relationships that aren't entirely


---------92:19----------
appropriate so i think part of the


---------92:21----------
reason that you feel guilty around this


---------92:23----------
gme stuff is because


---------92:25----------
cognitively you know that you you give


---------92:28----------
people good advice


---------92:29----------
cognitively you know you're not


---------92:31----------
responsible and in fact you go


---------92:32----------
out of your way to try to help people be


---------92:35----------
responsible


---------92:36----------
so then like where is that guilt really


---------92:39----------
coming from


---------92:40----------
you know because you you find yourself


---------92:41----------
questioning and and this is where i mean


---------92:43----------
we can go into


---------92:44----------
you know a whole lecture about this but


---------92:46----------
basically like it's been my experience


---------92:48----------
that


---------92:49----------
the strange emotions that people feel


---------92:52----------
with that ten


---------92:52----------
that that tend to conflict with their


---------92:55----------
cognitive mind tend to essentially be


---------92:57----------
like


---------92:58----------
emotions that are stored from the past


---------93:02----------
and so my sense is that if you work on


---------93:05----------
even talk through like this guilt around


---------93:06----------
your brother and stuff which is like


---------93:07----------
holy [ __ ] bro


---------93:09----------
that that enough is like that's crazy um


---------93:12----------
that hopefully somebody's just do it


---------93:14----------
after a while yeah


---------93:16----------
so so this is where like you get used to


---------93:17----------
it because you've gotten calloused


---------93:19----------
right like you've formed mental calluses


---------93:21----------
which allow you to function


---------93:23----------
but like a callus isn't really healing


---------93:26----------
it's just


---------93:27----------
you know it's just a layer on top of


---------93:28----------
something


---------93:30----------
and then the last point that i'm going


---------93:32----------
to give you is just a tiny tiny tiny


---------93:34----------
unlikely thing that could happen


---------93:38----------
but i want to just clue you in on this


---------93:40----------
in the event that it does because i


---------93:42----------
imagine it'll be important i'd say


---------93:43----------
there's a less than five percent chance


---------93:46----------
which is that be careful about


---------93:49----------
what kind of echoes could happen if your


---------93:52----------
wife does something that you perceive as


---------93:55----------
being negative towards your daughter


---------93:58----------
okay and what i mean by that is that


---------94:01----------
like so we have this


---------94:03----------
this basically what i don't want you to


---------94:06----------
do is


---------94:06----------
project like if you if your mind


---------94:10----------
sees your wife do anything similar to


---------94:13----------
what your mom did to you


---------94:16----------
you could get this weird like volcanic


---------94:18----------
rush of emotion


---------94:20----------
even though your head is gonna like it's


---------94:22----------
clearly apples and oranges


---------94:24----------
your wife would never do anything to


---------94:26----------
your daughter like what your mom did to


---------94:27----------
you


---------94:28----------
but there's a chance that if you see


---------94:31----------
something


---------94:32----------
something [ __ ] up is gonna happen


---------94:33----------
inside you and you're gonna get this


---------94:34----------
volcanic rush


---------94:36----------
of anger and like other kinds of weird


---------94:38----------
feelings


---------94:39----------
and just if that happens


---------94:43----------
you know go talk to someone about it


---------94:44----------
like go see a therapist and work through


---------94:46----------
that stuff


---------94:48----------
okay because i really don't want that to


---------94:50----------
mess up your relationship


---------94:54----------
i know it's kind of grim no no no i'm


---------94:57----------
i'm on board with you i know what you


---------94:59----------
mean i'm already i've already


---------95:00----------
you know working through that stuff for


---------95:01----------
example when i take care of the baby and


---------95:03----------
she starts crying my wife comes running


---------95:05----------
in i'm like yo


---------95:05----------
what she's like don't take the baby out


---------95:07----------
i'm like i'm a parent i'm her father i


---------95:09----------
know


---------95:10----------
that it's cold i've got a thing on here


---------95:11----------
not that i'm angry but i was getting


---------95:13----------
frustrated i was like why don't you just


---------95:14----------
let me be a parent i'm also


---------95:16----------
half parent here i can make good


---------95:18----------
decisions too


---------95:19----------
and then i kind of step back and i said


---------95:20----------
you know what babe i'm sorry i know


---------95:23----------
you're only doing this because you want


---------95:24----------
what's best for the baby and you're not


---------95:25----------
trying to say i'm not a good parent like


---------95:27----------
that


---------95:28----------
and we talked about it and i've gotten


---------95:29----------
better with it i'm very i'm very i'm


---------95:31----------
very


---------95:31----------
cognitive when i make a mistake and i'm


---------95:33----------
very i try to make sure that i work


---------95:35----------
through it and talk about it unlike


---------95:37----------
a woman not no not any woman but like


---------95:40----------
her as


---------95:41----------
her way where she'll just spend you know


---------95:42----------
three days upset about something and not


---------95:44----------
talk about it


---------95:45----------
i'm very very you know expressive in the


---------95:48----------
moment


---------95:49----------
and then i i i realize my mistake and


---------95:51----------
then i go


---------95:52----------
you know i'm so sorry um i i i am


---------95:56----------
expressive and i


---------95:57----------
and i then i work it through and i say


---------95:58----------
hey listen i [ __ ] up let me make sure


---------96:00----------
i don't do it again and so i


---------96:01----------
i really appreciate what you're saying


---------96:02----------
and i agree that's something i have to


---------96:04----------
be cognizant of moving forward that


---------96:06----------
i don't automatically assume that it's


---------96:08----------
something negative


---------96:10----------
yeah so just be aware stocky because


---------96:12----------
unfortunately like you said you know


---------96:14----------
some stuff gets laid down in our brain


---------96:16----------
in terms of like how we


---------96:18----------
automatically respond to situations


---------96:21----------
and and just to be aware that like there


---------96:23----------
may be some weird feelings that arise


---------96:25----------
and you may not even recognize them as


---------96:26----------
feelings like


---------96:28----------
because once again if you're a little


---------96:29----------
bit lexa-thymic like you're not going to


---------96:31----------
understand exactly what you're feeling


---------96:34----------
um


---------96:35----------
but you know just a couple things to


---------96:37----------
kind of think about any last kind of


---------96:38----------
thoughts or questions


---------96:41----------
no i mean this was this was nice you


---------96:43----------
know it's uh it's obviously you know


---------96:45----------
just exposed a lot of things about


---------96:46----------
myself not exposed but just


---------96:48----------
open up about a lot of its deep things


---------96:50----------
in front of thousands and thousands and


---------96:51----------
thousands of people i never thought this


---------96:52----------
would happen


---------96:53----------
uh it's not easy to do that but it was


---------96:54----------
nice to talk and i i just hope that


---------96:56----------
maybe someone else out there can


---------96:58----------
can can be helped by this maybe not that


---------97:00----------
there's


---------97:01----------
specifically a solution or resolution to


---------97:04----------
this conversation but maybe


---------97:06----------
they can say hey listen if this streamer


---------97:07----------
can deal with these things so can i and


---------97:09----------
then maybe i need to go get help or


---------97:10----------
maybe i need to talk to somebody or


---------97:12----------
you know stocky i i think a lot of


---------97:15----------
people are going to be helped by this


---------97:16----------
conversation


---------97:18----------
no i just want them to know they're not


---------97:19----------
alone and that and that listen there's a


---------97:21----------
lot of people out there that have it


---------97:22----------
really rough and


---------97:23----------
and it doesn't mean that you can't you


---------97:25----------
know accomplish good things you don't


---------97:26----------
have to be born with a silver spoon you


---------97:28----------
don't have to look up and say well that


---------97:29----------
person has what i don't i can't ever


---------97:30----------
have that


---------97:31----------
i just want people to be happy and i


---------97:32----------
want to be able to help people and and


---------97:34----------
if this helps people


---------97:35----------
um in any way then it was worth all of


---------97:39----------
this


---------97:40----------
just exposing myself to the world as


---------97:42----------
long as i can help somebody


---------97:43----------
um you know i mean i i talked to my chat


---------97:45----------
before i said you know listen i i dealt


---------97:47----------
with adhd in a very


---------97:49----------
very rough manner for many many years


---------97:51----------
and it wasn't until two years ago i


---------97:52----------
started getting treatment for it


---------97:53----------
it's helped my life significantly in a


---------97:55----------
lot of ways so


---------97:57----------
you know um obviously it's totally


---------97:58----------
different than the conversation we had


---------98:00----------
but


---------98:00----------
it's cool i'm just i'm just really


---------98:02----------
grateful you know


---------98:04----------
that uh that i've got this community and


---------98:05----------
uh and that they allow me to


---------98:08----------
have this job it's it's it's so [ __ ]


---------98:10----------
surreal that these guys let me


---------98:13----------
this is my job because of them you know


---------98:14----------
what i mean so i'm glad that i can help


---------98:16----------
somebody if i can


---------98:17----------
yeah and i want to thank you too because


---------98:19----------
i i think um


---------98:21----------
listening to you has been really


---------98:23----------
educational i think you kind of


---------98:25----------
you know like you mentioned you were


---------98:28----------
sort of vulnerable and and


---------98:30----------
i think that can be hard to do in front


---------98:31----------
of thousands of people so i


---------98:33----------
i appreciate that the other thing is


---------98:35----------
that um


---------98:36----------
you know i think the world is a better


---------98:37----------
place because you're in it man


---------98:39----------
and i i think as a father like i'm


---------98:41----------
inspired like listening


---------98:43----------
to you talk to you know about what kind


---------98:46----------
of dad you want to be for


---------98:48----------
your daughter like it makes me want to


---------98:49----------
be like you get


---------98:51----------
get my juices flowing like makes me want


---------98:53----------
to you know go there


---------98:55----------
i appreciate that i appreciate that yeah


---------98:58----------
um


---------98:59----------
last thing is that you know i i mean it


---------99:01----------
sounds like you may be in


---------99:03----------
you may have some kind of provider or


---------99:05----------
something but


---------99:06----------
you know i would encourage you if you


---------99:08----------
want to work on this down the road to


---------99:10----------
really go see someone about it


---------99:12----------
i don't think you need to work on it i


---------99:15----------
think it's totally fine for you to


---------99:17----------
not want to work on it now


---------99:20----------
and but down the road you know you may


---------99:22----------
change your mind at some point and it's


---------99:24----------
totally fine to seek someone out at that


---------99:26----------
point


---------99:27----------
yeah i mean i'm not against it it's just


---------99:29----------
like you said that's just not


---------99:31----------
i'm i'm i'm not okay or fine or happy


---------99:34----------
with everything but i'm content to the


---------99:36----------
point where


---------99:37----------
it's just gotten used to it you know i


---------99:38----------
mean it's like my birthmark just kind of


---------99:39----------
used to it at this point


---------99:40----------
yeah and the calluses are formed yeah


---------99:43----------
sure it would be great if i


---------99:44----------
if i took off my shirt and somebody


---------99:46----------
every now and then looked and didn't


---------99:47----------
stare and say hey what's that


---------99:48----------
oh it's a birthmark that'd be great i


---------99:50----------
don't give a [ __ ] you know what i mean


---------99:52----------
like


---------99:52----------
i've got a beautiful wife i've got a kid


---------99:54----------
i you know i've got a great


---------99:55----------
i'm not worried about what somebody


---------99:56----------
thinks there and so for me it's like


---------99:58----------
makes perfect sense you know what [ __ ]


---------99:59----------
it you know what what up [ __ ] it


---------100:01----------
it is what it is let me just make sure


---------100:02----------
my daughter doesn't have to have these


---------100:03----------
same


---------100:04----------
emotional bags that she has to carry let


---------100:06----------
me carry them absolutely absolutely yeah


---------100:09----------
so normally i teach meditation on stream


---------100:12----------
i can't do that yeah i i was gonna say i


---------100:16----------
i wouldn't recommend it today


---------100:18----------
um as well but so i think we're we're


---------100:22----------
we're maybe on the same page there i'm


---------100:24----------
just being honest with you i i can't


---------100:25----------
even read a book more than a page


---------100:26----------
without earmarking it i'll never make it


---------100:28----------
through meditation


---------100:30----------
uh yeah i i mean we do a lot of


---------100:32----------
successful meditation with people with


---------100:33----------
adhd but but


---------100:35----------
i think more of the reason that i would


---------100:36----------
suggest against it is just because


---------100:38----------
you have to be really careful with


---------100:40----------
meditation and and


---------100:41----------
histories of trauma so what meditation


---------100:44----------
tends to do is remove the calluses


---------100:48----------
so what can happen is peop like people


---------100:50----------
can get like


---------100:51----------
an upwelling of emotions and things like


---------100:53----------
that which i i don't i don't think


---------100:54----------
you're


---------100:56----------
um i don't think you need that right now


---------101:01----------
so i think if you want to do yoga or tai


---------101:04----------
chi or something that would be like


---------101:05----------
really great but like


---------101:06----------
i wouldn't recommend meditation for you


---------101:08----------
to be honest


---------101:10----------
what about a hot tub stream that's fine


---------101:14----------
okay hot tub is cool yeah do you have a


---------101:16----------
hot tub


---------101:17----------
no no i was just wondering because these


---------101:18----------
guys have been giving me [ __ ] about it


---------101:20----------
for days i thought hey listen i could


---------101:21----------
relax get some warm water and


---------101:23----------
and uh and and bait some dono's maybe i


---------101:26----------
don't know


---------101:26----------
yeah well listen sake thank you so much


---------101:30----------
for


---------101:30----------
coming and i know you didn't really know


---------101:32----------
what you signed up for i i really


---------101:33----------
appreciate you being such a good sport


---------101:35----------
about it


---------101:37----------
you know if you regret coming on or


---------101:38----------
something like that at some point down


---------101:40----------
the road which is a completely


---------101:41----------
reasonable thing for you to feel


---------101:43----------
you know please let us know if there's


---------101:46----------
any kind of fallout or aftermath from


---------101:48----------
our conversation today


---------101:50----------
um and and it you know it's causing you


---------101:53----------
any kind of problems please let us know


---------101:54----------
and we'd love to try to support you


---------101:56----------
through that or kind of fix


---------101:57----------
it you know um yeah so


---------102:00----------
i i think that my community um i've i've


---------102:03----------
done a very


---------102:04----------
thorough job in my opinion of keeping a


---------102:06----------
non-toxic very supportive community lots


---------102:07----------
of memes lots of [ __ ] posting but not


---------102:09----------
actual hate people


---------102:10----------
we don't allow that it's cool if


---------102:12----------
somebody thinks of me differently


---------102:14----------
which i don't see why because i've


---------102:15----------
always been very open and very


---------102:16----------
transparent about everything my trades


---------102:18----------
the way i do things the way i think my


---------102:19----------
life


---------102:20----------
i don't mind doing this because when


---------102:22----------
you're open and when you don't have much


---------102:23----------
to hide and you're doing that


---------102:25----------
you don't really worry about that


---------102:26----------
backlash so i think if anything my


---------102:28----------
community got to see a side of me a


---------102:29----------
little bit more in depth


---------102:31----------
might let them know who i am a little


---------102:32----------
bit more and if anybody


---------102:34----------
out there saw this and was like yeah


---------102:36----------
after seeing all this i don't want to be


---------102:37----------
part of that guy they're probably a


---------102:38----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] person i don't want him


---------102:39----------
here anyway so i think it's a win-win


---------102:41----------
for everybody i think everything that i


---------102:42----------
saw about you was like


---------102:44----------
awesome bro seriously except this fire


---------102:46----------
jesus christ do you have anything for


---------102:48----------
receding hairlines look at that [ __ ]


---------102:50----------
l are you is it really receding


---------102:53----------
yeah not a lot but i mean at 35 i have a


---------102:56----------
decent hairline but it's it's


---------102:58----------
it looks like the male it looks like a


---------103:00----------
widow's peak


---------103:01----------
the whole thing's moving backwards


---------103:02----------
that's because all this hair is gone so


---------103:05----------
it just looks that way okay


---------103:07----------
jesus christ my man over here it's


---------103:09----------
low-key roasting me


---------103:11----------
okay i okay yeah i mean


---------103:15----------
you know there are there are things


---------103:16----------
there are medications and stuff for hair


---------103:18----------
loss


---------103:19----------
there are some ayurvedic treatments as


---------103:21----------
well but those aren't really well


---------103:22----------
supported through the evidence


---------103:24----------
um well i mean you could get coconut oil


---------103:28----------
coconut oil massage or almond oil


---------103:30----------
massage goes a long way yeah she does


---------103:31----------
almond oil massages and stuff like that


---------103:33----------
but


---------103:33----------
with the baby and everything and we


---------103:34----------
haven't had time um and i get concerned


---------103:37----------
because the last time she gave me a


---------103:38----------
massage we got pregnant so i just try to


---------103:39----------
be very careful with you know the timing


---------103:41----------
of things but


---------103:42----------
no i'll definitely um i'll definitely um


---------103:45----------
look to see if there's something i can


---------103:46----------
add


---------103:46----------
you should ask her she'll know what to


---------103:50----------
do


---------103:52----------
all right doc it was nice uh nice


---------103:54----------
chatting with you uh


---------103:56----------

---------103:59----------
yolo


---------104:02----------

---------104:04----------
know yolo means you only live once but


---------104:08----------
doc i got i got 20 grand what am i going


---------104:10----------
to put it on today


---------104:12----------
i i don't know the idk oh god that one


---------104:16----------
already got played


---------104:18----------
i'm just kidding you're not giving me a


---------104:19----------
yellow listen thanks so much and i hope


---------104:20----------
that uh i hope that you have a great one


---------104:22----------
um and uh you know i i i i


---------104:27----------
maybe down the road so i had a


---------104:30----------
it's gonna sound so random but um


---------104:34----------
back when i was studying to become a


---------104:36----------
monk i got exposed to a lot of really


---------104:38----------
weird pseudo-spiritual


---------104:42----------
pseudo-scientific kind of [ __ ] um so


---------104:45----------
for example like i'm a certified crystal


---------104:47----------
healer but


---------104:48----------
i don't do that because i don't really


---------104:49----------
think it works


---------104:51----------
um so i was just learning a lot of


---------104:52----------
different stuff and one of the things


---------104:54----------
that i came across was someone who


---------104:56----------
uh i got trained in dowsing do you know


---------104:58----------
what dowsing is


---------105:00----------
yeah i found out that sounding rods and


---------105:03----------
doubting dowsing rods are not the same


---------105:04----------
thing by accident but yeah at dowsing


---------105:06----------
rods


---------105:07----------
i'm familiar yeah so so the person who


---------105:10----------
who got a wild man


---------105:14----------
so like no i'm serious these guys asked


---------105:15----------
me about sounding rods i thought it was


---------105:17----------
dowsing rods so i googled it and i just


---------105:19----------
wasn't ready for that i learned


---------105:20----------
something new that


---------105:21----------
yeah so so someone once made the claim


---------105:23----------
to me and i thought that this claim is


---------105:25----------
absolutely ludicrous but if you


---------105:27----------
no one's ever asked me to pick a stock


---------105:28----------
before but what i would do if you really


---------105:31----------
wanted me to pick a stock was


---------105:32----------
was get my dowsing pendant because i


---------105:34----------
have a dowsing pendant which is sat in a


---------105:36----------
closet for the last 18 years because i


---------105:38----------
think it's [ __ ]


---------105:40----------
um but it is pull that out and then if i


---------105:43----------
could get like a page of stocks i would


---------105:44----------
use the dowsing pendant and like pick


---------105:46----------
one


---------105:47----------
okay these guys are all waiting right


---------105:49----------
now they're literally like 5 000


---------105:51----------
waiting for you to do that oh but how do


---------105:53----------
i find the dowsing pendant is a physical


---------105:55----------
object so it's like a pendant so what i


---------105:58----------
need to do is twirl it and and have it


---------106:00----------
sit over a stock


---------106:01----------
so how literally you just get a bor you


---------106:04----------
get the alphabet and you do it and the


---------106:05----------
first three it lands on


---------106:07----------
are the three the alphabet a b


---------106:10----------
c d e f g h i j k


---------106:13----------
oh oh so i should just get a an alphabet


---------106:16----------
you just get a square


---------106:17----------
thing with the alphabet and you do your


---------106:19----------
rod you're sounding nothing


---------106:21----------
are we gonna do housing through the


---------106:22----------
circle are we doing this


---------106:24----------
go for it and then the first three i'll


---------106:26----------
make you a deal this is


---------106:27----------
for entertainment purposes only you do


---------106:29----------
that the first three letters it lands on


---------106:31----------
i'll buy a thousand dollars of that


---------106:32----------
stock okay right here live


---------106:33----------
okay we're gonna do so then i'm gonna


---------106:35----------
make i'm gonna make a i'm gonna


---------106:36----------

---------106:57----------

---------106:58----------

---------107:01----------

---------107:06----------

---------107:20----------
so you know it's funny chat because we


---------107:22----------
don't talk about this a lot on healthy


---------107:24----------
gamer


---------107:26----------
but you know i've explored a lot of


---------107:29----------
bs in my day in my search for like


---------107:32----------
what works and like what actually helps


---------107:35----------
people


---------107:37----------
um is this one


---------107:41----------
maybe i need to get my kids to help me


---------107:44----------
with this i was showing my kids

---------107:57----------
this there's like there's a lot of bs


---------107:58----------
out there right


---------107:59----------
so i'm also a skeptic so what happened


---------108:01----------
is like i was like okay i'm gonna have


---------108:03----------
an open mind


---------108:04----------
and we're gonna try to learn oh [ __ ] not


---------108:06----------
to find my dowsing pendant


---------108:18----------
all right let's do this full disclosure


---------108:19----------
this is for entertainment purposes only


---------108:21----------
do not


---------108:22----------

---------108:23----------
this is not fine with the device it's a


---------108:25----------
complete [ __ ] right now okay


---------108:26----------
yeah but i got a feeling of which i need


---------108:29----------
to find out how much money i've either


---------108:30----------
made or lost today because i had like


---------108:32----------
a lot of money in disney before we got


---------108:34----------
on and i'm green so i might have done


---------108:36----------
well let me see


---------108:38----------
it may take me a minute to find this


---------108:41----------
this thing


---------108:42----------
but these guys don't care this is very


---------108:44----------
oh it hit 190. i'm good i made money i

---------108:52----------
gifted


---------108:56----------
all right disney took a while but i


---------108:58----------

---------109:00----------
40 minutes which means it'll probably


---------109:01----------
jump on me npa dropping


---------109:04----------
olb is getting i'm getting down five


---------109:06----------
percent on that


---------109:07----------
i forgot i forgot to stop the stop loss


---------109:09----------
this is not all right let me tell a


---------109:10----------
little bit of stock here


---------109:12----------
let me sell you know what i'm going to


---------109:14----------

---------109:15----------
but i've had 10 shares 10 shares of


---------109:18----------
disney


---------109:20----------
i've been wanting to do this for decades


---------109:22----------
but i never


---------109:23----------
i never had the scientific integrity to


---------109:26----------
just actually run this experiment


---------109:28----------
i was like it's not scientific integrity


---------109:30----------
literally gambling at this point


---------109:32----------
yeah but my wife heard me and said that


---------109:36----------
i'm selling it five minutes after i buy


---------109:37----------
it


---------109:39----------
whatever it is hold on wait she said


---------109:42----------
that to me but you know what i did i


---------109:43----------
looked her right in the eyes when she


---------109:44----------
said that and i said


---------109:45----------
i said


---------109:51----------
did you dig yourself a hole i said yes


---------109:55----------
dear whatever you say


---------109:56----------

---------109:59----------
doing it guys


---------110:00----------
i said


---------110:07----------
maybe one of my kids oh no no


---------110:10----------
some bad energy with drawing crystal


---------110:14----------
that's different it's a whole different


---------110:16----------
crystal so many crystals


---------110:18----------
so this one found it here it


---------110:22----------
right so that's your is your dowsing


---------110:25----------
thing right


---------110:26----------
okay so and you have an alphabet you


---------110:28----------
have a no i need to like i need to like


---------110:30----------
write out the alphabet oh jesus


---------110:33----------
you're a doctor you don't own a scrabble


---------110:34----------
board a scrabble board


---------110:37----------
i feel like every doctor owned like


---------110:39----------
scrabble and like uh


---------110:40----------
and backgammon or something


---------110:44----------
dude what i own


---------110:48----------
a bunch like you know every doctor every


---------110:50----------
lawyer


---------110:57----------
oh just use my keyboard no it needs to


---------110:58----------
be a circle though


---------111:01----------
okay all right bye okay


---------111:05----------
so i got to tell you guys the story okay


---------111:07----------
so


---------111:08----------
so like i teach a lot of stuff on stream


---------111:11----------
so we talk about neuroscience we talk


---------111:13----------
about meditation


---------111:14----------
we talk about you know different kinds


---------111:17----------
of things


---------111:18----------
psychiatry um science


---------111:21----------
but what people don't know is that like


---------111:23----------
on my journey there's been


---------111:25----------
a lot of [ __ ] that i've encountered


---------111:28----------
and so what we try to teach


---------111:29----------
is like it's not like i don't do reiki


---------111:31----------
right because


---------111:32----------
i mean there's evidence that reiki


---------111:37----------
um you know helps people feel better but


---------111:41----------
uh doesn't actually lead to better


---------111:44----------
outcomes


---------111:46----------
so what we do on stream


---------111:49----------
is actually just like it's like the


---------111:52----------
stuff that works


---------111:53----------
but what people don't know is there's a


---------111:54----------
lot of [ __ ] out there that doesn't work


---------111:56----------
a b c d e f g h g k


---------111:58----------
l m m


---------112:01----------

---------116:56----------
growth


---------116:58----------

---------117:01----------

---------117:03----------
stock


---------117:05----------
absolutely oh god wells fargo oh no


---------117:09----------
oh no boys oh no


---------117:12----------
what happened oh no wells fargo is


---------117:14----------
always one getting screwed


---------117:16----------
this is this is just slightly more


---------117:18----------
effective than a ouija board


---------117:22----------
oh jesus christ am i going to go oh my


---------117:24----------
god i'm getting screwed all right


---------117:25----------
can i even order this can you even buy


---------117:28----------
this i can't even buy this


---------117:30----------
all right guys i guess i'm going in


---------117:32----------
wells fargo all right that's it all


---------117:33----------
right wells fargo it is


---------117:34----------
you've got it buddy uh i'm just buying


---------117:36----------
wells fargo because that was the answer


---------117:38----------
so


---------117:39----------
wells fargo the bank stock that always


---------117:41----------
gets screwed but has a decent dividend


---------117:43----------
i am going to buy this right now i am


---------117:46----------
going to buy


---------117:46----------
100 shares at 33.36


---------117:52----------
okay so sir because of you i have just


---------117:55----------
spent


---------117:56----------
what's our outcome though like how what


---------117:58----------
do we do with this like


---------118:00----------
what's how do we know what the end of


---------118:01----------
the experiment is


---------118:04----------
diamond hands what does that mean


---------118:11----------
el no sabe chat he doesn't no


---------118:14----------
okay let me show you my proof i'm gonna


---------118:16----------
dm it to you right now so you know but


---------118:18----------
i mean it's too late it's too late it's


---------118:19----------
too late it doesn't matter now


---------118:21----------
this remember there's no deal just buy


---------118:23----------
and hold what's going on


---------118:27----------
i don't know you're the ouija board that


---------118:30----------
you're you're sorry you're doubting


---------118:31----------
crystal told me to do it


---------118:33----------
i i understand but the douse i hope


---------118:35----------
you're dowsing as a lawyer


---------118:36----------
in case this goes badly the dowsing


---------118:39----------
crystal did not tell me


---------118:40----------
so so when i think about this i think


---------118:42----------
about this as a scientist so what i say


---------118:44----------
is that we should design an experiment


---------118:46----------
and i've never done this experiment


---------118:47----------
because there's no plausibility that it


---------118:50----------
would ever


---------118:50----------
actually work so it's the experiment


---------118:52----------
i've never done but i've thought through


---------118:54----------
it many times and what i'd think is that


---------118:55----------
what you have to do is like


---------118:56----------
pick a random assortment of stocks and


---------118:59----------
then dowse to pick


---------119:01----------
another assortment of stocks and then


---------119:03----------
compare your growth from these two


---------119:05----------
and then you run that test so many times


---------119:07----------
and then you


---------119:08----------
assess for statistical significance i


---------119:10----------
got an idea how about this


---------119:12----------
yeah i'll hold each one for a week okay


---------119:16----------
wednesday to wednesday it sounds next


---------119:18----------
wednesday you tell me the stock that i'm


---------119:20----------
selling this


---------119:22----------
profit or loss based on this dowsing


---------119:24----------
thing and i'll buy that and we'll just


---------119:26----------
keep rolling that


---------119:27----------
and see what happens okay so i'm picking


---------119:30----------
one stock via dowsing


---------119:32----------
every week i mean i mean you're a busy


---------119:36----------
man but if i just get bored what what's


---------119:38----------
our what's our control group though


---------119:41----------
like what right so we have to have a


---------119:44----------
control if we're doing an experiment


---------119:47----------
control we're talking about a crystal on


---------119:48----------
a piece of


---------119:50----------
freaking wire piece of thread and you


---------119:53----------
want a control group


---------119:54----------
that is a good [ __ ] point but yes


---------119:57----------
if we are going to do this we might as


---------119:59----------
well we have to have something to


---------120:00----------
compare okay


---------120:01----------
how about this this is why so we run


---------120:05----------
you're dowsing versus this right here


---------120:07----------
okay here you go


---------120:09----------
i got some random letters here okay i


---------120:11----------
don't even have all my letters here but


---------120:13----------
i'm just going to randomly pick three


---------120:14----------
letters and i'm going to put


---------120:15----------
the same amount of money in both of them


---------120:17----------
okay i don't even have all my letters


---------120:19----------
here so this isn't even going to go


---------120:20----------
wrong


---------120:20----------
i'm talking i'm just going to pick the


---------120:21----------
first one okay here you go you've got


---------120:24----------
g okay um i only have like a third of


---------120:26----------
the alphabet here but we're just going


---------120:27----------
to do it anyways what's this


---------120:29----------
gi okay what do we have here um


---------120:35----------
gib what's gib hold on this is great i


---------120:39----------
love this


---------120:39----------

---------120:45----------
at 79.21 so i'm going to drop the same


---------120:47----------
