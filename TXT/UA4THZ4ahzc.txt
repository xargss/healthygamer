---------00:00----------
cool man how are you I'm doing well how


---------00:03----------
are you um I am


---------00:08----------
well actually I mean well I I just had a


---------00:10----------
I just finished a really bad stream but


---------00:11----------
I think in general


---------00:14----------
I'm actually really stressed for the


---------00:17----------
last like four and a half weeks I've had


---------00:19----------
on average about a hundred to one


---------00:21----------
hundred and ten hour work weeks so it's


---------00:25----------
it's been it's been pretty sick I think


---------00:27----------
on average I was on air like 12 to 14


---------00:32----------
hours a day and at some points upwards


---------00:35----------
to 18 like either casting or streaming


---------00:40----------
so it really took its toll on my mental


---------00:42----------
health


---------00:43----------
[Music]


---------00:45----------
okay let's go weird a question so I


---------00:49----------
think the ad is still running for some


---------00:51----------
people oh god okay it's running for 30


---------00:53----------
more seconds that's so long maybe we


---------00:55----------
should stop doing that but yeah why um


---------01:00----------
so lck is the Korean League of Legends


---------01:04----------
regional tournament the you know the


---------01:09----------
Korean region there's four casters two


---------01:12----------
color commentators and to play by plays


---------01:15----------
and the other color commentator still


---------01:19----------
doesn't have his visa okay and so not to


---------01:22----------
lower the the quality of the broadcast


---------01:26----------
and whatnot I'm the only color


---------01:27----------
commentator so I was having to do five


---------01:29----------
day work weeks okay so five day work


---------01:32----------
weeks I have to be in there by 3:00 p.m.


---------01:35----------
and then I wasn't getting out on average


---------01:38----------
until about midnight and then I would go


---------01:42----------
home or I wouldn't go home I actually


---------01:44----------
got a hotel near the studio is like one


---------01:47----------
minute walking distance and I'd go back


---------01:50----------
to the hotel and then I would either


---------01:52----------
live view le c which is the european


---------01:55----------
regional tournament or i would power a


---------01:58----------
nap and then stream the North American


---------02:03----------
regional why


---------02:05----------
um so coach streaming for North America


---------02:09----------
is a new thing it just started this


---------02:10----------
season the first time like ever in the


---------02:13----------
history that streamers are allowed to Co


---------02:14----------
stream it


---------02:16----------
it's the most successful thing that my


---------02:18----------
streams ever have so I think it's pretty


---------02:21----------
silly if I don't do it it's two days a


---------02:22----------
week the EU one I actually stopped doing


---------02:27----------
this past week as a means to try to


---------02:30----------
better manage my mental health I guess


---------02:33----------
so I don't do it this this last week


---------02:35----------
what what effect does does 110 hour work


---------02:39----------
weeks have on you um so I think the


---------02:45----------
first week was actually pretty pretty


---------02:47----------
okay I I managed the first week pretty


---------02:49----------
fine the second week was a lot more


---------02:55----------
stressful because the Korean the Korean


---------02:59----------
League right now is it's uh I don't know


---------03:03----------
how to like talk about it without


---------03:04----------
sounding really negative it's just not


---------03:06----------
it's not doing very well


---------03:07----------
not not in terms of like viewership or


---------03:09----------
anything like that the overall level of


---------03:13----------
play is not what people would expect and


---------03:17----------
then the games are what I think a lot of


---------03:19----------
people would call very boring


---------03:22----------
they're like average 35 plus minutes to


---------03:25----------
40 minutes very dull meta state meta


---------03:30----------
being like what champions keep popping


---------03:33----------
up and whatnot


---------03:34----------
lots of series are going all the way to


---------03:37----------
three games and so that extends the


---------03:39----------
broadcast makes it go a lot longer so I


---------03:44----------
think by week two that's when I started


---------03:46----------
really stressing out and I started


---------03:48----------
having bouts of insomnia again which


---------03:50----------
I've had on and off like the last couple


---------03:53----------
of years and I was starting to get a lot


---------03:56----------
of anxiety on the broadcast and I was


---------04:01----------
feeling sick without actually being sick


---------04:03----------
like body aches and fatigue and all this


---------04:08----------
other stuff I ended up going to a clinic


---------04:12----------
for it I got like a cold like a banana


---------04:15----------
bag or something like the the lack of my


---------04:17----------
grandson


---------04:18----------
yeah yeah ended up getting like a banana


---------04:21----------
bag I did like a spa thing to try to


---------04:24----------
help de-stress and everything then the


---------04:29----------
coronavirus started popping up it's very


---------04:31----------
prevalent right now in South Korea


---------04:34----------
so that started adding stressors and I


---------04:39----------
don't know


---------04:41----------
110 hour work weeks we're not healthy


---------04:44----------
this past week I I cut back the European


---------04:48----------
live viewing and I also missed one of


---------04:52----------
the North American ones because I woke


---------04:54----------
up to do it and then I just thought to


---------04:56----------
myself like there's no way I can turn


---------04:58----------
the stream on I'm not in a good mental


---------05:00----------
state there's no way I'll be okay and I


---------05:02----------
just went back to sleep and I just


---------05:04----------
rested and and I did the next two casts


---------05:10----------
and now here we are this is the night


---------05:13----------
after this is actually my first off day


---------05:14----------
okay and you're spending yeah awake in


---------05:18----------
the middle of the night so let's let's


---------05:19----------
try to make this worth your here you


---------05:21----------
know let's try to make it work in a


---------05:24----------
while and make sure we're not


---------05:25----------
contributing to the problem so Ellis


---------05:28----------
what's your recollection of our last


---------05:30----------
conversation like what do you what did


---------05:32----------
you remember about it or takeaways I


---------05:37----------
ended up thinking a lot more about my


---------05:42----------
childhood and adolescence in general and


---------05:45----------
I remember thinking that the session or


---------05:50----------
just the the talk that we had in general


---------05:52----------
was it was very relieving I guess while


---------05:57----------
it was happening and also afterwards I


---------05:59----------
thought about a lot of stuff for several


---------06:02----------
days following and then literally


---------06:05----------
shortly thereafter that's when the work


---------06:07----------
weeks started sure so I just I sort of


---------06:10----------
dome it into everything else there I all


---------06:16----------
I remember is just going down memory


---------06:18----------
lane of my life talking about various


---------06:23----------
stuff I remember talking about like the


---------06:25----------
meditation stuff I remember talking


---------06:29----------
about just my thought processes


---------06:32----------
how I arrived at certain conclusions


---------06:34----------
stuff like that no I I I dwelled on that


---------06:37----------
more and more but I feel like ever since


---------06:41----------
that session so where we're at now I've


---------06:43----------
been constantly on without basically any


---------06:46----------
down time so I think there's a lot going


---------06:49----------
on in my life right now as well as in my


---------06:51----------
mental state that I am trying or that I


---------06:55----------
will process and filter once the noise


---------06:57----------
stops yeah yeah so I have a lot of


---------07:03----------
questions for you but I also have some


---------07:06----------
general thoughts what would you like to


---------07:09----------
start with if you think the questions


---------07:13----------
would help you with your general


---------07:14----------
thoughts then that would probably be


---------07:16----------
better okay let me just think about that


---------07:24----------
so sometimes LS I have a problem where I


---------07:27----------
talk to someone for five minutes and I


---------07:28----------
feel like I have a clear sense of what's


---------07:31----------
going on and then I feel like I should


---------07:33----------
ask more questions because I really do


---------07:35----------
want to know more stuff but I'm inclined


---------07:37----------
to actually just talk to you a little


---------07:39----------
bit about my impressions of what I'm


---------07:41----------
hearing yeah and okay so Alice here's


---------07:46----------
what I think one of your one of your


---------07:49----------
challenges is I think you are in crap


---------07:52----------
you have an incredibly strong willpower


---------07:53----------
and I think your capacity to take parts


---------07:57----------
of yourself that are busted or cracking


---------08:06----------
under pressure your your capacity to


---------08:08----------
keep going in spite of signals from your


---------08:11----------
mind and your body that you need to slow


---------08:13----------
down is actually really really high and


---------08:15----------
I think what that does is puts you in


---------08:17----------
situations where like you just start you


---------08:20----------
know stuff just starts with kind of


---------08:21----------
falling apart


---------08:22----------
yeah and and I think you know we saw


---------08:26----------
this a little bit so my recollection of


---------08:28----------
our last talk was we certainly went down


---------08:30----------
memory lane but we also talked a lot


---------08:31----------
about sort of how one can look at


---------08:34----------
depression and that you struggled with


---------08:36----------
depression for a long time and I had the


---------08:38----------
sense that your depression was a couple


---------08:40----------
of things one is that it's anger turned


---------08:42----------
against the self


---------08:45----------
is so psychologically like when you're


---------08:48----------
when you're learning to be a therapist


---------08:49----------
that's one of the theories that you kind


---------08:50----------
of think about which is that depression


---------08:52----------
is a manifestation of anger that's


---------08:54----------
directed towards you and I think part of


---------08:57----------
the part of the way that you view


---------08:59----------
yourself is actually like really really


---------09:01----------
beneficial so when you're hard on


---------09:03----------
yourself and you push yourself you're


---------09:05----------
seeing the highest numbers that you see


---------09:06----------
on stream you're casting in the Korean


---------09:08----------
League you know you're doing so much


---------09:10----------
because you really like you push


---------09:12----------
yourself really hard and I'm curious a


---------09:16----------
lot about you know a lot of things that


---------09:18----------
you've said about you know you managed


---------09:19----------
week one well you're stressing out you


---------09:21----------
kind of talked about stressing and


---------09:23----------
distressing and spa day and insomnia I'm


---------09:25----------
really curious about how much


---------09:28----------
frustration loathing or anger do you


---------09:31----------
have towards yourself in all of this


---------09:34----------
stuff because you are working 110 hour


---------09:37----------
work weeks and I'm curious if there's a


---------09:38----------
voice inside you that says you should be


---------09:41----------
able to handle this better there's there


---------09:46----------
was definitely many points I remember


---------09:48----------
talking to my producer she's really good


---------09:50----------
she's like she's really good at being


---------09:52----------
someone that I can talk to she's like my


---------09:54----------
boss and then there's someone that's


---------09:56----------
above her but she she runs the global


---------09:58----------
production for the cast and I remember


---------10:03----------
talking with her about feeling very lost


---------10:04----------
and what I was doing and feeling very


---------10:07----------
paranoid and sort of confused at myself


---------10:13----------
like the in-between broadcasts or prior


---------10:15----------
to a broadcast starting I think I talked


---------10:18----------
with her on two or three different


---------10:20----------
occasions about this stuff there were


---------10:23----------
definitely some points where I'd leave a


---------10:24----------
cast and I was actually really angry


---------10:26----------
because I thought like my mental


---------10:30----------
fortitude wasn't strong enough to have a


---------10:33----------
good cast or I thought what the am


---------10:35----------
i doing like what how what am I actually


---------10:40----------
just going through and it became a


---------10:43----------
battle of yes just pushing myself


---------10:46----------
through and if you remember the last


---------10:49----------
talk I think that a lot of it is like


---------10:51----------
fear the motivator of not just fear in


---------10:54----------
the traditional sense of how people


---------10:55----------
think but fear of missing out


---------10:57----------
yes Oh suddenly I would start viewing


---------11:00----------
well if I miss this stream I miss out on


---------11:05----------
potentially all of this or then I would


---------11:07----------
start having anxiety about what if I end


---------11:12----------
up losing out on certain viewers or


---------11:16----------
people that get ticked off because


---------11:17----------
there's a lot of other people


---------11:19----------
coach trimming too and so it gets into


---------11:23----------
this really weird mental state where


---------11:25----------
it's like I become afraid to miss days


---------11:29----------
due to expectation and then I get lots


---------11:32----------
of messages on Twitter or DMS or discord


---------11:34----------
messages where am I or am i doing the


---------11:37----------
coach stream etc and then I get very


---------11:39----------
anxious about letting that stuff down


---------11:41----------
but sometimes I I just like I just want


---------11:45----------
everything to stop I just want all the


---------11:47----------
noise to stop and this has happened a


---------11:48----------
lot in the last few weeks but it feels


---------11:52----------
like obvious like I I can't and I feel


---------11:56----------
like I feel like I'm at the gym sort of


---------11:59----------
I like the equivalency when when your


---------12:01----------
body wants to give up on an exercise


---------12:03----------
that you're doing but you know that it


---------12:07----------
at the very end it's probably better if


---------12:12----------
you go through with it without obviously


---------12:14----------
hurting yourself and so I keep I I


---------12:16----------
feel like I keep trying to trick myself


---------12:17----------
into thinking that everything's okay but


---------12:20----------
all that I'm seeing is at the end of the


---------12:22----------
road like what what happens when we


---------12:25----------
complete spring and summer and how is my


---------12:28----------
stream gonna actually gotta push through


---------12:30----------
right yeah that's literally that's


---------12:33----------
literally it's got it I think like so


---------12:35----------
I'm halfway done with the lck where


---------12:38----------
we're uh we're halfway done now starting


---------12:40----------
next week and then there's offseason so


---------12:43----------
there's a two-month break and I was


---------12:45----------
planning about or I was actually


---------12:47----------
planning to go back to the States for


---------12:50----------
like a month or two and just stop


---------12:52----------
everything because I've just been on too


---------12:54----------
much the last few months and now the


---------12:56----------
coronavirus thing I have no idea what's


---------12:58----------
gonna happen with travel regulations and


---------13:00----------
all this other stuff so it's another


---------13:02----------
headache and I'm like ah that's


---------13:05----------
gonna happen with Kuroda


---------13:08----------
everyone's asking yeah and then uh it


---------13:12----------
sucks so that's what I got thinking


---------13:15----------
about but I view these really big breaks


---------13:18----------
that are coming so April May or end of


---------13:21----------
April May is a big break and then


---------13:24----------
there's another break before worlds


---------13:26----------
typically there's like one one and a


---------13:29----------
half one free and then obviously post


---------13:31----------
world's there's a big offseason so I


---------13:33----------
feel like these are just milestones that


---------13:35----------
I have to hit sort of like reps or


---------13:37----------
something mm-hmm yeah so I completely


---------13:39----------
understand that that's how you feel


---------13:41----------
about things and I think you made a


---------13:43----------
really interesting caveat when it comes


---------13:45----------
to the gym you said it's really


---------13:47----------
important to push through provided you


---------13:48----------
don't hurt yourself


---------13:49----------
yes and I think your problem is that is


---------13:54----------
what I guess well not knowing whether or


---------14:00----------
not it's gonna hurt myself right or I


---------14:03----------
don't know I don't know man stressing


---------14:04----------
out insomnia anxiety going body aches


---------14:08----------
going to the clinic and getting a banana


---------14:10----------
bag you know what a banana bag is


---------14:13----------
basically um it's a lot of like well I


---------14:18----------
mean you said electrolytes and stuffs a


---------14:19----------
lot of minerals and stuff that the body


---------14:21----------
needs nutrients yes you know do you know


---------14:23----------
why most people don't get banana bags


---------14:27----------
most people are lacking all those things


---------14:31----------
or they're yeah do you know why most


---------14:32----------
people aren't lacking those things


---------14:35----------
they're living a normal healthy work we


---------14:40----------
all know so let's pause for a second


---------14:43----------
let's just understand this very clearly


---------14:45----------
okay okay a lot of people live unhealthy


---------14:47----------
lives


---------14:48----------
okay right like a lot of people don't


---------14:51----------
eat healthy that's like yeah and like


---------14:54----------
and they don't need banana bags people


---------14:58----------
who need banana bags are people who are


---------14:59----------
severely dehydrated and like people who


---------15:03----------
like a good example of people who get


---------15:05----------
banana bags or people who have severe


---------15:07----------
alcoholism and don't do anything except


---------15:09----------
for drink alcohol they get all their


---------15:11----------
calories from alcohol they don't they


---------15:12----------
like literally like people who get


---------15:13----------
banana bags or people who do not eat


---------15:16----------
food and do not drink water or other


---------15:19----------
kinds of things okay so like how's your


---------15:22----------
food bin I'm actually eating really well


---------15:26----------
but I actually gained weight


---------15:28----------
so amidst all of this through the stress


---------15:30----------
I've actually gained weight because I've


---------15:33----------
been stressed eating


---------15:33----------
yep so what about freaking fluids I


---------15:38----------
actually drink quite a lot at riot


---------15:41----------
there's a lot of well the drinks suck


---------15:44----------
but there's a lot of stuff for the


---------15:47----------
talent next okay so okay I probably yeah


---------15:51----------
how often do you go through a lot of


---------15:52----------
water bottles tea etc how often do you


---------15:55----------
urinate I would say several times a day


---------15:58----------
what color is your hair it's yeah it's


---------16:03----------
pretty it's either


---------16:04----------
almost see-through or very light yellow


---------16:06----------
okay so I know and I notice hydrate yeah


---------16:09----------
okay there's problems yeah so I mean I'm


---------16:13----------
like what are you so I just wanted to


---------16:17----------
make sure that you know medically or


---------16:18----------
even though I don't dispense medical


---------16:20----------
advice over the over the internet just


---------16:21----------
want to make sure that you're really not


---------16:22----------
in a situation where there's something


---------16:24----------
that could be going on yeah so it sounds


---------16:26----------
like you're actually eating and drinking


---------16:27----------
okay yeah I want to kind of so let me


---------16:31----------
just stop for a second so I think LS


---------16:34----------
there a couple things we can talk about


---------16:36----------
today one is that we can dig into what


---------16:38----------
stressing out means what anxiety is what


---------16:40----------
insomnia is I think we can also talk a


---------16:43----------
little bit about psychosomatic and what


---------16:46----------
that term means I think though that so


---------16:51----------
we can talk about each of those things


---------16:53----------
and that's sort of like standard stuff


---------16:54----------
right like stress anxiety all insomnia


---------16:57----------
the other thing though is that I think


---------16:59----------
at the root of this is that you have


---------17:02----------
this fear or you have something that


---------17:04----------
drives you


---------17:06----------
and the thing is that driver is like a


---------17:09----------
taskmaster with a whip and like you


---------17:11----------
don't need a banana bag unless like


---------17:13----------
you're like you whipped yourself into


---------17:15----------
exhaustion yeah and and so I think going


---------17:18----------
forward you know if you want like this


---------17:21----------
is not a sustainable solution like


---------17:23----------
working 110 hour weeks for months at a


---------17:26----------
time and then taking a month or two off


---------17:29----------
and then working another like 110 hour


---------17:32----------
week for you know a couple months at a


---------17:34----------
time and then taking another month off


---------17:36----------
and then you also have to remember that


---------17:38----------
like during your month off like you're


---------17:40----------
not gonna be you're not another person


---------17:42----------
you're actually still LS so like during


---------17:46----------
that month off you're still gonna have


---------17:47----------
lots of thoughts about like missed


---------17:49----------
opportunities and should you be doing


---------17:50----------
this yes and so like it's not even gonna


---------17:53----------
be a month off like do you see that like


---------17:54----------
the month off is just an illusion


---------17:56----------
because you're still gonna be you during


---------17:58----------
those times yeah I'm always connected


---------18:01----------
I'm always lined in and it when I'm not


---------18:03----------
lined in I feel anxious yep so it's like


---------18:06----------
are you either you take a step back and


---------18:09----------
then you have to deal with your


---------18:10----------
crippling anxieties you like force


---------18:12----------
yourself to relax right because it's


---------18:15----------
like that's just a weird paradox you


---------18:18----------
know yeah it's like anxiety provoking


---------18:21----------
relaxation is like an oxymoron and but


---------18:25----------
because that's who you are so I think


---------18:27----------
what we've really got to change is you


---------18:28----------
man like this is not a good plan and we


---------18:32----------
have to we have to really dig into or I


---------18:34----------
feel you know this we have to dig into


---------18:37----------
what it is that drives you like who's


---------18:38----------
the taskmaster and why do you have to do


---------18:40----------
all these things why do you have to why


---------18:42----------
do you have to push yourself clearly


---------18:43----------
past your breaking points and and the


---------18:46----------
challenge here is that you're so


---------18:48----------
resilient that you like how can I say


---------18:54----------
this yeah I mean you're just so


---------18:56----------
resilient that you like have gotten used


---------18:58----------
to pushing yourself past the like a good


---------19:01----------
limit like you're at the gym but you


---------19:02----------
just you injure yourself every time you


---------19:04----------
work out because you've just gotten used


---------19:06----------
to injuries and like that's gotta stop


---------19:11----------
dudes like you know yeah I don't know


---------19:18----------
I guess I don't know what to say in that


---------19:21----------
regard


---------19:22----------
mostly I think a lot of that I think I


---------19:26----------
think we touched on it briefly last time


---------19:28----------
we talked where I feel like I'm


---------19:33----------
cognizant that where I am right now in


---------19:37----------
the eSports community or the scene is a


---------19:39----------
very ridiculously fortunate position the


---------19:44----------
position that I'm in but I see how


---------19:48----------
quickly things change in this industry


---------19:50----------
and how quickly just everything gets


---------19:54----------
completely thrown around and whatnot and


---------19:56----------
I feel like due to the way that I got


---------20:01----------
here as well as how I stay within the


---------20:05----------
community right now it feels like III


---------20:07----------
can't afford to turn off and it creates


---------20:12----------
this really weird loop where at the same


---------20:15----------
time I think I mentioned this to you


---------20:18----------
last time that after eSports or


---------20:21----------
something I don't know what I do yet and


---------20:25----------
so that's a that's another scary


---------20:27----------
question I just entered into a mid-20s


---------20:32----------
but that's kind of old and eSports if


---------20:35----------
you don't have anything else going for


---------20:36----------
you or going on and I feel like there's


---------20:40----------
a lot of expectations on me I feel like


---------20:42----------
there's a lot of people that want to see


---------20:46----------
me fail and so that you know in a way


---------20:49----------
that's it is the thing so what's up what


---------20:53----------
that is well a lot well so I don't know


---------20:57----------
how much you know about my persona or


---------20:59----------
whatever from League pretty


---------21:02----------
controversial yeah I think that most


---------21:06----------
people either love or hate me I think


---------21:08----------
there's no gray area I think that the


---------21:13----------
way that I eye


---------21:17----------
the way that I talk in league setting


---------21:21----------
maybe you don't get it here or something


---------21:24----------
because we're not in a league setting or


---------21:26----------
something


---------21:26----------
it's very agitated of people pisses


---------21:29----------
people off I don't know


---------21:34----------
so anyways really what do you say that


---------21:37----------
pisses people off I don't know how to


---------21:41----------
okay so okay I can know I know I don't


---------21:47----------
know how to describe this myself


---------21:48----------
I agree so anger is a really interesting


---------21:54----------
word you asked me last time if I get


---------21:55----------
angry I don't yeah so I use anger as a


---------21:58----------
way to describe it but I don't think


---------22:00----------
that's the emotion that I'm actually


---------22:01----------
feeling what is the feeling okay if I


---------22:10----------
think about this can I think it's sort


---------22:15----------
of education it's like a vacation yes


---------22:17----------
can I guess yeah god is it


---------22:19----------
ridiculous what is is that lays it like


---------22:23----------
a sense of ridiculous


---------22:24----------
yes well yeah sure yeah just that's not


---------22:27----------
good this is ridiculous


---------22:29----------
um is that what it feels like I yeah


---------22:32----------
yeah so it


---------22:35----------
I feel constantly on defense pretty much


---------22:38----------
no matter what and I think that because


---------22:40----------
of how much time I commit into the game


---------22:43----------
whether by working or spending time on


---------22:46----------
it or spending time on others that are


---------22:48----------
like around me like pro players or


---------22:49----------
people that are like living with me that


---------22:51----------
are trying to get careers or do certain


---------22:53----------
things in the game I feel like the


---------22:56----------
amount of commitment and time I spend


---------22:59----------
into it anything about the game almost


---------23:01----------
ends up becoming personal because of how


---------23:05----------
deep I am I don't know if that makes


---------23:08----------
sense


---------23:09----------
yeah I'm trying to make sense of it and


---------23:11----------
so I take things really personal and I


---------23:16----------
was having a conversation with someone


---------23:18----------
the other day actually in I think


---------23:23----------
actually I was gonna ask you like if you


---------23:27----------
saw someone go on television and you saw


---------23:30----------
someone state something that was clearly


---------23:33----------
untrue and you have a way of showing


---------23:34----------
that it's untrue but but it's very


---------23:36----------
difficult yes like the earth is flat


---------23:39----------
yeah like you've got messy oh that I use


---------23:41----------
lately yes yes yes so like it's much


---------23:44----------
ridiculous right so if you can show


---------23:47----------
someone the earth isn't flat but you


---------23:50----------
can't do it verbally there there's no


---------23:53----------
way to get people to concede verbally


---------23:56----------
right if you're confronted with a flat


---------23:58----------
earther and you try to explain to them


---------24:03----------
the way that certain things work they


---------24:07----------
either will or won't accept it but if


---------24:09----------
they come from the standpoint that


---------24:10----------
you're already wrong it feels like


---------24:13----------
there's nothing you can say verbally


---------24:16----------
that can ever convince them sure and in


---------24:19----------
order to convince them you need to


---------24:21----------
physically show it in some way but if


---------24:23----------
you can never get the physical part it's


---------24:26----------
like a barrier that I just I


---------24:28----------
can't I yeah Jesus Christ I just wanna


---------24:30----------
 bash my head against the wall


---------24:32----------
and then due to the nature of analysis


---------24:35----------
in video games or strategy games or RTS


---------24:38----------
is shrouded against realtime strategy


---------24:42----------
verbal talks become extremely


---------24:45----------
frustrating and angering especially if


---------24:48----------
things are taken out of context or all


---------24:52----------
this other stuff so it becomes it


---------24:54----------
becomes very stressful and when I deal


---------24:58----------
with certain arguments or confrontations


---------25:01----------
and stuff I don't think that I handle


---------25:02----------
them the best that I could especially in


---------25:04----------
the moment especially if what I'm


---------25:07----------
hearing I think is nonsense and then as


---------25:11----------
a byproduct of that it feels like by


---------25:13----------
standards will only see me get angry


---------25:16----------
right where they'll see me get impatient


---------25:19----------
and frustrated and then I feel like it


---------25:20----------
has a negative recourse on me why so it


---------25:24----------
is lesson to this um I'm sorry you were


---------25:30----------
saying it led you to a point the less


---------25:31----------
sounded like you were


---------25:32----------
yeah actually offering an important


---------25:33----------
conclusion yeah so the the the so it's


---------25:37----------
led me to a point where I basically only


---------25:39----------
want to interact with certain people


---------25:41----------
within the community but I don't think


---------25:42----------
that's healthy because I want to


---------25:45----------
progress thinking within the game in the


---------25:48----------
community


---------25:50----------
I want to progress the way that people


---------25:53----------
see strategy things and everything


---------25:54----------
because I've been playing games all my


---------25:56----------
life started at you know H 2 & 3 and


---------25:59----------
then competitively I've been involved in


---------26:02----------
eSports since age 12 so if you know I'm


---------26:06----------
going on two decades okay and it's my


---------26:10----------
whole life okay so that I oh yeah okay


---------26:14----------
okay hold on okay


---------26:24----------
I'm gonna need a minute okay you're just


---------26:28----------
sharing so much that I think is actually


---------26:30----------
really like everything you say is laden


---------26:32----------
with importance and has been reflected


---------26:36----------
upon and I think everything the problem


---------26:38----------
that I'm having is that like I can't I


---------26:40----------
don't know you're giving me a thousand


---------26:41----------
roads to walk down I think all of what


---------26:43----------
you're good yeah I know yeah it sucks I


---------26:46----------
feel I'm actually nervous even saying


---------26:47----------
what I'm saying right now why people say


---------26:50----------
well I don't know last video we did


---------26:55----------
obviously I I would call it success like


---------26:59----------
you know got a lot of viewership on


---------27:00----------
YouTube etc I think that there's a lot


---------27:03----------
of people again in the league community


---------27:04----------
that will take what I'm saying right now


---------27:06----------
is egotistical or overly arrogant or


---------27:11----------
thinking that I'm always right or


---------27:12----------
something like that and it has nothing


---------27:13----------
to do with that and it just totally


---------27:15----------
please and I don't know I don't know


---------27:19----------
what to describe it as it's a very


---------27:21----------
awkward thing when I have to


---------27:24----------
I I choose to live in a glass house


---------27:27----------
because I feel like it's my only defense


---------27:30----------
what I mean by that is like III I'm


---------27:34----------
always basically on air or I'm always


---------27:36----------
open to the public I've opened ESI


---------27:38----------
defends you against lies or lies


---------27:43----------
fabrications from whom oh Jesus


---------27:48----------
anyone really I guess it's just uh it's


---------27:51----------
something I develop or I started doing


---------27:55----------
years ago eSports is a pretty weird


---------27:57----------
industry I think that lies fabrications


---------28:00----------
half-truths etc can spread very a lot


---------28:03----------
and then word of mouth is way too strong


---------28:06----------
and things can be taken on a context way


---------28:09----------
too easily especially clips for instance


---------28:11----------
I mean you might know about that from


---------28:13----------
twitch like you see a clip on a context


---------28:15----------
doesn't really tell you the whole story


---------28:17----------
and people can misconstrue certain


---------28:21----------
things and I feel like that's very


---------28:22----------
frustrating and then I get frustrated


---------28:24----------
because I'm open to talking to literally


---------28:27----------
anyone at any time


---------28:28----------
and


---------28:31----------
I don't know we've gone a lot of places


---------28:36----------
right now you go ahead yes I'm sorry no


---------28:38----------
I'm glad you're sharing so much so let's


---------28:40----------
just start with where we ended off OLS


---------28:44----------
okay let's just think for a second okay


---------28:47----------
yep can I get water really quick yeah go


---------28:54----------
for it okay okay all right thanks I'll


---------28:56----------
be one side of all of the things you can


---------29:01----------
do get water is at the top of the list


---------29:05----------
so I know that twitch app thinks that


---------29:08----------
Mitch Jones is the rain boss I feel like


---------29:09----------
LS is the right boss man okay yeah okay


---------29:37----------
hey so being misunderstood being


---------29:48----------
misunderstood really bothers you


---------29:51----------
yeah yeah and and so if we think a


---------29:55----------
little hold on a second hello


---------30:02----------
what


---------30:05----------
okay I was just informed that there's an


---------30:12----------
ad running right now because you went to


---------30:13----------
go get Walker look Jackson okay which is


---------30:17----------
great because I need some time to think


---------30:19----------
okay oh man it's so much okay let me


---------30:25----------
just take notes okay okay I can do this


---------30:27----------
okay I can do this


---------31:06----------
okay so first of all you remember the


---------31:12----------
last time like so one of the big things


---------31:14----------
that I remembered about last time was


---------31:15----------
that I felt like you needed more you


---------31:18----------
needed to experience more anger like we


---------31:21----------
talked last time about how you


---------31:23----------
essentially blamed yourself for all


---------31:25----------
kinds of bad things that happen around


---------31:26----------
you instead of being angry with other


---------31:28----------
people yeah okay so my general sense I'm


---------31:34----------
gonna use this phrase bursting at the


---------31:36----------
seams okay yeah and what I what I what


---------31:42----------
I'm getting from you LS is that you're


---------31:44----------
basically bursting at the seams I think


---------31:46----------
you have a lot of stuff that's going on


---------31:48----------
inside of you that doesn't have a way to


---------31:51----------
get out and so you're like bursting at


---------31:54----------
the seams and there's like leakage so my


---------31:58----------
sense is that you have a lot of


---------31:59----------
suppression and this is why it like it


---------32:01----------
feels so


---------32:05----------
overwhelming and multifactorial because


---------32:07----------
it's like it's like firing on like it's


---------32:09----------
so many different directions there's


---------32:11----------
insomnia there's physical problems


---------32:13----------
there's anger there's uncertainty about


---------32:15----------
your future there's a community that's


---------32:17----------
hating you there's some kind of weird


---------32:19----------
defenses that you set up for yourself a


---------32:21----------
community that loves you there's


---------32:22----------
expectation there's you know like like


---------32:25----------
strike while the iron is hot and right


---------32:27----------
now it's the gold rush and you're going


---------32:29----------
to California because that's where the


---------32:31----------
gold is and like eSports and like soon


---------32:33----------
it's all gonna be over there's just so


---------32:35----------
much yeah like just listening to you is


---------32:38----------
overwhelming like I can't even imagine


---------32:41----------
what living and in your life is like


---------32:45----------
like it's like you can't catch a break


---------32:47----------
anywhere and I think that that's that's


---------32:51----------
something we've got to just figure out


---------32:53----------
because that's just not I mean you're


---------32:56----------
you're screwed my friend if you continue


---------32:58----------
doing what you're doing and and going at


---------33:00----------
this pace oddly enough you may be very


---------33:02----------
successful but I think you're gonna pay


---------33:05----------
for that success and I do believe that


---------33:07----------
you can continue to be successful


---------33:09----------
without bursting at the seams so let's


---------33:13----------
start with this you don't like being


---------33:15----------
misunderstood you're talking to flat


---------33:18----------
earthers and they don't they don't


---------33:20----------
understand you can't show them and you


---------33:22----------
just want them you want them to


---------33:24----------
understand you want them to understand


---------33:26----------
your viewpoint you want them to


---------33:27----------
understand like what you're saying you


---------33:29----------
want like you want you want to be like


---------33:31----------
on the same team with them you don't


---------33:33----------
want to be oppositional with them


---------33:34----------
there's some amount of frustration


---------33:36----------
there's some amount of inability to show


---------33:37----------
them and then the other thing that I


---------33:39----------
think go for it now or I want them to


---------33:43----------
show me why the whatever it is that I'm


---------33:45----------
trying to say against their Flat Earth


---------33:47----------
is actually wrong fine right that isn't


---------33:50----------
just a versa I can get runs deeper so


---------33:53----------
that the other thing I said that this


---------33:55----------
rolls into your identity so I want you


---------33:57----------
to understand this very clearly okay so


---------33:59----------
I'm getting the sense that you can't


---------34:01----------
separate an argument from you like it


---------34:04----------
becomes about you yes right it's not


---------34:08----------
about like convincing like it's not it's


---------34:12----------
not sterile it's not it's not like


---------34:16----------
scientific it's not mathematical it's


---------34:19----------
like investment and who you are as a


---------34:20----------
person like there's your rolled up into


---------34:23----------
this does that make sense you're


---------34:25----------
invested yes yeah I think that that goes


---------34:29----------
to what I was saying about how deep I am


---------34:30----------
in eSports and yep


---------34:32----------
I also won't and I well I won't say I


---------34:37----------
will but I think often times I won't


---------34:39----------
even engage in a conversation if I don't


---------34:41----------
actually feel comfortable talking about


---------34:45----------
it I don't know if there's like a word


---------34:47----------
for that or phrase did you get what I


---------34:50----------
mean like you're avoidant unless you're


---------34:52----------
comfortable unless I feel comfortable


---------34:56----------
and competent in the material yeah so I


---------35:00----------
think this comes back to like you're


---------35:02----------
you're terrified of being misjudged yes


---------35:08----------
where does that work from I mean I I


---------35:18----------
would imagine it obviously stems from


---------35:21----------
something in childhood yeah we've talked


---------35:25----------
about four at the same time I don't know


---------35:28----------
if it really does okay


---------35:33----------
and the reason that I say I don't know


---------35:36----------
if it really does is because I think the


---------35:42----------
way that I thought of myself as a


---------35:45----------
preteen and a dazzle as an adolescence


---------35:48----------
was the opposite of what like teachers


---------35:51----------
and therapists and psychiatrists


---------35:52----------
psychologists success have thought of me


---------35:55----------
they thought better of me that I thought


---------35:57----------
of myself and so I guess that's a


---------36:02----------
misjudged thing but I don't


---------36:08----------
I don't know okay so so I'm gonna just


---------36:10----------
toss a Hail Mary okay so first of all


---------36:11----------
things aren't as simple as I make them


---------36:13----------
out to be okay so I think complicated


---------36:15----------
the first thing is as I'm hearing you


---------36:17----------
talk the thing that that I is actually


---------36:20----------
that you had some behavioral problems


---------36:22----------
right am i mixing you up with someone


---------36:23----------
else behavioral problems in what sense


---------36:26----------
like did you get in trouble at school I


---------36:29----------
was true and forced to drop out of high


---------36:32----------
school yeah


---------36:33----------
and so my education effectively it


---------36:36----------
stopped in like seventh grade


---------36:37----------
effectively yeah eighth grade so last


---------36:40----------
time we met we talked about


---------36:43----------
okay so what are you as he mentioned


---------36:46----------
that what are you feeling what as you


---------36:50----------
mentioned the truancy and what happened


---------36:51----------
to you and um I don't really mind it I


---------36:59----------
remember thinking that I wasn't gonna


---------37:02----------
use school or edu for anything and I


---------37:05----------
remember thinking in like ninth grade


---------37:07----------
tenth grade etc I would just wait for my


---------37:10----------
class to finish so that I could get the


---------37:12----------
that I could take the GED test because I


---------37:15----------
thought the material on the GED was


---------37:17----------
really simple but there's the law that


---------37:20----------
you have to wait for your graduating


---------37:21----------
class or you can take the test but you


---------37:24----------
have to wait for them to receive the


---------37:25----------
diploma something like that I don't know


---------37:28----------
I didn't want to go to school because I


---------37:31----------
didn't feel safe or comfortable at


---------37:32----------
school not because like anything like in


---------37:36----------
particular just a lot of things I guess


---------37:39----------
I was true in all the time I don't feel


---------37:44----------
anything in particular


---------37:45----------
I guess so I'm trying to figure out


---------37:51----------
maybe this isn't related but you know


---------37:53----------
there was a powerful story that you told


---------37:55----------
last time about you know when you were


---------37:57----------
like going through the truancy hearing


---------37:59----------
or something like that there one of the


---------38:01----------
teachers kind of like stopped and was


---------38:02----------
like no one is asking everyone's talking


---------38:05----------
about punishing him yeah but no one is


---------38:07----------
asking like why is he doing the things


---------38:10----------
that he does yeah is there anything


---------38:13----------
about that sentiment about being


---------38:16----------
misjudged judged by people held


---------38:18----------
accountable for things that are that


---------38:20----------
aren't your fault


---------38:21----------
that translates to today I


---------38:26----------
I would yeah I guess I would I would say


---------38:29----------
so


---------38:30----------
because I felt like I felt like speaking


---------38:33----------
the foreign language no one understood


---------38:35----------
me and it felt like people around me


---------38:41----------
that didn't understand me didn't make


---------38:43----------
any efforts to try to understand and


---------38:48----------
that was a very frustrating thing sort


---------38:51----------
of like what we're talking about right


---------38:53----------
now where it's like this is


---------38:55----------
ridiculous like why don't these why


---------38:58----------
don't these things these this context


---------39:00----------
why doesn't any of this matter to you


---------39:01----------
because it should all matter and yet for


---------39:04----------
some on hilarious and it doesn't


---------39:06----------
um and it just it doesn't make sense to


---------39:09----------
me who my whole thing is I try to run


---------39:13----------
through so many scenarios and things in


---------39:15----------
my head and I don't understand why other


---------39:17----------
people don't do the same or they don't


---------39:20----------
even attempt to understand yeah so I


---------39:25----------
mean I think the ridiculous is


---------39:27----------
kind of a good sentiment and and there's


---------39:30----------
also something let's a kind of like flat


---------39:32----------
earther ish about this to me you know


---------39:36----------
where it's sort of like people just


---------39:37----------
really do not try to understand it it's


---------39:41----------
just and so I'm not sure if I'm if it's


---------39:43----------
too loose of an association but


---------39:45----------
something at one well I I guess I would


---------39:50----------
ask you what like so to add some context


---------39:53----------
some of the stuff that I come out with


---------39:55----------
in the league scene right that has led


---------39:57----------
to a lot of controversy is imagined


---------40:02----------
because I don't know what games you play


---------40:04----------
imagine that everything is the way that


---------40:06----------
it is and then you come along and say no


---------40:09----------
this stuff's wrong I can show that it's


---------40:12----------
wrong but then a lot of people will


---------40:15----------
outwardly just dismiss it so maybe an


---------40:18----------
analogy I can make here is like in


---------40:20----------
science if it is they just talk about


---------40:24----------
League


---------40:25----------
okay so in in in league there's a lot of


---------40:31----------
concepts that I guess RT so


---------40:34----------
interestingly enough I I've had lots of


---------40:36----------
conversations with RTS players and they


---------40:39----------
they accept it a lot better than mobile


---------40:41----------
players do and it's the most


---------40:43----------
brain blasting thing in the world it


---------40:45----------
blows my mind


---------40:46----------
so in league of legends there will be


---------40:49----------
instances in pro play where there is no


---------40:52----------
objective on the map right there's do


---------40:54----------
you play league sure or no okay I


---------40:57----------
understand now I'll play dota ok


---------40:59----------
you play dota okay so is there neutral


---------41:01----------
objectives in DotA yeah like big things


---------41:03----------
okay so imagine there's very neutral


---------41:06----------
objective yeah sure like Baron great


---------41:09----------
yeah so imagine there's no neutral up


---------41:11----------
right and that means that there's


---------41:15----------
nothing to really contest or standing


---------41:18----------
gold on turrets can be about 500 right


---------41:22----------
500 is about two and a half million


---------41:24----------
waves


---------41:24----------
worth of gold without factoring in


---------41:26----------
experience okay so if you're winning


---------41:30----------
right if the enemy shoves a wave too


---------41:33----------
quickly for exams for example this can


---------41:36----------
allow you to take that wave and pull it


---------41:38----------
really far up your lane and then freeze


---------41:40----------
and then those minions can kill your


---------41:44----------
incoming minion wave over and over


---------41:46----------
several times it can actually net you a


---------41:49----------
higher gold value than a turret would


---------41:52----------
like it like a standing gold turret and


---------41:55----------
not even factoring an XP it also reduces


---------41:59----------
the amount of options both you have and


---------42:03----------
your opponent's have on the map because


---------42:06----------
everything the variables are reduced it


---------42:08----------
becomes very clear-cut like using


---------42:11----------
deductive reasoning what can and can't


---------42:13----------
happen okay um so this is this is one of


---------42:15----------
the more like recent things that's


---------42:17----------
happened um what do you mean by freeze


---------42:19----------
what does freeze me freezes they so for


---------42:23----------
instance if they had six minions and you


---------42:25----------
and you had six minions and they sort of


---------42:27----------
clash they killed your six minions you


---------42:30----------
take their six minions and you run it up


---------42:32----------
your lane without killing them yep now


---------42:34----------
when the next waves come they'll have 12


---------42:37----------
minions and you'll still have six so


---------42:39----------
your six minion


---------42:40----------
we'll die and if you can hold that by


---------42:43----------
freezing like keeping them at a certain


---------42:45----------
point and just constantly holding it


---------42:47----------
there they are forced to come and


---------42:49----------
eventually break it or they're forced to


---------42:51----------
do something else on the map okay but if


---------42:54----------
you're winning and your champions are


---------42:57----------
stronger and you have more items


---------42:59----------
obviously they cannot arbitrarily just


---------43:02----------
teleport anywhere on the map or


---------43:04----------
they can't just randomly die of a turret


---------43:06----------
because turrets are still really strong


---------43:07----------
the champions are still weak you can end


---------43:10----------
up getting more gold in creating a


---------43:13----------
larger net difference between you and


---------43:15----------
the enemy team as well as experience by


---------43:18----------
just freezing and then obviously you


---------43:21----------
know okay well you can only go into a


---------43:23----------
few places so I've had this conversation


---------43:25----------
with lots of RTS plays players it's


---------43:28----------
pretty easily accepted but with mobile


---------43:31----------
players for some reason it's


---------43:32----------
like flattering and it just doesn't make


---------43:34----------
any sense


---------43:35----------
the really weird thing is in the


---------43:36----------
community some people even even people


---------43:41----------
with high stature within the community


---------43:43----------
will say that you can't freeze or it's


---------43:45----------
not possible but wha


---------43:47----------
I have so many examples of freezing at


---------43:50----------
professional play from pro players and


---------43:52----------
there's also a lot of pro players that


---------43:54----------
are on this in alignment that freezing


---------43:57----------
can exist but there are also pro players


---------43:59----------
that are like no you can't freeze


---------44:01----------
because we can just do a b c and d and


---------44:04----------
it's a very frustrating thing because it


---------44:07----------
it feels very akin to flat earth where i


---------44:11----------
sort of like the misjudge thing will


---------44:13----------
never assert that a team can freeze


---------44:15----------
unless i really think that it's possible


---------44:17----------
like I'm not just gonna arbitrarily say


---------44:19----------
odds they should just blanketly freeze


---------44:22----------
so variables and conditions have to be


---------44:25----------
met for it to occur as like a


---------44:26----------
strategical maneuver and there's clear


---------44:29----------
upside that is related to like economy


---------44:31----------
an economy management is the thing that


---------44:33----------
is very common in our TSS but not and


---------44:36----------
when some not common in MOBA and in in


---------44:41----------
MOBAs players tend to only think about


---------44:43----------
their one champion but in RTS is you


---------44:46----------
think about lots of important champions


---------44:48----------
in lots of different important locations


---------44:51----------
and you're forced to make a you know


---------44:53----------
a major decision on how you're gonna


---------44:55----------
allocate and do certain things and so


---------44:58----------
because my first games we're Starcraft 1


---------45:00----------
Starcraft 2 and whatnot and also playing


---------45:03----------
card games a call an economy and


---------45:05----------
resource management and like how long it


---------45:08----------
takes units to move across the map


---------45:09----------
timing attacks how much damage they do


---------45:12----------
how little can you actually have and


---------45:16----------
still defend these are all RTS things


---------45:19----------
like like playing risk or monopoly or


---------45:21----------
lots of board games and I just I want to


---------45:25----------
blow my brains out when someone


---------45:27----------
with pretty high stature maybe in the


---------45:30----------
community will come along and assert


---------45:32----------
that it's not possible and I feel like


---------45:35----------
I'm speaking a different language so


---------45:37----------
then there's the there's the problem


---------45:39----------
where I can get certain other people to


---------45:42----------
agree in certain other pro players and I


---------45:44----------
can also have clear-cut examples playing


---------45:46----------
against some of the top like regional


---------45:50----------
teams in the world right videos video


---------45:52----------
proof tangible evidence things that can


---------45:55----------
be replicated quantifiable things still


---------45:59----------
there's just something too


---------46:01----------
exists for people they'll throw they'll


---------46:03----------
throw blanket statements Hail Marys like


---------46:05----------
they'll say that vision is important or


---------46:07----------
they'll say that champions can just dive


---------46:09----------
a turret and it's an impossible argument


---------46:13----------
to really handle verbally or that's how


---------46:17----------
I feel


---------46:18----------
Ellis first of all this is way better


---------46:20----------
for them this is a glimpse you're just


---------46:22----------
talking about one thing now so this is


---------46:24----------
easier for me to manage so now these


---------46:26----------
please don't get to we still get to just


---------46:29----------
the core issue which is why D why is it


---------46:31----------
important to you for to you to convince


---------46:32----------
these people well I feel like it's a


---------46:36----------
part of my job but also I want well my


---------46:39----------
jobs to analyze them coach fine


---------46:42----------
so your your job is to Anna so hold on a


---------46:45----------
second so analysis you're a coach


---------46:49----------
well I have Co I mean I still do


---------46:51----------
freelance coaching for various like LCS


---------46:53----------
and all AC players so analysis is very


---------46:56----------
different from convincing people


---------46:59----------
like why do you feel like you have to


---------47:01----------
convince people okay so if you were a


---------47:04----------
scientist and you discovered certain


---------47:08----------
things but the scientific board says


---------47:11----------
that you're wrong that can actually


---------47:13----------
really harm your career potentially it


---------47:17----------
can call into question your credibility


---------47:19----------
term then it becomes very frustrating if


---------47:22----------
you can quantify or replicate the things


---------47:27----------
that you're talking about like like a


---------47:28----------
test right like you can you mean that's


---------47:30----------
how it works in science that you can go


---------47:32----------
and recreate if you talk about freezing


---------47:35----------
and how it creates an economic advantage


---------47:37----------
bar in certain circumstances like no


---------47:39----------
neutral objectives on the map how does


---------47:43----------
that affect your career if lots of


---------47:47----------
people dissent against it some that are


---------47:50----------
even prolific within the community that


---------47:52----------
can be really bad because then if I get


---------47:56----------
labeled as so some people genuinely


---------47:59----------
think I'm a contrarian I say things just


---------48:01----------
to disagree dissent against the majority


---------48:03----------
opinion etc that is very common and then


---------48:06----------
you tell them no I'm not then I tell


---------48:09----------
them no you were flat earther


---------48:10----------
like holy I get really I get really


---------48:26----------
I think maybe you're familiar with the


---------48:29----------
term triggered yeah and I sit here in my


---------48:31----------
house with some of the people I live


---------48:34----------
with one of them is actually one of the


---------48:36----------
he might be the highest ranked Western


---------48:39----------
Terran Starcraft one player still in


---------48:41----------
stock f1 Nyoka


---------48:44----------
there's WCG USA finalists a couple of


---------48:47----------
times whatever in starcraft one anyway


---------48:49----------
so anyways I talk with him I talked with


---------48:52----------
max person that I live with and we will


---------48:55----------
just sit there for two to three hours


---------48:57----------
and literally play devil's advocate


---------48:59----------
trying to figure out ways to strangle


---------49:01----------
these conversations and it's so


---------49:04----------
insufferable yeah man so look what I


---------49:06----------
want to point out to you is that the


---------49:08----------
convincing someone right like so


---------49:09----------
convincing the scientific board so


---------49:11----------
you've made it clear


---------49:13----------
sorry I keep on having false starts with


---------49:15----------
sentences that's okay my words can't


---------49:19----------
catch up to what my mind is kind of


---------49:21----------
thinking about so let me just think for


---------49:22----------
a second so Ellis I think a big problem


---------49:28----------
that you run into is that your logic is


---------49:31----------
good so when we think about you know


---------49:35----------
when you think about sort of the gold


---------49:36----------
rush of esports right now and you think


---------49:39----------
about missed opportunities and


---------49:40----------
uncertainty about the future your logic


---------49:43----------
is good right so if if now for the first


---------49:46----------
time you can Co stream League events


---------49:48----------
that's not an opportunity you want to


---------49:50----------
miss out on because like once the field


---------49:52----------
gets saturated and people like go to


---------49:54----------
particular streamers like it's hard to


---------49:57----------
start streaming later there's the


---------50:00----------
problem is that your logic is good and


---------50:02----------
when it comes to the the potential


---------50:04----------
impact of you know being viewed as a


---------50:08----------
contrary Anor disrespected by other


---------50:10----------
people in the community how that affects


---------50:13----------
your standing and how that affects your


---------50:15----------
professional situation that also the


---------50:19----------
logic is good not disagreeing with any


---------50:22----------
of your logic what I'm curious about is


---------50:25----------
your personal investment right so if I'm


---------50:28----------
a scientist and I so I mean I I do this


---------50:31----------
right so I I go to let's say like I have


---------50:33----------
a prospective collaboration with like


---------50:36----------
MIT for healthy gamer and studying video


---------50:38----------
game addiction so I kind of go to some


---------50:40----------
people we've also had calls with you


---------50:43----------
know other institutions or organizations


---------50:45----------
and we actually had a great call with


---------50:50----------
Ryan a couple of weeks ago so we you


---------50:54----------
know if I go to someone and I say like


---------50:56----------
hey I think this is important and they


---------50:59----------
say no we disagree we don't think it's


---------51:00----------
important that can be strategically bad


---------51:05----------
but like I don't have to get bent out of


---------51:07----------
shape what I'm really curious about is


---------51:10----------
why you get so personally bent out of


---------51:13----------
shape like what what about this is


---------51:15----------
triggering or tilting like as people can


---------51:17----------
be idiots but what's your personal


---------51:20----------
investment like flat like so flat


---------51:24----------
earthers


---------51:26----------
you know or idiotic I think but growing


---------51:30----------
up I was called a liar a lot because


---------51:33----------
there were phases of my life where I did


---------51:35----------
have to lie a lot because there would be


---------51:38----------
instances where with my family they


---------51:41----------
would ask me a question and if I knew


---------51:43----------
that if I responded truthfully or


---------51:45----------
honestly it would result in an outburst


---------51:48----------
or it's something something physically


---------51:51----------
uncomfortable would occur okay and so as


---------51:54----------
a means to defuse the situation I would


---------51:56----------
lie instantly and I would develop ways


---------51:58----------
to lie instantly and that stuck with me


---------52:03----------
through preteen as well as teenage life


---------52:08----------
even so even when I stopped lying once I


---------52:11----------
felt more safe and secure with my own


---------52:15----------
identity as well as just knowing how


---------52:18----------
certain situations weren't gonna go etc


---------52:20----------
I think there's something about so this


---------52:23----------
actually goes back to the living in a


---------52:25----------
glass house recording everything etc I


---------52:27----------
think that if I present something and


---------52:32----------
someone just says no it's wrong I feel


---------52:36----------
like that is very akin to being called a


---------52:38----------
liar and when it's about a job that I'm


---------52:41----------
so invested into emotionally and


---------52:43----------
physically with the amount of time that


---------52:45----------
I sink into it


---------52:46----------
it disturbs me on a really pretty deep


---------52:50----------
emotional level that I think other


---------52:52----------
people with my same job titles wouldn't


---------52:56----------
actually understand because this is all


---------52:58----------
that I do and it's not that I can't


---------53:01----------
assert like you on an emotional level


---------53:03----------
what gets disturbed


---------53:06----------
it blows my mind that how how I don't


---------53:15----------
know how to answer it there's like a lot


---------53:32----------
of different images in my head a night I


---------53:34----------
don't know how to translate them into


---------53:35----------
words okay yeah I think so let me Alice


---------53:42----------
I think we're getting somewhere


---------53:43----------
and I think the basic issue here is that


---------53:45----------
you're not fighting the individual


---------53:48----------
battle from today you're fighting a host


---------53:51----------
every conversation that you have with


---------53:53----------
people every disagreement that you have


---------53:54----------
with people about strategy like you said


---------53:57----------
it makes you feel like a liar right and


---------54:00----------
so what it's actually Avoca within you


---------54:02----------
is like all of that stuff so so I think


---------54:07----------
the reason you're so invested personally


---------54:09----------
in these conversations which frankly


---------54:11----------
sounds kind of idiotic right so there's


---------54:13----------
a there's a saying in Sanskrit we got to


---------54:15----------
pass a guard Bhagwat or my language and


---------54:20----------
past I gotta pass what means reading the


---------54:22----------
Bible to a buffalo and it's like it's


---------54:26----------
like you're just gonna get frustration


---------54:28----------
like some situations or the equivalent


---------54:30----------
of trying to read the Bible to a buffalo


---------54:32----------
and it's just dumb like it's like if you


---------54:35----------
try to do it you can try to read as


---------54:37----------
beautifully and as convincingly as you


---------54:39----------
want but at the end of the day you're


---------54:40----------
just talking to a buffalo so they're


---------54:43----------
just not gonna understand and and what


---------54:46----------
what I hear are you doing is like trying


---------54:48----------
really really hard to convince people


---------54:50----------
and and to me it sounds you know your


---------54:52----------
your arguments have logic but I don't


---------54:55----------
think that your need to convince them


---------54:58----------
even though standing within the


---------55:00----------
community and stuff is like all


---------55:01----------
important there's clearly something else


---------55:04----------
that's driving you because like Flat


---------55:06----------
Earth earnest and standing in the


---------55:08----------
community or like completely separate


---------55:10----------
issues the Flat Earth earnest about the


---------55:13----------
the ridiculousness of it the perception


---------55:15----------
of being a liar the sort of living your


---------55:18----------
life in a glass house


---------55:19----------
all of these things have nothing to do


---------55:21----------
with your standing in the community


---------55:22----------
their adaptations or maladaptation x'


---------55:26----------
and we can talk about that too like


---------55:28----------
helping you manage like whatever this


---------55:31----------
thing is on the inside yes and I think


---------55:35----------
what happens with you is that when you


---------55:36----------
get into an argument with someone you're


---------55:39----------
trying to convince everyone in your past


---------55:42----------
in that moment and this is kind of weird


---------55:45----------
and messed up but unfortunately it's


---------55:46----------
just how our mind works just the rules


---------55:48----------
of the game you're trying to convince


---------55:50----------
everyone who thought you were a liar


---------55:52----------
right like everyone who judged you and


---------55:55----------
everyone who said this kid is wrong this


---------55:57----------
kid is crazy this kid is stupid and


---------56:00----------
you're trying to fight like all of those


---------56:02----------
battles in that moment because that's


---------56:04----------
the only way that you can get so much


---------56:07----------
emotional energy into an individual


---------56:10----------
conflict because it can't you just can't


---------56:12----------
leave that bent out of shape arguing


---------56:15----------
with some noob on a discussion forum


---------56:17----------
about whether you're strapped like it


---------56:19----------
just doesn't make sense right and like


---------56:25----------
that's the condition of the internet so


---------56:27----------
if we look at like toxicity and anger


---------56:29----------
and tilting on the internet like do you


---------56:31----------
really think every guy who gets super


---------56:33----------
super bent out of shape is like deeply


---------56:36----------
and personally invested in every single


---------56:38----------
reddit thread that they posted know it's


---------56:40----------
like misdirected anger and toxicity and


---------56:43----------
misjudgment like in the rest of their


---------56:46----------
world and I see this a lot like the the


---------56:48----------
more ashamed you are of yourself in the


---------56:50----------
real world the more important it is for


---------56:52----------
you to maintain a respectable online


---------56:54----------
persona because all of their shame like


---------56:58----------
they use like you know they teach noobs


---------57:00----------
on the internet like you Smurfs in law


---------57:03----------
so that you could feel good about


---------57:05----------
yourself and like generally speaking the


---------57:06----------
people who Smurfs you know like suck in


---------57:09----------
life are not confident in themselves in


---------57:11----------
some way right that's it that's my


---------57:14----------
personal toxicity towards Smurfs because


---------57:16----------
I have an issue in it so I say ne suck


---------57:18----------
at life right but anyway yeah yeah so


---------57:22----------
that's nice thing you brought that up my


---------57:24----------
point is that like like you know you're


---------57:26----------
not just talking to a person there's


---------57:28----------
like a whole pile of stuff and this goes


---------57:31----------
back to like bursting at


---------57:33----------
the scene so like let me just tell you


---------57:34----------
like just listen to this okay so


---------57:39----------
stressing out stressed insomnia fear


---------57:42----------
about the future anxiety it's my whole


---------57:45----------
life


---------57:46----------
psychosomatic stuff physical stuff anger


---------57:50----------
you know flat-earthers you just can't


---------57:54----------
understand it your whole life is caught


---------57:56----------
up in this like esports like respect


---------57:59----------
financial security like this all this


---------58:02----------
didn't this go I get impostor syndrome a


---------58:05----------
lot sometimes yeah when I have these


---------58:08----------
arguments in these conversations and


---------58:09----------
then so in the first meeting that we had


---------58:12----------
you you asked if I end up blaming myself


---------58:14----------
so at the end of this I blame myself


---------58:17----------
because I think that there's a better


---------58:18----------
way to attack the arguments and attack


---------58:20----------
the the problems yeah so but then I


---------58:23----------
wonder if I'm crazy or something


---------58:26----------
and you know like so it's it's a loop


---------58:30----------
yeah absolutely


---------58:31----------
so Ellis here's my point like when


---------58:33----------
someone says there are 50 million things


---------58:35----------
wrong I just don't think that there are


---------58:37----------
50 million things wrong so one of my


---------58:40----------
supervisors when I was in med school or


---------58:42----------
like one of the psychiatrist I was


---------58:43----------
working with one of the people who


---------58:44----------
inspired me to go to psychiatry once


---------58:47----------
told me that if any patient has three


---------58:49----------
diagnoses they're all wrong so sometimes


---------58:51----------
like we'd get these patients that have


---------58:53----------
like had this freaking alphabet of


---------58:56----------
diagnoses MD DG ad PTSD ad D


---------59:01----------
you know like it's like just a bunch of


---------59:03----------
letters and it's like that's not like I


---------59:06----------
don't think that this person has four


---------59:08----------
discrete processes that are going on in


---------59:12----------
their like mind I don't think they have


---------59:15----------
like four different circuits that are


---------59:17----------
busted like there's one like link


---------59:19----------
there's common stuff there's something


---------59:21----------
that is manifesting his depression


---------59:23----------
manifesting his anxiety making it


---------59:25----------
difficult for them to concentrate and


---------59:27----------
oftentimes it's trauma like traumas like


---------59:29----------
where all this crap starts and you've


---------59:31----------
had your fair share and so I think that


---------59:35----------
when you have all of these like like


---------59:36----------
issues around you know stressing out


---------59:39----------
insomnia like I don't think that's the


---------59:40----------
problem I think the basic problem is


---------59:42----------
that you've got some stuff from the past


---------59:44----------
which like acts on the present and you


---------59:47----------
don't deal with the stuff from the past


---------59:49----------
so another way to kind of say that is


---------59:52----------
you said the the first week went well


---------59:55----------
like earlier like at the very beginning


---------59:57----------
of this conversation you said yeah I


---------59:58----------
managed week one well week two is when


---------60:00----------
the problems started and I wanted to


---------60:02----------
stop you right there and I was like no


---------60:03----------
my friend the mistake was in week one


---------60:06----------
because week one is when you let that


---------60:09----------
 the problem is that the only time


---------60:11----------
you notice that there's trash to be


---------60:13----------
emptied is when your trashcan is


---------60:14----------
overflowing that's what your life looks


---------60:17----------
like in a nutshell like the problem is


---------60:21----------
that you're like oh there's like trash


---------60:22----------
on the floor oh maybe I like oh like


---------60:25----------
there's that my trashcan is overflowing


---------60:27----------
so let me just take all of the stuff on


---------60:29----------
the top that's spilling out and throw


---------60:31----------
that away and we're gonna leave all the


---------60:33----------
other trash in the trash can we're just


---------60:35----------
gonna take all the stuff that's spilling


---------60:37----------
over the top and we're gonna deal with


---------60:38----------
that but your problem is in that first


---------60:40----------
week you're kind of saying like okay I'm


---------60:43----------
gonna do this I'm gonna crucify myself


---------60:45----------
for 1/10 hour work weeks because they're


---------60:47----------
really good opportunities here and then


---------60:49----------
I'll take a break later and then I'm


---------60:51----------
gonna go back to crusing find myself


---------60:52----------
your whole system of managing whatever


---------60:55----------
it is that you're managing I think is


---------60:57----------
not working well and that's why it's


---------61:00----------
like you have stuff that's like seeping


---------61:02----------
out it's like getting like tilting it at


---------61:06----------
noobs who don't understand like I don't


---------61:08----------
I don't I don't get and I mean I do get


---------61:12----------
but I'm gonna just say like so you know


---------61:14----------
if you really are


---------61:14----------
saying the validity of your argument and


---------61:17----------
someone is too dumb to get it


---------61:21----------
like that


---------61:25----------
makes me feel like once you sort of get


---------61:27----------
that you don't try to convince them


---------61:29----------
anymore because you realize it's a lost


---------61:31----------
cause but you get tilted and then like


---------61:35----------
your body also starts giving out and you


---------61:37----------
get like allergen and asthma problems


---------61:39----------
and stuff like that and and so it's it's


---------61:42----------
just like literally like you're you're


---------61:43----------
building up I don't know I wish there


---------61:46----------
was like some word for you know like


---------61:51----------
DEET like not debuff it's like it you're


---------61:53----------
just building up like stress it's like


---------61:55----------
you have a stress if you play darkest


---------61:57----------
dungeon this is what it is no you guys


---------62:00----------
play okay so like in darkest dungeon


---------62:01----------
it's a fantastic game by the way I mean


---------62:03----------
if you're like in a competitive games


---------62:05----------
it's not like it's a single-player game


---------62:06----------
so darkest dungeon it's it's like cool


---------62:08----------
so you have this party right and like


---------62:09----------
the idea behind this is like your party


---------62:12----------
is gonna get screwed so you like your


---------62:13----------
characters die there's perma death they


---------62:15----------
like get like they get like Pete they


---------62:17----------
literally get PTSD and they like can't


---------62:19----------
fight properly and stuff like that it's


---------62:20----------
like an amazing kind of game and so what


---------62:22----------
happens so darkest dungeon introduced a


---------62:24----------
really cool concept in gaming which I


---------62:26----------
don't see very much which is we always


---------62:28----------
have like HP bars and MP bars we have


---------62:31----------
like resources that we use up and


---------62:35----------
diminish over time and then when we get


---------62:37----------
empty we die right like when you run out


---------62:40----------
of HP is when you die an agency starts


---------62:43----------
full and you kind of run out of HP so


---------62:44----------
darkest dungeon actually did the


---------62:46----------
opposite to where they added this this


---------62:48----------
stat called stress and as your stress


---------62:51----------
increases your character like gets


---------62:54----------
screwed so like you're in this dungeon


---------62:55----------
where like people are getting like every


---------62:57----------
time you get a critical every time your


---------62:59----------
character gets critically hit everyone


---------63:01----------
in your party gets like like stress so


---------63:05----------
like stress is like zero out of 200 so


---------63:07----------
they got like nine points of stress and


---------63:09----------
then once you win hit 100 they like they


---------63:11----------
have to make like some kind of check and


---------63:13----------
if they like hit 100 and they don't make


---------63:15----------
that check properly


---------63:16----------
they get like some kind of permanent


---------63:18----------
debuff they get like a 30% missed chance


---------63:20----------
or like they lose like you know like


---------63:23----------
their disease resistance goes down


---------63:25----------
sometimes they start to panic and they


---------63:27----------
like won't act


---------63:28----------
like instead of like attacking they'll


---------63:30----------
just sit there and their pants and


---------63:32----------
and like so I think it's a cool game I


---------63:35----------
love the game but in your case I think


---------63:37----------
what's happening is you're building too


---------63:38----------
op stress like there's some meter within


---------63:41----------
you that is filling up and it's like


---------63:43----------
your trashcan is filling up filling up


---------63:44----------
filling up and the only time you notice


---------63:47----------
it is when it overflows and then what


---------63:49----------
you try to manage is the overflow it's


---------63:51----------
like I'm exhausted haven't slept let me


---------63:54----------
go get a banana bag that's like taking


---------63:56----------
the five bits of trash from the top of


---------63:58----------
your trash can and like taking them out


---------64:00----------
and throwing them away and leaving your


---------64:02----------
trashcan leftover yeah and the trash can


---------64:06----------
is filled up in week one like you put


---------64:08----------
your body like the the other problem is


---------64:10----------
that you're so resilient and your


---------64:12----------
willpower is so strong that you can


---------64:15----------
tolerate like it's like your you know


---------64:18----------
your Constitution can tolerate rotting


---------64:21----------
food in your trash can whereas like


---------64:24----------
other people can't tolerate that so they


---------64:25----------
clean out their trash in a bizarre way


---------64:27----------
your capacity your Constitution and your


---------64:30----------
resilience allow you to propagate


---------64:32----------
unhealthy situations to the breaking


---------64:34----------
point and there's something really


---------64:37----------
bizarre that I see in some people which


---------64:39----------
is that some people suffer like


---------64:41----------
consequences you know when they're at 70


---------64:44----------
percent 50 percent 30 percent and some


---------64:46----------
people don't bend some people only break


---------64:49----------
and I think you fall into this category


---------64:52----------
where like you you can function at a


---------64:55----------
very high level until your breaking


---------64:58----------
point and then you just snap yes in the


---------65:01----------
suit that happens the snaps happen


---------65:03----------
absolutely man


---------65:05----------
they know that they happen almost if I


---------65:08----------
could like pull in some of my roommates


---------65:10----------
or something to like answer I mean no


---------65:13----------
I'm not going to I'm just saying the


---------65:15----------
cycles tend to be about nine weeks and


---------65:18----------
then there's a very big snap and then


---------65:24----------
everything goes away and it's like it's


---------65:27----------
back to zero the snaps are really scary


---------65:32----------
not like yeah I don't know how to


---------65:34----------
describe them so yeah so this is


---------65:39----------
important for people who are watching


---------65:40----------
too so I want you guys to understand


---------65:42----------
like


---------65:42----------
your pattern is not uncommon in fact


---------65:44----------
when it comes to gamers I think they're


---------65:46----------
remarkably resilient so I think that


---------65:49----------
gamers are very good at dealing with


---------65:51----------
just gigantic piles of like a negative


---------65:53----------
emotion and other stuff right that's why


---------65:55----------
we all procrastinate and like don't deal


---------65:57----------
with our problems and stuff like that


---------65:58----------
and then like we have this you know it's


---------66:00----------
like you've got this basement that's


---------66:02----------
just full of crap and in your case I I


---------66:05----------
just don't think that your life is gonna


---------66:07----------
continue to be sustainable and the


---------66:10----------
challenge the challenge is that none of


---------66:13----------
your logic is wrong right like so from a


---------66:15----------
career standpoint it may be a good idea


---------66:16----------
to scream LCS it may be a good idea to


---------66:18----------
work 110 hours a week but I think that


---------66:21----------
working 110 hours a week and at the same


---------66:23----------
time spending half of your energy


---------66:25----------
tilting it noobs like you just don't


---------66:28----------
have the energy to tilt at news we've


---------66:31----------
not another working 110 hours a week I I


---------66:33----------
think um this most recent leak Saturday


---------66:37----------
my coke asterisms Brendan Valdez


---------66:41----------
I remember before set to started I was


---------66:45----------
actually welling up and I sort of like


---------66:47----------
laugh to him and I said I'm just gonna


---------66:49----------
I'm gonna have a breakdown and he looked


---------66:52----------
at me like what's wrong and I said I


---------66:53----------
don't know and I started


---------66:55----------
panicking because usually when I'm in a


---------67:00----------
work mode I won't have a breakdown or I


---------67:06----------
won't have like a snap but five minutes


---------67:09----------
before the cast went live I was welling


---------67:12----------
up my legs were shaking and I'm like


---------67:16----------
holy I'm just gonna start crying


---------67:18----------
and I was just feeling so many


---------67:21----------
emotions managed to get together


---------67:23----------
cast the second series went home and


---------67:27----------
 it went right to sleep but that


---------67:31----------
was a very unsettling thing but


---------67:33----------
sometimes there's just moments where all


---------67:35----------
I want to do is cry and scream and I


---------67:40----------
just want everything to stop


---------67:41----------
so and we agree with you what do you do


---------67:45----------
then LS when you wanna throw in


---------67:48----------
everything so you do pride scream oh


---------67:51----------
yeah sometimes and I ask I ask roommates


---------67:56----------
to like leave the house and stuff


---------67:57----------
and it's like literally something


---------67:59----------
happens like a drama or like you


---------68:01----------
know something to watch on Netflix I


---------68:02----------
literally just have an emotional


---------68:05----------
breakdown and I'm like okay I'm reset as


---------68:08----------
 crazy is that sound like let's


---------68:11----------
do it again yeah man yeah so now we're


---------68:21----------
gonna talk about we're gonna talk about


---------68:22----------
adaptive and maladaptive okay so we I'm


---------68:29----------
glad you're able to share all this stuff


---------68:31----------
hopefully you know the noobs won't


---------68:34----------
attack you for your freezing strategy


---------68:36----------
because of what you're saying here today


---------68:38----------
and and so well that's just so I want I


---------68:43----------
want people to understand this too so I


---------68:44----------
so your body your mind and your brain


---------68:47----------
does the best that it can with the crap


---------68:50----------
that you throw at it right like that's


---------68:52----------
just how like and so what happens is as


---------68:56----------
we deal with emotions like we're not


---------68:58----------
really taught this stuff which is a huge


---------69:00----------
huge problem like we are not really


---------69:02----------
taught how to deal with emotions we're


---------69:04----------
not really taught like how our mind


---------69:06----------
works we're not really taught this stuff


---------69:07----------
so our body just comes up and we come up


---------69:09----------
with the best solutions that we can


---------69:10----------
which are sort of adaptive and


---------69:13----------
maladaptive its adaptive because if we


---------69:15----------
think about like an adaptive you know


---------69:17----------
evolutionary trait it's something that


---------69:19----------
allows us to succeed in a particular


---------69:21----------
environment and in your case like I


---------69:23----------
think this sort of reset breakdown


---------69:25----------
whatever you have every nine weeks is


---------69:28----------
like it's actually like helps you


---------69:30----------
succeed like you like because you just


---------69:32----------
you know you have all these emotions


---------69:34----------
that kind of build up build up build up


---------69:36----------
you're like okay five minutes before


---------69:37----------
cast im Welling up I'm about to break


---------69:40----------
down okay like let me just let me shove


---------69:42----------
like this is like when you take your


---------69:43----------
hands and you like shove the trash you


---------69:45----------
pack the trash in your trashcan you pack


---------69:47----------
it down so that you can put more trash


---------69:49----------
in there we're gonna pack it down we're


---------69:51----------
gonna pack it down more put more


---------69:53----------
they're more more trash in there and


---------69:55----------
then soot like that's the strategy right


---------69:57----------
and then every once in a while like what


---------69:59----------
happens is your trash can starts to


---------70:00----------
bulge and then it starts to ferment and


---------70:03----------
it produces acid and then like one day


---------70:05----------
like just your trash can just breaks and


---------70:08----------
like falls apart and there's crap all


---------70:10----------
over you know your your kitchen and then


---------70:13----------
you scoop it all up and you clean it all


---------70:15----------
out and then and then you go and you get


---------70:17----------
yourself another you know paper trashcan


---------70:20----------
and then you you put it there and it's


---------70:22----------
the same trashcan that used last time


---------70:24----------
you're not gonna get a metal one you can


---------70:25----------
use the same one get yourself a trash


---------70:27----------
bag money you put it in and then and


---------70:30----------
then you just you start shoving stuff in


---------70:32----------
there again so but that works for you


---------70:36----------
right so like this is the crazy thing


---------70:37----------
when we think about all of this stuff


---------70:39----------
that you're describing insomnia you know


---------70:41----------
anxiety anger tilting break down it's


---------70:45----------
like we look at that and we say like oh


---------70:47----------
this must be mental illness incorrect


---------70:50----------
this is your system of adaptation


---------70:53----------
there's also something very important to


---------70:55----------
understand our mind does the best that


---------70:58----------
it can and so even situations like


---------71:00----------
anxiety is it like an illness sure but


---------71:03----------
in a lot of experience that I've seen


---------71:05----------
anxiety serves a very very important


---------71:08----------
mechanism


---------71:09----------
so usually anxiety is protective


---------71:12----------
so anxiety keeps us from doing the


---------71:15----------
things that are gonna make us like look


---------71:17----------
and feel dumb right like it protects


---------71:21----------
other people from ridiculing us if you


---------71:23----------
really stop and think about it like


---------71:24----------
that's what it's doing so anxiety is a


---------71:26----------
way that we can protect ourselves from


---------71:27----------
being like judged and viewed as idiots


---------71:29----------
so if we really look at all of this


---------71:32----------
stuff I mean not all of mental illness


---------71:33----------
because I don't think for example


---------71:34----------
schizophrenia has an adaptive mechanism


---------71:36----------
but in your case you know you have all


---------71:39----------
this stuff which people can like say is


---------71:41----------
like you know patterns of mind and it's


---------71:43----------
like actually like that's how you


---------71:45----------
function cuz you you can work a hundred


---------71:48----------
ten hours a week and then have a


---------71:49----------
breakdown reset and then it's back back


---------71:52----------
to working 110 now I think I think what


---------71:56----------
we've got to figure out is like do you


---------71:57----------
want to continue this are you happy with


---------72:00----------
where you are or do you want to change


---------72:05----------
I want to well I mean it goes it goes


---------72:08----------
back to what I what I said well okay I


---------72:11----------
guess I don't know how you're asking the


---------72:12----------
question do you want do you want to


---------72:16----------
continue doing what I'm doing or yeah


---------72:20----------
like like what am i my work and stuff do


---------72:24----------
you want something to change about your


---------72:25----------
life are you happy with things


---------72:27----------
continuing at their current track oh


---------72:30----------
Jesus no I yeah obvious


---------72:36----------
obviously in in private I always look


---------72:40----------
for ways that I think I think I


---------72:43----------
mentioned this and the first time that


---------72:44----------
we spoke look for ways to fix or change


---------72:49----------
something however difficult it is so


---------72:55----------
that this cycle stops breaking the cycle


---------72:58----------
is like what do you want to change order


---------73:00----------
I want the cycle to stop what is this


---------73:03----------
like the cycle is somehow convincing


---------73:08----------
myself to go beyond the breaking point


---------73:10----------
you know constantly working through


---------73:12----------
whatever right now I am in the best I'm


---------73:17----------
financially and just work wise and


---------73:21----------
everything I'm in the best place I've


---------73:23----------
ever been like I'm I'm at a peak right


---------73:25----------
now maybe it's gonna even keep going up


---------73:28----------
etc and yet I have like a feeling that


---------73:32----------
the only way that I can describe it is


---------73:33----------
homelessness and it is a very it is a


---------73:39----------
very dark feeling obviously it's very


---------73:42----------
devoid of anything and it feels so empty


---------73:46----------
and scary right and it's like sometimes


---------73:50----------
I'll have a conversation with someone


---------73:51----------
and they'll just remind me of so many


---------73:54----------
things and then it sort of helps


---------73:56----------
alleviate the the feeling and stuff


---------73:58----------
obviously I want that feeling to go away


---------74:00----------
because I think that that feeling helps


---------74:03----------
reinforce the cycle and it helps


---------74:06----------
reinforce so I need to figure out a way


---------74:08----------
to get my brain to accept and be content


---------74:15----------
with everything as it is right now


---------74:19----------
without feeling over panicked anxious


---------74:22----------
about everything and feeling like I'm in


---------74:24----------
a constant like fear of missing out if


---------74:26----------
that makes sense yeah while


---------74:28----------
simultaneously feeling empty so you said


---------74:31----------
the feeling is homelessness it feels


---------74:35----------
like homelessness okay


---------74:36----------
I wait to put it yeah so Ellis I think


---------74:40----------
at some point okay now we get to the you


---------74:43----------
know psychoanalytic kind of stuff so


---------74:45----------
thank you so much for for saying that I


---------74:47----------
I don't know what you know I don't know


---------74:49----------
what the perception of people who are


---------74:50----------
watching is I feel like we've talked


---------74:53----------
about a lot of stuff kind of tied stuff


---------74:54----------
together but I think we're like at a


---------74:56----------
really good spot now


---------75:01----------
Gillies I mean I am in terms of I think


---------75:04----------
there's yeah you need to take a minute I


---------75:06----------
I have had an anxiety no no I've had


---------75:08----------
anxiety all week this is um like in an


---------75:11----------
unhealthy kind of way this is the best


---------75:14----------
I've been breathing in like a week


---------75:18----------
so I actually thought it was asthma so


---------75:20----------
like just before we started this call


---------75:22----------
actually I took my I took my albuterol


---------75:25----------
and my advair yeah and just so that


---------75:28----------
there wouldn't be any breathing


---------75:29----------
difficulties whatever but now I'm


---------75:31----------
realizing that it's not as m''e and that


---------75:32----------
there was just a shitload of


---------75:34----------
anxiety going on because I can breathe


---------75:35----------
really well right now


---------75:36----------
so odd and it feels like you know the


---------75:39----------
person sitting on me just sort of got up


---------75:41----------
so the conversations been helpful in


---------75:43----------
that regard all right but uh


---------75:46----------
sucks man holy


---------75:47----------
I can breathe it right now it's been a


---------75:51----------
while you know it's coming back though


---------75:56----------
coming back you mean the elephant is


---------75:58----------
starting the fat guy sitting on you just


---------75:59----------
suckin the whale back that that whale


---------76:04----------
who plays lul and does it agree with the


---------76:06----------
idea of freezing he says you just need


---------76:08----------
money well it's just one it's all it's


---------76:11----------
all one guy this is the thing Ellis it's


---------76:14----------
all one guys like seriously when you


---------76:16----------
tilt on them it's like so this is the


---------76:18----------
thing the body and mind are linked right


---------76:21----------
so when you say oh I didn't I didn't I


---------76:23----------
realize it's not asthma I actually


---------76:25----------
disagree so now we come to psychosomatic


---------76:28----------
right


---------76:29----------
this is making me have asthma I the two


---------76:32----------
are linked it's like your body and mind


---------76:34----------
are linked so anxiety makes asthma worse


---------76:36----------
so like so the the conditions that are


---------76:40----------
autoimmune are significantly altered by


---------76:43----------
your mental state so rheumatoid


---------76:46----------
arthritis things like chronic Lyme


---------76:47----------
disease asthma IBS all autoimmune


---------76:52----------
conditions are heavily influenced by the


---------76:54----------
mind and what's happening is when that


---------76:57----------
when your trashcan is overflowing you


---------77:00----------
feel it in terms of emotions but it's


---------77:02----------
also gonna manifest as asthma okay so


---------77:06----------
this is important I don't want you to


---------77:07----------
think because a lot of people think that


---------77:08----------
psychosomatic means all in your head I


---------77:11----------
don't think the asthma is all in your


---------77:13----------
head I think the only way that your body


---------77:15----------
knows how to process the stress it's


---------77:19----------
like your body is starting to give out


---------77:21----------
right like well you've got five lanes


---------77:22----------
and League and if you're under pressure


---------77:24----------
sometimes one of the one of the your


---------77:26----------
champions is gonna give out so asthma is


---------77:28----------
one way of you giving out the breakdown


---------77:30----------
is another way of you get giving out you


---------77:32----------
know yelling at noobs is a third way to


---------77:34----------
for you to break when those are all


---------77:36----------
signs of like fracturing right that's


---------77:39----------
the trash can overflowing and so the


---------77:41----------
cool thing is that when you talk like


---------77:43----------
this and you start to get some sense and


---------77:45----------
like why do you think you feel better


---------77:46----------
now like what have we done um I don't


---------77:52----------
know I I think just having a


---------77:56----------
conversation with someone helps a lot


---------77:57----------
because I don't actually get to UM I


---------78:01----------
don't have to talk about cuz usually um


---------78:04----------
some people that I'll talk to about


---------78:06----------
these very things they'll just it's not


---------78:11----------
really a conversation it's like I don't


---------78:14----------
know how to describe it's sort of like a


---------78:16----------
I don't know how to describe it okay so


---------78:20----------
actually I'll tell you the way that I


---------78:23----------
describe it to some of my roommates I am


---------78:26----------
a dog that everyone wants to be around


---------78:29----------
until I start barking and then when I


---------78:31----------
start barking they want to lock me in a


---------78:34----------
room and until the barking stops they


---------78:36----------
don't want to treat the barking or why


---------78:37----------
is the dog barking so that's that that's


---------78:41----------
the conversation with your teacher


---------78:43----------
that that's a similar conversation that


---------78:46----------
that's how I feel yeah I feel like a


---------78:48----------
barking dog and you know what actually


---------78:50----------
cares what yeah yeah absolutely right so


---------78:53----------
that sounds way closer to me to this


---------78:56----------
this thing with your teacher when she


---------78:57----------
was like why is this kid having


---------78:59----------
behavioral problems and this is the


---------79:01----------
problem LS is that like deep down I


---------79:03----------
think your sense of identity that I'm


---------79:06----------
gonna stop okay let's go back to the


---------79:08----------
sources actually that while I am


---------79:10----------
enamored with my ability to formulate


---------79:12----------
and understand people I don't know how


---------79:14----------
helpful that's gonna be um so let's go


---------79:18----------
back to why does this help like how does


---------79:21----------
this work we're just talking um there's


---------79:27----------
something humane about it okay


---------79:31----------
whereas most times I think when I talk


---------79:33----------
to people I am the idea or the


---------79:36----------
personification of my character within


---------79:39----------
the eSports community sure and that I'm


---------79:41----------
not me and that my problems are only a


---------79:45----------
detriment to whoever I'm talking to and


---------79:48----------
it we move better if I go back to just


---------79:52----------
being LS who they need me to be yeah


---------79:55----------
right so I was saying deep down your


---------79:58----------
identity dot dot dot so we'll come back


---------79:59----------
to that so good you went there so I


---------80:02----------
didn't need to go there but so I want to


---------80:05----------
understand from a mechanistic so let's


---------80:06----------
let's think about mechanism okay so


---------80:08----------
let's pretend we're playing an RTS and


---------80:10----------
the RTS is talking to LS on stream with


---------80:13----------
dr. k and and we noticed something which


---------80:16----------
is that like LS is breathing is improved


---------80:19----------
he feels better what what did we if we


---------80:22----------
go back and we watch the replay like


---------80:23----------
what's the mechanism tell me like how is


---------80:25----------
this happening using any of the language


---------80:29----------
or any of the imagery that we've talked


---------80:32----------
about today like how is this helping you


---------80:33----------
like what's happening I think a lot of


---------80:39----------
it is it's helping me feel or I don't


---------80:42----------
know if the phrase is less crazy but it


---------80:46----------
feels it's sort of like when no one


---------80:51----------
wants to listen to you or believe or


---------80:53----------
talk about any of the things that you're


---------80:54----------
saying but then you have a conversation


---------80:56----------
with someone that's just willing


---------80:58----------
it's sort of like a it's sort of


---------81:01----------
like when when someone says I don't even


---------81:09----------
know again I'm just seeing images I


---------81:11----------
don't can you dislike you know one of


---------81:15----------
the images is a girl breaking down and


---------81:17----------
like a diner she's in a booth and she's


---------81:20----------
just talking to a waitress and she just


---------81:22----------
starts crying and says finally I know


---------81:25----------
that sounds really weird I I think in a


---------81:26----------
lot of describe I just see lots of


---------81:29----------
images and I try to put them into words


---------81:31----------
I think that was very illustrative thank


---------81:35----------
you so it just it it it feels like holy


---------81:39----------
 you know like everyone just doesn't


---------81:41----------
care or want to listen to her and then


---------81:43----------
finally the waitress or something is


---------81:45----------
just willing to talk and it's just so


---------81:47----------
overwhelming that it's like a


---------81:49----------
floodgate you know someone's you know


---------81:52----------
yeah pretty much that that that's the


---------81:55----------
image that I think is the strong that's


---------81:58----------
a beautiful image thanks I don't know


---------82:01----------
what it comes from yeah it's raining in


---------82:03----------
the image got that go absolutely I think


---------82:07----------
it's I could have you know yeah I think


---------82:09----------
raining makes sense to me you know it's


---------82:12----------
it's I think it's a really good


---------82:16----------
description of your life in a lot of


---------82:18----------
ways so I think I think twitch chat has


---------82:22----------
figured it out so twitch chat knows what


---------82:25----------
we're doing


---------82:25----------
so twitch chat do you guys know how this


---------82:28----------
is helping so I've seen it it pop up a


---------82:30----------
couple of times like what are we doing


---------82:33----------
with him yes you look at that they say


---------82:40----------
are you on game can I tell you something


---------82:43----------
yeah there's there's a couple of people


---------82:45----------
in chat right now and I don't know this


---------82:48----------
tilts me tells me out of my mind


---------82:50----------
what is pathetic fallacy mean do you


---------82:53----------
know what the they might be saying I


---------82:54----------
don't know what that means I don't know


---------82:56----------
either so I need to know okay good so


---------83:00----------
we'll get to that we'll get to that okay


---------83:03----------
yeah okay so so what what did so aside


---------83:07----------
from the few person sad pathetic fallacy


---------83:09----------
because I don't even know what it's


---------83:10----------
called and what what are the other


---------83:13----------
people in your chat saying


---------83:18----------
because my cat has it figured out so I


---------83:21----------
don't know if it's just because by the


---------83:23----------
way well I'm not streaming i'm not


---------83:25----------
streaming oh you're not suing okay no I


---------83:27----------
know I don't shrimp when I do this okay


---------83:29----------
I would rather direct traffic so I'm


---------83:31----------
really impressed with like like cuz


---------83:33----------
twitch at dude like these guys learn and


---------83:36----------
girls and other other things you know so


---------83:40----------
I think their overwhelming sense is that


---------83:42----------
you're taking out the trash okay


---------83:45----------
oh when we're having yeah make sense


---------83:49----------
right and so that's how this works right


---------83:52----------
so it's it's not when you kind of think


---------83:54----------
about like what's the effect of this


---------83:56----------
conversation this is going to help you


---------83:58----------
in the next week because you've managed


---------84:00----------
and emptied out some of that trash so as


---------84:03----------
you build that stress in that trash


---------84:06----------
you've got to manage it by talking about


---------84:09----------
it so seeing a therapist I don't know


---------84:11----------
exactly what you know what therapy is


---------84:13----------
like in South Korea but you know talking


---------84:16----------
to someone can certainly help I think


---------84:19----------
the other thing that's happening is that


---------84:20----------
we're helping you be and so this is the


---------84:28----------
advantage of therapy by the way right so


---------84:29----------
like we all have emotions and stuff like


---------84:31----------
our trash can fills up throughout the


---------84:33----------
day and I'll teach you a meditation


---------84:35----------
technique that's kind of about unwinding


---------84:38----------
at the end of today so remind me to


---------84:42----------
teach you that the other thing so we


---------84:45----------
kind of build up emotions and like


---------84:46----------
negative experiences feelings and stuff


---------84:48----------
like that and then we need some place to


---------84:50----------
take out the trash so if you take out


---------84:52----------
the trash the cool thing LS is that I


---------84:53----------
think all of this stuff will get better


---------84:55----------
so I think your asthma will get better


---------84:57----------
your insomnia will get better your your


---------84:59----------
anxiety will get better it's not gonna


---------85:01----------
happen overnight and needs to happen on


---------85:03----------
a regular basis because you have a lot


---------85:04----------
of trash filled up like what you've been


---------85:05----------
doing is instead of a trash can you


---------85:07----------
actually have a basement where you throw


---------85:09----------
all your trash and so for years and


---------85:12----------
years and years you have a basement


---------85:14----------
that's just filled up the other thing LS


---------85:17----------
that I think you kind of really struggle


---------85:18----------
with and maybe we can talk about this


---------85:20----------
next time


---------85:21----------
is I think your sense of identity is


---------85:24----------
like all warped so I think part of this


---------85:28----------
whole glass house thing you try to be


---------85:29----------
like super transparent but I think deep


---------85:31----------
down there's sense of emptiness I don't


---------85:33----------
know if you really know who you are


---------85:35----------
I think that you're not confident you're


---------85:39----------
not confident in yourself so I think a


---------85:42----------
lot of your uncertainty has to do with


---------85:47----------
you know you don't know that you're


---------85:49----------
gonna land on your feet and and knowing


---------85:52----------
that you're gonna land on your feet


---------85:54----------
tends to come from like a good sense of


---------85:56----------
confidence and who you are as a person


---------85:58----------
like being secure within yourself and I


---------86:01----------
think we see other signs of sort of like


---------86:03----------
a kind of a shaky identity which is that


---------86:07----------
you know the opinions of others start to


---------86:10----------
influence you way more like so if I have


---------86:14----------
a clear sense of who I am and like the


---------86:15----------
world calls me an idiot like if I Know


---------86:17----------
Who I am I'm gonna be able to protect


---------86:19----------
myself from that because I know it's


---------86:21----------
kind of like you know the whole path I


---------86:23----------
gotta Padma thing like if I know that


---------86:24----------
other people are idiots and that my


---------86:26----------
strategy is a good one like I don't have


---------86:28----------
to try to convince them of anything like


---------86:29----------
if they're too dumb to realize it like


---------86:31----------
fine I'm just gonna own them harder and


---------86:32----------
harder and harder and the people who


---------86:34----------
understand it will like improve and the


---------86:35----------
people who don't want to accept me like


---------86:37----------
they're just gonna like they're gonna


---------86:39----------
suck they're gonna keep on losing MMR or


---------86:41----------
rank or whatever but in your case I


---------86:44----------
think there's something about needing to


---------86:46----------
prove yourself to other people and


---------86:52----------
imposter syndrome streaming all this


---------86:54----------
stuff gets exacerbated because you've


---------86:56----------
become this persona but essentially like


---------86:58----------
the person who needs to prove themselves


---------87:00----------
is the person who like isn't confident


---------87:02----------
in themself and so I think we've got to


---------87:06----------
go back to like you know when you like


---------87:08----------
like who are you really like who is ls


---------87:10----------
and what is a less capable of like who


---------87:13----------
are you yeah I'm curious I think yeah


---------87:24----------
um I don't know actually


---------87:31----------
yeah this goes back to what I said in


---------87:33----------
the first conversation I don't really


---------87:35----------
have a purpose but because this is all


---------87:38----------
that I've done I feel like my only


---------87:39----------
purpose is helping others it sounds so


---------87:49----------
fun


---------87:50----------
it sounds so stupid to say like


---------87:52----------
appreciate strategy more inside of video


---------87:54----------
games but I think that strategy in


---------87:56----------
itself is art and I think that there is


---------87:58----------
a lot of correlations or things that can


---------88:04----------
show themselves in other areas of life


---------88:06----------
that you can derive from strategy games


---------88:08----------
no no see that's beautiful that is your


---------88:12----------
purpose I think so so but this is this


---------88:15----------
is the crazy thing right like so despite


---------88:17----------
having such a pure purpose that no one


---------88:21----------
like people don't say that kind of thing


---------88:23----------
man so like that is a sign of like


---------88:26----------
that's actually true purpose like you


---------88:28----------
love strategy games you love learning


---------88:30----------
strategy you love applying to strategy a


---------88:33----------
strategy to like other parts of your


---------88:35----------
life you love talking about strategy


---------88:37----------
games that's what you're on this earth


---------88:38----------
to do my friend the question is why is


---------88:43----------
it that you can't just accept that right


---------88:45----------
like so there's something within you


---------88:46----------
that like like I think you've actually


---------88:48----------
got your purpose figured out I think


---------88:49----------
your problem is like you don't know who


---------88:51----------
you are


---------88:51----------
so when you say like my purpose is to


---------88:53----------
explore strategy to its fullest extent


---------88:56----------
because I think it's amazing the second


---------88:58----------
half of that sentence is fine I think my


---------89:00----------
I think where you fall short is with the


---------89:02----------
first word which is my and you don't


---------89:04----------
know who you are but I think what you're


---------89:07----------
doing is awesome I think like you love


---------89:08----------
strategy you love eSports you love


---------89:10----------
gaming and if that's what you want to


---------89:12----------
spend your life doing that I say go for


---------89:13----------
it man and and see what happens is like


---------89:17----------
yeah that there's more stuff I want to


---------89:20----------
do down the line that I need to grow


---------89:24----------
bigger in order to do like in terms of


---------89:27----------
like setting up networks and other stuff


---------89:29----------
go like whatever


---------89:35----------
okay I find a lot of probably very odd


---------89:38----------
off things pretty or beautiful or


---------89:41----------
exciting like art and stuff I'm sorry


---------89:45----------
you said odd off yeah like on like like


---------89:49----------
things that maybe most people wouldn't I


---------89:54----------
don't know I guess that's just my


---------89:57----------
opinion yeah so so I I think going


---------90:00----------
forward we've got to do some you know


---------90:02----------
work on like who you are but I think a


---------90:04----------
couple of concrete things do you have


---------90:05----------
any questions by the way so I'm gonna


---------90:08----------
kind of try to summarize because we've


---------90:10----------
been at this for a little while now okay


---------90:12----------
does this feel like a stopping point to


---------90:13----------
you yeah sure I mean I I don't really do


---------90:18----------
anything so I don't like I don't I think


---------90:23----------
after whenever I was gonna be done


---------90:25----------
talking with you I was gonna watch the


---------90:27----------
new Walking Dead episode and then


---------90:29----------
probably sleep okay so I don't really


---------90:34----------
have a schedule right now okay okay yeah


---------90:37----------
okay so um so let me let me try to just


---------90:41----------
summarize a couple of things okay so


---------90:42----------
first of all I'm glad you came on again


---------90:44----------
and I've thoroughly enjoyed talking to


---------90:47----------
you I think unless you are just a really


---------90:51----------
awesome dude and I think that you know


---------90:55----------
underneath all the anxiety and insomnia


---------90:57----------
and all that other kind of crap like I


---------90:59----------
love to hear that you are an artist when


---------91:02----------
it comes to strategy like you'll love


---------91:03----------
and appreciate strategy like art because


---------91:05----------
I think that's we need people like you


---------91:07----------
man


---------91:08----------
because the problem is that like the


---------91:10----------
rest of the world doesn't take the


---------91:11----------
gaming community seriously they don't


---------91:13----------
they don't understand that you can have


---------91:15----------
a beautiful work of art that is like


---------91:17----------
like you know a book you can have a


---------91:19----------
beautiful work of art that is a movie


---------91:21----------
and you can have a beautiful work of art


---------91:23----------
that is a video game like for many many


---------91:25----------
years when people ask me what kind of


---------91:27----------
music I like I would say instrumental


---------91:29----------
music but what I really meant is in my


---------91:30----------
free time I listen to like soundtracks


---------91:32----------
from video games that's what that's what


---------91:36----------
I listed to I listen to Chrono Trigger


---------91:37----------
divinity original sin usually


---------91:39----------
single-player RPGs you know like that's


---------91:42----------
what I listen to like sometimes some OC


---------91:43----------
remix from Street Fighter 2 and some


---------91:45----------
old-school stuff


---------91:46----------
um when my two-year-old like when she


---------91:49----------
was young I used to sing her the tearin


---------91:53----------
theme from Starcraft wanted to put her


---------91:55----------
to sleep oh man it's just nuts but like


---------91:58----------
that's what she loves the Terran theme


---------92:01----------
and and like that's out like that's her


---------92:04----------
- lullaby like you know cuz like it's


---------92:07----------
it's like 2:00 in the morning she's not


---------92:08----------
falling asleep I've sung everything that


---------92:11----------
I know how to sing and I just try to


---------92:12----------
think about okay what can I sing for 30


---------92:14----------
minutes without getting bored I won best


---------92:19----------
baby lullaby ever right nice it turns to


---------92:23----------
get theme it's a great thing yeah yeah


---------92:26----------
it's a really only one you can kind of


---------92:28----------
like sing to a kid you know like you


---------92:29----------
can't really do that with desert music


---------92:31----------
no so I I think it's awesome that like


---------92:37----------
you really are devoted to strategy I


---------92:39----------
think you know what your purpose is I


---------92:40----------
think the problem is that you've


---------92:42----------
developed some strategies to help you


---------92:48----------
succeed in your goals but that those


---------92:50----------
strategies are actually maladaptive they


---------92:53----------
work but they're not ideal and the basic


---------92:56----------
gist of it is that like you know whether


---------92:57----------
we talk about asthma or stress or


---------92:59----------
insomnia anxiety falling apart breaking


---------93:03----------
apart all that stuff is this I mean it's


---------93:05----------
not the same there's you know it's


---------93:06----------
complicated and there are all kinds of


---------93:08----------
stuff going on but I think basically


---------93:09----------
like your problem is that you're not


---------93:11----------
emptying the trash and it doesn't take a


---------93:13----------
whole lot so I don't think like you need


---------93:15----------
a spa day once a week I think you need


---------93:17----------
to you know it sounds like you're eating


---------93:18----------
well you hydrate really well that's


---------93:20----------
really great it sounds like you need


---------93:21----------
some kind of emotional support so I


---------93:23----------
don't know what that looks like if you


---------93:24----------
have you know therapists or something


---------93:26----------
like that I don't know well I'm gonna


---------93:28----------
have to think about that but I think on


---------93:29----------
some level it doesn't you have to be


---------93:31----------
necessarily talking to someone but like


---------93:32----------
processing your emotions so now I'd like


---------93:34----------
to teach you a meditation technique


---------93:36----------
around that so we'll stop after the


---------93:40----------
meditation technique but a couple of


---------93:41----------
other things so going for it I think the


---------93:43----------
big issue here is that somewhere along


---------93:45----------
the way you aren't even though you know


---------93:48----------
what you like and you know what it is


---------93:50----------
due to fear of judgment or something


---------93:53----------
like that like there's fear of judgment


---------93:54----------
there's not being taken seriously for


---------93:56----------
whatever reason you cannot be confident


---------93:58----------
in the person that you are


---------94:00----------
can't be comfortable in the person that


---------94:02----------
you are even though you know you want to


---------94:04----------
do a lot of stuff and you want to expand


---------94:05----------
your network you're afraid about your


---------94:07----------
future right whereas like when you say


---------94:09----------
things like this it actually makes me


---------94:11----------
think your future is gonna be fine man


---------94:13----------
because a lot of people like


---------94:14----------
transitioning out of eSports into other


---------94:16----------
stuff is something that people are


---------94:17----------
getting better and better at it's


---------94:19----------
becoming more of an industry and you're


---------94:21----------
actually thinking about it like I'm


---------94:23----------
confident that you're gonna do well


---------94:24----------
actually but for whatever reason your


---------94:27----------
sense of identity hasn't formed well so


---------94:29----------
I think that's something overall like I


---------94:30----------
think we so I'm happy to do this with


---------94:33----------
you but what what you really need to do


---------94:36----------
is try to figure out like when did you


---------94:37----------
go off track like when did you lose


---------94:39----------
confidence in the person that you are


---------94:41----------
when did you fundamentally like when did


---------94:44----------
the default become failure instead of


---------94:46----------
success


---------94:56----------
because I think once I started being


---------94:59----------
more aware of my my age okay so that is


---------95:03----------
a trash can that needs to be emptied the


---------95:06----------
last thing that I'll kind of share with


---------95:07----------
you before meditation is that I want you


---------95:10----------
to understand that like when you get


---------95:11----------
tilted or involved with like like that


---------95:13----------
each individual interaction and this is


---------95:17----------
for people at home to like you're not


---------95:18----------
just dealing with that interaction your


---------95:22----------
history in the emotional weight from the


---------95:25----------
past actually like plays into that


---------95:26----------
interaction so if you feel like


---------95:29----------
uncomfortable about your appearance or


---------95:31----------
you're afraid about dating or something


---------95:32----------
like that like all of those anxieties


---------95:34----------
from the past and like that like lack of


---------95:37----------
confidence and like fear that you're


---------95:39----------
gonna be rejected or unlovable like all


---------95:41----------
that crap enters your mind and actually


---------95:45----------
like affects you when you ask someone


---------95:47----------
that you're attracted to out and so you


---------95:49----------
got to deal with all that crap from the


---------95:51----------
past and then you'll be free from it and


---------95:52----------
your life is gonna feel way easier


---------95:54----------
my goal for uls is to feel like get that


---------95:57----------
that Elephant Man off your chest like


---------95:59----------
that's what we should do right and then


---------96:02----------
if you live life I think you're gonna be


---------96:04----------
you're gonna be good okay


---------96:06----------
Todd's questions I'm ready for


---------96:08----------
meditation yeah sure okay so sit up


---------96:12----------
straight I don't know if my chair hold


---------96:16----------

---------96:21----------
yeah totally straight back straight okay


---------96:23----------
okay okay


---------96:24----------
let your shoulders relax a little bit so


---------96:31----------
spine is different from shoulders no I


---------96:34----------
know yeah


---------96:38----------
try to bring your elbows weird you don't


---------96:41----------
know what I thought you just don't want


---------96:42----------
to relax yeah that's really weird so


---------96:47----------
they're just tense it's actually I I


---------96:51----------
think this is this is just I don't want


---------96:57----------
to describe my legs are tapping right


---------96:59----------
now yeah like I think this is just my


---------97:02----------
body is just very tense right now yeah


---------97:04----------
okay so if you can't yeah so so what


---------97:07----------
what I want you to try to do is let your


---------97:10----------
arms hang


---------97:10----------
let let gravity pull your arms down as


---------97:13----------
low as low as they'll go


---------97:15----------
I have arm rests okay so scoot scoot


---------97:20----------
scoot forward to the edge of your chair


---------97:22----------
yeah okay sure


---------97:25----------
right yeah okay okay and then now now


---------97:29----------
let your shoulders hang good better so I


---------97:33----------
want you to do this literally that yep


---------97:37----------
and now put your palms in front of you


---------97:41----------
like like let them rest in your lap yeah


---------97:45----------
okay let your shoulders relax


---------97:49----------
good okay trying yeah just let them fall


---------97:52----------
to the ground right so this is this is


---------97:54----------
tense this is like straight then just


---------97:56----------
let them down push them down yeah good


---------97:59----------
now close your eyes and now I'm gonna


---------98:03----------
walk you through a particular set I'm


---------98:05----------
gonna give you some instruction on yeah


---------98:08----------
what sorry well I I don't like closing


---------98:12----------
my yeah sorry you don't like closing


---------98:15----------
your eyes yeah


---------98:16----------
what don't you like about closing your


---------98:18----------
eyes


---------98:25----------
feel vulnerable I don't know I don't


---------98:28----------
know um you feel unsafe something uh not


---------98:33----------
unsafe there's something unsettling


---------98:35----------
about it not being pure black like I


---------98:38----------
have a you know the things that go over


---------98:39----------
hmm just sleep yeah I've used those okay


---------98:43----------
yeah I have to use those and whenever I


---------98:45----------
try to de-stress like on my own I have


---------98:49----------
to use that I can't just close my eyes


---------98:50----------
okay


---------98:51----------
but yeah I don't I don't know why okay


---------98:54----------
so try closing your eyes


---------98:55----------
mm-hmm okay so so I feel like the the


---------99:00----------
technique for you today is actually not


---------99:02----------
our technique it's just relax your


---------99:04----------
shoulders and close your eyes that's


---------99:06----------
what we're going to start but let's


---------99:07----------
let's try to give something for people


---------99:10----------
at home so this is what I want you to do


---------99:11----------
I'm gonna teach you kind of an unwind by


---------99:13----------
the way do you feel good in the morning


---------99:14----------
uh depends what's the first thing I see


---------99:20----------
on my phone if I see that there's a new


---------99:23----------
reddit thread or if I see there's tweets


---------99:25----------
that make me want to jump off my balcony


---------99:27----------
and you know I mean okay it affects


---------99:30----------
other morning we'll go okay okay so it


---------99:33----------
sounds like but in the morning before


---------99:35----------
how often do you check your how quickly


---------99:37----------
do you check your phone after you wake


---------99:38----------
up instantly so that needs slightly


---------99:42----------
under my pillow that needs to stop Ellis


---------99:47----------
okay how do we get that okay so open


---------99:50----------
your eyes for a second so I know I'm


---------99:51----------
supposed to teach meditation right now


---------99:53----------
and I've got to go in like 15 minutes


---------99:54----------
but this this okay so this needs to stop


---------99:57----------
okay so when it comes to emptying out


---------100:00----------
your trash can so talking with other


---------100:01----------
people meditating you got to put your


---------100:03----------
phone somewhere else and you got to give


---------100:05----------
yourself like like half an hour or 45


---------100:07----------
minutes before you check your phone or


---------100:09----------
before you check reddit how do we how do


---------100:11----------
we make that happen um I feel like


---------100:16----------
suffocating if I don't know what's going


---------100:18----------
on as soon as I wake up


---------100:20----------
I always feels like okay so there's a


---------100:24----------
lot of people that will message me like


---------100:26----------
with them listening whether it be


---------100:27----------
players that'll message me on discord or


---------100:30----------
though the M me or other people I feel


---------100:33----------
like because I'm operating on different


---------100:34----------
time zones that I need to try to reply


---------100:38----------
as soon as I can and so like I know that


---------100:44----------
if I wake up at 9 a.m.


---------100:46----------
how do you how often do you shower every


---------100:51----------
36 hours usually okay so when you all


---------100:54----------
depending on castes so if I'm casting I


---------100:57----------
shower every single day because they use


---------100:59----------
hairspray and other stuff and I get


---------101:01----------
tilted but yeah okay so so like I would


---------101:05----------
say like when you wake up do you shower


---------101:06----------
it usually at night or in the morning


---------101:10----------
depends what I'm doing the next day okay


---------101:13----------
so I you got to figure something out to


---------101:15----------
avoid avoid your phone for 30 minutes


---------101:18----------
okay when you wake up like I was gonna


---------101:21----------
say an hour but like you got it like eat


---------101:23----------
or or you know do something like go


---------101:27----------
outside go for a walk like do whatever


---------101:28----------
you want to just no phone for 30 minutes


---------101:31----------
you got to make that really even go out


---------101:32----------
the corona though okay looks like a void


---------101:36----------
public place yeah I don't know a lot of


---------101:38----------
places are out me or close it sucks yeah


---------101:40----------
so so practically though I want you to


---------101:42----------
think about it this way LS the more time


---------101:46----------
that your mind spends in that space of


---------101:49----------
stress and the more stress you're gonna


---------101:51----------
feel so you need to give your line you


---------101:54----------
need to learn how to break away from


---------101:57----------
that space for just a little while and


---------101:59----------
no wonder you have no idea who you are


---------102:01----------
because like you're never alone like


---------102:03----------
Netflix huh what if I watch Netflix


---------102:06----------
Netflix is fine just not on your phone


---------102:11----------
okay


---------102:12----------
okay so you can watch on your computer


---------102:14----------
but like no checking no social media for


---------102:16----------
30 minutes after you wake up you can


---------102:18----------
watch Netflix you can lay in bed you can


---------102:22----------
meditate you can you know you can do


---------102:25----------
whatever you want to but just no social


---------102:28----------
media for 30 minutes eat something yeah


---------102:30----------
take a dump be honest I think usually


---------102:33----------
things week


---------102:34----------
like discord calls or phone call or


---------102:36----------
alarm okay so fine to alarm but like


---------102:40----------
mute your discord when you go to sleep


---------102:42----------
okay let's just talk about like Here I


---------102:45----------
am trying to come up with all these


---------102:46----------
complicated like psychoanalytic


---------102:48----------
formulations for you and it's just like


---------102:50----------
yeah just stay away from your phone for


---------102:51----------
like half an hour just see what it does


---------102:53----------
to your mindset okay okay because you're


---------102:55----------
starting the day off like what you're


---------102:57----------
doing is you're giving your adrenaline


---------102:58----------
system a big kick as soon as you wake up


---------103:00----------
like you don't need coffee


---------103:01----------
it's like oh if that's like you


---------103:04----------
wake up you check your phone you're like


---------103:05----------
oh that's not coffee that's the


---------103:08----------
first thing I do okay fine so have


---------103:10----------
coffee and enjoy it and just don't look


---------103:12----------
at your phone there are these things


---------103:13----------
it's kind of weird like before you know


---------103:16----------
gaming and computers they used to like


---------103:18----------
instead of Reddit they would like take


---------103:19----------
like a bunch of reddit pages and they


---------103:21----------
would like put them together on paper


---------103:23----------
and they would like binders dinner huh


---------103:26----------
newspaper what a book no like yeah yeah


---------103:29----------
it's a book a book you've read so so you


---------103:35----------
know sometimes it's kind of like a it's


---------103:36----------
like reddit threads that are all like


---------103:38----------
linked to each other it's actually


---------103:39----------
really cool and it's like they're all


---------103:44----------
like linked together so it's kind of


---------103:45----------
like if you were to like read like you


---------103:47----------
know it's kind of like a vlog like all


---------103:49----------
of them are related but it's like it's


---------103:51----------
like one story so check one of those out


---------103:53----------
you know anyway so enough of me being an


---------103:58----------
ass seriously spend a half an hour in


---------104:00----------
the morning away from your phone okay so


---------104:02----------
now I'm going to teach you guys the


---------104:03----------
technique okay so close your eyes and


---------104:06----------
what I want you to do so you're in the


---------104:09----------
hand position yeah yeah okay so what I


---------104:13----------
want you to do is I want you to think


---------104:16----------
about the kind of like the last thing


---------104:19----------
that happened before we started talking


---------104:21----------
and I want you to think about any


---------104:25----------
emotions that you felt with that event


---------104:28----------
okay and then I want you to go to the


---------104:31----------
thing before so so basically what you


---------104:34----------
want to do before you go to bed at night


---------104:36----------
is you can do this technique and


---------104:39----------
throughout the day what's what's so


---------104:42----------
funny the dark humor in me the thing I


---------104:46----------
did before this


---------104:47----------
it was there was a fiora and she's a


---------104:49----------
dirty inter do you ever get someone that


---------104:52----------
runs it down in your game and dota huh


---------104:55----------
they just intentionally feed yeah yeah


---------104:56----------
yeah they just they make it so you can't


---------104:58----------
play well that what's the thing before


---------105:01----------
this that actually made me end my stream


---------105:04----------
and the thing before her was a different


---------105:06----------
dirty inter okay


---------105:09----------
good so now we're getting somewhere okay


---------105:11----------
good Alice okay so good so so okay so


---------105:14----------
close your eyes I want to go back to


---------105:16----------
those exactly so what I want you to do


---------105:19----------
is acknowledge the emotions that you


---------105:21----------
felt without getting into it okay you


---------105:24----------
can laugh it's okay so like yeah like so


---------105:27----------
you said like I had a dirty fiora or


---------105:30----------
whatever and and she fed and then like I


---------105:33----------
was super pissed off and tilted and I


---------105:35----------
decided to quit my stream and now go to


---------105:37----------
the game before and so what was the


---------105:39----------
situation there like acknowledge to the


---------105:41----------
situation oh I felt super tilted yeah


---------105:44----------
right and then what happened before yeah


---------105:47----------
I think we opened an 8-minute served


---------105:53----------
like 10 minutes yeah what does that mean


---------105:57----------
you know opening is everyone just let's


---------105:59----------
the enemy push okay so I want you to


---------106:03----------
continue going backwards in time mm-hm


---------106:06----------
and try to get like to a pretty small


---------106:08----------
resolution so I'll give you an example


---------106:09----------
of my routine like before you know like


---------106:14----------
like when I do this meditation before


---------106:17----------
bad so I usually do it before bed


---------106:18----------
so like before I got into bed I changed


---------106:21----------
my clothes before I changed my clothes I


---------106:23----------
brushed my teeth before I brush my teeth


---------106:25----------
I brushed my kids teeth before I brush


---------106:28----------
their teeth my little kid had taken the


---------106:31----------
cap off of the toothpaste and was eating


---------106:33----------
toothpaste again and I got pissed off at


---------106:35----------
her because she really needs to stop


---------106:37----------
eating toothpaste and and then I had to


---------106:40----------
fight with her about you know she wanted


---------106:43----------
to open the toothpaste and she wanted to


---------106:44----------
do it herself and and I got kind of


---------106:46----------
frustrated with that and before that I


---------106:49----------
changed them into pajamas and before I


---------106:51----------
changed them into pajamas we were like


---------106:55----------
doing like a pillow fight dance party


---------106:56----------
kind of thing and then that was a lot of


---------106:58----------
fun and then before that I


---------107:01----------
ate dinner at 10 o'clock at night


---------107:02----------
because I didn't get a chance to eat


---------107:04----------
until then and then before that I did


---------107:06----------
this and then I did this and this is how


---------107:08----------
I felt then and with dinner like I


---------107:10----------
really enjoyed the food because it was


---------107:11----------
healthy but I really wanted like a slice


---------107:13----------
of pepperoni pizza cuz that's just like


---------107:14----------
fatty and delicious and before that I


---------107:17----------
did this and I felt like this so you


---------107:19----------
just kind of track back so the thing a


---------107:21----------
couple of important things to remember


---------107:23----------
one is that you don't want to dive into


---------107:25----------
anything okay so I noticed that when you


---------107:29----------
started recalling the game like you


---------107:30----------
became pretty attached to the game and


---------107:32----------
you dived into those feelings quickly so


---------107:35----------
you want to acknowledge them and then


---------107:36----------
move back acknowledge move back


---------107:39----------
acknowledge move back and try to go all


---------107:41----------
the way back to when you started your


---------107:42----------
day and how you felt the moment you woke


---------107:45----------
up I was tilted first thing in the


---------107:56----------
morning


---------107:56----------
yeah okay I remember I yeah so try to


---------108:01----------
try to catch every major event of your


---------108:03----------
day and even small event so like


---------108:05----------
generally speaking this meditation takes


---------108:07----------
about five to ten minutes okay so but I


---------108:11----------
think you've got a handle on it and then


---------108:13----------
and so hopefully what this will do is


---------108:16----------
like empty out your trash a little bit


---------108:18----------
okay cuz you're trying to unwind as you


---------108:20----------
go through the day you wind up emotions


---------108:23----------
you have all this stuff that kind of


---------108:24----------
builds up and the our goal is to help


---------108:26----------
you like kind of unwind and start the


---------108:28----------
day on peaceful but apparently you start


---------108:30----------
the day off tilt like you woke up and


---------108:31----------
you were tilted yeah like you opened


---------108:34----------
your eyes and like you were tilted about


---------108:35----------
what um I ran over to the door to see if


---------108:40----------
max was awake and I walked out and I


---------108:42----------
said so I think I just said to him so


---------108:44----------
what the are we gonna do and I was


---------108:48----------
tilted about an argument that I had


---------108:50----------
yesterday


---------108:51----------
exactly him with someone nice so you


---------108:55----------
need to process that from the day before


---------108:57----------
using a technique like this so that you


---------109:00----------
don't wake up in the morning tilt it you


---------109:03----------
see how like it's all like like it's


---------109:05----------
just a cycle like it's oh it's a ball


---------109:07----------
that's rolling downhill it's like a


---------109:09----------
little snow it's a snowflake that's


---------109:11----------
becoming a snowball which is becoming a


---------109:13----------
novel


---------109:14----------
and so you've got to deal with your


---------109:16----------
emotions from the day before so that you


---------109:18----------
start the day off like you're already


---------109:20----------
encumbered


---------109:21----------
yeah I'm pretty often starting the day


---------109:24----------
off and I wake up tilton okay yeah so


---------109:29----------
then you gotta get so so process that


---------109:31----------
stuff the day before as best as you can


---------109:32----------
using this technique okay okay


---------109:35----------
dots or questions before we wrap up for


---------109:37----------
the day no okay strong work man very a


---------109:42----------
pleasure as always


---------109:44----------
once again yeah yes man get some sleep


---------109:47----------

---------109:50----------

---------111:01----------
all right chat see now see now you now


---------111:07----------
I've made a big big mistake because now


---------111:11----------
what I've done is tell chat that I don't


---------111:12----------
like spoilers and now chat knows my my


---------111:15----------
soft soft underbelly


---------111:17----------
and they're gonna spoil everything on


---------111:19----------
the universe so I can't read chat


---------111:20----------
anymore okay so I'm curious how


---------111:26----------
applicable was what we were talking


---------111:28----------
about like did did you guys like did


---------111:30----------
y'all resonate with anything that we


---------111:31----------
were talking about with LS okay


---------111:39----------
I wasn't sure cuz he had so many things


---------111:41----------
going on I wasn't quite sure like hooter


---------111:44----------
like yeah


---------111:49----------
and yeah man sometimes I try to make


---------111:53----------
things a little bit more applicable but


---------111:55----------
in LSE's case there's just a lot


---------112:02----------
yeah the trash can part so that's


---------112:04----------
applicable to everyone right so I think
