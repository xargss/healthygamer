---------00:00----------
welcome guys so welcome to the healthy


---------00:02----------
gamer GG stream my name is dr. Alec Cano


---------00:06----------
jeah I'm a psychiatrist practicing in


---------00:08----------
Boston Massachusetts we have a very


---------00:11----------
exciting stream today we're gonna have


---------00:13----------
Bobby scar Bobby scar I think Bobby scar


---------00:17----------
Newman I'm confused


---------00:19----------
but oh and a hypetrain


---------00:23----------
fantastic so we're gonna talk to Bobby I


---------00:26----------
think Bobby wants to talk a little bit


---------00:27----------
about Padma so in the past we've talked


---------00:30----------
about the Sun script word called Dharma


---------00:32----------
which means duty or responsibility and


---------00:35----------
one of the big things that I advocate


---------00:38----------
for is for people to find their Dharma


---------00:40----------
and I think that that becomes important


---------00:43----------
because Dharma is that would just allow


---------00:47----------
that which allows us to tolerate


---------00:49----------
negative things are suffering with like


---------00:52----------
actually just a lot of strength so it's


---------00:55----------
easy to do hard things if they're


---------00:57----------
aligned with your Dharma and I think a


---------01:00----------
lot of times people struggle because it


---------01:03----------
thanks for the subs nifty a lot of times


---------01:05----------
people struggle because when you think


---------01:07----------
about like the hard things that you have


---------01:09----------
to do in life you don't have like a good


---------01:10----------
reason to do them right so if it's like


---------01:12----------
getting out of that or finding a job


---------01:14----------
like finding a job in and of itself is


---------01:15----------
not a good reason to


---------01:17----------
I mean sure like it's a good idea to


---------01:19----------
have a job but like money is not


---------01:21----------
actually like a motivator that's gonna


---------01:22----------
help you overcome let's say video game


---------01:25----------
addiction or depression or things like


---------01:27----------
that so you need like a really good like


---------01:29----------
you need a cause like you need a cause


---------01:31----------
for yourself so termas like a personal


---------01:33----------
cause and I think Bobby wants to talk


---------01:35----------
some about that what's up man


---------01:40----------
uh not a whole lot just better still


---------01:46----------
rising Li not back to normal which you


---------01:49----------
know is taking way longer than I


---------01:51----------
expected but can we just do a quick


---------01:55----------
sound sound check we can test one two


---------01:58----------
does he sound okay I hear you okay the


---------02:04----------
people can hear me what is up with it


---------02:07----------
just a lot of them well yeah okay great


---------02:11----------
Oh some someone saying they


---------02:13----------
a little louder that's what it sounds


---------02:15----------
like to you okay test one two all right


---------02:18----------
so Bobby so tell me I'm so first of all


---------02:20----------
I'm sorry I know we've been scheduled to


---------02:22----------
talk a couple of times I just got like


---------02:24----------
laid low for a really long time yeah and


---------02:28----------
have been kind of out for two weeks so


---------02:31----------
sorry about that but hopefully I mean


---------02:33----------
I'm here now and hopefully I can help so


---------02:34----------
help me understand a little bit about I


---------02:36----------
understand you've kind of reached out to


---------02:38----------
us because you had some questions about


---------02:40----------
Dharma I just realized that you're like


---------02:42----------
the one person I've responded to on


---------02:44----------
Twitter to by the way that's yeah I


---------02:46----------
didn't see you respond and I was like oh


---------02:48----------
that's weird


---------02:49----------
why you would be healthy gamer GG but


---------02:51----------
you have your own Twitter yeah so and I


---------02:54----------
barely know how to use it so yeah that


---------02:57----------
should change I should probably get on


---------02:58----------
on Twitter and spend a little bit less


---------03:00----------
time on reddit yeah I'm for sure but so


---------03:03----------
tell me a little bit about you know what


---------03:05----------
you wanted to talk about today and and


---------03:06----------
how we can be helpful so I mean I


---------03:09----------
reached out to you originally first of


---------03:10----------
all that's a great question I'm not sure


---------03:13----------
that I know and I'm interested in


---------03:15----------
letting you drive okay you know you can


---------03:18----------
poke around and play with some things


---------03:20----------
we've got some directions to kind of go


---------03:22----------
in I reached out to you originally you


---------03:26----------
mind if I do a quick introduction know


---------03:27----------
where the hell means but yeah for those


---------03:29----------
of you don't know me yeah I'm Bobby


---------03:31----------
Starr I am if you do know me then you


---------03:34----------
know me from the melee community I'm an


---------03:36----------
X Pro player I was really good in 2009


---------03:39----------
still good in 2012 trying to be good in


---------03:42----------
2019 but I don't I don't have the time


---------03:43----------
that the kids do and I know right so I'm


---------03:49----------
kind of like an elder you might call me


---------03:51----------
at this time so I transitioned into


---------03:53----------
content creation and I'm a streamer not


---------03:56----------
full-time or anything but I shoutcast


---------03:58----------
big tournaments and stuff like that and


---------04:00----------
I make some YouTube content but along


---------04:04----------
the way I kind of realized you know I've


---------04:06----------
as I got a job and kind of gained more


---------04:09----------
responsibility or whatever


---------04:10----------
I've been tugged kind of in a direction


---------04:13----------
in my whole life


---------04:14----------
sorry and it was kind of I guess I


---------04:18----------
realized in retrospect you know I like


---------04:20----------
played this game and I tried to get


---------04:22----------
better at it pretty much obsessively


---------04:24----------
from college


---------04:26----------
and kind of as I looked back as I got


---------04:29----------
older I was like oh man


---------04:30----------
you know I learned how to create video


---------04:32----------
content from the melee community I


---------04:34----------
learned how to kind of like think from


---------04:37----------
the melee community I kind of learned


---------04:38----------
who I was and what I cared about from


---------04:40----------
this community I got my first job


---------04:42----------
through a connection in the community so


---------04:44----------
I kind of like had an increasing sense


---------04:46----------
that the game kind of made me everything


---------04:49----------
that I am and taught me everything that


---------04:50----------
I know and so kind of like looking back


---------04:53----------
I realized I've been trying to build


---------04:55----------
community to kind of make sure that


---------04:58----------
other people can have access to the


---------05:00----------
thing that gave me kind of like


---------05:01----------
everything that matters to me well yeah


---------05:05----------
and so that took me to live streaming so


---------05:08----------
i work at twitch I've been at twitch


---------05:09----------
almost seven years now so that's really


---------05:10----------
long in the you know if you talk about


---------05:12----------
like dog years it's like two lifetimes


---------05:15----------
and in tech yeah and you know when we


---------05:19----------
met I think I told you you know I you've


---------05:21----------
seen the matrix I see myself more as


---------05:23----------
Morpheus in this case you're neo where


---------05:25----------
I've been like scanning twitch for


---------05:28----------
someone to arise that's gonna look a lot


---------05:32----------
like you and kind of do all the things


---------05:35----------
that you're doing and you know it


---------05:38----------
happened in the last I don't know six


---------05:40----------
months or so and so like I've spent a


---------05:42----------
long time you know looking looking for


---------05:45----------
you so I people I wanted to help that's


---------05:46----------
why I reached out originally okay well


---------05:49----------
yeah so if you guys are just tuning in


---------05:52----------
so bobbi and I have had a so we


---------05:54----------
connected a little bit when I had to


---------05:55----------
cancel cuz I was sick and we were just


---------05:57----------
kind of joking back and forth about


---------05:59----------
which one of us is neo and which one of


---------06:00----------
us is Morpheus


---------06:03----------
I thought I was Morpheus than you or neo


---------06:05----------
but we can get into it the first thing I


---------06:07----------
want to just comment on first of all


---------06:09----------
Bobbi is that it sounds like you know so


---------06:10----------
I know that there's a lot of flack


---------06:12----------
against gaming right now and like gaming


---------06:14----------
communities and gamers in 2019 the World


---------06:17----------
Health Organization sort of classified


---------06:19----------
video game addiction as a disorder and


---------06:22----------
recently like president Trump made some


---------06:25----------
comments about school shooters being


---------06:27----------
related to like violence related video


---------06:28----------
games and things like that I just want


---------06:31----------
to just kind of just point out that I


---------06:32----------
think it's really amazing that it sounds


---------06:34----------
like your involvement in the melee


---------06:36----------
community has really given you a lot of


---------06:39----------
pause


---------06:39----------
like it's given you your first job


---------06:41----------
opportunity it's taught you how to train


---------06:42----------
it's not you how to think and and so


---------06:45----------
like gaming is not evil in fact it


---------06:47----------
sounds like it's a huge way to kind of


---------06:50----------
help you figure out who you are yeah


---------06:54----------
yeah for as far as I can tell a game


---------07:02----------
when people are connected around it kind


---------07:04----------
of it becomes this external and kind of


---------07:07----------
objective way of communicating in a


---------07:10----------
sense you know we all agree to the rules


---------07:12----------
of the game and then once we agree then


---------07:14----------
we can really enter some dialogue about


---------07:15----------
it and it helps kind of it also helps us


---------07:21----------
kind of be more objective and like you


---------07:23----------
believe what the game tells you in terms


---------07:25----------
of like if I win then probably I know


---------07:27----------
something that you don't even if I can't


---------07:29----------
express it or communicate it personally


---------07:31----------
so I don't know I found that I found


---------07:34----------
that in a weird way a game can kind of


---------07:36----------
help people connect on a human level


---------07:38----------
like if you don't have any objective


---------07:41----------
kind of thing that we're all looking at


---------07:43----------
then we could be talking about two


---------07:46----------
different things and kind of not realize


---------07:48----------
it I think my life has been about two


---------07:50----------
key themes one is communication and two


---------07:52----------
is about belonging like I've kind of


---------07:54----------
just been obsessed with how hard it is


---------07:58----------
to communicate with people and how it's


---------08:01----------
really interesting a lot of the times so


---------08:02----------
I remember as a kid watching people in


---------08:04----------
my family talk and it was really clear


---------08:06----------
that there were two different


---------08:07----------
conversations happening or you could


---------08:09----------
totally tell that person one thought


---------08:11----------
that it was the same conversation and


---------08:13----------
person two thought it was the same


---------08:14----------
conversation and like neither of them


---------08:16----------
were correct it's just very interesting


---------08:17----------
how you know you can piece the puzzle of


---------08:20----------
the conversation together even if it's


---------08:21----------
wrong really easily sure I think maybe


---------08:24----------
what you're referring to is that


---------08:26----------
oftentimes when people have


---------08:28----------
conversations they're sort of just


---------08:29----------
waiting for the other person to stop


---------08:31----------
talking so that they can share their own


---------08:33----------
thoughts and it's not like two


---------08:36----------
concurrent monologues as opposed to an


---------08:38----------
actual dialogue which yeah I see a lot


---------08:41----------
is that kind of what you mean I in that


---------08:44----------
I think more it happens I notice in


---------08:47----------
conflict so say two people are not


---------08:48----------
getting what they need they're talking


---------08:50----------
about it I've been


---------08:53----------
taken aback by like how unclear


---------08:57----------
conversation participants can be about


---------08:59----------
what the real issue is you know what are


---------09:01----------
you really upset about is a question


---------09:02----------
that I think that I ask a lot and I'm


---------09:06----------
not sure how its received but I don't


---------09:08----------
hear asked a lot and I think a lot of


---------09:10----------
the time you know two people could make


---------09:11----------
peace but they never get to their real


---------09:13----------
problem and so so you said the other


---------09:17----------
thing that you've been kind of curious


---------09:19----------
about is belonging so can you tell me


---------09:21----------
yet about that yeah so you know growing


---------09:24----------
up so I was born in the east coast to a


---------09:26----------
Catholic family


---------09:27----------
and it's it sorry I definitely have


---------09:31----------
something stuck in my throat I've been


---------09:34----------
thinking about all the ways that I felt


---------09:36----------
that I didn't fit in and all the you


---------09:38----------
know little factors they conspired to


---------09:40----------
make that you know really kind of


---------09:43----------
obvious but you know I didn't really fit


---------09:45----------
in my family I wasn't really into sports


---------09:47----------
I D converted from Catholicism and I


---------09:51----------
think high school which is an experience


---------09:53----------
that I haven't really reflected on


---------09:55----------
enough it's like a big deal to kind of


---------09:57----------
walk away from something like that


---------09:58----------
without anything else to catch you I


---------10:01----------
didn't really fit in in grade school you


---------10:04----------
know I had a series of friends where


---------10:06----------
like kind of kind of I guess from my


---------10:11----------
young perspective I was betrayed or


---------10:13----------
whatever but we would have falling outs


---------10:14----------
I think in part because you know what my


---------10:17----------
parents spoiled me and you know I had a


---------10:19----------
bunch of stuff and so it's kind of a


---------10:21----------
little bit weird to have a bunch of


---------10:22----------
stuff and then your friends don't have


---------10:24----------
as much and then it's like kind of I


---------10:26----------
didn't know why that was the case


---------10:27----------
etcetera


---------10:28----------
but anyway so having not belong for


---------10:30----------
quite a long time but then finally melee


---------10:32----------
and like having this real sense that I


---------10:35----------
do fit in was kind of nuts it's one of


---------10:41----------
those things where something was missing


---------10:42----------
but I didn't know what and then I had


---------10:44----------
this thing and it's like oh this is the


---------10:46----------
thing that was missing like this is


---------10:48----------
really great and so what was it that you


---------10:50----------
found with melee well I think for


---------10:56----------
first time you know I to be honest like


---------10:57----------
I've reflected on this question a lot


---------10:59----------
and I think that the the answer is that


---------11:02----------
it's my it looses what me we is yeah


---------11:05----------
yeah for the Gamecube by the way I


---------11:08----------
thanks to profound soup for the gifted


---------11:11----------
subs thank you profound is that someone


---------11:14----------
yeah thanks for your support you were


---------11:17----------
saying um Bobby yeah I think that it's


---------11:20----------
kind of this this sense of purpose that


---------11:22----------
is purposeless you had this pure sense


---------11:25----------
of play I think that's what I found like


---------11:27----------
I found this sense of inspiration that


---------11:29----------
came totally from within so it's like I


---------11:31----------
want to get good at this game for no


---------11:32----------
other reason than I want to and then


---------11:34----------
also that it was kind of sustainable and


---------11:36----------
I could go really really deep and there


---------11:38----------
were other people who were that deep and


---------11:39----------
who are interested in that I I don't


---------11:41----------
know about I don't know about you but


---------11:43----------
I've I'm one of those people where say a


---------11:46----------
friend will say hey have you ever


---------11:47----------
watched this series like have you gotten


---------11:48----------
into the wire for example and I'll watch


---------11:51----------
it but I'll watch it and get really


---------11:52----------
really deep into the lore and before I


---------11:54----------
know it I'm asking them if they know


---------11:55----------
stuff and they don't so it's like I


---------11:57----------
always feel like I go a little bit


---------11:58----------
deeper in something that really


---------12:00----------
interests me and then I end up kind of


---------12:02----------
like alone you know deep inside the lore


---------12:05----------
of something so sure that's not super


---------12:08----------
sustainable like you may enjoy the


---------12:10----------
content but you don't get the human


---------12:11----------
connection that comes with it which i


---------12:13----------
think is like but it sounds like with


---------12:14----------
with with smash brothers melee you found


---------12:16----------
people who would get just as deep as you


---------12:18----------
did yeah it's both we're right I I got


---------12:22----------
to you know when I think about belonging


---------12:24----------
versus fitting in it's like belonging is


---------12:27----------
when you can be fully yourself and still


---------12:29----------
like accepted like I don't have to not


---------12:31----------
be myself in order to like fit in that


---------12:35----------
means that's that's some way that you


---------12:36----------
belong so it's like I can be myself as


---------12:39----------
much as I want and other people will


---------12:41----------
still be there and they'll be cool with


---------12:42----------
me yeah I I think you're talking about


---------12:45----------
sort of acceptance right so yes yourself


---------12:47----------
and being accepted for being yourself


---------12:49----------
yeah and and fitting in is when you sort


---------12:52----------
of become someone that you're not for


---------12:54----------
the sake of acceptance exactly and


---------12:56----------
fitting in super toxic for those of you


---------12:59----------
don't know yeah why do you say that


---------13:05----------
why do I say that well I feel that


---------13:08----------
acceptance is a thing that we're hungry


---------13:11----------
for and authenticity is also a thing


---------13:13----------
that we're hungry for and those two


---------13:14----------
things you know you end up on one side


---------13:17----------
or the other with the realm of hungry


---------13:19----------
ghosts if you choose to be purely


---------13:22----------
authentic but you know everybody hates


---------13:25----------
you you know because you can't find a


---------13:27----------
way to be authentic and took like exist


---------13:28----------
with people I don't know it's difficult


---------13:31----------
to transcend the need for you know


---------13:33----------
social interaction


---------13:34----------
I'm sure or if you like go fully in the


---------13:36----------
direction of acceptance but you


---------13:38----------
sacrifice who you are then you know you


---------13:41----------
may feel good for a little while but


---------13:42----------
it'll come for you you know it'll have


---------13:44----------
you gone down that road which one


---------13:46----------
probably probably I've gone down both


---------13:48----------
yeah


---------13:48----------
yeah I'm going down both I know my way I


---------13:50----------
know my way around this space so Oh


---------13:52----------
Bobbi is there something in particular


---------13:54----------
that that you wanted to talk about today


---------13:57----------
or that I can help you with yeah


---------14:00----------
absolutely but there's there's almost


---------14:02----------
too many things but one thing that we


---------14:04----------
talked about was meeting people where


---------14:05----------
they are and there's a couple you I'm


---------14:09----------
gonna just cover a couple things sure so


---------14:11----------
I listened to your conversation with


---------14:14----------
looser fruit yesterday and the rightness


---------14:17----------
anger hurt well there's my arrogance


---------14:22----------
thing struck a really strong chord and I


---------14:24----------
think if there's something there for me


---------14:25----------
there it's a different yeah is that what


---------14:28----------
your senses yeah there's a different


---------14:31----------
route you know I think I felt that she


---------14:33----------
had a route that where you asked her a


---------14:35----------
question and she gave an answer that I


---------14:37----------
wouldn't have but like before that I was


---------14:38----------
pretty much my answers would have been


---------14:40----------
exact Oh calm and I I think it bit yeah


---------14:43----------
there's something really important there


---------14:44----------
okay what do you thing that's coming to


---------14:48----------
mind is there's this I think it was


---------14:51----------
Boris or something I don't know the


---------14:53----------
Deuter you told to clean his room which


---------14:55----------
I thought was really yeah Julius


---------14:57----------
bulliest yeah you talked to him about


---------14:59----------
lying and how if you lie you don't have


---------15:02----------
to keep the thing you know that you're


---------15:05----------
gonna lie about like in good order you


---------15:07----------
can just have it be in you know in other


---------15:09----------
words you can have your life messy and


---------15:10----------
you're just gonna lie so now no one


---------15:11----------
knows


---------15:13----------
I stopped lying a long time ago because


---------15:16----------
I learned first hand that it sucks and


---------15:18----------
it just yeah but I have noticed you know


---------15:21----------
from that conversation that though okay


---------15:23----------
so I have a lot of thoughts and I think


---------15:26----------
about the world in a particular way but


---------15:29----------
I have never decided to share what I


---------15:32----------
think with other people and so in a


---------15:34----------
sense it's not that I'm lying about it


---------15:36----------
it's just that I'm hiding it and so I've


---------15:37----------
never gone in there and cleaned it up


---------15:39----------
and made it presentable and I think that


---------15:44----------
there's something like important about


---------15:47----------
accepting for myself the way that I


---------15:49----------
think that makes sense


---------15:51----------
like I don't quite I don't want woody


---------15:53----------
yeah I have this sense that I don't want


---------15:56----------
other people to know the way that I


---------15:57----------
think why not why do i why do I have


---------16:04----------
sensor well yeah what is it that makes


---------16:06----------
you feel like other people there's a


---------16:10----------
part of you that you don't want to show


---------16:12----------
to other people yeah I've had that sense


---------16:15----------
my whole life okay so I'll talk a little


---------16:17----------
bit about my history like or you know my


---------16:20----------
kind of something more personal so in my


---------16:22----------
family my dad's side there's a disease


---------16:25----------
called CMT charcot-marie-tooth it's like


---------16:27----------
a degenerative kind of disease and I


---------16:30----------
know that both my dad and his dad like


---------16:35----------
have gone to extreme lengths to hide it


---------16:37----------
from other people so like their whole


---------16:39----------
life is about not being seen as weak


---------16:42----------
because like their their body is


---------16:43----------
degenerating right so they're always


---------16:45----------
hiding something I'm pretty confident


---------16:48----------
that that same anxiety passed to me cuz


---------16:51----------
I've had the sense my whole life that


---------16:52----------
like I've been hiding something and for


---------16:54----------
me I think maybe I just replaced it with


---------16:56----------
like I don't belong or something like


---------16:57----------
that but I've been looking for what I've


---------17:00----------
been hiding my whole life and I've never


---------17:01----------
found anything like what do I have to


---------17:04----------
hide where if people found out the thing


---------17:06----------
then I would be outcast forever I have a


---------17:10----------
deep sense that there is something there


---------17:11----------
but I've never been able to find it so


---------17:14----------
that you're you want to hide something


---------17:15----------
about who you are and yeah there our


---------17:18----------
hypothesis is that this was essentially


---------17:19----------
something that you learned from your dad


---------17:21----------
and your grandfather yeah and I don't


---------17:24----------
have the disease is it it is a


---------17:27----------
what do you call it an inherited disease


---------17:28----------
and I just didn't get the gene so it's


---------17:30----------
like if I had it then I would have


---------17:32----------
filled in the blank with the same thing


---------17:33----------
and then everything would have been fine


---------17:34----------
cuz my worldview would have made sense


---------17:36----------
but now I kind of it's been built on


---------17:38----------
this thing that doesn't you know I'm


---------17:41----------
trying to say there's like a whole yeah


---------17:43----------
so it sounds like you have you feel like


---------17:45----------
you need to hide something but you can't


---------17:46----------
understand what it is that you need to


---------17:48----------
hide yeah and so you know I've filled


---------17:52----------
that in with a bunch of things along the


---------17:54----------
line and you know it's like okay yeah so


---------17:57----------
I've had working hypotheses about what


---------17:59----------
it might be that I need to hide over


---------18:01----------
time and it's the answer has changed


---------18:03----------
well one thing that I still feel that I


---------18:06----------
do hide without any reason is the way I


---------18:09----------
think I feel like if people know that


---------18:12----------
about me and they won't accept me yeah


---------18:15----------
so why do you think that that's


---------18:16----------
unfounded though it's possible it is


---------18:19----------
probably founded it's probably well


---------18:21----------
founded only didn't didn't we talk I


---------18:23----------
think yeah go ahead


---------18:24----------
didn't we talk about how you have a lot


---------18:26----------
of kind of interpersonal conflict


---------18:29----------
between people when you share your


---------18:30----------
thoughts because they're not able to


---------18:32----------
meet you where you are and you're not


---------18:33----------
able to meet them where they are yes so


---------18:36----------
it sounds like when you actually show


---------18:37----------
who you are to people that it isn't


---------18:40----------
well-received


---------18:41----------
I think that's true I also have the


---------18:44----------
sense that when I when I approach a


---------18:47----------
conversation from the perspective that I


---------18:49----------
have something to hide it tends to go


---------18:51----------
much more poorly than if I show up


---------18:53----------
without having to hide anything yeah in


---------18:55----------
other words like I'll hide some of my


---------18:57----------
assumptions that help make the story


---------18:59----------
make sense like words that I'm saying


---------19:01----------
don't make sense to other people and I


---------19:03----------
realize after the fact that I didn't say


---------19:05----------
the like first part of the story so


---------19:07----------
let's just pause for second and just


---------19:11----------
think about this for a second so you say


---------19:12----------
that you have something that you feel


---------19:14----------
like you need to hide about yourself and


---------19:16----------
let's just understand what the different


---------19:18----------
hypotheses are for why someone can think


---------19:21----------
that okay yeah so the first is that you


---------19:25----------
know so I tend to have like an mo which


---------19:27----------
tends to be around some scars which is


---------19:29----------
that you do actually have something to


---------19:31----------
hide and that's a very genuine feeling


---------19:33----------
and that if we dig we'll find something


---------19:35----------
that will fit our hypothesis of there is


---------19:38----------
something I need to hide I just don't


---------19:39----------
know what it


---------19:40----------
hmm but we have to pause for a second


---------19:43----------
because that hypothesis in a sense part


---------19:45----------
of what I don't like about that kind of


---------19:47----------
thinking is that it always presumes that


---------19:49----------
the answer is like one layer deeper and


---------19:51----------
if we don't find anything it's that


---------19:53----------
we're not digging deep enough right so


---------19:55----------
so it's kind of tricky because it's like


---------19:57----------
if I believe that there's some like deep


---------19:59----------
juicy psychological root to all of your


---------20:01----------
problems I can continue to believe that


---------20:03----------
and if I don't find it I can just say


---------20:05----------
that oh it's deeper it's deeper it's


---------20:07----------
deeper so it's actually a it's not a


---------20:09----------
very scientific hypothesis because it's


---------20:10----------
not falsifiable agree second thing is


---------20:15----------
how much do you know about epigenetics


---------20:17----------
our inherited trauma have you learned


---------20:18----------
anything about this stuff studied this


---------20:20----------
okay no I've only heard from you so I


---------20:22----------
think this is kind of an very


---------20:24----------
interesting kind of field of frankly


---------20:27----------
pseudoscience so the this is really in


---------20:30----------
the qualitative research realm so it


---------20:32----------
hasn't really been that born out but as


---------20:36----------
kind of a promising and kind of


---------20:38----------
intriguing field so the first is that


---------20:39----------
when we think about what we inherit from


---------20:42----------
people before us we tend to think about


---------20:46----------
genetics right so like if your dad has a


---------20:48----------
certain hair color or eye color your mom


---------20:50----------
has a certain hair color eye color


---------20:51----------
you're likely to have those hair colors


---------20:53----------
or eye color sometimes you know


---------20:55----------
depending on whether it's recessive or


---------20:56----------
dominant things can skip a generation so


---------20:59----------
we know that there's genetic inheritance


---------21:01----------
from generations past there's a really


---------21:04----------
interesting book so this is more of a


---------21:07----------
qualitative exploration about this


---------21:09----------
concept of inherited trauma which looked


---------21:12----------
at Holocaust survivors and specifically


---------21:14----------
the children of Holocaust survivors and


---------21:17----------
that the children of Holocaust survivors


---------21:19----------
exhibited some signs or symptoms of PTSD


---------21:22----------
which really didn't map on to like any


---------21:25----------
kind of trauma because they were never


---------21:26----------
traumatized right it was sort of like


---------21:28----------
they had some version of PTSD even


---------21:30----------
though there was never a Sentinel event


---------21:32----------
so that they believed and acted in


---------21:34----------
certain ways like almost like you are


---------21:38----------
right so where you're trying to hide


---------21:39----------
something I mean that that can be


---------21:41----------
actually passed on from generations


---------21:44----------
previously so there are kind of two


---------21:47----------
scientific mechanisms through this one


---------21:50----------
is through apogee attic changes so we


---------21:53----------
have the actual sequence


---------21:54----------
of our genes and then we also have


---------21:55----------
epigenetics which is like the activation


---------21:58----------
or dis activation of particular genes


---------22:01----------
and those can actually be passed on to


---------22:03----------
so as you activate let's say like


---------22:05----------
certain genes that maybe make you more


---------22:07----------
prone to anxiety even like you can pass


---------22:10----------
on some degree of that epigenetically


---------22:12----------
it's still an emerging field the science


---------22:15----------
is not really clear I guess


---------22:16----------
pseudoscience is a little bit unfair


---------22:18----------
it's just an emerging field that we


---------22:19----------
don't really rice in right the other


---------22:22----------
thing is that it may not be something


---------22:24----------
that's on the epigenetic level but is


---------22:25----------
something more on the the social or


---------22:28----------
psychological or like upbringing level


---------22:31----------
right so it's not nature on the


---------22:34----------
epigenetic it's nurture so yeah


---------22:36----------
essentially like if your dad was anxious


---------22:40----------
and and like taught you how to hide then


---------22:42----------
you can sort of mimic his behaviors yeah


---------22:44----------
so children of abusive parents will


---------22:48----------
oftentimes be abusive there's some


---------22:50----------
really interesting research about if you


---------22:53----------
have a child with an anxiety disorder


---------22:55----------
and you have a parent with an anxiety


---------22:57----------
disorder you can actually treat the


---------22:59----------
parents anxiety disorder and the child's


---------23:02----------
anxiety will get better I don't want any


---------23:04----------
direct treatment I totally believe that


---------23:06----------
and so then so we have two scientific


---------23:10----------
kind of causes for the first thing is


---------23:13----------
that either this has happened either you


---------23:15----------
feel like you need to hide things number


---------23:16----------
one because there's something deep down


---------23:18----------
that you need to hide the second is that


---------23:21----------
there could be some degree of an


---------23:22----------
epigenetic phenomenon going on in terms


---------23:24----------
of like you said that you know in that


---------23:26----------
something that you've kind of pieced


---------23:27----------
together right so that there's something


---------23:29----------
like a tradition of and that may have


---------23:31----------
changed actually the the way that your


---------23:33----------
dad's genes were activated and that can


---------23:35----------
be passed along or that it was sort of


---------23:38----------
the way that you were raised and taught


---------23:39----------
and you certain behaviors were modeled


---------23:41----------
for you mm-hmm


---------23:43----------
and then we get to the really wild stuff


---------23:45----------
which is frankly like this sort of garma


---------23:48----------
reincarnation like that kind of thing


---------23:50----------
which I mean I think is so first of all


---------23:54----------
is a little bit more spiritual but I


---------23:55----------
think generally speaking you know I


---------23:58----------
think a lot of these like more spiritual


---------24:00----------
or non scientific concepts are actually


---------24:04----------
supported by science the further that


---------24:06----------
science advances


---------24:07----------
think about God Irma in this idea that


---------24:10----------
like you you are born with certain


---------24:12----------
things that are from beyond this life


---------24:15----------
that's basically what karma says is that


---------24:17----------
all causes have effects and that all


---------24:19----------
effects have causes that's really all


---------24:21----------
god am i saying it's actually like


---------24:23----------
Newtonian physics so every action has an


---------24:25----------
equal and opposite reaction and so if


---------24:27----------
you look at your particular life that


---------24:29----------
your particular life has causes so the


---------24:32----------
effects of your life the way that you


---------24:34----------
are today is actually affected by things


---------24:37----------
that happened before your life even


---------24:39----------
began yeah


---------24:41----------
which SATs true again so the interesting


---------24:44----------
moment from the perspective of like my


---------24:46----------
worldview anyway I think it that's true


---------24:47----------
what do you mean by that


---------24:49----------
like the I really want to get this thing


---------24:52----------
out of my throat man this is killing me


---------24:54----------
does it ever get some water you know get


---------24:56----------
some water okay yeah just drink


---------24:58----------
something is that gonna make it go away


---------25:01----------
I guess it kind of does yeah you have


---------25:04----------
post-nasal drip is there actually


---------25:07----------
something in your throat or you feel


---------25:08----------
like clearing your throat there was but


---------25:11----------
I think that I the water flush it out


---------25:13----------
okay you're on top of it I said from the


---------25:16----------
perspective of my worldview that makes


---------25:18----------
sense so basically like I've gone to all


---------25:20----------
sorts of lengths to figure out why I


---------25:21----------
feel like not good enough not good


---------25:24----------
enough I know as a theme a lot of people


---------25:25----------
feel that way I have a very deep sense


---------25:27----------
of it and I've like tried to fix it so I


---------25:32----------
try to understand it and so belonging


---------25:37----------
and community is the number one thing


---------25:40----------
that's helped me feel like a good enough


---------25:42----------
person but I've noticed that if I'm in


---------25:44----------
the melee context you know I feel good


---------25:45----------
its context you know it kind of goes out


---------25:49----------
the window and I found that to be very


---------25:51----------
interesting and so I've kind of noticed


---------25:53----------
that I had these different personalities


---------25:55----------
in relation to different communities and


---------25:57----------
I've thought pretty deeply about that


---------25:59----------
like I'm as a twitch staff and as an


---------26:01----------
employee I feel one way you know with my


---------26:03----------
family I feel a different way with the


---------26:05----------
melee community I feel a different way


---------26:06----------
with like my wife's friends I feel a


---------26:08----------
different way and I played with that I


---------26:11----------
actually like meditated for an hour a


---------26:13----------
day for a hundred days to try to like


---------26:15----------
get deeper into my mind I found that we


---------26:18----------
can talk about that a little bit later


---------26:19----------
but I felt very anxious when I met


---------26:21----------
I don't think that I was in you know I


---------26:23----------
didn't have the right well anyway I


---------26:26----------
didn't kind of accept the thoughts as


---------26:28----------
they came I was trying to be enlightened


---------26:29----------
I actually straight up was like all


---------26:31----------
right I'm gonna hit I'm gonna achieve


---------26:32----------
enlightenment and I know that my idea


---------26:34----------
about that was like not well-founded


---------26:37----------
so Bobby I'm gonna jump in for a second


---------26:40----------
so you say that you kind of have a sense


---------26:41----------
that you're not good enough yeah and


---------26:43----------
that you've tried a lot of different


---------26:44----------
reasons a lot of ways to fix that


---------26:47----------
because you're assuming that that's like


---------26:48----------
some kind of pathology or that's


---------26:50----------
something wrong with you and you tried


---------26:53----------
meditation and different kinds of


---------26:56----------
environments and circumstances to help


---------26:58----------
you feel good enough yeah okay so I have


---------27:03----------
a really crazy question for you if you I


---------27:06----------
inserted the fact that maybe you're


---------27:07----------
actually not good enough yes that's been


---------27:10----------
hypothesis number one and how do you


---------27:13----------
feel about that I mean I believe it I


---------27:18----------
believe that I believe that I'm not


---------27:20----------
gonna know for sure so I feel great to


---------27:23----------
think that it makes everything make


---------27:24----------
sense yeah so so it does that cause you


---------27:27----------
suffering


---------27:31----------
ah that's a good question what I'll say


---------27:41----------
is that that idea does not cause me


---------27:43----------
suffering I feel totally fine with the


---------27:45----------
idea that I'm not good enough what does


---------27:47----------
cause me suffering is to have reflected


---------27:49----------
back to me something that I don't


---------27:50----------
believe is true so if someone else kind


---------27:53----------
of you know you're when you were talking


---------27:56----------
about when you're talking with loser


---------27:58----------
fruit you said something about cutting


---------28:00----------
yourself some slack and that being


---------28:01----------
something that she could try maybe it


---------28:04----------
was with the guy you had before Mitch


---------28:07----------
Mitch Jones okay but anyway my kind of


---------28:10----------
response as you asked that question you


---------28:12----------
know the one that comes from me is that


---------28:13----------
I don't cut myself any slack and I like


---------28:16----------
that and I want other people to know


---------28:19----------
that I don't cut myself any slack so


---------28:20----------
that when they asked me questions like


---------28:23----------
in other words I wish that I had some


---------28:25----------
way of saying like you don't believe


---------28:27----------
that I've done this due diligence but I


---------28:29----------
have so just stop asking questions along


---------28:31----------
this line unless you really want to get


---------28:33----------
into it cuz like I've already done this


---------28:34----------
work like I don't cut myself any slack


---------28:36----------
so I don't need you to okay you know ask


---------28:39----------
me a billion questions about a couple of


---------28:41----------
different things going on here okay


---------28:42----------
cool the first is how you relate to


---------28:45----------
other people which is oh [ __ ] so you


---------28:49----------
get into that and I can help you with


---------28:51----------
that but the second thing is I want to


---------28:53----------
offer another option so I so generally


---------28:55----------
speaking when people feel like they're


---------28:57----------
not good enough we almost assume that


---------28:59----------
that is like a sense of inadequacy right


---------29:02----------
yeah do you feel inadequate no okay so


---------29:07----------
good so now I think you are one of the


---------29:09----------
very rare people where your sense of not


---------29:12----------
good enough so I don't usually say this


---------29:14----------
to most people right like so for most


---------29:15----------
people that I talk to if they tell me


---------29:17----------
that they don't feel good enough we try


---------29:18----------
to dig into how their insecurity is


---------29:21----------
actually like comes from a root that is


---------29:24----------
like unfair and you're yes I actually


---------29:26----------
think you're not good enough okay


---------29:28----------
because it's strange right because in


---------29:30----------
your sense


---------29:31----------
you're not good enough doesn't actually


---------29:32----------
cause you a problem it doesn't cause you


---------29:34----------
suffering so I think your sense of not


---------29:37----------
being good enough is actually the


---------29:39----------
calling of an incomplete karma oh I


---------29:42----------
totally agree with you yeah I'm not yeah


---------29:44----------
I totally agree with you


---------29:45----------
and and so in your case I think that


---------29:47----------
that force that that causes you to


---------29:49----------
strive to be a little bit better which I


---------29:51----------
don't think you need to be better I


---------29:52----------
think you do something that's a little


---------29:54----------
bit unhealthy with that but you need to


---------29:58----------
help yourself understand that you're


---------30:00----------
first of all you're not you're not good


---------30:02----------
enough and secondly that that's okay and


---------30:05----------
that over time you will become good


---------30:09----------
enough in the way that you need to be


---------30:11----------
and in the way that the world needs you


---------30:13----------
to be hmm I'll try it's super hard to


---------30:18----------
what to be the me that I think the world


---------30:23----------
is asking me to be yeah so that's your


---------30:27----------
problem


---------30:27----------
is because you're trying super hard and


---------30:30----------
the more you try the less authentic you


---------30:33----------
become okay that I think that that is


---------30:37----------
true mm-hmm so so you're right


---------30:39----------
so what you need to do is just


---------30:41----------
understand that you don't need to try to


---------30:42----------
be anyone else you just need to be you


---------30:45----------
oh people won't like me upon me so then


---------30:48----------
we get to the second part right which is


---------30:50----------
the [ __ ] which is the way that's why I


---------30:51----------
don't that's why I don't be Who I am if


---------30:54----------
he won't like me upon me I believe that


---------30:56----------
yeah that that's because so I don't that


---------31:01----------
that's a problem I agree


---------31:03----------
okay but that we're gonna have to gonna


---------31:06----------
go slower we're gonna go into how you


---------31:09----------
relate to other people but the first


---------31:10----------
thing that I want you to understand is


---------31:11----------
that I don't think you're good enough


---------31:12----------
and I think you're good enough Ness is


---------31:15----------
not like a deficiency or earning


---------31:18----------
inadequacy and I'm glad that you


---------31:19----------
actually don't feel inadequate because I


---------31:21----------
think this is rare you're good enough


---------31:23----------
'no siz actually just a sense of


---------31:25----------
incompleteness it's like a ball that's


---------31:27----------
been thrown up in the air and hasn't


---------31:29----------
come down and so just have faith that


---------31:33----------
that and maybe this is where you know I


---------31:36----------
would encourage you to


---------31:37----------
and yeah okay so we got to get to the


---------31:39----------
other people because that's you're


---------31:41----------
hesitant at the way that you relate to


---------31:43----------
other people makes it hard for you to


---------31:45----------
accept the person that you are because


---------31:48----------
other people are not willing to accept


---------31:49----------
that person but I don't think that they


---------31:52----------
actually see that person I think they


---------31:54----------
see some distorted version of that


---------31:56----------
person because I think you've got other


---------31:57----------
kind of things that come out when you


---------31:59----------
relate to other people and when you talk


---------32:01----------
to a guy but let's start with so I think


---------32:03----------
it's okay for you to not be good enough


---------32:05----------
I think you're not good enough I think


---------32:06----------
you have just an incomplete Dharma right


---------32:09----------
so that sense of not being good enough


---------32:11----------
is your Dharma so until that voice is


---------32:14----------
quieted you should continue to strive to


---------32:18----------
be whatever the world needs you to be


---------32:20----------
also to be yourself because the world is


---------32:24----------
not going to ask you to be anything that


---------32:26----------
you cannot be mm-hmm oh I feel okay I


---------32:35----------
think that what you're under stand what


---------32:37----------
you're saying here's let me repeat back


---------32:38----------
I don't necessarily get I'll tell you


---------32:42----------
what I do understand I felt that people


---------32:45----------
have told me that I need to be a


---------32:46----------
different person and I found that as I


---------32:48----------
listen to them they don't feel that


---------32:51----------
anything's gotten better and so I've


---------32:53----------
learned to kind of not trust when people


---------32:56----------
tell me oh you need to talk in this way


---------32:58----------
or you need to do this you need to do


---------32:59----------
that and they're rather they're pointing


---------33:01----------
at a sense that they can't quite put


---------33:03----------
their finger on what the real problem is


---------33:05----------
okay


---------33:06----------
and so when you say the world is telling


---------33:09----------
you like I kind of try to listen to


---------33:10----------
let's call it reality like people can


---------33:13----------
tell me things but oftentimes the words


---------33:16----------
that content is not like really where


---------33:18----------
the meaning is or where the money is as


---------33:19----------
you put it so I feel like what you're


---------33:21----------
saying is that if I read between the


---------33:23----------
lines the world is not and has not asked


---------33:26----------
me to be not me


---------33:28----------
it's just asked me to be me yes and also


---------33:31----------
the world has told me that I have a


---------33:33----------
feeling of not good enough and my not


---------33:36----------
good enough comes from a job not yet


---------33:37----------
done which is my feeling but that's not


---------33:40----------
coming from the world that's coming from


---------33:41----------
you


---------33:42----------
which part the feeling of not being good


---------33:45----------
enough okay so the world is asking you


---------33:48----------
to be a different person or not the


---------33:50----------
world but individual people so I'll give


---------33:51----------
you an example or the world telling you


---------33:53----------
that you're good enough and that's melee


---------33:55----------
yeah right so when you think about the


---------33:58----------
melee community you just showed up and


---------34:00----------
you were just you showed up I just


---------34:02----------
showed up yeah and that was sufficient


---------34:04----------
that was enough you felt like you


---------34:05----------
belonged so we actually have evidence


---------34:08----------
that when you show up in the right place


---------34:10----------
at the right time and you be the person


---------34:12----------
that you're that you are that everything


---------34:15----------
is is hunky-dory and kosher and


---------34:17----------
wonderful and that's you fulfilling your


---------34:19----------
Dharma okay can I ask you a different


---------34:22----------
question I pivot slightly here's the


---------34:26----------
thing that happens in melee that lets me


---------34:28----------
show up as me and I I have a question


---------34:31----------
all the time when I interact with people


---------34:32----------
it's even happening right now of like


---------34:34----------
why like why am I here why are we


---------34:37----------
talking why is anybody care like why


---------34:39----------
like guys there's a why question that


---------34:40----------
with melee the answer was melee and I


---------34:43----------
didn't have there was no question below


---------34:45----------
it yep like me talking to you I'm


---------34:48----------
excited to talk to you so maybe that's a


---------34:49----------
good enough why like I'm here because I


---------34:51----------
want to be and I just want to I just


---------34:52----------
want to talk with you but I find that


---------34:55----------
like social anxiety and even you know


---------34:57----------
I'm really working on parenting is I


---------34:59----------
have a three-year-old and I don't want


---------35:00----------
to pass my insanity to him I have a why


---------35:05----------
question of like I want to do a good job


---------35:07----------
as a dad but it's like it's not a why


---------35:08----------
it's like how do I do that or what does


---------35:10----------
that mean or what does it look like it


---------35:11----------
gets complicated and then I'm in my head


---------35:14----------
and I'm not right where I'm is that the


---------35:18----------
right word yeah sure but listen so how


---------35:22----------
do I be me Who am I okay so how do you


---------35:29----------
be you


---------35:33----------
so here's the problem with being you the


---------35:36----------
problem with being you is you're


---------35:38----------
concerned about the consequences of


---------35:40----------
being you and the more you have become


---------35:43----------
concerned about the consequences of


---------35:44----------
being you the less you become you right


---------35:50----------
hell yeah I'm concerned about the


---------35:51----------
consequences I learned right that I


---------35:53----------
should be concerned about the


---------35:54----------
consequences there's a lot of saying


---------35:56----------
that's that's what you got to unlearn


---------35:57----------
right so that's the pain that you got a


---------35:59----------
process because let me explain something


---------36:00----------
to you you can't screw up your kid like


---------36:02----------
you just can't right like like does that


---------36:05----------
make sense to you or no no hero so so


---------36:09----------
you know you have a three-year-old right


---------36:10----------
so your three-year-old like comes up to


---------36:13----------
you sometimes and wants to do something


---------36:15----------
and then like like what's the last thing


---------36:19----------
your three-year-old ask you to do be a


---------36:21----------
monster okay be a shark okay and so like


---------36:25----------
eat the corn and the tomatoes that the


---------36:28----------
farmers growing okay and did you do that


---------36:31----------
I did okay so was that what was the


---------36:36----------
consequent that did you mess him up no


---------36:38----------
but I think if I said no I don't care


---------36:41----------
about your stupid shark that wouldn't


---------36:44----------
been bad that would have been bad I


---------36:46----------
agree


---------36:46----------
but what what did you feel like doing


---------36:49----------
what was the authentic you telling you


---------36:51----------
to do I really would have preferred to


---------36:54----------
rest okay I chose to be a shark okay


---------37:01----------
right so is that net net net net I


---------37:05----------
prefer to be a shark okay so so in fact


---------37:08----------
like that's that's what being a parent


---------37:09----------
is right like your kids sometimes shows


---------37:11----------
up and like wants you to be a shark and


---------37:13----------
you want to rest and if you're just


---------37:15----------
gonna do your dog amount to your child


---------37:16----------
it's like being a shark for a little


---------37:18----------
while because the other thing that you


---------37:20----------
need to understand if you tell your


---------37:21----------
child from time to time that Daddy


---------37:23----------
really doesn't want to be a shark right


---------37:24----------
now I'm super tired


---------37:25----------
is that gonna mess him up no that would


---------37:28----------
be a nice way to say it


---------37:29----------
but I feel guilty sometimes I don't know


---------37:31----------
I've been listening to how you talk


---------37:32----------
about you know how you are with your


---------37:36----------
kids and I think it's really good and I


---------37:37----------
want to learn how to do that better


---------37:38----------
how'd it be less apologetically me I had


---------37:41----------
this kind of thing that's in my mind of


---------37:43----------
like being a little bit more we need to


---------37:45----------
do is stop


---------37:46----------
to be better like this is the problem is


---------37:49----------
that you have a sense of incompleteness


---------37:52----------
right but then ya think that the


---------37:54----------
solution to that incomplete list if


---------37:55----------
you're not good enough the solution is


---------37:57----------
to get better that's where you're making


---------37:58----------
a mistake you don't need to be better


---------38:00----------
just because you're not good enough


---------38:02----------
doesn't mean that you need to be better


---------38:04----------
cuz that sense of completeness are


---------38:07----------
becoming better is gonna happen like you


---------38:10----------
didn't create smash smash happen to you


---------38:12----------
whatever is gonna happen to you is gonna


---------38:15----------
happen to you like you get that your kid


---------38:16----------
happened to you yeah like you didn't


---------38:19----------
like your kid is amazing yeah did you


---------38:22----------
make I didn't know so like like if you


---------38:25----------
didn't make that amazing using what me


---------38:27----------
what makes you think you can [ __ ] up


---------38:29----------
that amazingness you're right you're


---------38:31----------
right tunics it yeah you're right you're


---------38:33----------
yeah you're right you're right right


---------38:35----------
about what where I saying it's like


---------38:37----------
completely ridiculous it's it's a


---------38:40----------
delusion of control to believe that I


---------38:42----------
can that I'd like yeah that I


---------38:43----------
super-duper influence my kid because i


---------38:46----------
do realize you know through meditation I


---------38:48----------
barely even control myself


---------38:50----------
you know yeah so so this is where to


---------38:54----------
think that I can both control myself


---------38:55----------
predict the bounces of what I'm gonna do


---------38:57----------
and how he's gonna hear it at that


---------38:59----------
particular moment so that I can craft


---------39:00----------
him into it as ridiculous exactly right


---------39:03----------
so that's the thing you can't craft him


---------39:05----------
into anything you can't make him be good


---------39:07----------
and you can't make him be bats also just


---------39:09----------
share something from the field of


---------39:11----------
Psychiatry so sometimes when I'm working


---------39:13----------
in the emergency room which is not


---------39:14----------
something thankfully I do much anymore


---------39:16----------
but I actually kind of miss it so


---------39:17----------
sometimes you get a kid who comes in


---------39:19----------
who's like completely all who has


---------39:20----------
something that we call SLS [ __ ] life


---------39:23----------
syndrome like that's the diagnosis they


---------39:25----------
have like ADHD and PTSD and depression


---------39:27----------
and this learning disability and this


---------39:30----------
kind of thing they've been in juvie and


---------39:32----------
they've got this case worker so like


---------39:34----------
they're all these like diagnoses that we


---------39:36----------
checked but really what it is is there's


---------39:37----------
this wonderful nurse practitioner who


---------39:39----------
works in the emergency room who's like


---------39:41----------
she's just she's a veteran so she's been


---------39:43----------
doing it for a long time and she was


---------39:45----------
like a brilliant person taught me a lot


---------39:47----------
about psychiatry she's like this part of


---------39:48----------
this kid doesn't have any of this stuff


---------39:49----------
this kid has [ __ ] life syndrome and then


---------39:53----------
so then something funny happens so like


---------39:55----------
when you meet the kid and the kid is


---------39:57----------
like a complete [ __ ] or whatever and


---------39:59----------
you try to be compassionate


---------40:00----------
empathic or whatever and you you make


---------40:02----------
some progress with the kid and then at


---------40:03----------
some point you meet the parents and then


---------40:05----------
one of two things happens when you meet


---------40:07----------
the parents you start to ask yourself


---------40:09----------
how can you still hear me


---------40:12----------
are we frozen Oh hold on


---------40:19----------
twitch chat' my life frozen crash okay


---------40:24----------
hold on Oh are we back can you hear me


---------40:32----------
Bobby I can hear you okay so I was where


---------40:36----------
did where did we lose you I thought it


---------40:37----------
froze for a second you're asking chat


---------40:40----------
you didn't never lose me but okay so you


---------40:43----------
heard the story about yeah her soul then


---------40:44----------
you meet the parents okay if you meet


---------40:47----------
the parents one of two things happens


---------40:49----------
you either so at some point like you


---------40:51----------
know you meet a really like messed up


---------40:52----------
kid and then you meet the parents and


---------40:54----------
then you say oh that's why they're that


---------40:55----------
way like you how did this kid end up


---------40:57----------
like this and then you meet the parents


---------40:58----------
they're like oh that makes perfect sense


---------41:00----------
that's how but sometimes you meet the


---------41:03----------
parents and they're like the nicest most


---------41:04----------
wonderful people in the world they have


---------41:06----------
two siblings who are also like wonderful


---------41:08----------
people and you're like how the [ __ ] did


---------41:09----------
that happen we have no idea that


---------41:12----------
sometimes I mean is it I know it sounds


---------41:14----------
insensitive but like sometimes you just


---------41:16----------
get like a bad kid and it's not the kids


---------41:18----------
fault but it's also not the parents


---------41:19----------
fault


---------41:19----------
mm-hmm my point is that you know like


---------41:22----------
you're like your kid is amazing and you


---------41:24----------
didn't really make him that way he's


---------41:26----------
just do it right it makes sense to me


---------41:28----------
and so you can't craft him into


---------41:30----------
something but you can certainly do right


---------41:32----------
things or you can do wrong things right


---------41:34----------
there are times where you can say like


---------41:37----------
you know I'm too tired and there are


---------41:39----------
also times where you can like be a shark


---------41:41----------
so you can do your Dharma to him but you


---------41:43----------
don't control the Karma you control the


---------41:46----------
Dharma you control what you do you don't


---------41:48----------
control what happens to him yeah and who


---------41:51----------
he becomes you just do the best that you


---------41:53----------
can and at times it's important to tell


---------41:55----------
him that you're tired because he's got


---------41:57----------
to understand that like other human


---------41:59----------
beings have like feelings and limits you


---------42:02----------
know and he can start to learn


---------42:04----------
compassion and things like that so I


---------42:05----------
think that you can you can you know


---------42:07----------
logic yourself and thought loop yourself


---------42:09----------
into thinking that you're doing a bad


---------42:11----------
job no matter what you're doing


---------42:14----------
and so to kind of sum up I mean I think


---------42:19----------
yeah I think I think your problem is


---------42:22----------
that you try too hard to control the


---------42:24----------
consequences of your behavior sure for


---------42:27----------
sure yeah I see that


---------42:30----------
and.and so okay so let me just think is


---------42:36----------
that sufficient on that do we want to


---------42:38----------
talk about other people do you need a


---------42:41----------
you know an analogy about nature to


---------42:45----------
drive things home no I think I I think I


---------42:49----------
understand what you're saying okay so


---------42:51----------
help us understand what I'm saying I


---------42:53----------
think that I mean you talk about it all


---------43:01----------
the time man and and I know it from from


---------43:03----------
playing melee like if I'm trying to win


---------43:05----------
though the best thing to do if you're


---------43:08----------
trying to win is like don't try to win


---------43:10----------
like you just have to play like it's


---------43:12----------
always a paradox at the end of the day I


---------43:13----------
think that you're telling me that I'm


---------43:16----------
not seeing I'm seeing a paradoxes cause


---------43:18----------
and effect where like I can just try to


---------43:22----------
be better and that's gonna do the thing


---------43:25----------
but if I want to be better I need to not


---------43:28----------
try to be better


---------43:29----------
exactly right if I want to see Who I am


---------43:32----------
then I need to stop trying to trying is


---------43:35----------
trying is the devil I mean I'm trying to


---------43:38----------
figure out who I am so that I can be Who


---------43:40----------
I am I'm trying to control being Who I


---------43:41----------
am just kind of ridiculous trying I'm


---------43:44----------
trying trying like you can't you know


---------43:45----------
ascendance doesn't come out of your your


---------43:47----------
mouth with without the word trying yeah


---------43:50----------
it doesn't come out of my head either


---------43:52----------
either my head exactly what citizen that


---------43:55----------
that's how we're seeing what's in your


---------43:56----------
head and that's the problem you need to


---------43:57----------
pull out a crime and this is where I


---------44:00----------
think it related to other people so I


---------44:02----------
agree so I think I completely agree so I


---------44:04----------
will get into that but now I want to


---------44:07----------
just go back for a second and just


---------44:08----------
remind you that


---------44:11----------
okay let me just think about this so


---------44:13----------
oddly enough I think your sense of not


---------44:16----------
being good enough is actually could be


---------44:18----------
your solace here so for a lot of people


---------44:21----------
feeling not good enough is a sense of


---------44:23----------
inadequacy which makes you want to try


---------44:25----------
harder but if you can accept that you're


---------44:27----------
and I think you're halfway there because


---------44:29----------
your sense of not being good enough


---------44:30----------
doesn't cause you suffering it's not a


---------44:32----------
sense of inadequacy it's just the sense


---------44:35----------
of something half done right and so if


---------44:40----------
you can take solace in the fact that the


---------44:42----------
other half is gonna come when it's gonna


---------44:43----------
come that a flower is gonna bloom when


---------44:45----------
it blooms like you can see the bulb and


---------44:48----------
you can say it hasn't bloomed yet and


---------44:49----------
like that doesn't have to be a problem


---------44:51----------
and the flower can think like oh I need


---------44:54----------
to bloom but like no you're gonna bloom


---------44:56----------
it's just gonna happen when it happens


---------44:57----------
and that's what smash taught you so


---------45:00----------
you're gonna is teaching you this


---------45:01----------
already that in order to create this


---------45:03----------
amazing child you didn't need to try to


---------45:05----------
do anything you just needed to be the


---------45:07----------
person that you could be be the best


---------45:09----------
person that you could every day for your


---------45:11----------
son and as long as you do that he seems


---------45:13----------
to be doing pretty good and you're


---------45:15----------
afraid that you're going to curse him


---------45:17----------
with all of your negativity and stuff


---------45:19----------
like that don't worry about it man if


---------45:21----------
it's in his garma to get cursed he's


---------45:24----------
gonna get cursed and it's not something


---------45:28----------
that you can control you can just


---------45:29----------
control the most that you can do so take


---------45:31----------
solace in the fact that you actually


---------45:33----------
don't need to try and that your sense of


---------45:36----------
completeness is gonna come mm-hmm it's


---------45:40----------
gonna come the same way that Miele came


---------45:41----------
the same way that your son came into


---------45:44----------
your life the same way that like


---------45:46----------
important things are happening into your


---------45:48----------
life the same way that you were here


---------45:50----------
Morpheus looking for neo and then lo and


---------45:53----------
behold I knew you were gonna come I I


---------45:55----------
knew it I predicted it I knew it was


---------45:57----------
gonna happen yeah so maybe you are


---------45:59----------
Morpheus right but so that's the thing


---------46:01----------
so so take solace in that right that


---------46:03----------
that that life is gonna give you what


---------46:05----------
you need and you actually don't need to


---------46:07----------
try because the most amazing things that


---------46:11----------
you've done in life have been without


---------46:13----------
trying so it's not a winning strategy


---------46:15----------
buddy no it's a terrible strategy yeah


---------46:19----------
so now we can it's difficult to learn


---------46:22----------
that strategy generally and I'm excited


---------46:25----------
to get to the next part cuz I think that


---------46:27----------
that's in nowhere yeah I completely


---------46:28----------
agree so so good so let's talk about


---------46:31----------
what's the next part other people


---------46:37----------
absolutely good let's talk about other


---------46:40----------
people I've got two camps okay you're


---------46:43----------
one of my people or you're not hmm


---------46:46----------
you're one of my people I could be


---------46:47----------
myself if you're not I can not and I've


---------46:50----------
noticed that I have a you know there's a


---------46:52----------
score system you start out I don't even


---------46:54----------
know where you start out but I've


---------46:56----------
noticed that I have no mechanism to kind


---------46:58----------
of increase my sense of trust only to


---------47:01----------
decrease and that once it's decreased


---------47:02----------
it'll never go back up it's like totally


---------47:05----------
messed up okay how long died at that


---------47:09----------
time I think as long as I can remember


---------47:12----------
to be honest what's your gently a little


---------47:19----------
bit about your upbringing yeah so yeah I


---------47:26----------
have one little brother he was he was


---------47:29----------
he's two and a half years younger than


---------47:30----------
me something like that I was I think


---------47:34----------
pretty much showered with attention like


---------47:36----------
I think my parents my parents parenting


---------47:38----------
style was basically like love you know


---------47:41----------
love my kid just purely expressed love


---------47:43----------
like get stuff for them and then I think


---------47:47----------
my dad had this strategy of if there's


---------47:49----------
something that I don't like criticize it


---------47:51----------
until they stop doing it so you know


---------47:55----------
I've kind of wondered you know we talk a


---------47:57----------
lot of it when you get into psychology


---------47:59----------
you kind of think about the story that


---------48:01----------
kids tell themselves and I kind of have


---------48:03----------
this feeling that before my brother was


---------48:05----------
born or whatever or even you know before


---------48:07----------
my Deb got concerned that I was a brat


---------48:09----------
uh the game that I was playing was


---------48:12----------
basically just show up and be me and


---------48:14----------
everything's gonna be totally chill


---------48:15----------
right people are gonna get stuff for me


---------48:17----------
everybody's excited about me everybody


---------48:18----------
wants to listen to what I have to say


---------48:20----------
and then one day my dad starts saying


---------48:23----------
you know as I'm just doing my normal


---------48:24----------
stuff that always is a winning strategy


---------48:26----------
he's like hey you know you're being a


---------48:28----------
brat like nobody likes a brat and like


---------48:29----------
kind of making fun of me then if I cried


---------48:31----------
about it it's like you know you're being


---------48:32----------
a


---------48:33----------
my baby or whatever it's like well


---------48:34----------
that's [ __ ] you know what happened in


---------48:36----------
the old game where I just you know you


---------48:38----------
never did this I'm bringing all the


---------48:42----------
subjects because I feel like this is


---------48:44----------
kind of how I've thought about how to


---------48:47----------
explain how I work because it is


---------48:49----------
difficult to explain


---------48:50----------
sure so so yeah I'm sorry why you're 11


---------48:56----------
I'm laughing because so the more that I


---------48:59----------
get conclusions from other people the


---------49:01----------
harder my job is mmm


---------49:03----------
you want you don't want conclusions you


---------49:05----------
want right so your conclusions that are


---------49:10----------
generally so when I get conclusions from


---------49:11----------
people so it's it's clear that you've


---------49:13----------
thought a lot about this and I've


---------49:14----------
noticed this in the couple of


---------49:15----------
conversations we've had Bobby that


---------49:17----------
sometimes it's hard because I have to


---------49:19----------
like unravel your conclusions to try to


---------49:21----------
get the raw data so that I can grab the


---------49:24----------
raw data yeah I think you're gonna give


---------49:27----------
me whatever you gonna give me and it's


---------49:28----------
fine I'm just laughing because it just


---------49:29----------
means I have to you know it's just that


---------49:31----------
my process is gonna be different


---------49:32----------
and I think for overall it's generally


---------49:35----------
good that people are thoughtful and


---------49:36----------
reflective because the the upside of


---------49:38----------
what you do is that we cover a lot more


---------49:40----------
ground because right you know I don't


---------49:42----------
have to stop and and digest everything


---------49:44----------
but let me ask you this did you ever get


---------49:46----------
back to how did you ever kind of get


---------49:49----------
back to where you were with your dad no


---------49:53----------
not yet


---------49:54----------
not not quite recently I think something


---------49:57----------
happened where my dad was worried that I


---------49:59----------
want it because I moved away and I


---------50:01----------
changed my last name you know there's a


---------50:03----------
couple things I think he interpreted as


---------50:05----------
me like distancing myself but we had a


---------50:08----------
conversation and came to a head and I


---------50:09----------
pretty much told him like hey man like I


---------50:12----------
love you and I'm your son and like I


---------50:14----------
want to you know I want to I want that


---------50:16----------
to be the case and there's nothing else


---------50:17----------
going on I think since then we've kind


---------50:19----------
of connected a lot more like I noticed


---------50:21----------
something changed but my dad was very


---------50:24----------
much like more the dictator and the


---------50:27----------
authority you know he's very high-stress


---------50:29----------
he's a very anxious person I think he's


---------50:32----------
like a workaholic to kind of cope and my


---------50:35----------
mom kind of keeps the peace and my mom


---------50:38----------
was kind of the one who like listened


---------50:39----------
and stuff I never got along with my


---------50:41----------
little brother we like fought a lot he


---------50:43----------
kind of picked on me and my mom told me


---------50:45----------
to like


---------50:46----------
because I'm older this is maybe when I


---------50:47----------
was six or seven it's like my


---------50:50----------
responsibility to just like kind of take


---------50:52----------
it and that I think was very formative


---------50:56----------
like I remember that I have very few


---------50:58----------
memories from my childhood but I


---------50:59----------
remember that very clearly how do you


---------51:01----------
think that affected you well I think


---------51:06----------
that it makes me more patient you know


---------51:08----------
I've noticed that I'm a very patient


---------51:09----------
person like I can listen to other people


---------51:12----------
when they're feeling hurt for a very


---------51:13----------
long time so I can sit with feeling hurt


---------51:16----------
I guess for a long time but on the other


---------51:18----------
hand I don't really know how to take


---------51:23----------
negative or critical words from other


---------51:27----------
people I don't know how to deal with it


---------51:30----------
okay so I from kind of letting it in and


---------51:32----------
believing it


---------51:38----------
that's a conclusion but I guess I've


---------51:40----------
just noticed that when my brother did


---------51:42----------
that it's like for me to not react like


---------51:44----------
I had to find a way to not react and so


---------51:46----------
that's created a bunch of behaviors and


---------51:48----------
coping strategies and stuff like what I


---------51:52----------
definitely think that kind of just


---------51:57----------
wondering if they're right is a pretty


---------51:59----------
effective strategy to not react to


---------52:01----------
something like so my brother would be


---------52:04----------
like oh you know you've got a piece of


---------52:06----------
pizza face or whatever when I had acne


---------52:07----------
and it's like I could be upset but if I


---------52:10----------
stop and think about well maybe I do you


---------52:13----------
know and then I feel like some shame or


---------52:14----------
whatever then I don't really react


---------52:17----------
what's wrong with reacting that was what


---------52:21----------
my mom is asking me to do in other words


---------52:22----------
I interpreted it as like don't react to


---------52:25----------
the you know if he's making fun of you


---------52:28----------
like you you're the older brother so be


---------52:31----------
patient and be patient in my mind was


---------52:33----------
don't react okay


---------52:39----------
isn't that what that means sure what


---------52:43----------
would she ask me to do it yeah yeah um I


---------52:47----------
think um I just I have a lot to say


---------52:50----------
actually but I'm just thinking about so


---------52:53----------
let me ask you this so I'm almost


---------52:55----------
getting the impression that you know in


---------52:57----------
your dad your relationship with your dad


---------52:59----------
was sort of you started out in a


---------53:01----------
particular place and then you kind of


---------53:03----------
got bumped down a notch because you were


---------53:05----------
being obnoxious and then you got bumped


---------53:07----------
down another notch because you were


---------53:08----------
being a crybaby


---------53:09----------
and that in a sense it's been really


---------53:12----------
hard to claw your way back up


---------53:16----------
yeah for what it's worth I don't have


---------53:20----------
any real memory of being in that


---------53:22----------
original place but I'm sure that I was


---------53:24----------
you know from my cameos and stuff you


---------53:26----------
just you just remember the back slide


---------53:28----------
yeah I do remember this in gradually


---------53:30----------
yeah so I remember like at a certain


---------53:33----------
point I kind of understood my dad as


---------53:36----------
more of a force of nature and less of a


---------53:38----------
person with feelings and motivations and


---------53:41----------
kind of like control that's helped me


---------53:45----------
mm-hmm and when you think about other


---------53:48----------
people and when they lose ground in your


---------53:50----------
eyes how do you think about them do you


---------53:51----------
think about them as people or do you


---------53:53----------
think about them as forces of nature mmm


---------53:59----------
forces of nature for sure absolutely for


---------54:03----------
sure no question one of the things that


---------54:05----------
really struck a chord was when you asked


---------54:07----------
the question of like okay so if someone


---------54:08----------
does something to hurt I'm also very


---------54:10----------
very sensitive like I feel hurt all that


---------54:12----------
you know very easily like is it better


---------54:14----------
if they have a good reason or a bad


---------54:15----------
reason like a bad reason is kind of like


---------54:18----------
unacceptable in my mind and I just kind


---------54:19----------
of don't even consider that that's


---------54:20----------
possible so there has to be a good


---------54:22----------
reason and the best good reason I can


---------54:24----------
think of for like lots of people


---------54:25----------
ignoring me and stuff is that you know


---------54:27----------
they're kind of motivated by other


---------54:28----------
things and like I'm not really part of


---------54:30----------
the equation


---------54:30----------
it helps numb the pain for me to think


---------54:34----------
that someone did something and it hurt


---------54:35----------
me and but like they weren't really


---------54:38----------
thinking about it


---------54:40----------
Bobby you experienced a lot of hurt man


---------54:43----------
yeah yeah I think I had the empathic


---------54:45----------
sponge thing dude well my wife will tell


---------54:49----------
me stories about like you know her


---------54:51----------
coworkers or whatever and like you know


---------54:52----------
they did this thing and like it wasn't


---------54:54----------
quite right and she's upset about it I


---------54:56----------
feel like I feel her hurt and judgement


---------54:58----------
but I feel the other person's like


---------54:59----------
struggle to be good enough and to be


---------55:01----------
seen well in other people's eyes and


---------55:04----------
then it's like I feel I feel so much


---------55:07----------
when she tells me that I feel like I


---------55:08----------
feel the whole world of hurt so you you


---------55:12----------
caught yourself you almost said I feel


---------55:13----------
hurt all the time but you didn't quite


---------55:17----------
say that do you feel hurt all the time


---------55:21----------
almost all the time yeah what's yeah I


---------55:25----------
do it feels like the incompleteness that


---------55:34----------
I have to be honest it feels like you


---------55:38----------
gotta get that no I don't think it's for


---------55:41----------
me I don't have an appointment it feels


---------55:44----------
like I deserve it


---------55:46----------
it feels kind of sad but it feels


---------55:49----------
motivating at the same time hold on a


---------55:51----------
second sorry yeah dr. K with the phone


---------55:55----------
dude sounds like a dog barking


---------56:17----------
weird hold on a second


---------56:23----------
yep for sure still 11:04 my time I hope


---------56:28----------
I do homies hadn't convinced when you


---------56:36----------
said I'm here to see you sounded


---------56:39----------
convincing to me too


---------56:40----------
I may have to step outside for a second


---------56:43----------
and just figure something out but yeah


---------56:46----------
so so Bobby I mean I I so did it's that


---------56:49----------
feeling of in it's that feeling of not


---------56:51----------
being good enough uh no I feel like no


---------57:00----------
it's different it feels like someone


---------57:05----------
else feels like someone else or lots of


---------57:07----------
other people feel hurt and it's my job


---------57:08----------
to do something about it like I feel


---------57:10----------
like I had to protect them from from


---------57:12----------
kind of what I experienced the hurt that


---------57:14----------
I experienced that's what it feels like


---------57:17----------
when we talk about me feeling it hurt


---------57:18----------
all the time that's what it feels like


---------57:20----------
it really does if it feels like what I


---------57:25----------
feel like I'm hurt because I identify


---------57:30----------
with other people and how hurt they are


---------57:32----------
and that I need to do something about it


---------57:35----------
okay let me just think for a second let


---------57:37----------
me figure out who's in my office - okay


---------57:38----------
so I'm gonna just


---------57:43----------
I'm gonna have to stop at about 10 or 15


---------57:45----------
minutes is that okay mm-hmm we can pick


---------57:47----------
this up um but I just want to go back to


---------57:50----------
so when you feel hurt you feel like you


---------57:57----------
have to protect other people from that


---------57:59----------
hurt yeah yeah I feel a Papa Bear


---------58:01----------
instinct so if my wife is telling me


---------58:03----------
about a co-worker and how that person's


---------58:06----------
like not doing their job or whatever I


---------58:08----------
remember when I couldn't do my job and


---------58:10----------
like no one taught me how to do my job


---------58:12----------
and that's [ __ ] right and I know other


---------58:15----------
people looked at me in this way you know


---------58:17----------
where it's like oh you suck but it's


---------58:19----------
like no one taught me that's not fair


---------58:20----------
and I feel like it's time for me to step


---------58:23----------
in and make it clear that like you can't


---------58:26----------
just treat people like that it's okay


---------58:27----------
for people to not know what they're


---------58:29----------
supposed to do but then it is so but


---------58:34----------
there's so many different layers of that


---------58:36----------
happening all the time so what what UPS


---------58:42----------
what kind of conflict do you have with


---------58:44----------
other people can you give me a little


---------58:49----------
more to go yeah so like no one tiling a


---------58:51----------
little bit go ahead go ahead so you were


---------58:53----------
kind of talking about how like you know


---------58:55----------
sometimes people say things to you and


---------58:57----------
you feel like like you you know you do


---------59:00----------
your due diligence and they'll question


---------59:02----------
you and then you'll feel like they don't


---------59:04----------
respect that you're doing your due


---------59:06----------
diligence right right right right um


---------59:10----------
yeah I think that the conflict so here's


---------59:12----------
the conflict that I think that I have I


---------59:13----------
show up to work every day and I'd show


---------59:15----------
up in most places every day feeling like


---------59:17----------
I've got a job to do and it's like a big


---------59:19----------
job


---------59:21----------
I also am aware that this is more of a


---------59:27----------
conclusion so I won't even add that part


---------59:28----------
and so I'm coming to work and I'm having


---------59:30----------
a conversation and it's like I


---------59:32----------
understand that the stakes for example


---------59:33----------
like community is very sensitive so I've


---------59:36----------
really deeply studied community in it


---------59:38----------
that you need to find a way for people


---------59:40----------
like lots of different kinds of people


---------59:42----------
to find their way in and like be


---------59:45----------
accepted really be accepted without


---------59:47----------
compromising the integrity of the thing


---------59:49----------
that people are coming together around


---------59:50----------
it's very delicate and it's very


---------59:52----------
sensitive and if you get it slightly


---------59:54----------
wrong you can compromise the integrity


---------59:56----------
of the community which is devastating to


---------59:58----------
everybody or you can ostracize someone


---------60:01----------
who's trying to come in and that's also


---------60:02----------
that's devastating to me personally so


---------60:04----------
the stakes are very high and I'm trying


---------60:06----------
to communicate this and I'm trying to do


---------60:08----------
this kind of like very advanced in my


---------60:10----------
mind very technical very delicate dance


---------60:14----------
and like other people aren't on that


---------60:16----------
level you're not thinking about it the


---------60:18----------
same way and I can't get them to think


---------60:20----------
about it the same way and I know that


---------60:23----------
the you know the decision or whatever


---------60:25----------
you know other perspective is out there


---------60:27----------
could hurt a lot of people does that


---------60:30----------
make sense yeah so so that sounds


---------60:34----------
incredibly frustrating yeah what upsets


---------60:38----------
you about the way they treat you I just


---------60:47----------
felt it the thing that gets me very very


---------60:50----------
angry is like what I perceive is


---------60:52----------
unearned confidence uh oh my god like I


---------60:56----------
get so angry if someone's saying like no


---------60:59----------
no no it's just this way like it's


---------61:00----------
simple and they don't even they they


---------61:02----------
don't have the full picture so like kind


---------61:06----------
of a disrespect of the


---------61:08----------
when you when you brought up arrogance


---------61:10----------
it's like okay in my mind all human


---------61:13----------
beings were like naturally arrogant


---------61:14----------
whenever anybody says something they


---------61:16----------
want to believe that what they just said


---------61:17----------
is correct


---------61:18----------
right mmm so provided that that's gonna


---------61:20----------
be true and I don't want to say anything


---------61:22----------
wrong I have a deep sense of not saying


---------61:25----------
anything wrong


---------61:26----------
I need to be aware of my own arrogance


---------61:28----------
and so I need to check everything that I


---------61:29----------
think is right because it's probable it


---------61:31----------
might be wrong but because I think it's


---------61:32----------
right that's like zero data it's like


---------61:34----------
you know and so I'm trying to hold that


---------61:38----------
for me and for other people like I find


---------61:40----------
that I do that in the melee community I


---------61:41----------
try to hold our arrogance in check and


---------61:44----------
they let me do it in the melee community


---------61:45----------
in a lot of other places I don't know


---------61:47----------
one lets me do that


---------61:48----------
and so I get very angry because it's


---------61:50----------
like no no no you're just literally


---------61:51----------
being biased like any executive at any


---------61:58----------
company you know Nintendo or could tell


---------62:00----------
me oh I know this that and the other but


---------62:02----------
it's like customer dawg


---------62:03----------
I'm your customer and you don't know


---------62:05----------
your customer I know you don't know your


---------62:06----------
customer because of everything you're


---------62:07----------
saying it shows me that you don't know


---------62:09----------
what you're talking about


---------62:09----------
so just like why do I even need to talk


---------62:11----------
to you that's what that's kind of the


---------62:14----------
anger that I feel and and so what do you


---------62:17----------
think it is that people so we were


---------62:20----------
talking earlier about how you know you


---------62:23----------
not being good enough is reinforced by


---------62:28----------
the way that other people treat you


---------62:29----------
mm-hmm but this seems different right so


---------62:37----------
I think what they're responding to is


---------62:39----------
not the authentic you yeah what are they


---------62:43----------
responding to


---------62:47----------
so what you just said I don't know if I


---------62:50----------
I hear it and it makes sense but I'm not


---------62:53----------
sure that I believe it what don't you


---------62:56----------
have what your response what they're


---------62:57----------
responding to is not the authentic you I


---------62:59----------
think maybe I think it's the authentic


---------63:01----------
me the me that's trying I think is the


---------63:04----------
authentic me no it's not exactly so that


---------63:07----------
that's not that connection has not been


---------63:09----------
made up here like when you said it I was


---------63:11----------
thinking to myself like men are so very


---------63:13----------
good so the the authentic you doesn't


---------63:15----------
try if you're trying you're not the


---------63:20----------
authentic you oh right so the authentic


---------63:27----------
you is being it's not trying


---------63:32----------
I think also what's going on is


---------63:37----------
something that they're triggering


---------63:38----------
something but what comes out is actually


---------63:40----------
not the authentic you what comes out is


---------63:43----------
some sense of now this is important so I


---------63:46----------
think there's also inadequacy like this


---------63:48----------
sounds like inadequacy like there you're


---------63:51----------
like you guys are not giving me the


---------63:53----------
respect that I deserve


---------63:54----------
absolutely yeah it's all at you go I can


---------63:57----------
tell


---------63:58----------
I don't shrug any sauce so but that's


---------63:59----------
not the authentic you so then the


---------64:03----------
question becomes so then I think like


---------64:05----------
your whole like like it's not your


---------64:07----------
premises wrong you're doing this weird


---------64:09----------
thing where you have a sense that you're


---------64:11----------
not good enough and that's your


---------64:12----------
incomplete karma and that actually


---------64:13----------
doesn't cause you any suffering or lack


---------64:15----------
of peace or anything like that that you


---------64:17----------
actually have been complete and good


---------64:19----------
enough several times in your life oh


---------64:21----------
okay I guess I just have a flash of


---------64:24----------
something I'm sorry to cut off go okay


---------64:28----------
so I feel like what I'm trying to do my


---------64:31----------
Karma or at my Dharma is like I'm trying


---------64:33----------
to cast a OE belonging let's call it


---------64:35----------
that right you're doing AoE healing I'm


---------64:37----------
trying to catch Larkin and I kind of do


---------64:38----------
it in the melee community and I'm trying


---------64:40----------
to build the tools that I would need and


---------64:42----------
that my community would need to like


---------64:43----------
grow way faster that's my idea that's


---------64:45----------
what I want to do I want to do it for us


---------64:47----------
but I also want to do it for other


---------64:48----------
people like me and other people like us


---------64:50----------
which includes you I'm trying to control


---------64:53----------
that outcome yeah you're very welcome


---------64:55----------
I'm trying to control that outcome and I


---------64:57----------
feel so close dr. K to being able to do


---------65:01----------
it I feel like I'm so close if only


---------65:04----------
right if only I had the respect people


---------65:08----------
would listen or only if only all like


---------65:10----------
these these things then it would be done


---------65:12----------
and not only would I be complete but


---------65:15----------
like it would bring you know something


---------65:17----------
really important to the people of the


---------65:19----------
world which is what I have to do and I


---------65:20----------
feel like people are in my way that's


---------65:25----------
what makes me crazy what do you think


---------65:26----------
about that


---------65:30----------
I think at once it could be true but it


---------65:32----------
could be true that I'm right about some


---------65:34----------
things that are really important I also


---------65:38----------
think that


---------65:42----------
you know I think about other people


---------65:45----------
unlike I'll get upset about it but also


---------65:47----------
so poppy I'm gonna cut you off okay sir


---------65:50----------
yes do it do it here's here's here's the


---------65:52----------
problem so I think that you have this


---------65:55----------
burden on your shoulders and first of


---------65:58----------
all you're trying to do it right so


---------66:00----------
that's mistake number yes and the harder


---------66:03----------
you try look more you try you're like I


---------66:05----------
want this like it's like it's almost


---------66:07----------
like I'm gonna use this weird analogy


---------66:08----------
it's like you're trying to get someone


---------66:10----------
to love you yeah like I want you to love


---------66:12----------
me I want you to love me I want you to


---------66:14----------
love me and then in comes someone in the


---------66:15----------
middle and gets in the way of you making


---------66:18----------
someone love you and then you get mad at


---------66:21----------
that person because why are you in the


---------66:22----------
way of this great work that I'm trying


---------66:24----------
to do I'm trying to save humanity with


---------66:27----------
AoE belonging and you are like getting


---------66:30----------
in my way


---------66:31----------
and then I think what they're responding


---------66:33----------
to is not your authenticity but like


---------66:35----------
this whole complex like this is not you


---------66:38----------
like the way that you created belonging


---------66:41----------
is not through trying it's through being


---------66:44----------
it's a subtle difference subtle subtle


---------66:47----------
subtle subtle subtle and I think what


---------66:50----------
they're responding to is is your


---------66:52----------
frustration that they are not getting


---------66:54----------
into line and I don't think you can


---------66:56----------
blame them for that because that's


---------66:57----------
[ __ ] you know you're like you're


---------66:59----------
telling them that like you it's like


---------67:00----------
you're playing whack-a-mole and they're


---------67:02----------
there like the one nail that is like a


---------67:04----------
little bit above popping out of the


---------67:05----------
bench and you're trying to hammer them


---------67:07----------
into place and they don't like it when


---------67:09----------
you hammer them mm-hmm


---------67:10----------
and and that too is like there's some


---------67:13----------
part of you I think that sort of longs


---------67:14----------
for this kind of sense of you know the


---------67:19----------
greater good and that everyone needs to


---------67:21----------
get in line and it's like a little bit


---------67:23----------
like you know like I mean there's a lot


---------67:27----------
of you know the road to creating the


---------67:29----------
greater good is like tramples on all


---------67:32----------
kinds of people right and and I think


---------67:35----------
that what you what you really need to do


---------67:37----------
is like first of all take a step back


---------67:38----------
from trying to create this thing so hard


---------67:41----------
like that so if you can start solve the


---------67:43----------
trying I think a lot of this stuff is


---------67:44----------
gonna get better but then secondly like


---------67:46----------
it's not that you're inadequate it's


---------67:48----------
just that they're responding to you


---------67:50----------
being an [ __ ] which is that believe


---------67:54----------
is probably true


---------67:55----------
which which I think sometimes you can


---------67:57----------
become and and the reason that you


---------67:59----------
become an [ __ ] is because you're


---------68:00----------
trying so hard and someone is getting in


---------68:02----------
your way I'm also trying really hard to


---------68:05----------
not be an [ __ ] but it turns out that


---------68:06----------
trying to not be an [ __ ] and trying


---------68:08----------
it doesn't add up and to do that


---------68:11----------
stuffing an [ __ ] I mean so I think


---------68:13----------
this is where like you know taking a


---------68:16----------
page out of your mom's playbook I think


---------68:18----------
what you need is patience right so the


---------68:20----------
first thing is that you can't make this


---------68:21----------
thing happen because it's like false


---------68:23----------
like if this one person gets in line


---------68:25----------
like what you're gonna get what you're


---------68:27----------
trying to create is like not gonna


---------68:28----------
actually happen


---------68:29----------
secondly the things that you need to


---------68:31----------
accomplish what you need what you want


---------68:34----------
to in life to do your daughter mom


---------68:35----------
they're actually gonna pop up and help


---------68:37----------
you out like you're playing an RPG where


---------68:39----------
like you walk into a town and there's a


---------68:41----------
guy there who's ready to join your party


---------68:43----------
you don't have to make him he's there


---------68:45----------
and like you're that person and like so


---------68:48----------
whether you're Morpheus and I'm neo or


---------68:49----------
the other way around like you predicted


---------68:51----------
my rise within the world of twitch and


---------68:54----------
Here I am to help you out and so you've


---------68:56----------
got to take a step back and do what you


---------68:59----------
need to do and if there are forces that


---------69:01----------
are getting in your way you know don't


---------69:04----------
take it personally because it's not


---------69:06----------
personal they just don't understand they


---------69:08----------
may not be as deep of thinkers as you


---------69:10----------
are but like you can't blame them for


---------69:12----------
being what they are you can't be mad at


---------69:14----------
a cucumber for not being a flower right


---------69:18----------
and and somewhere along the way like


---------69:20----------
your relentless pursuit of this great


---------69:22----------
thing I think is letting you engage in


---------69:25----------
all kinds of bad mental stuff in your


---------69:27----------
head I agree yeah I agree with you and


---------69:30----------
and so can I ask ya a question sure my


---------69:37----------
question is back to who am i but who am


---------69:39----------
i if I'm not trying like I haven't been


---------69:41----------
anyone who's I've been trying for a long


---------69:44----------
time yeah but you haven't right so like


---------69:47----------
when you it's purpose without purpose


---------69:49----------
that's not trying it's the thing with


---------69:52----------
nothing underneath you've been it Bobby


---------69:54----------
yeah you've been it so like like I have


---------69:57----------
a meditation practice for you and then


---------69:59----------
unfortunately I'm gonna have to stop


---------70:00----------
yeah yeah yeah because I I did actually


---------70:03----------
make an appointment so not the guy's


---------70:04----------
fault


---------70:05----------
I just I just texted him incorrectly but


---------70:10----------
um so I want you to like just like what


---------70:14----------
do you like to do with your kid again


---------70:20----------
I'm trying to figure it out I like


---------70:21----------
playing outside I'll hang outside do you


---------70:24----------
ever watch your kids sleep yeah


---------70:27----------
that's pretty dope so like so I want you


---------70:30----------
to just watch your kids sleep right and


---------70:32----------
then like like I can't leave my sleeping


---------70:36----------
children alone so I have to like attack


---------70:38----------
them and kiss them and and rub their


---------70:40----------
feet and things like that and and just


---------70:44----------
bother them to no end


---------70:45----------
but so I I want you to think about like


---------70:48----------
you know when when you're doing when


---------70:49----------
you're in that moment and they're being


---------70:51----------
who they are and you're being who you


---------70:53----------
are where's the trying right so like sit


---------70:58----------
and just do that and look for the trying


---------71:00----------
and then the next time you're in


---------71:03----------
conflict with someone look for the


---------71:05----------
trying


---------71:05----------
okay right like like just just just take


---------71:09----------
a snapshot of watching your child sleep


---------71:11----------
and take a snapshot of an interaction


---------71:13----------
with another person where they're not


---------71:15----------
being the thing that you want them to be


---------71:17----------
or whatever and just see how different


---------71:20----------
those two moments are and then you tell


---------71:23----------
me so we're gonna have to do follow-up


---------71:25----------
so I apologize for having to cut things


---------71:27----------
a little bit short but you tell me then


---------71:29----------
which one is the real you all right for


---------71:33----------
sure I'll do that I'm gonna look at the


---------71:38----------
trying yeah look for the trying right


---------71:41----------
and look for the absence of trying look


---------71:43----------
for the triangle look for the being yeah


---------71:45----------
and I think the more that you can


---------71:47----------
gravitate towards your authentic self I


---------71:49----------
think like you've done it a couple of


---------71:50----------
times already and you're gonna continue


---------71:52----------
to do it


---------71:53----------
and then we can get into like what's the


---------71:55----------
deal with this grand you know this grand


---------71:58----------
work that you have to do like I don't


---------72:00----------
doubt that it's grand work but when you


---------72:01----------
start thinking of it as grand work is


---------72:03----------
like when it gets them to a problem like


---------72:05----------
I run into all kinds of problems when


---------72:07----------
you know I take seriously that people


---------72:09----------
think I'm here to like save them and


---------72:10----------
stuff like that there's a real cult


---------72:12----------
mentality that if we're not careful is


---------72:13----------
gonna grow in healthy gamer yeah for


---------72:16----------
sure


---------72:16----------
and and so it's it's just I mean it's


---------72:19----------
just about individual conversations


---------72:21----------
right it's not about I mean AoE healing


---------72:23----------
is cool and all but it's not about what


---------72:25----------
the viewercount is it's not about other


---------72:26----------
people it's a conversation between me


---------72:28----------
and you yeah and and that's the Dharma


---------72:31----------
that we do in as long as we stick with


---------72:32----------
that term oh we're doing great and I


---------72:36----------
think you've got to learn how to just be


---------72:38----------
yourself a little bit more yeah the


---------72:44----------
other things like it might be right the


---------72:46----------
last thing is like I don't know where


---------72:47----------
this like deep well of hurt that seems


---------72:50----------
to never end comes from I don't think it


---------72:52----------
comes from the outside I think it comes


---------72:53----------
from within and we gotta understand you


---------72:56----------
know where did you learn to hurt so


---------72:58----------
easily and like what's the what's the


---------73:00----------
deal with that that's bad because I


---------73:06----------
think most anger has its origins and


---------73:08----------
hurt and you seem to me to be incredibly


---------73:10----------
angry yeah for sure and and so that


---------73:14----------
means that you got hurt somewhere right


---------73:16----------
like and like even when you respond to


---------73:18----------
those people in those moments like why


---------73:20----------
don't you guys take me seriously like


---------73:21----------
that's you that's like anger that's


---------73:23----------
coming from hurt like they're hurting


---------73:25----------
you with their words and then you


---------73:27----------
respond with anger so like I don't know


---------73:29----------
what that that's completely separate


---------73:31----------
from what we were talking about earlier


---------73:33----------
like yeah so that we can get into but


---------73:37----------
yeah anyway cool good work today is your


---------73:41----------
breakfast or I got a run okay cool so


---------73:44----------
sorry guys but I think in your case your


---------73:47----------
meditation practice is to catch look


---------73:49----------
trying and to watch your child sleep


---------73:51----------
will do okay and then if you've watched


---------73:54----------
something maybe you can lead everyone


---------73:55----------
else but


---------73:57----------
you're gonna live you are you go to my


---------73:59----------
stream I'm actually not live right now


---------74:01----------
because I'm on a Mac and it's like who


---------74:03----------
should who should I raid
