---------00:43----------
it's just kind of like it's an


---------00:45----------
odd name no yes


---------00:48----------
sorry it's a bit weird um basically


---------00:51----------
uh the second time i went


---------00:55----------
to university i was


---------00:59----------
as the title suggests very socially


---------01:02----------
anxious


---------01:04----------
um i i used to


---------01:07----------
i had a sink in my room


---------01:11----------
and i used to i used to pee in the in


---------01:13----------
the sink because


---------01:15----------
i i was avoiding my flatmates


---------01:20----------
um well i mean it started off okay like


---------01:23----------
freshers week was okay but then i didn't


---------01:25----------
i ended up staying in my room


---------01:26----------
on my computer for like a week and then


---------01:29----------
like i hadn't seen them in a week and i


---------01:30----------
was like


---------01:31----------
okay it's been a week like if i see them


---------01:34----------
now that


---------01:34----------
it's gonna be really weird so then it


---------01:36----------
like the weeks tend into months


---------01:37----------
anyway um so i didn't


---------01:41----------
i didn't go into the kitchen ever


---------01:44----------
and i didn't use the bathroom i used to


---------01:46----------
pee in my sink in my room


---------01:48----------
and i used to make food in my room as


---------01:50----------
well


---------01:51----------
occasionally i would make noodles in the


---------01:53----------
sink


---------01:54----------
and in the uk there's this brand called


---------01:56----------
super noodles


---------01:58----------
um anyway uh


---------02:02----------
but um i didn't yeah i


---------02:06----------
one time i one time i i


---------02:09----------
i defecated in the sink by accident um


---------02:14----------
yeah i didn't it wasn't on purpose


---------02:16----------
normally i would


---------02:18----------
um normally i would [ __ ] in like


---------02:21----------
um wait can i swear oh it's too late now


---------02:24----------
um


---------02:24----------
normally i'd [ __ ] in like plastic bags


---------02:28----------
okay um yeah


---------02:32----------
accident yeah


---------02:35----------
yeah um but anyway that's what happened


---------02:39----------
and then the guy i was that who's my


---------02:41----------
boyfriend at the time


---------02:43----------
he made a joke called me poop noodle


---------02:46----------
cause it was the same thing that i made


---------02:48----------
noodles in and rhyme with superman


---------02:52----------
yeah so i mean that's i think that's


---------02:54----------
funny i i also think it's interesting


---------02:56----------
that you


---------02:57----------
you know this is not the kind of thing


---------02:58----------
that people would normally advertise


---------03:02----------
no no not really


---------03:05----------
so help me understand that


---------03:09----------
i i don't


---------03:12----------
i don't know um i i very


---------03:16----------
openly i used to talk about this a lot


---------03:20----------
and like make like sort of


---------03:23----------
raunchy gaudy sort of jokes and stuff


---------03:26----------
and talk about that sort of


---------03:28----------
thing um i i think i felt like


---------03:33----------
sort of wearing it on my sleeve


---------03:37----------
helps is that does that make sense


---------03:40----------
interesting


---------03:40----------
right so let's let's just put a pin in


---------03:42----------
that concept


---------03:44----------
right because i can imagine that if


---------03:45----------
we're dealing with social anxiety


---------03:49----------
you know telling the story that you just


---------03:51----------
did i would i would imagine


---------03:53----------
makes your social anxiety worse


---------03:57----------
um yes


---------04:01----------
yeah yeah does it


---------04:05----------
i don't know i don't think so are they


---------04:07----------
interesting


---------04:08----------
actually no because i'm saying it to you


---------04:11----------
and i can see your face


---------04:12----------
yeah that's hard that's really hard but


---------04:16----------
saying it to like my stream when it's


---------04:18----------
just a bunch of text


---------04:20----------
completely different what makes it hard


---------04:22----------
when you can see my face


---------04:26----------
um


---------04:30----------
i didn't i don't know just like your


---------04:33----------
face


---------04:35----------
oh no that's my face


---------04:39----------
no i don't like it


---------04:43----------
um i just i feel like i


---------04:46----------
i pay a lot of attention to yeah


---------04:49----------
expressions


---------04:50----------
yes and do i


---------04:53----------
i know that i misinterpret expressions a


---------04:56----------
lot


---------04:57----------
as negative and i i don't like looking


---------05:01----------
at people's faces


---------05:03----------
well i don't like looking at your face


---------05:05----------
either


---------05:08----------
okay so we'll talk about that so paying


---------05:10----------
attention to people's expressions


---------05:12----------
right yeah and misinterpreting people's


---------05:14----------
expressions


---------05:15----------
i don't think that you're


---------05:16----------
misinterpreting them by the way


---------05:18----------
technically


---------05:19----------
okay i think what you're able to do is


---------05:22----------
detect


---------05:25----------
dissatisfaction in a face that primarily


---------05:31----------
is satisfied if that makes sense so


---------05:34----------
there's actually research on this


---------05:36----------
so let me let me explain it from the top


---------05:38----------
it's a really interesting study


---------05:40----------
so i'm smiling at you right


---------05:44----------
and then i get okay i'm mad at you


---------05:47----------
like there's a transition so smiling


---------05:50----------
matt


---------05:50----------
and there's like a transition right you


---------05:52----------
does that make sense like


---------05:54----------
this and then this is kind of halfway


---------05:56----------
and then like this


---------05:57----------
yeah yeah yeah so there's there's a


---------06:00----------
transition so if you think about it


---------06:02----------
halfway between smiling and being mad at


---------06:04----------
you my face is displaying 50


---------06:07----------
happiness 50 anger does that make sense


---------06:11----------
yes i think so so a normal person and i


---------06:14----------
don't mean to say you're abnormal i mean


---------06:16----------
someone who's not as sensitive as you


---------06:17----------
are like literally your brain has a


---------06:19----------
higher processing power


---------06:20----------
here okay so okay so most people they're


---------06:24----------
processing power when they when they see


---------06:26----------
like the half angry half happy face


---------06:28----------
they they're just confused they think i


---------06:30----------
don't know what this person is feeling


---------06:33----------
does that make sense because it's like


---------06:35----------
half smiling half angry it's like what


---------06:37----------
is that person feeling i don't know


---------06:39----------
and even if you think about it when i'm


---------06:41----------
80 smiling and 20


---------06:43----------
angry most people will think that i'm


---------06:46----------
happy


---------06:47----------
does that make sense yes but people who


---------06:50----------
have


---------06:51----------
social anxiety or some other


---------06:54----------
it's not even a psychiatric thing but


---------06:56----------
like there's some other diagnoses that


---------06:57----------
are associated


---------06:59----------
with the ability to detect negative


---------07:02----------
affect or negative emotion in someone's


---------07:05----------
face


---------07:05----------
even though it's hidden so you'll be


---------07:08----------
able to detect the 20


---------07:10----------
anger with the 80 smile


---------07:13----------
and your brain will tell you oh that


---------07:15----------
person is still 20 angry


---------07:18----------
does that make sense so it's not that


---------07:20----------
you that you're like


---------07:22----------
you're detecting false things you're


---------07:24----------
just detecting a small amount of


---------07:26----------
dissatisfaction


---------07:28----------
in spite of the large amount of approval


---------07:32----------
and your brain is clueing you in to that


---------07:34----------
signal but it's not like it's in your


---------07:36----------
head it's literally that your brain


---------07:38----------
is more sophisticated and can detect


---------07:42----------
low negative emotion at very low amounts


---------07:47----------
okay does that make sense


---------07:50----------
yes absolutely the other interesting


---------07:54----------
thing is that people who've experienced


---------07:56----------
trauma especially in childhood develop


---------07:58----------
this skill


---------08:00----------
so if you look at people who like have


---------08:02----------
abusive parents


---------08:04----------
you know if your parents are abusive and


---------08:06----------
they seem like they're in a good mood


---------08:08----------
it becomes a survival mechanism to be


---------08:11----------
able to detect


---------08:13----------
storm clouds oh is my dad really in a


---------08:16----------
good mood


---------08:17----------
or is he like uh happy on the surface


---------08:20----------
and like a volcano underneath and so


---------08:23----------
like their brains literally adapt


---------08:25----------
to detecting like negative emotion


---------08:29----------
underneath positive emotion okay


---------08:32----------
it's almost like they have x-ray vision


---------08:34----------
which is kind of what you want


---------08:36----------
so the thing that you have to be careful


---------08:38----------
about is that your


---------08:40----------
mind will detect 20 dissatisfaction


---------08:43----------
and that's what your mind will zoom in


---------08:45----------
on and it'll ignore the 80


---------08:48----------
so that's something you have to retrain


---------08:50----------
but your capacity to detect you're


---------08:52----------
literally more sensitive like you can


---------08:53----------
detect things


---------08:54----------
that normal human beings can't people


---------08:56----------
with anxiety and people with histories


---------08:58----------
of trauma


---------08:59----------
are like able to detect things because


---------09:01----------
their brain has like told them hey like


---------09:02----------
this


---------09:03----------
stimulus is actually important so let's


---------09:05----------
pay attention to that


---------09:06----------
what do you think about that it made it


---------09:09----------
sound


---------09:09----------
much much cooler than i thought it


---------09:13----------
what did you think about it i don't


---------09:17----------
um i don't know my


---------09:20----------
i mean my my parents were lovely yeah so


---------09:23----------
i i mean obviously there were some


---------09:25----------
things that happened in my childhood


---------09:27----------
um but i i couldn't pinpoint


---------09:31----------
like a single thing that sort of


---------09:35----------
you know i like i i remember i have


---------09:38----------
memories of like my mum wearing


---------09:40----------
sunglasses a lot and whenever she was


---------09:43----------
wearing these sunglasses i always


---------09:45----------
thought she was angry at me because i


---------09:46----------
couldn't see her face


---------09:48----------
so i always found it quite scary um


---------09:52----------
and so when she wore them i'd always ask


---------09:53----------
her to take them off because i couldn't


---------09:55----------
i couldn't see her face


---------09:56----------
but like i i have fond memories of of my


---------10:00----------
parents i don't


---------10:01----------
yeah i i didn't mean to imply that you


---------10:03----------
know your parents were abused i'm just


---------10:04----------
saying that's


---------10:05----------
what we see yes sometimes


---------10:08----------
there's two camps there's people with


---------10:10----------
social anxiety there's also people who


---------10:11----------
have a history of


---------10:12----------
abuse growing up they both their their


---------10:14----------
brain wires to be


---------10:15----------
sensitive to facial expressions what are


---------10:18----------
you getting from my face


---------10:30----------
um


---------10:32----------
you look a bit bored okay now


---------10:36----------
oh now you look like you're cringing no


---------10:40----------
i'm smiling i'm having a blast


---------10:44----------
okay


---------10:47----------
this is my board face i guess does this


---------10:49----------
look like a board face t


---------10:51----------
wait no it's because i'm i was looking


---------10:54----------
at


---------10:55----------
the other because there's a little bit


---------10:57----------
of a delay wait


---------10:58----------
do the face again wait are you you can't


---------11:00----------
see me on discord


---------11:02----------
um because you're like really really


---------11:04----------
pixelated so i'm looking at your stream


---------11:06----------
because you're not


---------11:07----------
you're not pixley here i'm pixelated


---------11:10----------
that's gotta be tough um


---------11:14----------
oh i can see you now okay fantastic


---------11:17----------
great


---------11:18----------
so just look at me don't watch stream


---------11:20----------
and certainly ignore twitch chat i do my


---------11:21----------
best too


---------11:22----------
okay yeah sorry for the random ass


---------11:25----------
tangent


---------11:27----------
okay


---------11:33----------
no i was i was just gonna say um yeah


---------11:35----------
sorry sorry about that


---------11:36----------
and then so i think there were a couple


---------11:39----------
things that i really


---------11:40----------
thought were really important about your


---------11:42----------
story uh which highlight


---------11:44----------
so like social anxiety so one is like


---------11:46----------
this idea that


---------11:47----------
they haven't seen you in a week so you


---------11:48----------
can't see them


---------11:50----------
yeah right and then two weeks go by and


---------11:53----------
then it's like no


---------11:53----------
now i can't show my face and every week


---------11:56----------
that goes by


---------11:59----------
you ca they can't see you and then every


---------12:00----------
week it gets worse and worse


---------12:02----------
and then you have to become a hermit you


---------12:04----------
have to just like move out of the


---------12:05----------
apartment


---------12:06----------
at three in the morning that's exactly


---------12:08----------
what i did i used to i had this little


---------12:10----------
pile of cushions that i would put


---------12:12----------
like right next to the door so i could


---------12:14----------
sit and listen


---------12:16----------
for long periods of time to work out


---------12:19----------
when


---------12:19----------
they weren't in the corridor and i that


---------12:22----------
sounds


---------12:23----------
absolutely crazy doesn't it yeah um


---------12:26----------
yeah yeah that's that's what happens


---------12:30----------
i mean like what you said about the it's


---------12:32----------
been the weeks and then it's been months


---------12:33----------
thing like i remember one time


---------12:35----------
um oh isn't it quite a long uh


---------12:38----------
uber journey and as i got in the car my


---------12:41----------
seat belt um got stuck in the door so it


---------12:45----------
was like poking out the door


---------12:47----------
so i sit in the car but i didn't want to


---------12:49----------
move over so i was i couldn't


---------12:50----------
i couldn't actually use the seat belt um


---------12:53----------
but it had been about 20 seconds by that


---------12:55----------
point and i felt like oh no if i if i


---------12:57----------
say something about it now to him and


---------12:59----------
i'm just a window


---------13:00----------
yeah like so so i ended up just sat


---------13:03----------
there for the next like 20 minutes


---------13:05----------
thinking that i was gonna


---------13:06----------
die because i wasn't wearing a seatbelt


---------13:07----------
because i felt too nervous to actually


---------13:09----------
say hey


---------13:10----------
can i yeah yeah and then it's like how


---------13:13----------
do you tell them oh like


---------13:15----------
five minutes into the journey like oh by


---------13:17----------
the way i don't have a seatbelt


---------13:18----------
ten minutes into the journey by the way


---------13:20----------
i don't have a seat belt on


---------13:23----------
and then they're like why would why


---------13:26----------
would you wait 10 minutes and then tell


---------13:28----------
me you know


---------13:29----------
it's crazy yeah


---------13:32----------
i remember one time i had been out of


---------13:34----------
school for a little while


---------13:36----------
and then like since i was out of school


---------13:38----------
like i couldn't go back like what would


---------13:40----------
people think


---------13:41----------
yes and then like i had missed classes


---------13:45----------
and then like how can you show up like


---------13:46----------
i've i've just been skipping


---------13:48----------
class because playing video games all


---------13:50----------
day and then it was like halfway through


---------13:51----------
the semester if i start going to class


---------13:54----------
now i can still pass


---------13:56----------
but can you just like i didn't know like


---------13:58----------
what to think like there are 30 people


---------13:59----------
in the class and then halfway through


---------14:00----------
the semester someone just walks in that


---------14:02----------
you've never seen before


---------14:04----------
yes yes and then they're like what are


---------14:06----------
you doing here and you're like i'm in


---------14:07----------
the class and they're like no you're not


---------14:09----------
where you've been this whole time i


---------14:11----------
couldn't do it


---------14:13----------
so yeah i mean yeah i dropped out of


---------14:16----------
university


---------14:17----------
a few years ago because of i just felt


---------14:19----------
largely because of that


---------14:21----------
yeah oh right so i showed up on the day


---------14:24----------
of my final


---------14:26----------
and then i i put my head down and i


---------14:30----------
i thought i was banking on people not


---------14:33----------
noticing because they would be taking


---------14:34----------
their final


---------14:35----------
yes and then took my final and then


---------14:38----------
walked out


---------14:40----------
do you know what grade i got in the


---------14:41----------
class can you guess


---------14:46----------
i don't how do you grade things


---------14:50----------
oh yes so a b c d


---------14:53----------
and f okay how do you grade things where


---------14:57----------
you are


---------14:58----------
that way but i don't know i just thought


---------15:01----------
it might be different


---------15:04----------
uh a c f wait no did you


---------15:07----------
oh okay


---------15:10----------
that's how you fail at class boys and


---------15:12----------
pulse


---------15:14----------
so you never go and then you show up on


---------15:15----------
the final and then you do your best


---------15:18----------
which is pretty awful


---------15:19----------
and then i went home and i played a lot


---------15:21----------
of diablo too to make my feelings go


---------15:23----------
away


---------15:24----------
that sounds fun thing it was actually a


---------15:26----------
lot of fun


---------15:27----------
it was a blast of semester i really


---------15:29----------
enjoyed it


---------15:34----------
alas okay i did actually


---------15:37----------
have a class that i failed as well


---------15:39----------
because of that but that was at


---------15:40----------
this university uh it was it was um


---------15:44----------
i was studying chinese and i


---------15:47----------
i went i went for like the first couple


---------15:49----------
months


---------15:51----------
and then it dropped off i have this


---------15:52----------
pattern with everything that i do it


---------15:54----------
just it slowly drops off


---------15:55----------
because i miss one thing and then i'm


---------15:57----------
like well i can't go to the next one


---------15:58----------
because yeah i wasn't at the last one


---------16:00----------
and what if they asked me


---------16:01----------
what happened at the last one i wasn't


---------16:02----------
there um so anyway yeah


---------16:04----------
the days turn into a week 10 months i go


---------16:06----------
to the final exam


---------16:08----------
um and i throw up


---------16:12----------
in the room and i get sent home


---------16:16----------
and i failed the exam yeah


---------16:20----------
wow yeah it's hard right like when when


---------16:23----------
the only


---------16:24----------
way that you can show up the next day is


---------16:26----------
to have been perfect the day the day


---------16:27----------
before


---------16:30----------
yes i hadn't thought of it like that


---------16:33----------
yeah that's what do you think about that


---------16:41----------
i don't know i like to be very like


---------16:43----------
prepared


---------16:45----------
because things have to go perfect yeah


---------16:49----------
yeah otherwise i don't go back


---------16:52----------
yep right so so like


---------16:55----------
like lou i think you're living life like


---------16:58----------
these speed runners


---------17:00----------
or like a single mistake and you have to


---------17:01----------
start over


---------17:03----------
yeah so you never make and like that's


---------17:06----------
great


---------17:07----------
when you're playing the same game with


---------17:09----------
the same levels


---------17:10----------
over and over and over and over and over


---------17:12----------
again


---------17:14----------
but it's hard in life where like every


---------17:16----------
day is a little bit different


---------17:19----------
it's like you're trying to speed run a


---------17:20----------
game but you only get to play it once


---------17:22----------
and tomorrow there's a new game


---------17:27----------
yeah it's weird i think i understand


---------17:30----------
that


---------17:32----------
yeah so chase and perfection


---------17:35----------
why do you have to be prepared


---------17:40----------
um should prepare you know


---------17:43----------
for the worst i i've been told i uh


---------17:46----------
catastrophize a lot what is that so like


---------17:52----------
like i don't know how to describe like


---------17:54----------
for example i used to go to these like


---------17:57----------
spin classes with my dad um


---------18:00----------
and suddenly out of nowhere


---------18:03----------
um i would this thought would pop into


---------18:07----------
my head that like i'm gonna


---------18:08----------
spin off the front of the bike and like


---------18:11----------
die


---------18:12----------
and like the bike will like explode or


---------18:14----------
something or something will explode in


---------18:16----------
the room above me


---------18:17----------
um and it happens like every time i go


---------18:20----------
outside


---------18:21----------
like i'm trying to cross the road this


---------18:23----------
car is going to run me over


---------18:24----------
i'm like i'm going to die yeah


---------18:29----------
it's it's weird to have a mind that


---------18:31----------
tells you that kind of stuff right


---------18:33----------
does that make sense i don't i don't


---------18:36----------
i don't know because it's because it is


---------18:39----------
my


---------18:40----------
mind does everyone not have these


---------18:43----------
thoughts sometimes or do you have those


---------18:46----------
thoughts


---------18:47----------
do you not have those thoughts sometimes


---------18:50----------
um i suppose when i'm drunk


---------18:54----------
ah i don't catastrophize okay


---------18:58----------
no okay interesting


---------19:02----------
um and how long have you been


---------19:04----------
catastrophizing


---------19:07----------
like forever okay so you've been doing


---------19:10----------
it your entire life


---------19:16----------
oh it feels that way but


---------19:19----------
maybe not i think so yeah important


---------19:22----------
revelation right


---------19:24----------
let's just think about that so so you


---------19:26----------
just said


---------19:27----------
yeah i have been doing it and then you


---------19:29----------
paused


---------19:30----------
and then you said it feels like it's


---------19:33----------
been my entire life


---------19:37----------
yeah so has it been your entire life


---------19:46----------
no so in the past few years


---------19:49----------
so let's think about that right so


---------19:51----------
something when i asked you the question


---------19:53----------
there's some kind of internal


---------19:55----------
calculation that says


---------19:57----------
yes this has been going on forever like


---------19:59----------
it gave you that answer


---------20:02----------
yeah like but


---------20:06----------
it turns out that that's not actually


---------20:07----------
the case


---------20:09----------
so then if we're being very careful what


---------20:11----------
we have to recognize is that sometimes


---------20:13----------
our mind


---------20:14----------
produces answers for us that are wrong


---------20:19----------
yeah that's yeah all the time


---------20:24----------
can you tell us about that oh oh


---------20:27----------
uh yeah


---------20:31----------
like uh oh like this this like just


---------20:34----------
like last week okay um last year there


---------20:38----------
was a


---------20:38----------
stream i was quite uh like


---------20:42----------
a big fan of had been subbed to him for


---------20:43----------
a few months okay


---------20:45----------
like maybe six months i resubscribe and


---------20:48----------
he's like um


---------20:50----------
pooper noodle yikes and


---------20:53----------
he's just like a bit of a joker like


---------20:55----------
that's just saying whatever he farms


---------20:57----------
they'll w's


---------20:58----------
but um instantly i was like oh


---------21:02----------
my god he hates me i unsubscribed


---------21:06----------
instantly i unfollowed him everywhere


---------21:09----------
i just i was mortified


---------21:13----------
um i avoided watching any videos about


---------21:16----------
this streamer because i couldn't stop


---------21:17----------
thinking about this time that he was


---------21:19----------
like


---------21:19----------
pooper and it all yikes um and


---------21:23----------
like a month ago he said something


---------21:25----------
really nice about me


---------21:26----------
and i realized that it was


---------21:29----------
just all in my head yeah looked


---------21:32----------
completely made up


---------21:35----------
yeah how do you understand that what's


---------21:38----------
up with that


---------21:42----------
i i don't know it made me think of


---------21:45----------
like lots of other incidents where i've


---------21:49----------
just in like instantly i'm like okay


---------21:52----------
this person wants nothing to do with me


---------21:54----------
i'm just gonna remove myself completely


---------21:57----------
okay from all of that so let's talk


---------22:00----------
about that for a second


---------22:01----------
is that cool yeah yeah


---------22:05----------
so this person wants


---------22:08----------
nothing to do with me


---------22:15----------
hold on can i think for a second yes


---------22:28----------
how much of your social anxiety can be


---------22:31----------
captured by that phrase


---------22:34----------
what phrase this person wants nothing to


---------22:37----------
do with me


---------22:39----------
um probably quite a lot of it


---------22:44----------
okay how long have you felt


---------22:48----------
how long has your mind been sometimes


---------22:51----------
randomly telling you that this person


---------22:53----------
wants nothing to do with me


---------22:55----------
um i i mean i've always been


---------22:59----------
like i've always been quite quiet like a


---------23:02----------
child growing up i my brother was very


---------23:06----------
social media outgoing um and he would


---------23:09----------
always


---------23:10----------
make the friends and then i would like


---------23:14----------
play with like little toy cars or


---------23:16----------
something um


---------23:18----------
one of us


---------23:22----------
oh yeah so that was that was


---------23:25----------
that was quite difficult as well because


---------23:27----------
sometimes we would do things


---------23:29----------
like as a family and there would be


---------23:32----------
like maybe another family with like kids


---------23:35----------
there


---------23:36----------
and then he would make their friends


---------23:37----------
first and then


---------23:40----------
he'd be like you know you know don't


---------23:42----------
talk to her she's just quiet and weird


---------23:44----------
and then they would like all go have fun


---------23:45----------
the night but like i


---------23:47----------
i did i liked my own company so it


---------23:49----------
wasn't it wasn't awful


---------23:51----------
um i just wasn't very outgoing and i


---------23:53----------
hadn't been difficult to


---------23:58----------
you know just talk to to kids and stuff


---------24:02----------
um and then i had some pretty bad


---------24:05----------
experiences in in high school with like


---------24:07----------
other girls so then


---------24:08----------
i didn't know how to talk to girls


---------24:10----------
anymore for i still don't i don't really


---------24:12----------
have any friends now that are girls many


---------24:14----------
at all


---------24:14----------
um yeah


---------24:18----------
okay so i asked you about


---------24:22----------
you know sort of like whether this


---------24:25----------
person wants nothing to do with me


---------24:27----------
has oh no oh you asked me something and


---------24:30----------
i went on complete tangent oh i'm so


---------24:31----------
sorry


---------24:32----------
no no don't be sorry i think that's


---------24:36----------
where we learn


---------24:38----------
that's wonderful okay i'm glad you went


---------24:40----------
on a tangent right because you gave us a


---------24:41----------
couple of really important pieces of


---------24:43----------
information


---------24:44----------
one is that while you may have been


---------24:46----------
socially isolated


---------24:49----------
the reasons for your social isolation


---------24:52----------
back then


---------24:52----------
were fundamentally different because i


---------24:54----------
didn't hear this person doesn't want to


---------24:56----------
hang out with me i heard


---------24:58----------
i was just kind of a quiet shy kid and i


---------25:00----------
was okay with my own company


---------25:01----------
so if anything that tells us that like


---------25:03----------
something happened that changed the way


---------25:06----------
that you


---------25:07----------
perceived your interpersonal


---------25:08----------
interactions which is great


---------25:11----------
like it's great that you gave me that


---------25:12----------
piece of information because then we


---------25:14----------
actually know that you haven't always


---------25:16----------
been like this


---------25:18----------
okay does that make sense


---------25:21----------
yes yes


---------25:26----------
okay yeah so so yeah okay


---------25:29----------
yeah go ahead i don't know i just


---------25:31----------
thought that like


---------25:32----------
since i'd been quiet my you know whole


---------25:35----------
life that i'd


---------25:36----------
always had social anxiety but are you


---------25:38----------
telling me that that's not quite the


---------25:40----------
case i could just been quiet and then


---------25:42----------
something happened along the way that


---------25:44----------
made me anxious


---------25:45----------
about social things


---------25:49----------
that's what i would hypothesize okay


---------25:52----------
right because what what i'm hearing this


---------25:54----------
person wants nothing to do with me


---------25:56----------
says nothing about the person


---------26:00----------
it says something about you


---------26:03----------
right yeah it has to do with the way


---------26:07----------
that you perceive


---------26:08----------
your value whereas


---------26:11----------
the girl who's content to play with toy


---------26:13----------
cars


---------26:15----------
has no problem with her value in fact as


---------26:17----------
you put it you used to think the


---------26:18----------
opposite


---------26:19----------
i'm a cool person to hang out with all


---------26:21----------
by myself


---------26:23----------
i'm very good company right if you think


---------26:26----------
about it that's actually the exact


---------26:27----------
opposite you're like hey this person's


---------26:29----------
awesome


---------26:29----------
i don't need any of those [ __ ]


---------26:33----------
i'm gonna hang out with me myself and


---------26:36----------
lou


---------26:37----------
we're gonna play with our toy cars and


---------26:38----------
it's gonna be great


---------26:41----------
yeah and then somewhere somewhere along


---------26:44----------
the way you were like oh like


---------26:45----------
lou's not worth hanging out with that's


---------26:48----------
different


---------26:49----------
something's changed does that make sense


---------26:52----------
that those are


---------26:53----------
those feel very different to me yes


---------26:56----------
i um like i had why i had this amazing


---------27:01----------
family


---------27:01----------
my childhood was a bit difficult because


---------27:04----------
we were moving


---------27:05----------
a lot so i was i was born in thailand


---------27:09----------
in phuket and we lived there for six


---------27:13----------
seven years and then


---------27:16----------
my dad was a teacher and he got a job


---------27:19----------
then as a headmaster in chile in south


---------27:22----------
america


---------27:23----------
so then we lived there for four years so


---------27:25----------
i was learning different languages


---------27:27----------
and then after that we we moved to to


---------27:30----------
england


---------27:32----------
and while i did make friends i was


---------27:35----------
always


---------27:36----------
very different from them and there were


---------27:39----------
there were


---------27:40----------
times where like if my friends wanted to


---------27:43----------
exclude me


---------27:45----------
they would they would talk in their own


---------27:47----------
language


---------27:48----------
so that i couldn't join in


---------27:53----------
um and i mean that happened in all the


---------27:56----------
countries apart from england because i


---------27:57----------
speak english then yeah


---------28:01----------
what was it like to be excluded


---------28:07----------
it wasn't fun um


---------28:11----------
no that there was


---------28:14----------
quite a um


---------28:20----------
poignant moment in high school


---------28:23----------
actually in england where i felt very


---------28:26----------
excluded


---------28:29----------
that i think i don't know how to


---------28:31----------
describe it really shaped the way i


---------28:33----------
felt about myself i think um


---------28:36----------
it's it sounds really materialistic


---------28:39----------
but i was in this group of like maybe


---------28:43----------
seven girls seven or eight girls and we


---------28:45----------
were all like best friends


---------28:47----------
uh but there was a pecking order and i


---------28:50----------
was


---------28:50----------
the bottom of the pecking order but it


---------28:52----------
was fine because like


---------28:54----------
i it meant i didn't have to sit in the


---------28:56----------
toilet at lunchtime if i hung out with


---------28:58----------
them


---------28:59----------
um and basically


---------29:02----------
every every birthday because for our


---------29:05----------
18th it was his 18th birthday so


---------29:07----------
every birthday everyone would pitch in


---------29:09----------
20 pounds


---------29:10----------
and then like the week before everyone


---------29:12----------
would would go


---------29:13----------
out and choose a like a special charm


---------29:17----------
bracelet with a charm for them and then


---------29:18----------
like a cake and then a little surprise


---------29:20----------
party and that sort of thing


---------29:21----------
anyway uh you can probably tell where


---------29:24----------
this story is going but like


---------29:25----------
four birthdays happen everyone pitches


---------29:27----------
in i pitch in


---------29:28----------
it gets to my birthday uh nothing really


---------29:31----------
happens


---------29:32----------
on the day that's fine i'm people busy i


---------29:35----------
wait a couple of weeks


---------29:36----------
um one of the girls invites me around to


---------29:39----------
hers


---------29:43----------
[Laughter]


---------29:49----------
sorry um when i walked in


---------29:52----------
there was like half a box of donuts


---------29:56----------
and some deodorant that they were like


---------29:58----------
spraying around i don't know if that was


---------30:00----------
like a joke


---------30:01----------
like i smell bad or something that's


---------30:04----------
probably in my head as well um


---------30:06----------
but uh these yeah these don't episode


---------30:09----------
already started eating


---------30:10----------
um they sang happy birthday i was


---------30:13----------
waiting for this bracelet


---------30:15----------
um which yeah that makes me sound really


---------30:18----------
spoiled but


---------30:19----------
uh it didn't happen uh i found out


---------30:22----------
afterwards


---------30:23----------
that between the sort of seven of them


---------30:27----------
they only managed to get together about


---------30:30----------
five ten pounds


---------30:32----------
um so


---------30:36----------
well that made me feel pretty [ __ ] um


---------30:40----------
yeah what does that mean feel pretty


---------30:42----------
[ __ ] what are you feeling


---------30:46----------
um i felt


---------30:50----------
like like these


---------30:54----------
these people were my friends and they


---------30:59----------
like even though i'd joined in all the


---------31:01----------
other i joined in all the birthdays


---------31:03----------
afterwards


---------31:04----------
as well um even though i joined in all


---------31:07----------
this stuff they didn't


---------31:08----------
they didn't want to do the same for me


---------31:12----------
and it i just made me feel quite uh


---------31:14----------
excluded


---------31:20----------
like they want nothing to do with you


---------31:23----------
that's the one yeah there it is


---------31:30----------
so i want to point something else out to


---------31:32----------
you lou that's interesting because you


---------31:34----------
call yourself materialistic when you


---------31:36----------
tell that story


---------31:39----------
yeah why do you do that because it


---------31:43----------
is it's quite quite expensive bracelet


---------31:46----------
everyone pitches in 20 pounds


---------31:49----------
but to me it wasn't really about the


---------31:51----------
bracelet it was about


---------31:53----------
i don't think it's about to bracelet to


---------31:55----------
anyone who's listening to that story


---------31:59----------
okay right but i want you to notice what


---------32:03----------
your mind does


---------32:05----------
even when you're sharing something that


---------32:08----------
is


---------32:08----------
authentic vulnerable and that maybe you


---------32:11----------
deserve


---------32:12----------
compassion for what do you do to try to


---------32:16----------
the kind the what do you preemptively do


---------32:19----------
to our compassionate response


---------32:25----------
um to try to like


---------32:28----------
uh squash it yes yeah right interesting


---------32:31----------
huh


---------32:32----------
you see how you're doing that


---------32:35----------
you're actually devaluing yourself


---------32:40----------
in the story


---------32:43----------
you're like look at me i'm a


---------32:44----------
materialistic little [ __ ]


---------32:47----------
and then you tell the story which is not


---------32:49----------
about i don't think anyone


---------32:50----------
thinks that that's materialistic i think


---------32:52----------
it's about


---------32:54----------
fairness and


---------32:58----------
justice sounds bizarre but like you know


---------33:00----------
i think it's about value


---------33:03----------
it's about being valued about being


---------33:06----------
appreciated


---------33:08----------
it's not a story about material things


---------33:13----------
right yeah


---------33:16----------
yeah i and yet your mind generates this


---------33:19----------
thought which is like oh i'm so it


---------33:21----------
sounds kind of materialistic thought we


---------33:24----------
were going to talk about like


---------33:26----------
you know everyone had a louis vuitton


---------33:28----------
bag and like i didn't have one or


---------33:30----------
something like that


---------33:31----------
even then that's okay i guess but


---------33:35----------
you know that sounds to me like they


---------33:37----------
they really i mean you were


---------33:41----------
yeah i mean i it doesn't sound to me


---------33:43----------
like they were your friends


---------33:48----------
oh yeah but i don't talk to them anymore


---------33:50----------
it kept


---------33:51----------
more things kept happening and then i


---------33:53----------
realized this


---------33:54----------
just making me sad actually um


---------33:58----------
they used to sort of say that i always


---------34:01----------
make myself a victim um


---------34:06----------
which made well the rest of my life


---------34:09----------
really hard because whenever anything


---------34:11----------
happened to me uh i would be like


---------34:14----------
uh i'm just making myself a victim here


---------34:17----------
you know


---------34:18----------
am i overreacting there it is so so do


---------34:20----------
you see that if you're


---------34:21----------
if you're just making yourself a victim


---------34:23----------
what are you doing to yourself


---------34:26----------
you're devaluing yourself


---------34:29----------
right you take the


---------34:32----------
oomph out of whatever complaint you have


---------34:37----------
blaming the victim and calling someone a


---------34:40----------
victim


---------34:41----------
is the last refuge of [ __ ]


---------34:46----------
because because if if you're just being


---------34:48----------
a victim all the time then like


---------34:51----------
i'm perfect the problem's you


---------34:56----------
right it's a very very very easy way to


---------35:01----------
dodge any kind of personal


---------35:03----------
responsibility


---------35:05----------
to blame the victim or say that


---------35:08----------
you know lou what's wrong with you


---------35:11----------
you're a vic like you're so victim


---------35:13----------
complex like


---------35:14----------
we got you deodorant and donuts


---------35:17----------
and the rest of us got charm bracelets


---------35:19----------
and cakes on our birthday by the way


---------35:22----------
or near our birthday not as an


---------35:24----------
afterthought


---------35:27----------
like why are you whining why are you


---------35:30----------
making me feel bad for being an [ __ ]


---------35:31----------
and treating you like [ __ ] it's your


---------35:33----------
fault


---------35:36----------
yeah that's that sounds like what they


---------35:39----------
would say yeah


---------35:40----------
yeah and then you started adopting the


---------35:42----------
victim mentality which has


---------35:44----------
to do with so like if we think about it


---------35:46----------
like if if you start blaming yourself


---------35:48----------
for being a victim


---------35:49----------
you devalue your own experience does


---------35:52----------
that make sense


---------35:54----------
yes and so when you devalue yourself


---------35:58----------
like your worth is a human being and


---------36:01----------
your mind decreases


---------36:02----------
does that make sense yeah


---------36:05----------
and if your worth as a human being is


---------36:07----------
really low why would anyone want to hang


---------36:09----------
out with you


---------36:15----------
that's true i don't know why anyone


---------36:17----------
would


---------36:18----------
so so i i think i mean it's kind of


---------36:20----------
weird but like this idea of this person


---------36:22----------
wants nothing to do with me


---------36:25----------
to me feels very connected to this


---------36:28----------
ah yeah


---------36:39----------
i think the the value uh thing is


---------36:42----------
interesting because


---------36:44----------
i don't know if this is related at all


---------36:46----------
but um


---------36:48----------
i used to get my nails done um quite


---------36:51----------
frequently before


---------36:52----------
locked down um and they


---------36:56----------
always turned out okay but there was


---------36:57----------
this one lady one week who


---------36:59----------
just felt like she just like got a saw


---------37:02----------
and just chopping my fingers off like


---------37:04----------
they were just they were bleeding


---------37:06----------
and i was sat there like tears streaming


---------37:08----------
like and she was like oh oh i'm sorry i


---------37:10----------
hope it hurt


---------37:11----------
but i didn't want i didn't want her to


---------37:13----------
feel bad that she was doing a bad job so


---------37:15----------
i was sat there like oh no


---------37:16----------
they're fine and then for the following


---------37:20----------
few weeks


---------37:21----------
every time i went to shower they would


---------37:23----------
sting in the shower my nails snapped off


---------37:26----------
i had to wear plasters on them and i was


---------37:28----------
i was beating myself up over it like you


---------37:30----------
know


---------37:31----------
you're such a [ __ ] you should have just


---------37:32----------
you should have said you know mate can


---------37:34----------
you cool off my nails a bit


---------37:36----------
um but i didn't do that and


---------37:40----------
yeah i just i kept yeah


---------37:43----------
i get myself into these situations a lot


---------37:48----------
so how do you think that's related you


---------37:51----------
started that off with like i'm not sure


---------37:52----------
if this is related but


---------37:54----------
this thing happened to me so you tell me


---------37:55----------
how it's related


---------37:58----------
why does your mind go there because


---------38:02----------
my thing


---------38:05----------
the pain i was in was worth less


---------38:08----------
than whether or not she thought she was


---------38:11----------
doing a good job


---------38:13----------
beautifully put


---------38:17----------
right and then what do you do to


---------38:19----------
yourself so like that's true


---------38:22----------
but then what happens in the shower what


---------38:24----------
do you do to yourself


---------38:26----------
every time you're in pain what does your


---------38:28----------
mind tell you what


---------38:32----------
why you such a [ __ ] idiot like yeah


---------38:36----------
yeah right so like this is kind of weird


---------38:39----------
lou but like you're setting up


---------38:41----------
you're playing a rigged game


---------38:44----------
and it's a game where lou doesn't get to


---------38:45----------
complain


---------38:48----------
and it's always lou's fault


---------38:52----------
yeah how fun is that game to play


---------38:58----------
um a lot of fun though


---------39:03----------
yeah sounds quite shitty


---------39:15----------
i'm thinking but also giving you space


---------39:18----------
to speak


---------39:19----------
okay i


---------39:23----------
okay i don't i don't quite know what to


---------39:26----------
say


---------39:27----------
i don't know either so can i think for a


---------39:28----------
second yeah


---------39:30----------
yeah go ahead so now that we've


---------39:33----------
potentially made this discovery


---------39:35----------
now i'm like okay great now what


---------39:40----------
that's what i'm thinking okay what do we


---------39:42----------
do with this


---------39:43----------
right so let me let me just give you a


---------39:45----------
second to try to figure out where we go


---------39:46----------
from here


---------39:47----------
okay okay that's fine what are you what


---------39:49----------
are you thinking right now


---------39:52----------
um it's just a lot of painful memories


---------39:56----------
just


---------39:56----------
just came back about tell me about those


---------39:58----------
girls and tell me tell me something


---------40:00----------
um so


---------40:04----------
i just there was it's the same group of


---------40:07----------
same group of girls there's one time it


---------40:09----------
was


---------40:10----------
the first time that i'd ever


---------40:15----------
this is really embarrassing to say it


---------40:17----------
was the first time i've ever been like


---------40:18----------
naked in front of someone


---------40:20----------
we went to get a spray tan together


---------40:24----------
um i i was 18


---------40:28----------
and it was for it was for like the the


---------40:30----------
prom at the


---------40:32----------
at the end of like i guess that's what


---------40:33----------
you have called it was called the levers


---------40:35----------
ball or something


---------40:36----------
um but we went to get a spray tan


---------40:40----------
together i didn't actually know you're


---------40:41----------
supposed to


---------40:42----------
like get get naked for a spray tan


---------40:45----------
so uh that was a surprise um but i did


---------40:49----------
she had hers done and then i went to get


---------40:50----------
mine done straight afterwards and then i


---------40:52----------
went back into the changing room


---------40:54----------
to put my stuff back on my clothes back


---------40:58----------
on


---------40:58----------
and she


---------41:03----------
she said to me um


---------41:07----------
what the [ __ ] is wrong with your nipples


---------41:11----------
they look blue i don't


---------41:15----------
i mean i don't think i have blue nipples


---------41:17----------
um but she said that and then she said


---------41:19----------
um


---------41:23----------
when you have sex with a guy don't


---------41:27----------
take off your top because he's not going


---------41:29----------
to want to [ __ ] you


---------41:32----------
um and at the time i was just


---------41:35----------
trying my hardest not to look upset by


---------41:37----------
this because i knew that she'd call me


---------41:39----------
sensitive


---------41:40----------
so i was i was just like okay laughs and


---------41:44----------
like


---------41:44----------
joked along and and then when i got home


---------41:50----------
i couldn't stop thinking about it and


---------41:53----------
it meant that the rest of my


---------41:55----------
relationships i


---------41:56----------
i used to just keep my shares on


---------42:14----------
crap


---------42:17----------
what do you think about that story now


---------42:22----------
i think that my nipples aren't [ __ ]


---------42:28----------
blue


---------42:32----------
so there's there's something important


---------42:33----------
there i mean there's a lot that's


---------42:34----------
important there but i just want to point


---------42:36----------
something out to you


---------42:37----------
yeah you look like you're processing


---------42:39----------
still


---------42:40----------
yeah i'm gonna give you a second you let


---------42:43----------
me know when you're


---------42:44----------
ready okay


---------42:48----------
i'm ready so


---------42:52----------
if someone says something like that


---------42:54----------
about you yeah


---------42:56----------
there's a there's like if someone says


---------42:58----------
something mean about you there's like


---------43:00----------
this counterpoint right there's like a


---------43:03----------
no my nipples are normal or whatever


---------43:07----------
but the point is when someone puts you


---------43:09----------
down


---------43:10----------
there's a voice within you that says no


---------43:12----------
that isn't true


---------43:15----------
and what did you do to that voice


---------43:21----------
squashed it yep and so then what becomes


---------43:25----------
true for you


---------43:27----------
what's left what they what they said to


---------43:30----------
me


---------43:31----------
yeah and so if we think about it like


---------43:33----------
when we think about


---------43:34----------
at the very beginning of this


---------43:35----------
conversation i sort of mentioned to you


---------43:36----------
that like your mind


---------43:38----------
generates these thoughts right


---------43:41----------
and like where do those thoughts come


---------43:42----------
from they come from like the mind


---------43:45----------
generates thoughts that it thinks are


---------43:46----------
true


---------43:48----------
but the truth like the the thought


---------43:50----------
generating machines in your mind i think


---------43:52----------
were formed by experiences like this


---------43:55----------
because they were allowed to become true


---------43:57----------
certain opinions


---------43:59----------
about you as a person stood unopposed


---------44:04----------
in fact if anything and be careful


---------44:06----------
because i'm not blaming you for this


---------44:07----------
because but it could seem like an


---------44:09----------
indictment i could make it sound like


---------44:11----------
it's your fault so be careful okay


---------44:13----------
because


---------44:14----------
watch out if the victim complex comes up


---------44:16----------
but you basically


---------44:18----------
stabbed yourself in the back right


---------44:20----------
because instead of fighting against that


---------44:22----------
thought and i'm not


---------44:22----------
saying that this is your fault so be


---------44:24----------
careful victim complex don't derise


---------44:26----------
or if it does arise you let me know but


---------44:29----------
basically what happened is for a long


---------44:30----------
time it sounded like you have some real


---------44:32----------
[ __ ] people in your life


---------44:34----------
that were laying the foundation of the


---------44:37----------
way that you viewed yourself


---------44:42----------
and so like go ahead sorry


---------44:45----------
i i will say quite


---------44:50----------
nasty things about myself to other


---------44:54----------
people


---------44:55----------
because then it hurts less hearing them


---------45:01----------
you own it right yeah


---------45:04----------
why do you call yourself pooper noodle


---------45:06----------
again


---------45:08----------
cause because i shot in a sink


---------45:11----------
and if you call yourself pooper noodle


---------45:13----------
what does that let you do


---------45:16----------
um i don't own it


---------45:23----------
and then it hurts less yeah


---------45:35----------
we're gonna just sit quietly for a


---------45:36----------
moment okay


---------45:39----------
if you need me to say something please


---------45:41----------
let me know


---------45:43----------
okay i'm feeling emotions too


---------45:47----------
okay i have tears welling up in my eyes


---------45:51----------
that's that's very nice


---------45:55----------
um okay


---------45:59----------
yeah what are you feeling right now


---------46:03----------
um


---------46:07----------
i don't i don't know i am


---------46:10----------
this there's something else that i do as


---------46:12----------
well as say nasty things about myself


---------46:16----------
and i don't know how to explain this i


---------46:18----------
don't know why i do it


---------46:20----------
um but i will


---------46:23----------
actively go out sometimes but


---------46:27----------
on a really good day sometimes i will


---------46:29----------
actively go out online


---------46:31----------
search my name and look for the really


---------46:35----------
nasty comments about me and i would i


---------46:38----------
would do it to myself


---------46:40----------
and i will look for the nasty things i


---------46:43----------
don't know if it's to like uh


---------46:44----------
prepare myself or


---------46:48----------
i don't i don't know uh


---------46:51----------
but yeah i do that quite often


---------47:00----------
that makes a lot of sense to me can i


---------47:03----------
have a moment to figure out how to


---------47:05----------
explain it


---------47:06----------
yes you can


---------47:20----------
i think it comes down to


---------47:24----------
well i'm just going to toss out a random


---------47:26----------
kind of story is that okay


---------47:28----------
yeah go ahead


---------47:31----------
sometimes people torture themselves on


---------47:33----------
social media before they go to bed


---------47:37----------
it took me a while to like figure out


---------47:38----------
why they do this but i don't know how


---------47:40----------
else to describe it but like


---------47:42----------
you know sometimes when it's like late


---------47:44----------
at night and you may be feeling good


---------47:45----------
about yourself you may be feeling bad


---------47:47----------
about yourself


---------47:48----------
but then what you do is you hop on


---------47:50----------
social media and you look at all


---------47:52----------
of the wonderful things that other


---------47:53----------
people are doing


---------47:55----------
and it just makes you feel like [ __ ] but


---------47:57----------
you just sign up for that torture


---------48:00----------
like you log on and you gravitate


---------48:02----------
towards


---------48:03----------
seeing all of these happy people and


---------48:06----------
each person that you see


---------48:07----------
makes you feel worse and worse but you


---------48:09----------
just keep looking


---------48:11----------
and you know you do it to yourself and


---------48:12----------
you do it to yourself


---------48:14----------
and sometimes you're feeling good and


---------48:16----------
sometimes you're feeling bad sometimes


---------48:17----------
it's sort of like


---------48:18----------
confirming what you already suspect and


---------48:21----------
sometimes it's like


---------48:23----------
knocking you down a peg because you


---------48:26----------
don't deserve to feel good about


---------48:28----------
yourself


---------48:32----------
yeah and in your case


---------48:37----------
i think hope is a dangerous thing


---------48:40----------
because if hope yep


---------48:44----------
i think hope is a dangerous thing


---------48:47----------
because you've been


---------48:48----------
at the bottom of the pecking quarter you


---------48:49----------
know you can survive that


---------48:51----------
right like it's familiar territory you


---------48:53----------
know how to play this game


---------48:54----------
you've played this game before you're


---------48:56----------
actually really good at speed running


---------48:57----------
this game


---------48:58----------
when lose at the bottom of the totem


---------49:00----------
pole you spend you spend so much time


---------49:02----------
knocking yourself down


---------49:03----------
you know exactly what it looks like you


---------49:05----------
can survive


---------49:06----------
that you're actually quite strong and


---------49:10----------
you know you're strong you know if


---------49:11----------
people think you're [ __ ]


---------49:12----------
you'll survive that because you've


---------49:14----------
survived it for a long time i was about


---------49:16----------
to say


---------49:16----------
your entire life but that's not true


---------49:19----------
what's dangerous


---------49:23----------
is if you're not at the bottom of the


---------49:24----------
tone pole because being at the bottom


---------49:26----------
you're used to falling to the bottom


---------49:28----------
that hurts so much


---------49:30----------
more yeah


---------49:39----------
it's the possibility that you may not be


---------49:42----------
at the bottom which is absolutely


---------49:43----------
terrifying


---------49:47----------
what do you think about that


---------49:50----------
um i


---------49:53----------
yeah that's very well put hadn't thought


---------49:56----------
of it like that


---------49:58----------
um


---------50:01----------
yeah i don't know if it's related but


---------50:03----------
i've always been told i'm quite


---------50:05----------
pushover um as well


---------50:09----------
um so


---------50:12----------
so so so when i am you know assertive


---------50:16----------
it's a huge victory


---------50:19----------
for me just just a small thing


---------50:23----------
like telling a sexy driver that my seat


---------50:26----------
belt is stuck in the door


---------50:28----------
um but the the


---------50:32----------
totem pole thing i


---------50:38----------
um yeah i don't


---------50:45----------
i yeah


---------50:49----------
sorry i'm thinking and trying to speak


---------50:51----------
at the same time it's not working


---------50:56----------
i [ __ ] that up on the on a daily basis


---------51:02----------
i should use your line


---------51:05----------
um it's a good one


---------51:11----------
um normally like yeah


---------51:15----------
normally before like uh doing something


---------51:18----------
like this


---------51:20----------
i would i'll drink or like


---------51:24----------
like because in the past


---------51:27----------
like at a university and stuff i've


---------51:30----------
always been really


---------51:32----------
boring sober and then when i drink


---------51:35----------
the next day people would be like oh you


---------51:37----------
you're so much fun


---------51:38----------
when you drink you stream more often you


---------51:40----------
should you come out oh


---------51:42----------
you're so funny last night um so then


---------51:45----------
i start to think that i'm like i can't


---------51:48----------
be


---------51:50----------
funny without without alcohol i don't


---------51:52----------
drink very often


---------51:53----------
because i don't socialize very often


---------51:56----------
maybe like once a month


---------51:58----------
um but when i do i drink excessively


---------52:02----------
because i feel like i have to catch up


---------52:04----------
to everyone else's social level


---------52:07----------
of of being you know


---------52:10----------
a social person um so


---------52:14----------
yeah and then it always backfires


---------52:16----------
because i can't tell you how many people


---------52:17----------
that i've tried to make friends with at


---------52:19----------
university


---------52:20----------
but um i [ __ ] it up the first night


---------52:22----------
because they invited me out for drinks


---------52:23----------
and then i drank too much


---------52:25----------
and i they had to take me home from the


---------52:28----------
club and i threw up in the taxi and then


---------52:30----------
they never spoke to me again


---------52:32----------
um that's happened


---------52:35----------
quite a lot i've ruined it for myself


---------52:38----------
really with the alcohol um


---------52:41----------
yeah quite good at ruining things for


---------52:45----------
yourself


---------52:46----------
yeah yeah pro


---------52:52----------
you know one of the hardest things about


---------52:54----------
substances so


---------52:56----------
i don't know how many people know this


---------52:57----------
but in my day job i'm actually an


---------52:58----------
addiction psychiatrist so i work


---------53:00----------
primarily with addictions


---------53:02----------
oh you know you know what the hardest


---------53:05----------
addiction is to crack


---------53:08----------
it's when people tell me that when i use


---------53:11----------
the substance


---------53:13----------
i feel the way that other people look


---------53:17----------
i feel normal yeah


---------53:21----------
yeah because it's it's


---------53:24----------
easy to give up something


---------53:28----------
but it's hard to give up that which


---------53:30----------
makes you normal


---------53:32----------
it's a big ask


---------53:40----------
yeah that's what it is right you get to


---------53:44----------
be


---------53:45----------
normal you get to be funny


---------53:50----------
you get to have people like you you get


---------53:53----------
to not think those things about yourself


---------53:56----------
that sober you likes to think


---------54:00----------
yeah but then the next day i do


---------54:02----------
absolutely right


---------54:04----------
so here's the thing about drinking the


---------54:07----------
good point


---------54:08----------
you're not actually normal when you


---------54:10----------
drink you're just taking a loan


---------54:13----------
you're gonna have to pay that back right


---------54:15----------
because all of the self-judgmental


---------54:17----------
thoughts are gonna come


---------54:18----------
roaring back and you're actually going


---------54:22----------
to sabotage your relationships but man


---------54:24----------
is it really sweet like it's just like a


---------54:25----------
loan it's like


---------54:26----------
when i get like a loan from a bank and


---------54:28----------
i'm sitting on like ten thousand dollars


---------54:30----------
of cash like


---------54:31----------
that's awesome i get to buy whatever the


---------54:33----------
[ __ ] i want


---------54:35----------
yeah pay it back


---------54:41----------
i hadn't thought of it like that


---------54:47----------
right so then and the thing is usually


---------54:49----------
when it comes substances as i'm sure


---------54:50----------
you've learned


---------54:51----------
you pay it back with interest because


---------54:54----------
then those people


---------54:55----------
don't call you again in that situation i


---------54:58----------
think it's fair to say i mean so


---------54:59----------
don't get me wrong i want to be


---------55:00----------
compassionate and empathetic


---------55:03----------
but if you hang out with people for the


---------55:04----------
first time and you vomit in a taxi


---------55:08----------
like i wouldn't expect those people to


---------55:09----------
call you again right you're kind of


---------55:11----------
[ __ ] up there


---------55:12----------
like yeah


---------55:16----------
they had to pay flippy quid yeah


---------55:23----------
like don't get me wrong i i don't i mean


---------55:25----------
i i blame you for it and i forgive you


---------55:27----------
for it because


---------55:28----------
we're allowed to make mistakes right


---------55:31----------
that's part of life


---------55:32----------
but let's like be clear and like it it's


---------55:35----------
a mistake


---------55:37----------
yeah drinking too much vomiting in a


---------55:39----------
taxi and alienating people


---------55:41----------
generally speaking in the grand scheme


---------55:43----------
of life is a mistake


---------55:45----------
yeah now when someone tells you that


---------55:48----------
your nipples look strange


---------55:49----------
and you laughing it off and believing


---------55:51----------
that about yourself and being


---------55:53----------
self-conscious


---------55:54----------
that's not a mistake


---------55:57----------
that really isn't fair for you to think


---------55:59----------
about yourself


---------56:03----------
and and it's really mean that she said


---------56:05----------
that and i the


---------56:06----------
same part of me that you know


---------56:09----------
i guess holds you to the standard of


---------56:11----------
making a mistake for bombing the taxi


---------56:13----------
also says that you don't deserve that


---------56:16----------
sure like you deserve the taxi vomit 50


---------56:18----------
quid


---------56:19----------
fine but like this the rest of the stuff


---------56:21----------
that you do to yourself you don't


---------56:22----------
deserve


---------56:23----------
you also don't deserve to believe and


---------56:25----------
i'm not blaming you for believing this


---------56:27----------
that


---------56:27----------
you're not a delightful person without


---------56:29----------
alcohol because you seem delightful to


---------56:31----------
me


---------56:31----------
are you drunk right now no okay no


---------56:35----------
because that would really torpedo my


---------56:36----------
argument real fast wouldn't it


---------56:49----------
yeah i think uh


---------56:53----------
it's interesting that you keep using the


---------56:55----------
word deserve um


---------56:58----------
something


---------57:02----------
so


---------57:08----------
something happened to me last year um


---------57:13----------
and i wrote about it online


---------57:17----------
and for the whole world to see


---------57:20----------
um and


---------57:27----------
a lot of people said


---------57:30----------
uh you know how


---------57:33----------
how did she not see the red flags


---------57:37----------
what [ __ ] idiot um


---------57:42----------
like you know she deserved this to


---------57:43----------
happen to her sort of thing


---------57:45----------
and i i i do


---------57:52----------
i do um sort of believe that


---------57:56----------
you do believe what


---------57:59----------
that um i just deserved this bad


---------58:03----------
thing to happen to me because i was


---------58:07----------
[ __ ] stupid


---------58:14----------
i think about that for a second yes


---------58:33----------
do you mind if i um and i want you to


---------58:36----------
think about this question before you


---------58:37----------
answer it


---------58:38----------
okay do you mind if i add some


---------58:42----------
or ask you some just basic questions


---------58:44----------
about context remember we talked about


---------58:46----------
this


---------58:47----------
yes are we going to offer more context


---------58:50----------
are we going to skip past the context


---------58:52----------
whichever one you want to do um


---------58:57----------
i


---------59:01----------
let's get past okay yeah


---------59:05----------
okay yeah does that feel like the right


---------59:07----------
move to you


---------59:09----------
um uh


---------59:11----------
[Music]


---------59:13----------
yes okay okay you feeling good about


---------59:16----------
that


---------59:17----------
we good you're judging yourself again


---------59:19----------
what's going on


---------59:20----------
your face is changing i see it what are


---------59:22----------
you doing what are you telling yourself


---------59:25----------
uh the i'm gonna think about this a lot


---------59:28----------
later


---------59:30----------
that's okay you're allowed to think


---------59:31----------
about it what else you're doing that lip


---------59:33----------
biting thing that you do when you're


---------59:34----------
judging yourself


---------59:35----------
uh i i feel bad that i didn't want to


---------59:39----------
give context nope and


---------59:42----------
i am worried that i made your show bad


---------59:45----------
by not doing that


---------59:46----------
there it is okay so just notice what


---------59:48----------
happened right so there come the


---------59:50----------
thoughts again


---------59:51----------
and you believe them to be true they're


---------59:53----------
telling you they're true


---------59:57----------
you see that they feel true to you yeah


---------60:02----------
are they true i don't know


---------60:06----------
okay okay good i'll take and i don't


---------60:08----------
know but just acknowledge that they feel


---------60:10----------
true that's totally cool


---------60:12----------
they feel true to you it turns out i


---------60:14----------
don't think you [ __ ] anything up


---------60:15----------
that's my opinion okay okay but i'm


---------60:18----------
maybe your mind sort of tells you oh


---------60:20----------
he's just saying that


---------60:21----------
and he would be


---------60:28----------
almost like i do this for a living


---------60:31----------
so lou it's it's totally fine man


---------60:35----------
i think i think we can you don't have to


---------60:37----------
go into context you're not like a weak


---------60:38----------
person like oh my god


---------60:40----------
she'd be so much stronger if she spoke


---------60:42----------
out because that's what you're supposed


---------60:44----------
to do


---------60:49----------
right it's it's you do you man


---------60:53----------
so be careful because don't there you


---------60:55----------
like it it's there again too because


---------60:57----------
you have an impulse which is like this


---------61:00----------
is what lou wants to do


---------61:02----------
lou's nipples aren't weird and what do


---------61:05----------
you do to that impulse


---------61:08----------
right so so now i want you to really


---------61:10----------
notice


---------61:12----------
that that's just your reflex of


---------61:14----------
devaluing the way that you feel


---------61:17----------
you're putting you're knocking lou down


---------61:19----------
to the bottom of the totem pole


---------61:20----------
for the sake of the show


---------61:24----------
if i don't give a [ __ ] about the show


---------61:25----------
you certainly shouldn't give a [ __ ]


---------61:26----------
about the show


---------61:30----------
oh all right something changed


---------61:44----------
right so so how did we do that like how


---------61:45----------
are you feeling right now


---------61:48----------
uh uh


---------61:55----------
exposed okay and how does it feel to


---------61:58----------
feel exposed


---------62:04----------
um i'm worrying about


---------62:07----------
what's gonna happen later


---------62:11----------
okay okay


---------62:14----------
i think you're allowed to do that but


---------62:17----------
but what i'm hearing


---------62:18----------
is something this so let's just track


---------62:20----------
through what happened through your mind


---------62:21----------
right so i asked you


---------62:23----------
should we ask more context or uh provide


---------62:25----------
more context or not


---------62:26----------
and then yeah you didn't want to which


---------62:29----------
is totally fine


---------62:30----------
right because i think it's actually not


---------62:31----------
that important we can get a lot out of


---------62:32----------
this


---------62:34----------
okay and and then you started to judge


---------62:36----------
yourself


---------62:38----------
and then you were thinking like this lou


---------62:39----------
is bad in the moment she's [ __ ]


---------62:41----------
things up now


---------62:42----------
and then we've sort of noticed that that


---------62:45----------
you're like beating yourself up again


---------62:46----------
that you're devaluing yourself remember


---------62:48----------
the show


---------62:49----------
is more important than your feelings


---------62:51----------
like you did it again


---------62:54----------
yeah that same program it's like a bot


---------62:57----------
that's just like


---------62:58----------
auto run stuff for you and then we


---------63:00----------
noticed it and that and now you started


---------63:02----------
worrying about the future which i think


---------63:03----------
is a different bot


---------63:04----------
but it's not the same bot does that make


---------63:06----------
sense yes


---------63:07----------
yeah you weren't like devaluing yourself


---------63:09----------
you were like just maybe now you're


---------63:11----------
catastrophizing


---------63:12----------
or something like that yeah yeah but


---------63:14----------
beating yourself up and devaluing


---------63:16----------
yourself is not the same as


---------63:17----------
catastrophizing


---------63:20----------
agreed yes


---------63:26----------
no yeah oh no i forgot what's gonna say


---------63:31----------
it's okay


---------63:34----------
what i'm talking about is quite abstract


---------63:36----------
and hard to hold on to


---------63:42----------
i also get the sense that you're doing


---------63:44----------
by the way you're doing really well


---------63:45----------
i think it's hard for people to learn so


---------63:47----------
many different things that are new


---------63:49----------
all at the same time and are able to


---------63:51----------
keep up


---------63:54----------
yeah i feel like maybe like 20 of it is


---------63:57----------
going in


---------63:58----------
that's why i'm yeah i think it's


---------64:00----------
probably closer to 80 but that's you


---------64:01----------
doing it again you see it


---------64:06----------
but you're gonna take 80 and you're


---------64:07----------
going to turn it into 20 in your mind


---------64:12----------
yes do you see how like it's automatic


---------64:16----------
man


---------64:17----------
how do you notice it so well i don't


---------64:20----------
notice it at all


---------64:21----------
yeah well i mean now we're gonna get to


---------64:24----------
red flags


---------64:24----------
so the reason i notice it well are two


---------64:26----------
reasons one is i'm on the outside


---------64:29----------
uh-huh right the second thing is


---------64:32----------
i practice so you can learn to notice it


---------64:36----------
too because you can notice it if i


---------64:37----------
point it out to you so all you have to


---------64:40----------
do is you have certain programming


---------64:42----------
that has taught you to take opinions


---------64:45----------
about yourself


---------64:46----------
and knock them down in the same way you


---------64:49----------
can start to


---------64:50----------
program being able to notice opinions


---------64:53----------
about yourself


---------64:54----------
and recognize that these are not


---------64:56----------
actually fair opinions this is just your


---------64:58----------
programming


---------65:00----------
you have internalized the opinions of


---------65:04----------
that group of girls


---------65:06----------
does that make sense


---------65:10----------
um yeah sorry i'm bouncing around a lot


---------65:12----------
you can also


---------65:13----------
internalize what i am telling you it


---------65:16----------
just takes practice


---------65:18----------
so you can learn how to know this too


---------65:23----------
it's really cool you have to forgive me


---------65:24----------
i'm an academic so


---------65:26----------
when i sometimes i could say things


---------65:29----------
simply and then instead i make them


---------65:30----------
complicated and hard to understand


---------65:33----------
it's so it's all right um


---------65:36----------
it's the way we feel good about


---------65:38----------
ourselves because then we feel smarter


---------65:39----------
than everyone else


---------65:43----------
when we say something and the rest of


---------65:44----------
the world doesn't understand it just


---------65:45----------
means we're brilliant and they're idiots


---------65:47----------
and then we're like oh when actually


---------65:50----------
we're the ones who are stupid


---------65:52----------
because if we're teachers our job is to


---------65:54----------
help people understand


---------65:58----------
do you think i'm understanding i think


---------66:00----------
you're understanding a lot more than you


---------66:01----------
give yourself credit for


---------66:05----------
okay i'm not making it easy on you by


---------66:07----------
the way


---------66:09----------
no this is this is great this is


---------66:13----------
very uh informative


---------66:18----------
should we get back to it okay yeah go on


---------66:21----------
how are you feeling right now real quick


---------66:24----------
uh oh what did i say


---------66:28----------
that i felt exposed yeah


---------66:33----------
yeah yeah i'm worried about later


---------66:36----------
um what um


---------66:47----------
okay um um


---------66:54----------
no um you know what i'm i'm not gonna


---------66:56----------
skip past it


---------66:58----------
um see look no she just did


---------67:01----------
yeah last year


---------67:05----------
i um i was uh i was assaulted


---------67:09----------
by someone and um


---------67:12----------
i wrote about my experience online


---------67:16----------
and a lot of people


---------67:20----------
reach out to me afterwards about it


---------67:25----------
uh people that i hoped i


---------67:28----------
would never hear from again


---------67:31----------
for example there those those girls from


---------67:34----------
high school


---------67:38----------
read um [ __ ]


---------67:41----------
nice my stuff and reached out to me


---------67:46----------
but exes that i hoped i'd never speak to


---------67:49----------
again


---------67:49----------
reached out to me um it was


---------67:53----------
it was it was weird it was really weird


---------67:56----------
some guy that i went to school with who


---------67:59----------
i only spoke to like maybe two times


---------68:02----------
sent me a message on facebook saying oh


---------68:04----------
hey i read your twitter longer


---------68:06----------
um if you ever need someone to talk to


---------68:09----------
i'm here like


---------68:11----------
i don't i mean i know these people they


---------68:13----------
mean well


---------68:14----------
um but i think that's why i feel exposed


---------68:17----------
right now because i'm i'm


---------68:19----------
thinking about later like what's


---------68:22----------
happening yeah like who's gonna reach


---------68:24----------
out to me and be like hey


---------68:26----------
i saw i saw your interview you know


---------68:29----------
oh hope you're doing okay if you need


---------68:32----------
someone to talk


---------68:33----------
like but there's people that i don't


---------68:34----------
want to hear from that's yeah


---------68:36----------
that sounds really ungrateful um but


---------68:39----------
oh no i just did it again didn't i ah


---------68:42----------
how did you learn how to do that


---------68:45----------
because you made a face


---------68:48----------
you had like well i've [ __ ] faced


---------68:52----------
this all the time


---------68:53----------
okay just a random pile of faces


---------69:03----------
you really can't blame me for that or


---------69:06----------
credit me for that


---------69:07----------
i think that's you learning that's what


---------69:09----------
learning is like


---------69:12----------
because i make okay [ __ ] i'm making a


---------69:14----------
face right now like


---------69:15----------
what does this mean no one knows


---------69:18----------
yeah i can't tell yes


---------69:24----------
my face is about as rng as you can get


---------69:28----------
okay so let's let's try to put some i'm


---------69:30----------
gonna try to


---------69:31----------
organize our discussion a little bit is


---------69:32----------
that okay yes


---------69:34----------
do you want some time to think nope i'm


---------69:37----------
good do you want some time to think


---------69:39----------
no i'm great okay yeah


---------69:42----------
so i i see a fork in the road we can


---------69:45----------
either talk about


---------69:46----------
like you know what you're experiencing


---------69:48----------
now about like what is it that makes you


---------69:49----------
not want to hear from people


---------69:51----------
what is it that makes you worried about


---------69:53----------
the consequences of this conversation


---------69:56----------
or we can go back to this idea of


---------69:59----------
not seeing the red flags feeling stupid


---------70:02----------
feeling like on some level you may have


---------70:04----------
deserved it


---------70:06----------
which direction do you want to go down


---------70:14----------
um the


---------70:16----------
the the deserving one okay


---------70:20----------
so let's start with red flags can i tell


---------70:22----------
you story


---------70:24----------
yes one of my favorite stories so when i


---------70:26----------
was an intern i just finished medical


---------70:28----------
school


---------70:29----------
and i was an intern so like when you're


---------70:31----------
an intern i'm a psychiatrist but when


---------70:32----------
you're an intern


---------70:33----------
you do all kinds of like physical


---------70:35----------
medicine so i was working in the icu


---------70:36----------
and things like that learning how to


---------70:38----------
treat heart attacks and strokes and


---------70:40----------
pneumonia and all that kind of stuff


---------70:42----------
so i one time had this patient that was


---------70:45----------
an elderly woman


---------70:46----------
who um had pneumonia and


---------70:50----------
like what happens is you start your


---------70:52----------
shift at like seven in the morning


---------70:54----------
and it ends at seven at night so you're


---------70:56----------
in the hospital for 12 hours


---------70:59----------
so you're in in the hospital 12 hours a


---------71:01----------
day


---------71:02----------
six days a week so um


---------71:05----------
you know we're taking care of the woman


---------71:06----------
and she starts to do a little bit worse


---------71:09----------
her breathing gets a little bit worse


---------71:11----------
like you know she starts to have


---------71:12----------
her white count which is like the her


---------71:14----------
cells that fight infection kind of jump


---------71:16----------
up a couple things are happening we're


---------71:18----------
kind of monitoring very closely


---------71:20----------
throughout the day because she seems to


---------71:21----------
be moving in the wrong direction


---------71:24----------
so then when shift change happens around


---------71:26----------
7 pm my


---------71:27----------
my colleague shows up at 6 30 and then i


---------71:31----------
start telling


---------71:32----------
my colleague about all the patients that


---------71:33----------
they're gonna have to watch overnight


---------71:35----------
including my patients so you kind of


---------71:36----------
tell them about all the patients


---------71:37----------
and so i tell her tell him about this


---------71:39----------
woman i said hey you know she's we've


---------71:41----------
been watching her we're like


---------71:42----------
she may need to go to the icu at some


---------71:44----------
point she's not doing as well


---------71:46----------
and then he kind of takes a look at her


---------71:48----------
like data and stuff and he's like


---------71:49----------
listening to the story and she's like


---------71:51----------
and he starts freaking out he's like


---------71:53----------
dude she needs to like she needed to be


---------71:54----------
in the icu hours ago


---------71:56----------
like look at this man like she's not


---------71:58----------
breathing well her white count is up


---------72:01----------
she's like like like just look at her o2


---------72:04----------
levels her oxygen levels and he starts


---------72:05----------
like freaking out


---------72:07----------
and then i start to feel like really


---------72:08----------
really bad because like as he's


---------72:10----------
repeating this stuff back to me


---------72:13----------
like it sort of like makes perfect sense


---------72:15----------
because he's like listing the data that


---------72:17----------
everything that i literally just told


---------72:18----------
him


---------72:18----------
and when he like packages it and gives


---------72:20----------
it back to me i'm like oh [ __ ] this lady


---------72:22----------
needs to be in the icu


---------72:24----------
and then and then he starts like really


---------72:27----------
panicking and then he kind of like riles


---------72:28----------
me up and then i feel terrible because i


---------72:30----------
and i kind of tell him that you know


---------72:32----------
when you're an intern you have two


---------72:33----------
supervising doctors so i kind of tell


---------72:34----------
them


---------72:35----------
hey like you know i talked it through


---------72:36----------
with like the two supervising doctors


---------72:39----------
and like they felt like we just talked


---------72:40----------
about this lady like two hours ago we


---------72:42----------
went and saw her two hours ago


---------72:43----------
we decided that we didn't think icu


---------72:45----------
transfer was appropriate


---------72:46----------
and he's like well that's just idiotic


---------72:48----------
like she absolutely needs to be in the


---------72:49----------
icu


---------72:50----------
she starts paging a bunch of people and


---------72:51----------
like people show up and they like take


---------72:53----------
her to the icu and stuff and like i feel


---------72:55----------
like a complete dumb ass


---------72:56----------
cause i'm like how did i miss this it's


---------72:57----------
so obvious


---------72:59----------
and so then later i went to one of these


---------73:01----------
like older doctors in the hospital like


---------73:03----------
these


---------73:03----------
super wise guy you with me by the way


---------73:05----------
have i lost you yeah okay


---------73:06----------
no no and then i i kind of tell them


---------73:08----------
like one day after like we have this


---------73:10----------
conference and then at the end of the


---------73:11----------
conference i kind of tell them hey like


---------73:12----------
i think i kind of screwed up


---------73:14----------
and he's like this nice guy that you go


---------73:15----------
to when you have problems


---------73:17----------
and i said like i don't know how i


---------73:18----------
missed this it happened right in front


---------73:20----------
of my eyes


---------73:22----------
and what the the doctor said next blew


---------73:24----------
my mind and he says well that's why you


---------73:25----------
didn't see it


---------73:27----------
he's like the hardest things to see are


---------73:30----------
those that happen


---------73:31----------
right in front of you right when you're


---------73:34----------
inside something every step of the way


---------73:37----------
you don't see the big picture you just


---------73:38----------
see like one step at a time


---------73:40----------
and you're stuck in it


---------73:43----------
and that's how you you miss it like if


---------73:45----------
you think about things like abusive


---------73:46----------
relationships or grooming or stuff like


---------73:48----------
that


---------73:49----------
each step of the way feels okay


---------73:53----------
it's when you zoom out that everyone's


---------73:55----------
like how can this person be so stupid


---------73:58----------
and like literally if you if i put this


---------74:00----------
in front of my eyes like i can't see any


---------74:04----------
right the closer you are to something


---------74:06----------
the harder it is to notice


---------74:08----------
even if we think about your thought


---------74:10----------
process


---------74:12----------
when your thoughts when you're really


---------74:15----------
fused in your mind


---------74:16----------
they feel true to you and they're not


---------74:18----------
opinions they're facts


---------74:19----------
they're not thoughts they're not


---------74:21----------
emotions they're not feelings they're


---------74:23----------
facts


---------74:24----------
you tell yourself lou just isn't that


---------74:26----------
good of a person it feels like a fact


---------74:28----------
when you gain distance from it


---------74:31----------
when you learn to see it from the


---------74:33----------
outside is when it becomes a red flag


---------74:36----------
when it becomes a problem when it's no


---------74:38----------
longer true


---------74:40----------
yes so the first thing is that other


---------74:43----------
people can see red flags from the


---------74:44----------
outside but like that's because they're


---------74:46----------
from the outside


---------74:48----------
the hardest mistakes to see are the ones


---------74:52----------
that we make


---------74:53----------
not the ones that other people make i


---------74:55----------
mean take any [ __ ] person on the


---------74:57----------
street they can tell you a thousand


---------74:58----------
things that you're doing wrong


---------75:00----------
ask them what are they doing wrong


---------75:01----------
they've got no answers


---------75:06----------
so the first thing is are you stupid


---------75:10----------
i don't think so what do you think


---------75:17----------
you're allowed to say yes i think i'm


---------75:20----------
[ __ ] stupid


---------75:22----------
what makes you feel like you're [ __ ]


---------75:23----------
stupid you're allowed to believe that


---------75:28----------
um


---------75:33----------
i i i


---------75:36----------
well and i feel stupid like


---------75:40----------
like just your story i i i missed


---------75:44----------
a lot of seemingly quite obvious


---------75:49----------
things but i i didn't want to


---------75:52----------
to believe that this person was


---------75:56----------
bad i


---------75:59----------
i wanted to believe that they were a


---------76:02----------
good person


---------76:04----------
it was harder for me to believe that


---------76:07----------
they were capable of doing something bad


---------76:11----------
okay so what i'm


---------76:14----------
it's gonna sound silly lou that doesn't


---------76:16----------
sound stupid to me


---------76:18----------
let's just listen to your words i wanted


---------76:21----------
to believe that this person


---------76:23----------
was better than they were that doesn't


---------76:25----------
sound like idiocy


---------76:27----------
that sounds like faith in humanity and


---------76:30----------
maybe you can say that faith in humanity


---------76:31----------
is stupid


---------76:34----------
but like literally lou what makes me


---------76:36----------
good at my job is believing exactly what


---------76:38----------
you believe


---------76:41----------
anytime someone walks into my office i


---------76:43----------
want to believe that they can be better


---------76:45----------
than what they're suggesting


---------76:49----------
yeah i want to believe that you are


---------76:53----------
worth


---------76:54----------
more than you tell me your worth


---------76:57----------
does that make me stupid


---------77:06----------
whether i'm stupid or not i'm i choose


---------77:09----------
to believe it anyway


---------77:10----------
people can call me stupid for having


---------77:12----------
faith that you have value as a human


---------77:14----------
being i know it sounds


---------77:15----------
a weird sentence but you know like like


---------77:18----------
i don't think


---------77:19----------
i don't think you wanting to believe


---------77:22----------
that someone was better than what you


---------77:25----------
what they could have been i don't think


---------77:26----------
that makes you stupid i just don't


---------77:32----------
or if it does i think stupidity is a


---------77:34----------
good quality


---------77:35----------
and i do think that like i mentioned


---------77:37----------
earlier it's like you get lost and stuff


---------77:39----------
because it's in front of your face


---------77:41----------
yeah i mean generally speaking i haven't


---------77:44----------
seen any


---------77:45----------
evidence that suggests that like you


---------77:47----------
know victims of sexual violence


---------77:50----------
like it's not about iq


---------77:54----------
it's about emotions power dynamics


---------77:58----------
kind of like predatory behavior


---------78:02----------
like victims aren't stupid they're


---------78:04----------
victims


---------78:08----------
you know i it doesn't i just don't


---------78:11----------
accept that


---------78:13----------
i mean you may be stupid like maybe


---------78:14----------
you're stupid but that has nothing to do


---------78:15----------
with you being a victim it's just like


---------78:17----------
those are different things what do you


---------78:20----------
think


---------78:24----------
um i i


---------78:26----------
feel like i um


---------78:33----------
uh i feel like i'm not allowed to be


---------78:36----------
happy because


---------78:44----------
i i mean i've had i've had people


---------78:47----------
message me or say things before like you


---------78:49----------
know this


---------78:51----------
girl looks way too happy here she's


---------78:52----------
obviously lying


---------78:54----------
about about the whole thing so


---------78:57----------
i feel like i'm not allowed to be happy


---------79:00----------
because then


---------79:02----------
um people would um


---------79:06----------
believe me and you want people to


---------79:09----------
believe you


---------79:13----------
more than i want to be happy


---------79:18----------
that's interesting


---------79:22----------
so let's think about that for a second


---------79:24----------
right so i thought that was very


---------79:26----------
a very authentic representation so what


---------79:29----------
do you think about someone who wants to


---------79:31----------
be believed


---------79:32----------
more than they want to be happy


---------79:39----------
that they're stupid probably


---------79:44----------
i can see why you would come to that


---------79:46----------
conclusion i


---------79:48----------
i i i think though so what that tells me


---------79:51----------
lou is that


---------79:56----------
i i don't think it's stupid at all i


---------79:58----------
think that


---------79:59----------
um i laughed because it's i sort of


---------80:02----------
walked into that one


---------80:04----------
in terms of your response because like


---------80:07----------
of course like


---------80:08----------
why wouldn't people choose happiness but


---------80:09----------
i think it tells us a lot about you


---------80:11----------
right so i think this goes back to like


---------80:13----------
you being seen


---------80:14----------
and accepted for what you are


---------80:19----------
and and your entire life you've been


---------80:21----------
sort of like trying to be you


---------80:23----------
and people have been swatting you down


---------80:26----------
and now with something so important


---------80:30----------
you want them you don't want to swat


---------80:32----------
yourself down


---------80:34----------
like you want people to believe you like


---------80:36----------
you want to say like you know


---------80:38----------
take your pick like six donuts is not


---------80:41----------
okay


---------80:44----------
you know my i was about to make a


---------80:47----------
comment about your nipples but that's


---------80:48----------
just gonna get taken out of context


---------80:50----------
but like you know take whatever whatever


---------80:52----------
uh


---------80:53----------
you know context like whatever story


---------80:55----------
like there have been lots of times where


---------80:56----------
you've taken what you are on the inside


---------80:59----------
and you've said i defer to the rest of


---------81:01----------
the world


---------81:02----------
what i am gets second place


---------81:05----------
compared to like what y'all think but


---------81:08----------
what i'm hearing you do is like put your


---------81:10----------
foot down


---------81:11----------
draw your line in the sand and say when


---------81:13----------
it comes to this


---------81:15----------
i'm not going to compromise and i need


---------81:19----------
to be believed


---------81:19----------
and this did happen and if happiness is


---------81:22----------
the sacrifice that it takes to be like


---------81:24----------
authentic and accepted then so be it


---------81:30----------
yeah that doesn't sound stupid to me at


---------81:32----------
all


---------81:37----------
what do you think


---------81:41----------
i feel um


---------81:44----------
i i put a lot of pressure on myself


---------81:48----------
because i


---------81:52----------
i worry that if


---------81:55----------
that if i if i


---------81:59----------
heal and i am happy and someone is like


---------82:02----------
she looks way too happy to clout


---------82:06----------
chase and [ __ ] clearly lies about the


---------82:08----------
whole thing then


---------82:10----------
what if they discredit


---------82:13----------
other people's stories as well because


---------82:17----------
because it seems like i am lying


---------82:20----------
and then suddenly i


---------82:24----------
i think i'm catastrophizing sort of


---------82:28----------
sure see there you did it again look at


---------82:31----------
that


---------82:34----------
yeah what are you starting to do


---------82:38----------
you're gaining distance from your


---------82:39----------
thoughts because you were like about to


---------82:42----------
like you were boarding that train


---------82:44----------
and it was like the seat belt isn't on


---------82:46----------
it's starting to chug away and you're


---------82:47----------
like hey hold on a second


---------82:49----------
can you pull over i need to put the seat


---------82:50----------
belt on that's what you just did yeah


---------82:51----------
you just did it


---------82:53----------
yeah yeah


---------82:57----------
i did yeah interesting


---------83:01----------
what happened to that that train of


---------83:03----------
thoughts once you're like oh i'm


---------83:04----------
catastrophizing again


---------83:09----------
i can't remember what i was talking


---------83:11----------
about there you go


---------83:13----------
pull the plug on it so if anyone here is


---------83:15----------
watching this is the way you pull the


---------83:17----------
plug on anxiety


---------83:19----------
like i can't even remember like just


---------83:21----------
imagine if i could give you a pill


---------83:23----------
that would make you literally forget


---------83:25----------
your anxieties because that's what we


---------83:27----------
just saw happen you literally forgot


---------83:30----------
your anxiety like that's what you can't


---------83:31----------
even remember what you were talking


---------83:32----------
about now


---------83:37----------
yeah oh no i just remembered


---------83:41----------
see it takes work though doesn't it yeah


---------83:44----------
okay good because the more you remember


---------83:48----------
the more you can practice forgetting and


---------83:50----------
when you get really good at forgetting


---------83:52----------
when you get really good at noticing


---------83:54----------
then you'll be in control


---------83:58----------
but keep going you want to finish your


---------83:59----------
thought


---------84:01----------
no okay


---------84:04----------
so if i if i notice


---------84:09----------
these things what happens like i notice


---------84:11----------
it and then what


---------84:13----------
did it still happen yes


---------84:16----------
except every time you notice it you gain


---------84:18----------
a little bit of control over it


---------84:22----------
right so if i notice my facial


---------84:25----------
expressions


---------84:27----------
if i pay attention to them i can


---------84:30----------
control them


---------84:33----------
right and if i'm not aware of what i'm


---------84:36----------
doing


---------84:36----------
then i don't control it


---------84:40----------
so awareness precedes control


---------84:43----------
if you've ever had dental work done and


---------84:46----------
you've had your mouth numb


---------84:48----------
you can't control anything in there


---------84:50----------
because you can't feel it you're not


---------84:51----------
aware of it


---------84:52----------
you don't even know where your tongue is


---------84:56----------
and so once you become aware of


---------84:57----------
something


---------84:59----------
then you can do something about it


---------85:06----------
okay does that how do i


---------85:10----------
how do i do that with social anxiety


---------85:17----------
same way it's just it can be harder


---------85:21----------
right so you're like so i'm helping you


---------85:23----------
do it and your mind is in a very


---------85:26----------
aware state right now and you're going


---------85:28----------
to be exhausted after this i'm going to


---------85:30----------
be exhausted too


---------85:32----------
yeah and


---------85:35----------
and then what happens is like you're


---------85:37----------
going to do it again and you're going to


---------85:39----------
do it again and you may have someone to


---------85:40----------
help you like


---------85:41----------
therapists may be a good idea in your


---------85:43----------
case


---------85:45----------
if you don't have one already and then


---------85:47----------
you're going to practice this


---------85:49----------
and then what's going to happen is like


---------85:50----------
maybe when it comes to


---------85:52----------
[Music]


---------85:53----------
you know but i think in social anxiety


---------85:55----------
it's the same


---------85:56----------
like you're going to notice yourself


---------85:58----------
catastrophizing you're going to notice


---------86:00----------
yourself like you're you're like


---------86:01----------
someone's going to invite you over


---------86:04----------
and then you're going to have that


---------86:05----------
thought pop in your head oh they don't


---------86:06----------
actually want to see you


---------86:08----------
they just want your 20 quid and then


---------86:10----------
you're going to notice that thought


---------86:12----------
you're going to be like no


---------86:12----------
actually that's not true they do want to


---------86:16----------
see me


---------86:17----------
yeah so it's the same thing


---------86:20----------
sometimes the stakes can feel higher and


---------86:23----------
so it can be harder to overcome there


---------86:24----------
certainly is like level one level two


---------86:26----------
level three level four


---------86:27----------
in terms of difficulty but it's the same


---------86:36----------
i yeah so something happened like


---------86:39----------
a couple weeks ago where um


---------86:43----------
i like um everyone at the moment


---------86:47----------
playing this game among us right and a


---------86:49----------
couple weeks ago


---------86:51----------
uh i'm in all these lobbies and i tried


---------86:53----------
to join this


---------86:54----------
this random one and there were the


---------86:56----------
streamers in there who i


---------86:58----------
i thought i was friends with so i felt


---------87:00----------
comfortable going in there


---------87:02----------
i was only in it for like like maybe


---------87:04----------
three


---------87:05----------
three games um but i just i had this


---------87:09----------
really


---------87:10----------
embarrassing moment where i went into


---------87:12----------
this


---------87:13----------
school and like


---------87:16----------
in my head this was a disaster but in


---------87:19----------
the call


---------87:20----------
it i i couldn't imagine anyone in there


---------87:23----------
probably doesn't remember this at all


---------87:25----------
um but there was this one guy who was


---------87:28----------
calling everyone by their names


---------87:30----------
and then he was calling me by my color


---------87:33----------
instead of my name


---------87:34----------
kept calling me orange instead of poop


---------87:37----------
noodle and it really


---------87:39----------
upset me and


---------87:42----------
um eventually i was like hey my name is


---------87:45----------
pooper noodle


---------87:47----------
and then it's like it looks like a


---------87:49----------
little bit of a lull it went a little


---------87:50----------
bit quiet and then everyone just carried


---------87:52----------
on


---------87:52----------
um but after that i i couldn't say


---------87:56----------
again i just i closed closed the game


---------87:58----------
left core i didn't want to make a scene


---------87:59----------
i was like i gotta go


---------88:00----------
uh and and then i i just i spent like


---------88:04----------
the rest of the day just crying


---------88:05----------
about it about about just getting called


---------88:07----------
orange


---------88:08----------
uh and it's it was pathetic


---------88:16----------
okay so i i'm guessing that the reason


---------88:18----------
you brought that up


---------88:19----------
is because we're gonna use this as a


---------88:22----------
case for understanding


---------88:24----------
is that okay let's analyze it okay


---------88:29----------
is that that's what i'm seeing


---------88:33----------
is the clearest relevance to me is that


---------88:35----------
okay


---------88:36----------
yes i think it's a great example i think


---------88:38----------
it's a beautiful example i think it ties


---------88:40----------
together everything we've been talking


---------88:41----------
about today


---------88:43----------
so what would you rather have than


---------88:44----------
happiness


---------88:48----------
we were talking about this right


---------88:51----------
because you felt stupid because you


---------88:53----------
wanted


---------88:54----------
i wouldn't want it to be believed yeah


---------88:58----------
right so this goes back to this idea


---------89:00----------
that there's like two kinds of blues


---------89:03----------
there's the real lou and then there's


---------89:05----------
the loo that everyone else sees


---------89:08----------
there's a part of you that yearns to be


---------89:10----------
seen and accepted


---------89:12----------
and you're willing to sacrifice that


---------89:14----------
part for the most


---------89:16----------
most of the time but there are some


---------89:18----------
things that you're not willing to


---------89:19----------
compromise on


---------89:21----------
does that make sense yeah this is like


---------89:23----------
this is like the real you that's like


---------89:25----------
fighting to say i don't have blue


---------89:27----------
nipples


---------89:28----------
i am a good person i'm worth more than


---------89:31----------
six donuts


---------89:32----------
and deodorant you know yeah i'm a cool


---------89:35----------
person like it's not about popularity or


---------89:37----------
anything like that but like i'm a good


---------89:38----------
person and i deserve to be seen


---------89:41----------
i deserve to be treated and judged for


---------89:43----------
who i am


---------89:45----------
as opposed to who people think i am


---------89:51----------
that's why that person isn't gonna take


---------89:53----------
orange from anyone


---------89:55----------
you're not gonna you're not gonna be


---------89:58----------
orange


---------90:01----------
do you want them to see who you are


---------90:08----------
yeah so i think it's that same part of


---------90:12----------
you


---------90:13----------
and it speaks up it says damn you


---------90:17----------
i'm pooper noodle and i would like you


---------90:19----------
to address me as such


---------90:22----------
right and then something really funny


---------90:24----------
happens like so when you do that and you


---------90:26----------
stand up for yourself


---------90:28----------
when you tell the driver to pull over


---------90:30----------
because your seat belt isn't on


---------90:33----------
then it runs very contrary to all of


---------90:36----------
this programming


---------90:39----------
which is like you've been telling


---------90:40----------
yourself you've practiced really really


---------90:42----------
hard you've leveled up a lot


---------90:44----------
in terms of devaluing yourself but


---------90:46----------
there's this part of you that's like


---------90:48----------
is trying to break through this like


---------90:50----------
hard soil and like start to bloom


---------90:52----------
which is like who you really are and


---------90:55----------
then sometimes it pops its head up and


---------90:57----------
then you enter this


---------90:58----------
period of intense conflict because it


---------91:01----------
runs


---------91:01----------
against all of the programming that


---------91:03----------
you've been doing


---------91:04----------
which is no no no they get to call you


---------91:07----------
whatever they want lou


---------91:09----------
why are you inconveniencing them with


---------91:12----------
your name


---------91:13----------
yeah yeah how dare you


---------91:18----------
how dare you inconvenience them


---------91:21----------
and so it's like like there's a this


---------91:22----------
part of you that wants to come up and


---------91:24----------
then there's this part of you and then


---------91:25----------
then you're crying all day because like


---------91:28----------
then it like then you're just kind of


---------91:29----------
conflicted


---------91:31----------
and that takes time to sort of work


---------91:33----------
through right and that too comes with


---------91:34----------
distance


---------91:36----------
with sort of taking taking a step back


---------91:37----------
and recognizing what's going on


---------91:40----------
recognizing that for a long time this


---------91:42----------
part of you that


---------91:44----------
knocked yourself down also i know this


---------91:47----------
sounds really bizarre


---------91:48----------
also protected you


---------91:52----------
because if you knock yourself down and


---------91:55----------
you hurt yourself


---------91:56----------
no one can do can out do you


---------92:00----------
and if you're the one knocking yourself


---------92:01----------
down at least you're in control


---------92:06----------
and what you want more than anything


---------92:07----------
else is control


---------92:10----------
yeah stacked up pillows against the door


---------92:13----------
and listening what are you doing you're


---------92:14----------
trying to get control


---------92:16----------
you're trying to control the


---------92:17----------
circumstances


---------92:22----------
so this is the hard thing about anxiety


---------92:24----------
you gotta let go of control


---------92:27----------
you gotta let people judge you and it's


---------92:29----------
terrifying


---------92:31----------
yeah i care a lot about other people's


---------92:35----------
opinions like like way too much


---------92:38----------
so let me ask you a crazy question


---------92:40----------
what's harder


---------92:42----------
knowing that everyone doesn't like you


---------92:45----------
or not knowing if everyone doesn't like


---------92:47----------
you


---------92:50----------
not knowing right no it's weird


---------92:55----------
yeah anxiety is a strange beast in that


---------92:59----------
way


---------93:01----------
you're looking for certainty even you'll


---------93:03----------
take you'll take a certain


---------93:05----------
bad thing over an uncertain bad thing


---------93:09----------
yeah which is like then how the [ __ ]


---------93:12----------
like no wonder you feel the way that you


---------93:16----------
do


---------93:17----------
because it's like i give you two choices


---------93:19----------
100 chance of failure


---------93:21----------
50 chance of failure which one do you


---------93:24----------
pick


---------93:24----------
you pick for 100 yeah


---------93:28----------
and then it's like no wonder you're


---------93:30----------
where you are


---------93:32----------
yeah but it takes courage to take the


---------93:35----------
50.


---------93:36----------
people look at that and they say you're


---------93:37----------
stupid for picking 100 chance of failure


---------93:39----------
no they just don't understand that's not


---------93:40----------
how psychology works you're not stupid


---------93:42----------
it's that


---------93:43----------
the other way to think about it is


---------93:44----------
control versus not control


---------93:46----------
and are you stupid for picking control


---------93:52----------
right yeah


---------93:56----------
yes i don't know what the answer was


---------94:00----------
yeah i don't know sorry this this is


---------94:02----------
where i get too abstract


---------94:06----------
some people follow me some people can't


---------94:08----------
it's not a big deal it's more on me than


---------94:09----------
it is on you


---------94:11----------
okay but does that make sense where you


---------94:13----------
you sort of at least when you beat


---------94:15----------
yourself up


---------94:15----------
you control the pain yeah and you can


---------94:18----------
survive that you're used to that


---------94:21----------
yes so i think the orange story is a


---------94:24----------
great one


---------94:25----------
because i think it's sort of like you


---------94:27----------
know you kind of fight against yourself


---------94:29----------
and then like that thing comes


---------94:31----------
roaring back and so the next time i


---------94:33----------
would say the next time you stand up for


---------94:34----------
yourself


---------94:36----------
be aware that the part of you that


---------94:39----------
has made yourself a pushover so that


---------94:42----------
other people will like you


---------94:44----------
will be very upset there's one part of


---------94:47----------
you that's like


---------94:48----------
i'm going to let other people do


---------94:49----------
whatever the [ __ ] they want to me


---------94:50----------
because then they'll like me


---------94:54----------
and then there's another part of you


---------94:55----------
that's like nah


---------94:58----------
because you were upset that everything


---------95:00----------
went quiet


---------95:01----------
yeah oh my god


---------95:05----------
i inconvenienced them i'm sorry lady


---------95:08----------
who's doing my nails that you're putting


---------95:09----------
me into physical pain


---------95:11----------
did i inconvenience you by telling you


---------95:13----------
that you're physically hurting me and my


---------95:14----------
nails are bleeding


---------95:15----------
i'm so sorry


---------95:19----------
yeah yeah um


---------95:23----------
that's exactly what goes on yep and if


---------95:26----------
you


---------95:27----------
if you would have told her then what


---------95:28----------
would you do to yourself afterward


---------95:36----------
what do you think would happen if you


---------95:37----------
told her to stop


---------95:41----------
i had i'd been thinking about like


---------95:44----------
how awkward it was that i had to tell


---------95:46----------
her just to stop and then i'd be like


---------95:48----------
analyzing her face like was she sad


---------95:50----------
about it was she upset that she was


---------95:52----------
doing her nails


---------95:52----------
my nails badly i'm terrified of like uh


---------95:56----------
confrontation


---------95:57----------
[Music]


---------95:59----------
and you'd be torturing yourself yeah


---------96:03----------
you see so anytime lou tries to break


---------96:06----------
out of the surface


---------96:08----------
there comes anxiety it's like how dare


---------96:11----------
you


---------96:13----------
how dare you be a person lou how dare


---------96:15----------
you have feelings


---------96:17----------
how dare you have value


---------96:35----------
thoughts questions okay


---------96:41----------

---------96:44----------
yep at all i think we're close to being


---------96:47----------

i can't already for bed yeah


---------97:04----------
wait do i look tired there it is


---------97:09----------
no i i can tell you that you're


---------97:11----------
cognitively spent


---------97:13----------
okay i'm cognitively spent too


---------97:16----------
how do you feel about me saying that


---------97:22----------
bad yeah see


---------97:25----------
that's okay is that not a bad thing


---------97:29----------
do you normally get cognitively spent


---------97:32----------
yes


---------97:33----------
okay i'm out of mana


---------97:37----------
you're out of mana we've been casting


---------97:40----------
spells for a while


---------97:41----------
that doesn't make us bad people it


---------97:42----------
doesn't make us weak it doesn't make us


---------97:44----------
stupid it just means we're out of mana


---------97:45----------
we've been doing this [ __ ] for like an


---------97:48----------
hour and a half now


---------97:51----------
oh wow yeah yeah


---------97:54----------
straining your wealth your cognitive


---------97:57----------
straining your brain for an hour and a


---------97:59----------
half is gonna make you um


---------98:02----------
yeah do you want to learn how to


---------98:05----------
meditate


---------98:07----------
um oh okay


---------98:11----------
well then what was that ooh


---------98:16----------
um


---------98:19----------
i've tried to do it meditation before


---------98:23----------
um but two


---------98:27----------
things i'm very lazy and also


---------98:31----------
um i


---------98:35----------
i find that it doesn't maybe i've not


---------98:38----------
been doing it for long enough


---------98:39----------
but it doesn't it doesn't quite turn


---------98:42----------
down


---------98:42----------
my my thoughts i've i'm terrified of


---------98:45----------
being alone


---------98:46----------
with them yeah


---------98:51----------
okay i think that's


---------98:54----------
reasonable can i think for a second


---------99:10----------
yes


---------99:19----------
i may need longer than a second i may


---------99:21----------
need a minute or two


---------99:23----------
oh okay do you


---------99:27----------
do you want to do if you don't want to


---------99:29----------
learn how to meditate we don't have to


---------99:30----------
do anything


---------99:32----------
first okay okay


---------99:35----------
what do you think what's the second


---------99:38----------
thing


---------99:39----------
is if you do want to learn something


---------99:41----------
then i'll try to teach you something


---------99:44----------
i'm wondering if if you're going to take


---------99:45----------
the out for both of us because i'm not


---------99:47----------
sure what to teach you


---------99:48----------
but i'll figure something i have an idea


---------99:50----------
i oh


---------99:51----------
i i i just i i


---------99:54----------
feel like i'm doing it wrong because


---------99:56----------
it's supposed to help isn't it and it


---------99:57----------
just


---------99:58----------
makes things worse is it


---------100:01----------
am i doing it i've thought maybe


---------100:05----------
no you're you're not doing it wrong


---------100:07----------
you're being taught the wrong kind of


---------100:09----------
meditation


---------100:10----------
okay okay right it's kind of like if i


---------100:14----------
walk into the shoe store


---------100:17----------
and i put on a pair of shoes that's my


---------100:19----------
size


---------100:20----------
the problem isn't that my feet are or


---------100:22----------
like let's say i


---------100:24----------
put on a pair of shoes it's too big the


---------100:26----------
problem isn't that my feet are too small


---------100:27----------
it's that the shoe isn't the right size


---------100:28----------
right you have to do meditation that


---------100:30----------
fits


---------100:30----------
for your mind so i'm just trying to


---------100:33----------
think about what have you tried


---------100:34----------
do you like what kind of meditation


---------100:36----------
doesn't help let's start there


---------100:38----------
um


---------100:42----------
mindfulness yep mindfulness is going to


---------100:44----------
be terrible for you


---------100:46----------
oh like mindfully


---------100:50----------
eating and like looking at a little


---------100:53----------
grape


---------100:54----------
so let me okay


---------101:00----------
um so so let's let's think about why


---------101:03----------
mindfulness is not gonna i mean


---------101:05----------
we can do a mindfulness practice if you


---------101:07----------
want but mindfulness


---------101:08----------
tends to be sitting back and observing


---------101:11----------
there are two kinds of meditation


---------101:13----------
there's a focusing meditation and an


---------101:14----------
observing meditation


---------101:16----------
one is where you watch what your mind


---------101:18----------
does


---------101:20----------
and then the second is when you tell


---------101:22----------
your mind to do something


---------101:25----------
so in your case if you're feeling like


---------101:27----------
pretty anxious i think there are a


---------101:29----------
couple of breathing techniques that


---------101:30----------
could help you


---------101:32----------
but i sort of feel like breathing


---------101:33----------
techniques isn't the right fit bizarrely


---------101:35----------
i want to teach you something like a


---------101:36----------
mindfulness practice


---------101:38----------
but i want to teach you a very


---------101:39----------
structured one okay even though i


---------101:41----------
don't think it's really great for you


---------101:43----------
but we're going to try something because


---------101:44----------
i think you actually have a talent for


---------101:45----------
it in a particular


---------101:46----------
way we try something a little bit


---------101:48----------
unusual


---------101:50----------
yeah okay um i reserve the right for


---------101:52----------
this to not work


---------101:54----------
and then i want to be able to try to


---------101:55----------
teach you something else


---------101:57----------
okay that okay yeah i want you to close


---------102:00----------
your eyes


---------102:01----------
okay okay so today lou we've been


---------102:04----------
talking about


---------102:07----------
the different programs in your mind


---------102:11----------
right so like there's like the lou that


---------102:13----------
wants to come forward and like wants to


---------102:15----------
be believed wants to be seen wants to be


---------102:17----------
heard


---------102:18----------
and there's the lou that tries to swap


---------102:20----------
her down


---------102:22----------
yeah so what i'm gonna do is i want you


---------102:25----------
to watch carefully now


---------102:26----------
i'm to make a statement and i want you


---------102:29----------
to eyes


---------102:30----------
nope okay how do i pay attention listen


---------102:33----------
good point like i said i deserve to [ __ ]


---------102:36----------
this one up


---------102:37----------
i mean i i reserve the right to [ __ ]


---------102:38----------
this one up okay


---------102:40----------
um so i want you to listen carefully to


---------102:43----------
what i say


---------102:43----------
and i want you to watch your mind and


---------102:45----------
watch your mind's response


---------102:48----------
okay and just notice for a second i'm


---------102:51----------
just gonna speak


---------102:51----------
words but that those words they're just


---------102:54----------
words it's like


---------102:56----------
you know my name is red


---------103:00----------
i like balloons words are words they


---------103:02----------
have no meaning


---------103:04----------
but i want you to see how the words that


---------103:06----------
i speak


---------103:07----------
are going to evoke responses in your


---------103:09----------
mind


---------103:11----------
okay and tell me what the responses are


---------103:14----------
ready


---------103:16----------
yeah you are a wonderful person


---------103:23----------
do i do i tell you yeah tell me


---------103:27----------
what happens in your mind when i say


---------103:28----------
that


---------103:30----------
um


---------103:35----------
just trying to be nice that you are


---------103:38----------
trying to be nice what happens


---------103:40----------
eyes closed oh sorry okay


---------103:43----------
uh whoever saying that just trying to be


---------103:46----------
nice to me okay


---------103:47----------
so so you notice how your mind responded


---------103:49----------
to that right


---------103:50----------
yeah you swatted it down


---------103:55----------
yeah okay now number two


---------103:58----------
you are a terrible person


---------104:02----------
what does your mind do in response to


---------104:03----------
that um


---------104:05----------
[Music]


---------104:08----------
true okay


---------104:12----------
so that's kind of interesting right you


---------104:13----------
see how your mind responds


---------104:14----------
differentially to those statements


---------104:18----------
yeah so now what i want you to do is try


---------104:22----------
to figure out


---------104:23----------
where do those thoughts come from


---------104:34----------
uh you're not going to be able to


---------104:37----------
so just give me what you got when i tell


---------104:40----------
you to


---------104:40----------
figure out where they come from what


---------104:42----------
happens what how can you look for where


---------104:44----------
they come from


---------104:49----------
i don't know they just come from from me


---------104:53----------
okay so where from you good


---------104:58----------
um


---------105:01----------
i i don't know okay good


---------105:05----------
would it okay so good so you're doing it


---------105:07----------
right i know it sounds weird


---------105:08----------
so now i want you to think about so when


---------105:10----------
i say you're a wonderful person


---------105:12----------
try to find wonderfulness within you


---------105:15----------
okay


---------105:16----------
do you have wonderfulness anywhere in


---------105:18----------
you um


---------105:29----------
yeah where


---------105:33----------
um


---------105:33----------
[Music]


---------105:39----------
i really like dogs okay


---------105:44----------
and now so so where do you feel that


---------105:49----------
right is that a is it a thought or a


---------105:51----------
feeling first of all


---------105:52----------
that's a feeling and what does that feel


---------105:55----------
like


---------105:56----------
wonderful and where does it where do you


---------105:59----------
how


---------106:00----------
how can you know that you're feeling


---------106:01----------
wonderfulness


---------106:07----------
what is your experience of wonderful


---------106:13----------
um


---------106:17----------
is there a right answer sort of not


---------106:20----------
really


---------106:22----------
i've i have no idea okay good


---------106:26----------
okay now i'm going to tell you something


---------106:27----------
else are you starting to feel


---------106:29----------
self-conscious


---------106:30----------
yeah because my eyes are closed good


---------106:33----------
notice that self-consciousness


---------106:34----------
where is that feeling where is that


---------106:38----------
feeling


---------106:41----------
everywhere good what does it feel like


---------106:44----------
tell me


---------106:47----------
um


---------106:51----------
like like i'm like i'm gonna fall off a


---------106:55----------
building or something


---------106:56----------
yep so so there's a sensation right


---------107:00----------
of like something terrible is about to


---------107:03----------
happen


---------107:04----------
notice the lack of safety with your eyes


---------107:07----------
being closed


---------107:09----------
yeah it's like what are people thinking


---------107:12----------
what is he doing what's his face doing


---------107:14----------
oh my god what do they think i don't


---------107:16----------
even know where the computer is


---------107:17----------
am i sitting in the right place yeah so


---------107:19----------
you're so notice that the


---------107:21----------
though all of those thoughts actually


---------107:22----------
come from the feeling not the other way


---------107:24----------
around


---------107:25----------
i want you to notice the vulnerability


---------107:27----------
is generating thoughts in your mind


---------107:30----------
does that make sense it's almost like a


---------107:32----------
fountain that's just generating all


---------107:33----------
these [ __ ] random thoughts like


---------107:34----------
is my camera still on am i sitting in


---------107:37----------
the right place


---------107:38----------
what are they thinking what are they


---------107:40----------
saying like you see how it's like it's


---------107:41----------
like a fountain it's just spewing out


---------107:42----------
these random ass thoughts


---------107:44----------
yeah like but somewhere there's a


---------107:47----------
feeling within you


---------107:51----------
notice that vulnerability you may feel


---------107:54----------
it somewhere in your body what do you


---------107:55----------
feel in your body


---------108:07----------
um


---------108:10----------
but what can can can you can you repeat


---------108:13----------
the question


---------108:14----------
yeah what do you feel in your body right


---------108:16----------
now what does


---------108:17----------
vulnerability feel like in your body


---------108:20----------
uh i'm sweating okay good what else


---------108:26----------
um pay attention to your


---------108:29----------
throat your chest


---------108:33----------
heart stomach


---------108:37----------
um


---------108:41----------
i feel a bit dizzy


---------108:44----------
okay so now i want you to in a moment


---------108:47----------
i'm going to ask you to open your eyes


---------108:49----------
but before i do that i want you to take


---------108:51----------
a snapshot of the way


---------108:53----------
take a screenshot of the way that you


---------108:55----------
feel and then we're going to open your


---------108:57----------
eyes


---------108:57----------
and we're going to see how you feel


---------108:59----------
afterward open


---------109:00----------
okay what's happening


---------109:06----------
oh my god that's so weird where am i


---------109:11----------
what's weird tell me i can see


---------109:18----------
uh everything's much


---------109:22----------
smaller than i imagined it okay


---------109:26----------
so by smaller you mean your fears right


---------109:31----------
i mean the room okay


---------109:34----------
cool things are smaller


---------109:38----------
okay yeah awesome that means you're


---------109:40----------
doing it right


---------109:42----------
so okay what about your fears


---------109:46----------
that yeah that too so interesting


---------109:50----------
so now we're gonna do it again i know


---------109:51----------
we're at both oom but


---------109:53----------
raid boss is at 10 we're going to keep


---------109:55----------
going you ready


---------109:57----------
yeah close your eyes again okay


---------110:03----------
what comes up


---------110:08----------
um


---------110:10----------
i can't see again there we go good so


---------110:13----------
notice that you can't see again


---------110:15----------
so things are getting bigger yeah your


---------110:18----------
fears are magnifying


---------110:23----------
the room is getting bigger


---------110:30----------
just notice that all of that stuff for a


---------110:33----------
moment


---------110:34----------
right notice how bad it feels


---------110:38----------
and now open your eyes


---------110:44----------
and now what's happening


---------110:48----------
it's gone away what's gone away the


---------110:53----------
scariness okay


---------110:56----------
so guess what you just learned how to do


---------111:00----------
was was that meditation


---------111:03----------
nope yeah sure you just learned to make


---------111:06----------
the scariness go away in meditation


---------111:08----------
technique


---------111:09----------
that's what we're going to call it okay


---------111:12----------
but


---------111:12----------
i i want you to really pay attention so


---------111:14----------
you can try this i think this is


---------111:16----------
actually a good technique for you


---------111:17----------
so i want you to just this is going to


---------111:19----------
be your technique i don't know that's


---------111:21----------
going to work for anyone else


---------111:22----------
but what i want you to notice and you


---------111:24----------
got to tell me if i'm wrong


---------111:25----------
okay lou you can't please just don't


---------111:27----------
tell me what i want to hear


---------111:29----------
what i want you to notice is that the


---------111:31----------
size of your fears


---------111:34----------
grows and shrinks


---------111:38----------
depending on what your eyes being open


---------111:42----------
or closed


---------111:44----------
yeah how vulnerable i am [ __ ] dumb


---------111:49----------
your eyes being opened and closed has


---------111:51----------
nothing to do with the fears in the


---------111:53----------
world


---------111:54----------
has to do with your feelings has to do


---------111:58----------
with your sense of vulnerability


---------112:00----------
but the fear is the fear the fear the


---------112:02----------
actual probability that something bad


---------112:04----------
happens is not going to change


---------112:06----------
it's not going to alter wildly in the


---------112:08----------
span of 90 seconds whether you're doing


---------112:10----------
this or doing this


---------112:12----------
does that make sense yeah but


---------112:16----------
how does it feel


---------112:20----------
it feels like the fears become bigger


---------112:24----------
even the roof becomes bigger the


---------112:26----------
microphone is like in your face right


---------112:30----------
like everything is like pressing in on


---------112:33----------
you


---------112:35----------
with your eyes closed and so what you're


---------112:37----------
doing is like the world is like


---------112:38----------
coming in and then you open them and it


---------112:41----------
zooms out


---------112:43----------
everything feels smaller bigger smaller


---------112:46----------
bigger smaller


---------112:50----------
and so if you do this practice so you


---------112:52----------
start by doing it by yourself


---------112:54----------
and then if there's someone that you


---------112:55----------
trust do it with them in the room


---------112:58----------
and it's going to make it way harder


---------113:03----------
and then go and do it in the public


---------113:05----------
place


---------113:06----------
oh no right


---------113:09----------
but here's the here's the crazy thing


---------113:11----------
blue like stay with me now okay


---------113:13----------
try really hard you with me do your best


---------113:16----------
yay all you're doing is


---------113:19----------
opening and closing your [ __ ] eyes


---------113:23----------
the world doesn't change that rapidly


---------113:27----------
do you see how your fears will literally


---------113:29----------
grow or shrink


---------113:31----------
depending whether on whether your eyes


---------113:32----------
are open or closed


---------113:36----------
but what if i get hit by a car well i


---------113:39----------
mean


---------113:41----------
okay so let's work let's not worry about


---------113:42----------
the public place yet


---------113:44----------
let's just focus on in the room and with


---------113:46----------
one person you trust


---------113:48----------
okay okay i mean what if you get hit by


---------113:50----------
a car


---------113:51----------
i i'm not saying you do it while you're


---------113:54----------
driving okay


---------113:57----------
i'm saying like like if you have a


---------113:59----------
balcony


---------114:01----------
like go out onto the balcony or


---------114:04----------
something like that


---------114:06----------
okay but what what i really i don't know


---------114:09----------
if you're


---------114:09----------
getting this or not which is fine


---------114:11----------
because i know you're um and i'm out of


---------114:12----------
um so i'm asking a lot of you


---------114:13----------
but what i want you to notice is that


---------114:15----------
literally your fears can


---------114:17----------
grow or shrink depending on what your


---------114:19----------
eyelids are doing


---------114:22----------
and do you see how like that's just not


---------114:24----------
literally like how the world works


---------114:28----------
like my chances of getting hit by a car


---------114:30----------
don't inc well maybe they do increase or


---------114:32----------
decrease if my eyes are closed but


---------114:34----------
bad example or a good example on your


---------114:36----------
part real five-head player


---------114:38----------
but generally speaking you know the fear


---------114:41----------
or your value as a human being or all of


---------114:43----------
these other things that you're worried


---------114:44----------
about shouldn't change over the


---------114:46----------
span of 60 seconds if you open or close


---------114:48----------
your eyes does that make sense


---------114:51----------
yeah but the feeling changes rapidly


---------114:57----------
and so if you do this practice literally


---------114:59----------
what you're going to


---------115:01----------
gain is control over your fear


---------115:05----------
you're gonna learn the process of


---------115:07----------
shrinking your fears


---------115:09----------
or growing them and you're gonna see how


---------115:11----------
the mind shrinks fears and grows them


---------115:20----------
and as you learn that you're gonna get


---------115:23----------
literally you're gonna get control over


---------115:25----------
your fear


---------115:26----------
because you'll learn cognitively how to


---------115:28----------
shrink it


---------115:29----------
it's like a shrink-a-matic for your


---------115:31----------
fears


---------115:32----------
i like that


---------115:36----------
so and even if what i'm saying to you


---------115:37----------
right now doesn't make sense that's okay


---------115:39----------
it doesn't need to make sense right now


---------115:41----------
just do the practice do it a couple


---------115:42----------
times a week just like go and like close


---------115:44----------
your eyes and just


---------115:45----------
notice like it's like closing your eyes


---------115:46----------
is like opening the doors to your fears


---------115:48----------
and then opening them is like putting


---------115:50----------
them all away


---------115:53----------
yeah and yet it's still you still have


---------115:56----------
within


---------115:56----------
you the capacity of putting them all


---------115:58----------
away


---------116:02----------
yeah questions i really like that


---------116:05----------
no that's that's that sounds much better


---------116:08----------
than


---------116:09----------
what i was doing before


---------116:12----------
um yeah yeah


---------116:17----------
yeah you i think i'm glad it worked i


---------116:19----------
don't i guess i don't have to come up


---------116:21----------
with a backup then


---------116:22----------
oh i'm sorry


---------116:26----------
no because i just i didn't know because


---------116:27----------
it's it's a it's it's actually like a


---------116:29----------
high level meditation technique


---------116:31----------
it's not like a novice meditation oh


---------116:34----------
yeah does that make me an


---------116:37----------
expert in meditation


---------116:41----------
what does that thought evoke in you


---------116:46----------
if i were to tell you lou you were an


---------116:48----------
expert at meditation


---------116:51----------
what happens um


---------116:55----------
i don't know it'd be pretty cool yes so


---------116:58----------
the short answer is yes


---------117:00----------
yeah let me explain it to you this way


---------117:03----------
you spend so much time


---------117:04----------
in your head so you're actually going to


---------117:07----------
be pretty good at meditation


---------117:12----------
yeah right because from a very young age


---------117:15----------
when other people were


---------117:16----------
interacting with the outside world who


---------117:18----------
were you interacting with


---------117:20----------
me so you started leveling up meditation


---------117:23----------
very young


---------117:27----------
you've leveled up a skill you just


---------117:28----------
haven't found the right gear until today


---------117:31----------
okay oh and so practice it


---------117:35----------
okay any closing thoughts or questions


---------117:38----------
before we wrap up for the day


---------117:41----------
um um


---------117:46----------
how do i not care about


---------117:50----------
what other people think of me you do


---------117:52----------
care about what other people think about


---------117:54----------
you


---------117:54----------
you don't not care you just let yourself


---------117:56----------
care


---------117:57----------
caring is fine what i want you to learn


---------118:00----------
lou is not to not


---------118:02----------
care what other people think it's to


---------118:03----------
gain distance from the caring


---------118:08----------
okay right


---------118:11----------
you're allowed to care what other people


---------118:12----------
think


---------118:14----------
but it doesn't have to control who you


---------118:18----------
are


---------118:21----------
okay you're perfect the way you are


---------118:25----------
you don't need to change you just need


---------118:27----------
perspective on who you are


---------118:32----------
now it's a weird concept


---------118:40----------
okay do you feel like he's just saying


---------118:42----------
that


---------118:44----------
uh


---------118:47----------
i don't know just it was just quite nice


---------118:50----------
and yeah now i'm crying i don't know why


---------118:53----------
so that's pretty so you know what's cool


---------118:54----------
about that


---------118:55----------
is i just called you perfect


---------118:58----------
and your mind didn't respond with he's


---------119:01----------
just saying that


---------119:03----------
you were able to feel it it was able to


---------119:05----------
sink in


---------119:07----------
and i'm not saying it to be nice i think


---------119:09----------
it's genuinely true


---------119:11----------
i think you're amazing exactly how you


---------119:13----------
are


---------119:15----------
and that your life has been a confluence


---------119:18----------
of circumstances


---------119:19----------
to make you into a perfect and unique


---------119:22----------
human being


---------119:24----------
and that just because you have flaws


---------119:26----------
doesn't mean that you aren't perfect


---------119:28----------
and that's part of life it's part of the


---------119:30----------
journey of growth


---------119:35----------
and i wish you all the best thank you


---------119:39----------
