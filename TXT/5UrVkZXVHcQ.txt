---------00:00----------
let's get started okay so today is day 8


---------00:04----------
and 10 today we are gonna talk about


---------00:09----------
fear or not theories really models of


---------00:17----------
mind so the goal of today is to talk a


---------00:21----------
little bit about you can see that okay


---------00:22----------
okay you know what are the different


---------00:26----------
ways that we can understand how our mind


---------00:28----------
works like what are the different models


---------00:30----------
we can use to understand the system of


---------00:32----------
mind so we're gonna start with first by


---------00:35----------
talking about Western models of mind


---------00:36----------
[Music]


---------00:39----------
then we're gonna talk about ethics


---------00:43----------
psychology and then hopefully we'll do


---------00:48----------
like a little bit of kind of exercises


---------00:50----------
to think through these things so let's


---------00:52----------
start with Western models okay Western


---------00:57----------
models so the first thing is oh the


---------01:01----------
third thing is gonna be like practical


---------01:03----------
applications okay


---------01:10----------
so Western models the first thing is


---------01:12----------
that the Western model of the mind


---------01:13----------
basically has a couple of components so


---------01:16----------
the first kind of model that we can


---------01:18----------
think about is conscious subconscious


---------01:28----------
or unconscious and some people will


---------01:32----------
actually put the unconscious is separate


---------01:36----------
from the subconscious they'll actually


---------01:38----------
say that this actually goes here I think


---------01:41----------
it really doesn't matter so this sort of


---------01:44----------
posits that you have I think the best


---------01:46----------
way to understand this is you have


---------01:48----------
thoughts and then you have the place


---------01:53----------
that thoughts come from okay


---------02:02----------
and that's basically like the Western


---------02:05----------
model of the mind right like so we say


---------02:07----------
that we have our unconscious mind or


---------02:08----------
subconscious mind which is where like


---------02:10----------
particular thoughts are just going to


---------02:11----------
come from and you know it's it's there's


---------02:15----------
not really a clear sense of how


---------02:18----------
conscious mind and subconscious mind or


---------02:20----------
unconscious mind interact you can't


---------02:22----------
really use conscious mind to control


---------02:24----------
unconscious mind it's a little bit you


---------02:28----------
know it's sort of this general


---------02:29----------
observation that there's a part of the


---------02:30----------
mind that is not active and then there's


---------02:33----------
a part of the mind that is active or


---------02:34----------
noticeable and that's kind of it


---------02:38----------
this stuff was sort of developed by


---------02:40----------
Western psychologists especially people


---------02:42----------
like Freud and Jung although it's very


---------02:45----------
possible that earlier philosophers kind


---------02:47----------
of you know notice this as well so let's


---------02:49----------
talk about sort of the central Freudian


---------02:52----------
model before we get to the good stuff


---------02:56----------
okay


---------02:56----------
so Freud posited that our mind this was


---------02:59----------
really his biggest contribution kind of


---------03:01----------
I mean one of the biggest contributions


---------03:02----------
was sort of the acknowledgment that we


---------03:05----------
have an unconscious mind before Freud


---------03:07----------
people didn't really think about the


---------03:09----------
unconscious as a thing whereas now we


---------03:11----------
all sort of accept it


---------03:13----------
and that was largely Freud's


---------03:15----------
contribution so the other thing that


---------03:17----------
Freud sort of talked about is that we


---------03:19----------
have something called the ED we have


---------03:23----------
something called the ego and we


---------03:25----------
essentially have something called the


---------03:26----------
super-ego and the way that he defined


---------03:29----------
these is the it'd is our impulses


---------03:34----------
instincts


---------03:36----------
so like these are the kinds of like if I


---------03:38----------
smell a a hamburger cooking I'm gonna


---------03:40----------
want to eat it I may have sexual


---------03:43----------
impulses which he was a big fan of


---------03:45----------
talking about they're just basically


---------03:47----------
different kinds of like impulses or


---------03:48----------
desires that we have or super-ego is our


---------03:51----------
sense of morality or like sense of right


---------03:55----------
and wrong


---------03:57----------
so if I see like a hamburger being


---------04:01----------
cooked but from a street vendor I'm just


---------04:03----------
not gonna pick it up and eat it I'm


---------04:05----------
gonna sort of pay for it I'll you know


---------04:09----------
order one etc so this is sort of the


---------04:11----------
part of us that essentially controls


---------04:14----------
restrains our impulses so if we think


---------04:16----------
about it it's like pure impulsivity and


---------04:18----------
then control over here those are the it


---------04:21----------
and the the super-ego and then in the


---------04:23----------
middle is the ego which is sort of


---------04:26----------
mediates the interactions of it and


---------04:36----------
super-ego okay so the it is like in the


---------04:40----------
middle so if I have an impulse to eat a


---------04:42----------
hamburger but then there's a part of me


---------04:44----------
that says oh no you should pay for it


---------04:45----------
that the part that resolves that


---------04:48----------
conflict or manages those two sides is


---------04:50----------
the ego and so for example if we look at


---------04:54----------
people who are self critical or self


---------04:57----------
judgmental they're gonna have a lopsided


---------05:04----------
they're gonna have a super-ego that is


---------05:08----------
very strong and like stronger than let's


---------05:11----------
say the it'd or ego okay and then like


---------05:16----------
another person so sometimes when people


---------05:17----------
are depressed they really beat up on


---------05:19----------
themselves right so beating up yourself


---------05:26----------
is a strong super-ego


---------05:33----------
so that's like a quick way to kind of


---------05:35----------
understand it right so if we if I'm


---------05:37----------
really self-critical and notice that


---------05:39----------
like beating up yourself isn't


---------05:40----------
necessarily a bad thing I mean it is a


---------05:42----------
bad thing because you're gonna feel bad


---------05:44----------
but beating up yourself can actually


---------05:46----------
lead to like productivity and success


---------05:48----------
like academic success professional


---------05:50----------
success so sometimes some of these like


---------05:53----------
beating up yourself kind of


---------05:54----------
characteristics can be correlated with


---------05:56----------
like positive things in the real world


---------05:58----------
so that's an example of like a strong


---------06:02----------
super-ego so if someone is kind of like


---------06:05----------
animalistic so if someone is kind of


---------06:08----------
animalistic and what I mean by that or


---------06:10----------
maybe animalistic isn't the right word


---------06:12----------
hedonistic it's maybe a better word


---------06:16----------
that's kind of a situation where the


---------06:18----------
it'd is way stronger than the super-ego


---------06:23----------
or ego and then generally speaking what


---------06:28----------
Freud posited or what people after Freud


---------06:30----------
posited was that you know the stronger


---------06:32----------
your ego is the better off you're gonna


---------06:34----------
be


---------06:34----------
so like ego strength is sort of the


---------06:36----------
ability to sit with this like sit with


---------06:42----------
these two different parts of yourself


---------06:44----------
so hedonistic means pleasure-seeking I


---------06:47----------
don't know why I put quotes there right


---------06:52----------
so like you don't really have you just


---------06:54----------
do what feels fun or what feels good


---------06:56----------
like you don't eat healthy you eat


---------06:58----------
things that taste good you don't want to


---------07:01----------
work you don't want to do other things


---------07:02----------
like you're you're basically controlled


---------07:04----------
by your impulses okay so and then when


---------07:08----------
when these things are well balanced when


---------07:10----------
you have a strong ego it sort of manages


---------07:12----------
your moralistic side from your you're


---------07:15----------
like impulsive side and then you're


---------07:18----------
basically kind of a balanced human being


---------07:19----------
okay so that's one model so this is kind


---------07:22----------
of the Western model so let's go to the


---------07:23----------
Vedic model okay


---------07:29----------
so Vedic model of move this over a


---------07:43----------
little bit there we go okay so the first


---------07:52----------
thing that I want you guys to understand


---------07:53----------
about the Vedic model of mind and why


---------07:56----------
this is useful is that we have


---------08:01----------
conflicting thoughts so this is why I


---------08:07----------
like this model of the mind so generally


---------08:09----------
speaking if I decide that I'm gonna do


---------08:12----------
something there are other parts of my


---------08:15----------
mind that tell me that I'm not gonna do


---------08:16----------
this thing like if I say I'm gonna wake


---------08:18----------
up every day and I'm gonna do yoga


---------08:19----------
that's one part of your mind right so


---------08:22----------
I'm gonna do yoga every day I'm gonna


---------08:26----------
yoga great so that's the thought that


---------08:30----------
you have and there are all kinds of


---------08:31----------
other things in your mind that crop up


---------08:33----------
like how about we watch twitch right and


---------08:45----------
there are all kinds of things like I'm


---------08:47----------
not flexible


---------08:52----------
there are all kinds of thoughts that


---------08:53----------
kind of crop up so the question is like


---------08:55----------
how on earth does this work


---------08:57----------
why do we have conflicting thoughts in


---------08:59----------
our mind why doesn't our mind just make


---------09:01----------
a decision and do it right like this if


---------09:03----------
you stop and think about it we think


---------09:05----------
about the mind is one thing we think


---------09:06----------
about it is monolithic but if the mind


---------09:09----------
is one thing like why on earth do we


---------09:11----------
have contradictory thoughts like what is


---------09:13----------
up with that right it's not like we go


---------09:15----------
around in life with like you know my


---------09:18----------
left hand is like hey I'm gonna drink my


---------09:19----------
water and then the right hand is like no


---------09:21----------
we're not gonna drink the water no what


---------09:23----------
are you doing don't drink the water in


---------09:24----------
my left hand it's like no no I really


---------09:25----------
wonder get my right is like no don't


---------09:28----------
drink the water right that's not how are


---------09:32----------
the rest of our body works it's not like


---------09:34----------
one eye is like I'm gonna look over here


---------09:36----------
and then the other eye is gonna like I'm


---------09:38----------
gonna look over there alright so if you


---------09:40----------
have a weakness in one eye muscle


---------09:41----------
sometimes you can get you know


---------09:43----------
cross-eyed but that's separate so this


---------09:45----------
is normal okay that our mind has


---------09:48----------
conflicting thoughts and so the question


---------09:50----------
is like why does our mind have


---------09:51----------
conflicting conflicting thoughts and the


---------09:54----------
short answer is that we have different


---------09:57----------
pieces of mind and the the four pieces


---------10:03----------
that I'm going to talk about are three


---------10:04----------
four or five pieces I'm going to talk


---------10:06----------
about the first is the munnis which is


---------10:10----------
emotional mind


---------10:14----------
the second is a hum car which is ego or


---------10:22----------
identity and then the third is would be


---------10:28----------
or intellect rationality the fourth part


---------10:38----------
of mind is a some scar or undigested


---------10:46----------
emotion or pattern also personality and


---------10:54----------
then the fourth is chittha or


---------11:00----------
unconscious or really mind stuff you


---------11:07----------
can't I'll explain what these mean so


---------11:09----------
what I want you guys to understand is


---------11:10----------
the reason we have conflicting thoughts


---------11:12----------
in the mind and the reason we have a war


---------11:13----------
in our mind is because we have different


---------11:16----------
we have thoughts that come from


---------11:19----------
different places so it's not like our


---------11:21----------
mind is one thing it's like our mind is


---------11:23----------
like knights of the round table at


---------11:24----------
Camelot and like different parts of the


---------11:27----------
mind are gonna have different thoughts


---------11:28----------
so let me give you guys an example okay


---------11:30----------
so let's say that I want to apply for a


---------11:32----------
job so my would be


---------11:34----------
so my intellect let's use the scenario


---------11:38----------
of job so my intellect is going to say


---------11:57----------
[Music]


---------12:01----------
we need a job and then what happens is


---------12:07----------
like like when we like go to ask for an


---------12:10----------
application we feel anxiety right like


---------12:13----------
if we go and do if we're not used to it


---------12:15----------
the thought of going in somewhere and


---------12:17----------
asking for an application can lead to


---------12:19----------
all kinds of anxiety and so what happens


---------12:22----------
in our emotional mind we feel anxiety


---------12:25----------
and then that anxiety gives us another


---------12:29----------
thought


---------12:30----------
I don't wanna okay actually that's not


---------12:37----------
that's not correct it's a different part


---------12:39----------
of our mind tricky tricky tricky the


---------12:44----------
they they will think I'm stupid


---------12:56----------
okay and then what happens is we have


---------12:59----------
another thought and this thought comes


---------13:02----------
from our identity or ego so this thought


---------13:06----------
says getting a minimum-wage job is for


---------13:18----------
losers right so like this is how our


---------13:24----------
mind actually functions even though you


---------13:26----------
know you need a job and getting a


---------13:29----------
minimum-wage job isn't for losers


---------13:32----------
you have different parts of your mind


---------13:34----------
that like are conflicting and you can


---------13:37----------
like clearly see that the different


---------13:40----------
thoughts are sourced from different


---------13:43----------
parts of your mind


---------13:44----------
right your emotions will lead to certain


---------13:46----------
kinds of thoughts your identity or ego


---------13:49----------
will say like I'm smarter than this


---------13:51----------
right and then you end up like confused


---------14:00----------
because a week later you're sitting at


---------14:02----------
home and you're like I need a job and


---------14:04----------
then so you kind of think through this


---------14:07----------
right and then like days go by and then


---------14:10----------
you end up back here


---------14:11----------
we still need a job and then the process


---------14:14----------
repeats itself and then like this leads


---------14:17----------
to frustration and annoyance and and


---------14:19----------
beating yourself up because you're like


---------14:20----------
why on earth like why does this happen


---------14:24----------
to me I don't understand and then what


---------14:25----------
happens is you conclude right that like


---------14:29----------
this is the conclusion then you analyze


---------14:30----------
yourself so then your intellect steps in


---------14:32----------
and says like how on earth does this


---------14:35----------
work how does this work and then it


---------14:44----------
concludes I'm lazy right this what you


---------14:50----------
guys can do it oh I'm lazy i


---------14:51----------
procrastinate


---------14:55----------
so you guys come up with these umbrella


---------14:57----------
terms which don't actually help you at


---------15:01----------
all like so laziness is not an


---------15:03----------
actionable term so this is what I don't


---------15:05----------
like about using words like laziness or


---------15:07----------
astha nation or willpower


---------15:09----------
I mean it starting to be their actual


---------15:10----------
but they're really not actionable like


---------15:12----------
what's the cure for laziness being born


---------15:14----------
not lazy like how does that help us


---------15:15----------
there's no point in in conceiving of a


---------15:19----------
system unless that system helps us to


---------15:22----------
move forward right it's like it's like


---------15:25----------
saying that weather is due to Zeus the


---------15:27----------
Thunder God like we can't make any


---------15:28----------
predictions about that we can't rely it


---------15:30----------
on any on it in any way it's not like a


---------15:33----------
useful conception of the world


---------15:34----------
irrespective of whether you know you


---------15:37----------
believe in Zeus or not I'm saying that


---------15:38----------
like there are two ways that you can


---------15:39----------
approach problems one is to diagnose or


---------15:42----------
define them in a way that is like


---------15:43----------
actionable in another way that is like


---------15:45----------
in actionable furthermore this happens


---------15:48----------
to be not true like calling yourself


---------15:50----------
lazy isn't is in and of itself


---------15:52----------
intellectually lazy it takes this


---------15:54----------
complicated aspect of human behavior


---------15:57----------
which is not simplistic and it reduces


---------15:59----------
it down to one word and then so you're


---------16:01----------
like okay we're done so the real reason


---------16:03----------
this happens is can you guys see that


---------16:05----------
like so now we have our intellect okay


---------16:09----------
we have our ego and then we have our


---------16:13----------
emotions and basically there's like a


---------16:16----------
pull between these and if our ego is


---------16:22----------
stronger than our intellect or our


---------16:25----------
emotions then we'll will behave a


---------16:27----------
certain way right if our emotions are


---------16:30----------
stronger than our intellect our ego will


---------16:32----------
behave another way


---------16:33----------
and if our intellect is stronger than


---------16:36----------
our ego or emotions will behave a third


---------16:38----------
way right so let's just think about this


---------16:42----------
for a second so let's say that you guys


---------16:49----------
let's say someone criticizes me okay so


---------16:51----------
let's say dr. K is an idiot


---------16:56----------
what do you guys think is the first part


---------16:58----------
of my mind that responds to that thought


---------17:11----------
okay right so so in emotion most people


---------17:15----------
are saying emotion or ego so like like


---------17:18----------
what's the emotion that I'm gonna be


---------17:19----------
feeling


---------17:32----------
okay hold on so defense is not an


---------17:35----------
emotion okay so we're gonna say so you


---------17:37----------
guys are saying emotion first okay so


---------17:40----------
anger may be shame right and what is


---------17:45----------
defense what is the defense of thought


---------17:51----------
okay or you can say ego first I'm not


---------18:01----------
stupid


---------18:01----------
yes he beautiful I'm not stupid


---------18:05----------
also you're stupid


---------18:10----------
I'm not stupid you're stupid you're the


---------18:13----------
dumb one I'm not the dumb one he's wrong


---------18:17----------
me right so do you guys see how like so


---------18:22----------
so even thoughts like how dare you do


---------18:31----------
you know who I am


---------18:37----------
do you know who I am do you know do you


---------18:42----------
know how dare you how dare you so these


---------18:47----------
are all ego thoughts right so then what


---------18:49----------
happens is depending on on my mind and


---------18:53----------
how strong it is or weak it is the


---------18:56----------
intellect comes in and so the intellect


---------19:00----------
may say hey man you're not perfect


---------19:09----------
these people are calling you an idiot


---------19:11----------
maybe it's because you're a boomer and


---------19:13----------
you don't know how to use technology


---------19:15----------
twitch hurr Durr okay it's like you know


---------19:24----------
these guys like you may be you know you


---------19:30----------
may have a certain amount of educational


---------19:31----------
background but it's not like the people


---------19:33----------
on Twitter dumb right like the people on


---------19:34----------
Twitter like let's be honest twitch it


---------19:38----------
is pretty smart sometimes you say dumb


---------19:51----------
things right tech W POG Bey Hance right


---------20:06----------
so it's like so so few areas like look


---------20:12----------
at this like so now what happens is the


---------20:14----------
question is like what part of my mind is


---------20:16----------
stronger so even though you know my my


---------20:21----------
ego is gonna respond in a particular way


---------20:24----------
like it depends on the relative strength


---------20:26----------
of my ego or intellect so you know I try


---------20:30----------
to do something which some I mean I hope


---------20:33----------
works most of the time but maybe I don't


---------20:34----------
know right so even that that little


---------20:37----------
thing that I did in my head was ego


---------20:40----------
warring with intellect and I'll explain


---------20:43----------
that in a second but generally speaking


---------20:44----------
when someone calls me stupid


---------20:45----------
my first question is like why do you


---------20:48----------
think that it's not you're wrong because


---------20:51----------
they may be right like I could be dumb


---------20:52----------
like there's no way to know I mean maybe


---------20:56----------
I am dumb right it's very possible


---------20:58----------
so like help me understand like how do


---------21:01----------
you why do you think I'm dumb whereas if


---------21:04----------
I let my in and that's actually my


---------21:05----------
intellect controlling or I think it's


---------21:07----------
controlling my response and I may see


---------21:10----------
feel some kind of emotion like I may


---------21:13----------
feel angry or ashamed and then like I


---------21:14----------
kind of like notice that emotion I set


---------21:16----------
it aside I'm like okay look we feel


---------21:17----------
shame we feel attacked we feel like


---------21:20----------
these people don't like me and I want to


---------21:21----------
be liked and I want to be


---------21:23----------
Soviet so I'm getting attacked let's try


---------21:25----------
to figure out what's going on here and


---------21:26----------
then other times my ego is gonna like


---------21:29----------
win when it comes to my intellect I'm


---------21:32----------
just gonna get incensed and angry and


---------21:34----------
things like that


---------21:34----------
and I'm gonna say I'm not stupid you're


---------21:36----------
stupid so do you guys see how like each


---------21:40----------
of these things this guy oh no he


---------21:51----------
figured out I'm posture attack


---------22:06----------
handwriting fog run away stop streaming


---------22:18----------
so all of these thoughts can come from


---------22:20----------
emotions and like you guys can see that


---------22:25----------
like the the the nature of thoughts that


---------22:28----------
come from different parts of our mind


---------22:30----------
are different and that's what leads to


---------22:32----------
conflict and confusion and us not doing


---------22:35----------
the right thing okay so this is what I


---------22:38----------
love about this model of mind is once


---------22:39----------
you understand like which thoughts come


---------22:41----------
from which places you can see why you're


---------22:44----------
not able to do stuff and what it comes


---------22:46----------
down to is what are the relative


---------22:47----------
strengths of your intellect ego and


---------22:50----------
emotions so generally speaking you know


---------22:52----------
gamers have an intellect that's level


---------22:54----------
three they have emotions that are level


---------22:56----------
five and they have ego that is level 82


---------23:00----------
and so like the reason you guys are


---------23:03----------
stuck is because there's like some parts


---------23:05----------
of your mind that are just way stronger


---------23:06----------
than other parts of your mind and


---------23:08----------
they're beating crap out of you


---------23:09----------
right it's like yeah I mean you guys


---------23:13----------
understand levels I don't need to


---------23:15----------
explain it further so let's look at a


---------23:16----------
couple of other attributes okay so how


---------23:19----------
does this help us so the first thing is


---------23:20----------
what is the chain of events so generally


---------23:23----------
speaking our minds reaction so order of


---------23:27----------
operations okay


---------23:29----------
order


---------23:31----------
operations so the first thing that tends


---------23:34----------
to happen is an emotional response so


---------23:37----------
motion is super fast okay and if you


---------23:42----------
think about it like if I walk into a


---------23:44----------
room and then everyone turns on the


---------23:46----------
lights and says surprised even before I


---------23:49----------
consciously process what is going on


---------23:52----------
before I have an an analytical


---------23:54----------
understanding of what happens in the


---------23:56----------
room like my emotions are like react so


---------23:59----------
emotions are the fastest okay and then


---------24:03----------
what happens is our ego so these act


---------24:07----------
first now let's talk about ego for a


---------24:11----------
second so then usually ego arises as a


---------24:16----------
protective mechanism so the ego is your


---------24:23----------
main tank that's the way I want you guys


---------24:25----------
to think about it when your emotions


---------24:28----------
when you're feeling hurt your ego or


---------24:30----------
eise's to protect you so when some girl


---------24:32----------
like let's say you ask out a girl this


---------24:35----------
is an example that I use a lot and she


---------24:36----------
says no then you feel like shame you


---------24:40----------
feel fear that you're unlovable you feel


---------24:42----------
like all these things but they happen


---------24:43----------
like this and then your ego steps in


---------24:47----------
right away to protect you from all those


---------24:48----------
negative feelings and you're like yeah


---------24:49----------
it's her loss she's dumb like I can do


---------24:54----------
so much better than her you know she's


---------24:57----------
gonna end up alone like all of these


---------25:00----------
thoughts like those are all egotistical


---------25:02----------
thoughts right like that's clear I don't


---------25:03----------
need to explain that like oh yeah like


---------25:04----------
she missed out man boy did I dodged a


---------25:07----------
bullet when really like that doesn't


---------25:09----------
make any sense oh she's not that


---------25:11----------
attractive anyway like I'm not even that


---------25:12----------
into her which is like why'd you ask her


---------25:14----------
out in the first place man like if


---------25:15----------
you're not that into her oh yeah I was


---------25:16----------
doing her a favor and then if you talked


---------25:18----------
to people like you'll see that like as


---------25:23----------
you talk to them rationally like their


---------25:24----------
ego just keeps on spinning stuff out and


---------25:27----------
that's because their main tank is really


---------25:28----------
strong like you can try to attack it any


---------25:30----------
way you want to their main tanks like


---------25:32----------
level 82 and it's like hey man you got


---------25:33----------
nothing on me like I can block whatever


---------25:35----------
you send my way right and and so like


---------25:42----------
the main tank kind of steps in and


---------25:43----------
protects you


---------25:44----------
from negative emotion so it's really


---------25:46----------
trying to protect you it's trying to


---------25:47----------
help you out like it's trying to help


---------25:48----------
you feel less hurt because if you don't


---------25:50----------
think those kinds of thoughts if you


---------25:51----------
don't think oh it's her loss


---------25:53----------
then whose loss is it it's my loss and


---------25:55----------
that's hard for people to accept and


---------25:57----------
then what happens is the intellect goes


---------25:59----------
and then sorry the ego goes and it


---------26:04----------
bullies the intellect so it goes over


---------26:06----------
the intellect and it's like hey buddy


---------26:08----------
we're hurting right now I need you to go


---------26:10----------
back in time and do some really really


---------26:12----------
selective analysis that shows us that


---------26:15----------
proves my point to my emotions that we


---------26:18----------
are awesome and so the intellect is like


---------26:21----------
okay like I don't know if I want to do


---------26:24----------
that knee goes like no screw you like


---------26:26----------
your level three I'm level 82 like do


---------26:28----------
some selective reasoning for us


---------26:29----------
and there are intellectus like oh yeah


---------26:31----------
remember six years ago when that


---------26:34----------
attractive popular girl actually had a


---------26:36----------
crush on us and we found out three years


---------26:38----------
later and we didn't really do anything


---------26:40----------
about it but she was into us because


---------26:42----------
that friend told us that she was kind of


---------26:44----------
into us and she kind of had a crush on


---------26:46----------
us and she was super hot and she was


---------26:48----------
super popular so yep it's that girl's


---------26:50----------
loss that girl turned me down like cuz


---------26:52----------
six years ago this other girl like found


---------26:54----------
me attractive so that's that's how it


---------26:59----------
works right


---------26:59----------
like the intellect gets bullied by the


---------27:02----------
ego and the egos like hey man do


---------27:04----------
selective reasoning and and then the


---------27:07----------
intellect is like okay and then the


---------27:09----------
problem is that the this person thinks


---------27:11----------
they're logical right so then then what


---------27:13----------
happens is selective reasoning because


---------27:18----------
if you try to argue with them their


---------27:19----------
their intellect presents evidence and if


---------27:24----------
you guys have ever tried to like you


---------27:25----------
know argue with someone and you've


---------27:27----------
presented evidence you can understand


---------27:28----------
especially if they're like emotionally


---------27:31----------
hurt in some way evidence is irrelevant


---------27:33----------
and and so I'll give you guys kind of


---------27:36----------
another example of this so let's say


---------27:38----------
that you have a relationship where one


---------27:40----------
partner is unfaithful and then like you


---------27:43----------
know that person feels like ashamed of


---------27:45----------
being unfaithful but then their ego


---------27:47----------
steps in and they're like oh you know


---------27:49----------
they made me cheat like they weren't


---------27:52----------
emotionally or physically available


---------27:53----------
because they were working so hard and


---------27:55----------
they weren't


---------27:56----------
and I have needs and then what happens


---------27:58----------
as it goes to the intellect and it's


---------28:00----------
like hey like we feel bad about


---------28:01----------
ourselves can you come up with some kind


---------28:04----------
of line of reasoning that can make us


---------28:05----------
feel better about ourselves and then


---------28:07----------
your intellect is like sure how about we


---------28:09----------
say that we have unmet needs because if


---------28:12----------
we have unmet needs needs then we can do


---------28:15----------
whatever we need to do to meet those


---------28:17----------
needs it's not morality or anything like


---------28:19----------
that we're gonna frame them as needs and


---------28:22----------
if we frame them as needs like hunger


---------28:23----------
and thirst like you can't really blame


---------28:25----------
us for doing that and then we'll feel


---------28:26----------
better about ourselves and so this is


---------28:30----------
kind of the chain of events okay


---------28:34----------
presuming that your intellect is weak is


---------28:37----------
this a one person asked a question about


---------28:39----------
confidence so confidence is opposite ego


---------28:43----------
so if we have a spectrum egos over here


---------28:48----------
confidence is over here so I'm about to


---------28:52----------
say something and this could be ego this


---------28:53----------
could be confidence you guys let me know


---------28:55----------
so I think that the way that I respond


---------28:57----------
to people's criticism of me is because


---------28:59----------
I'm confident in Who I am but if someone


---------29:02----------
calls me stupid my whole question is


---------29:03----------
gonna be why because I don't you know I


---------29:05----------
don't need to feel smart to them I'm


---------29:08----------
pretty confident in Who I am and what


---------29:10----------
I'm capable of so I'm like okay so like


---------29:11----------
tell me how I'm wrong am i dumb sure


---------29:13----------
let's let's hear out how am i dumb in


---------29:15----------
what way


---------29:16----------
so that to me feels like a confident


---------29:19----------
response but maybe that's my ego talking


---------29:21----------
cuz now I'm saying I do this and like oh


---------29:23----------
like look at me like I'm so confident oh


---------29:25----------
yeah look at how dr. K is confident look


---------29:28----------
at it so dr. K is different right you


---------29:31----------
guys have your ego that's Lovelady tube


---------29:33----------
of my intellect to say 82 ah right that


---------29:36----------
in and of itself is an egotistical


---------29:37----------
statement like this comparison that I'm


---------29:39----------
making about myself is egotistical so


---------29:42----------
maybe in that situation actually like


---------29:43----------
I'm doing the same thing I'm committing


---------29:46----------
the same problem it's just but no no but


---------29:49----------
you guys don't understand I have


---------29:50----------
evidence that I'm less egotistical than


---------29:53----------
everybody else I have evidence let me


---------29:55----------
tell you about all the yoga that I did


---------29:57----------
let me tell you about all the meditation


---------29:59----------
that I did let me tell you about this


---------30:01----------
let me tell you about that let me tell


---------30:02----------
you why I am different


---------30:08----------
you guys see that that's an ego


---------30:11----------
statement right that's an ego statement


---------30:17----------
so like so any statement that has to


---------30:21----------
kind of do with with I could be an ego


---------30:23----------
statement or it could be like an actual


---------30:25----------
intellectual assessment right so like


---------30:27----------
your intellect can without ego assess


---------30:30----------
that you're good at things are assess it


---------30:31----------
that you're bad at things the question


---------30:33----------
is what is the relationship between


---------30:34----------
intellect and ego it's for you guys to


---------30:37----------
decide whether my statement is


---------30:39----------
egotistical or confident like that's for


---------30:41----------
you to decide and that is my sense of


---------30:44----------
that's actually like that's a good D


---------30:46----------
statement so that's an intellectual


---------30:47----------
statement for me to say that you guys


---------30:50----------
are the deciders of whether I'm


---------30:51----------
egotistical or confident in my mind is a


---------30:54----------
statement that comes from my intellect


---------30:56----------
not my ego because my ego says oh y'all


---------30:58----------
are right I mean y'all are wrong and I'm


---------31:00----------
right


---------31:01----------
it's not for you to decide it's for me


---------31:02----------
to decide and so in my mind if I'm


---------31:04----------
telling you guys y'all are the ones that


---------31:06----------
decide whether I'm smart or dumb or


---------31:07----------
confident or egotistical that's kind of


---------31:11----------
like the intellect because the intellect


---------31:12----------
sort of says my intellect says you know


---------31:15----------
you're gonna be biased or I'm gonna be


---------31:16----------
biased my mind is gonna be biased so if


---------31:19----------
I really want a fair shake of like what


---------31:21----------
I'm capable of I should look to other


---------31:22----------
people because they're gonna be like


---------31:24----------
more objective than I am because I'm


---------31:26----------
gonna experience all my own emotions so


---------31:29----------
confidence equals being humble basically


---------31:31----------
yeah right so if you think about someone


---------31:33----------
who's confident they're not so what's


---------31:36----------
the difference new confidence in ego


---------31:38----------
okay let's just talk about this for a


---------31:39----------
second


---------31:40----------
self-worth from within and then


---------31:49----------
self-worth from without or actually


---------31:55----------
outside


---------32:04----------
right so when people have their sense of


---------32:08----------
self depends on the praise or lack of


---------32:11----------
praise they get from other people that's


---------32:13----------
ego and when your sense of self comes


---------32:16----------
from within and it doesn't depend upon


---------32:19----------
other people that's confidence so people


---------32:23----------
who are egotistical are gonna be like


---------32:24----------
sensitive to the criticisms of others if


---------32:27----------
you call them dumb they're gonna respond


---------32:29----------
in a particular way is like the


---------32:31----------
confident person is like okay you can


---------32:32----------
think I'm dumb like that's fine


---------32:33----------
let go I don't think go ahead and think


---------32:36----------
that that's fine okay so let's go back


---------32:42----------
to this for a second so the order of


---------32:44----------
operations so now the question is like


---------32:48----------
how do we move forward okay so actually


---------32:50----------
there are a couple of questions the


---------32:51----------
first is so let's just go back here okay


---------32:54----------
emotions ego and intellect okay so the


---------33:04----------
first thing is like if you guys are


---------33:06----------
having trouble with following your like


---------33:10----------
accomplishing what you tell your mind to


---------33:12----------
do if you tell your mind to do something


---------33:14----------
and it doesn't work like you're like oh


---------33:17----------
we need to get a job the first thing


---------33:19----------
that you need to do is recognize in your


---------33:21----------
thoughts which thoughts are coming from


---------33:24----------
what place okay so now we're gonna do a


---------33:26----------
couple of practical applications so if


---------33:28----------
we want to get a job or we want to stop


---------33:32----------
playing video games right like what what


---------33:38----------
are the thoughts that we have like write


---------33:40----------
down the thoughts of conflict and then


---------33:44----------
try to figure out which one is coming


---------33:47----------
from where and then you'll understand


---------33:48----------
that it's not like you're just dumb and


---------33:49----------
paralyzed and lazy it's that there's


---------33:52----------
actually like a war going on inside you


---------33:54----------
and there are different parts of you


---------33:55----------
that are like fighting for different


---------33:57----------
things right it's kind of like an


---------33:59----------
election where each part of your mind


---------34:02----------
has a different number of votes based on


---------34:04----------
their relative strength and then they


---------34:06----------
kind of like all cast their vote and


---------34:08----------
then you decide on a particular behavior


---------34:10----------
so this could be so look for thoughts of


---------34:13----------
shame or anger


---------34:15----------
whatever and then also recognize that


---------34:17----------
like the last thing that you the thing


---------34:20----------
that you're gonna experience first in


---------34:22----------
your mind is actually gonna be the last


---------34:24----------
one in the chain so the last thing


---------34:26----------
you're gonna find or the first thing


---------34:28----------
you're gonna find is the selective


---------34:29----------
reasoning which is actually like the


---------34:31----------
last thing in the consequence because


---------34:33----------
this chain happens super fast like less


---------34:36----------
than a second because the mind is pretty


---------34:40----------
amazing so if I ask a girl out and she


---------34:42----------
says no within five seconds or maybe one


---------34:45----------
second I'm gonna be thinking oh it's her


---------34:48----------
loss right it happened super fast so


---------34:52----------
what you guys want to do is isolate the


---------34:54----------
different thoughts that are coming from


---------34:55----------
emotions coming from ego and coming from


---------34:57----------
intellect so let me give you guys a


---------34:59----------
couple of attributes of these okay so


---------35:03----------
emotions I think you guys we've talked


---------35:05----------
about before we did a whole lecture on


---------35:06----------
that so I'd go back and watch that if


---------35:08----------
you guys want a go there are a couple of


---------35:10----------
clues one is its comparative okay so


---------35:15----------
this is the biggest clue of an


---------35:16----------
egotistical thought and we have a


---------35:18----------
channel on our discord that's devoted to


---------35:20----------
a hum car or finding your ego so this is


---------35:24----------
a thought that compares you to someone


---------35:25----------
else or compares different things the


---------35:27----------
ego is fundamentally comparison


---------35:29----------
comparative the other thing is ego pumps


---------35:31----------
you up and puts other people down so if


---------35:39----------
you have a thought that is comparison or


---------35:42----------
lifts like pumps you up or tries to


---------35:45----------
knock other people down those are ego


---------35:47----------
thoughts right so oh I could do better


---------35:50----------
than her that's a comparison that also


---------35:54----------
like puts you up and puts her down do


---------35:56----------
you guys see how like that thought I


---------35:59----------
could do better than her


---------36:07----------
so the other thing is I don't know if


---------36:09----------
you guys are familiar with like the


---------36:11----------
pickup artist


---------36:13----------
red pill kind of movement but in my


---------36:19----------
experience these people have very very


---------36:21----------
strong egos and they do a lot of very


---------36:24----------
selective reasoning and they tend to not


---------36:27----------
be aware of their emotions because they


---------36:28----------
make a lot of comparisons right and I


---------36:31----------
invite you guys to like look for that


---------36:33----------
yourself


---------36:35----------
and so you'll kind of see that like they


---------36:37----------
make lots of comparisons they make they


---------36:40----------
put other people down they put


---------36:42----------
themselves up so they have like very


---------36:44----------
very strong egos so then then what


---------36:49----------
happens is like you know you're gonna


---------36:51----------
have some amount of reasoning so like


---------36:53----------
you're gonna have some things that you


---------36:54----------
use as evidence or justification so look


---------36:59----------
for the thoughts that make you think


---------37:02----------
you're right right these are the


---------37:05----------
thoughts that make you think you are


---------37:12----------
right and that's gonna be the intellect


---------37:17----------
and whether those thoughts are accurate


---------37:20----------
or inaccurate are is based on their


---------37:24----------
relative strength to the ego so the last


---------37:26----------
thing to understand about this is that


---------37:29----------
like so we have a basic problem with our


---------37:31----------
intellect which is that human beings


---------37:33----------
always believe that they are correct and


---------37:37----------
they are logical right no human being


---------37:39----------
walks around and says I am wrong if you


---------37:41----------
talk to anyone about politics for


---------37:43----------
example everyone who believes something


---------37:45----------
in politics logically believes that they


---------37:48----------
are correct and that the other side is


---------37:50----------
wrong it's not about right or wrong I


---------37:52----------
mean it's about right or wrong it's not


---------37:54----------
about relative views like you know one


---------37:56----------
of the biggest things that I remember


---------37:58----------
when you know I was training and so I


---------38:00----------
trained it a very liberal institution


---------38:02----------
and the the biggest thing that I


---------38:05----------
remember in 2016 when Trump won the


---------38:07----------
election and in the US is that everyone


---------38:10----------
was surprised that people could


---------38:12----------
quote-unquote be so stupid they were


---------38:15----------
like I don't understand how people can


---------38:16----------
be so stupid I don't understand how


---------38:18----------
people can be so stupid


---------38:20----------
if you think about it that like everyone


---------38:21----------
no one thinks they're stupid everyone


---------38:23----------
thinks that are smart everyone thinks


---------38:24----------
they're logical so how do you know


---------38:26----------
whether your intellect is operating well


---------38:30----------
or is like operating poorly how can you


---------38:33----------
tell whether your intellect is flawed or


---------38:36----------
correct because your intellect is always


---------38:38----------
gonna tell you that you are correct


---------38:41----------
right it's kind of like bizarre so so so


---------38:46----------
this person says liberals on ego trip


---------38:49----------
lull w that in and of itself is also a


---------38:51----------
comparison what I'm saying is that


---------38:53----------
everyone is on an ego trip everyone who


---------38:58----------
talks about politics usually believes


---------39:00----------
that they are factually correct


---------39:02----------
and then the other side believes they're


---------39:06----------
factually correct right so this is


---------39:08----------
exactly what I'm saying like even


---------39:09----------
y'all's reactions are so rapid if you're


---------39:13----------
making a comparison that like the same


---------39:16----------
is true of conservatives right so when I


---------39:18----------
talk to trump supporters now and I ask


---------39:21----------
them how do you guys think the u.s. is


---------39:22----------
doing with the coronavirus they say


---------39:25----------
we're doing a great job and then I say


---------39:26----------
okay then help me understand why you


---------39:28----------
think it is that the number of cases


---------39:30----------
that we how are we number one in the


---------39:32----------
world even coronavirus cases we had two


---------39:34----------
months more to prepare than China like


---------39:37----------
how is that a great job and then they


---------39:40----------
they tell me all kinds of different


---------39:42----------
stuff right so then their intellect does


---------39:44----------
these weird mental gymnastics and and


---------39:47----------
they say oh it's the NIH s fault it's


---------39:49----------
like how is it the NIH s fault but help


---------39:53----------
me understand that they're like oh it's


---------39:54----------
the scientists fault that's like what do


---------39:56----------
you mean it's the scientists fault and


---------39:58----------
then I can keep on asking him questions


---------39:59----------
and their mind is going to keep on


---------40:01----------
coming up with answers right so that's


---------40:04----------
that is they're just gonna keep on


---------40:06----------
coming up with answers I can ask a


---------40:07----------
million questions that I want to and as


---------40:09----------
I ask more questions and as they so


---------40:11----------
let's just think about this as I ask


---------40:13----------
more questions how do you think they


---------40:14----------
feel


---------40:22----------
okay so as they as they get insecure so


---------40:25----------
let's run through this right this is fun


---------40:28----------
so as they feel insecure what's gonna


---------40:32----------
happen how are they gonna respond to


---------40:36----------
that insecurity sure they feel insecure


---------40:39----------
frustrated irritated more ego exactly


---------40:45----------
right


---------40:46----------
and then what does their intellects


---------40:48----------
gonna do as we level up the ego ego


---------40:56----------
protect their emotions


---------41:01----------
shields up and then what happens defend


---------41:08----------
themselves counter right right and so


---------41:12----------
this is what happens if you engage in a


---------41:14----------
political discussion with someone the


---------41:16----------
more right you are how convinced do they


---------41:19----------
get when you're right absolutely they're


---------41:27----------
tanking up right that the more correct


---------41:29----------
you are the more wrong they feel so this


---------41:31----------
is the main thing you guys got to


---------41:32----------
understand in politics the more wrong


---------41:34----------
they feel the more right they're gonna


---------41:38----------
feel and the less they're gonna listen


---------41:39----------
and we kind of know this right like you


---------41:41----------
can observe this so like this model that


---------41:43----------
Yogi's came up with 5000 years ago in


---------41:46----------
five minutes explains political


---------41:48----------
discussion done so now I'm gonna ask you


---------41:51----------
guys a question


---------41:52----------
if you want to if you want to convince


---------41:54----------
someone politically what should you work


---------41:57----------
on how do you convince them okay


---------42:05----------
[Music]


---------42:12----------
where does it start


---------42:21----------
disarm their ego nope incorrect


---------42:24----------
you can't disarm the level 80 to tank


---------42:28----------
fight them sure emotions absolutely


---------42:34----------
right so like there's a really


---------42:36----------
fascinating I remember seeing like a


---------42:37----------
small docu-series about a black guy who


---------42:39----------
like convinced KKK members that they


---------42:42----------
were racist and like converted them from


---------42:44----------
racism to being like less racist and he


---------42:47----------
didn't do it by attacking them right he


---------42:49----------
like went and he hung out with them and


---------42:51----------
then likely they hung out with him and


---------42:53----------
they started hanging out for a little


---------42:55----------
while and then like the KKK folks were


---------42:57----------
like oh the students like actually a


---------42:58----------
pretty cool guy and so he just like


---------43:00----------
treated him like normal people and he


---------43:02----------
didn't attack him he didn't call him


---------43:03----------
dumb and then over time yeah Darrell


---------43:06----------
Davis so it's it's great like so that's


---------43:11----------
how you do it so this is the thing if


---------43:12----------
you want to convince someone you have to


---------43:14----------
disarm their emotions right you have to


---------43:15----------
make them feel comfortable and then like


---------43:18----------
over time you can sort of bypass the ego


---------43:20----------
and then like speak to their real


---------43:21----------
intellect because here's the thing as


---------43:24----------
long as they're not attacked their level


---------43:26----------
82 main tank is like is afk


---------43:29----------
so he's like afk drinking at the bar and


---------43:32----------
then you can have a conversation between


---------43:33----------
emotions and intellect and this is like


---------43:36----------
what a lot of therapy is about it's


---------43:37----------
about sort of disarming emotions so that


---------43:39----------
people can you know focus on their


---------43:41----------
intellect okay so yeah so that's the


---------43:47----------
goal like the goal is like as long as


---------43:48----------
you disarm their emotions and you treat


---------43:50----------
them with kindness then their main tank


---------43:52----------
is gonna go afk and if their main tank


---------43:55----------
is afk then you can have a discussion


---------43:56----------
with them so like when I'm talking to


---------43:57----------
people I mean I don't


---------43:58----------
I tend not to talk to people about


---------43:59----------
politics but you know when I have


---------44:02----------
someone whose views I disagree with I


---------44:04----------
tend to start by like actually first of


---------44:07----------
all starting with the idea that my views


---------44:09----------
could be wrong right like what makes my


---------44:11----------
views like why am i is a human being


---------44:13----------
more qualified to like know something


---------44:16----------
than someone else and and I had one of


---------44:20----------
these


---------44:20----------
since two days ago and it was it took a


---------44:23----------
lot of self-control to not let my ego


---------44:25----------
get in the way but it was like okay so


---------44:28----------
like maybe this person is right maybe


---------44:29----------
prayer does stop the coronavirus you


---------44:32----------
know it's possible like we do know that


---------44:34----------
that you know mind has a positive effect


---------44:37----------
on the immune system that is we as we


---------44:40----------
decrease our stress there's a


---------44:41----------
psychosomatic component and there are


---------44:45----------
all kinds of reasons why like what


---------44:47----------
they're saying actually could have merit


---------44:49----------
and I have to like really like work I


---------44:52----------
had to work at that a little bit right


---------44:53----------
to kind of get there again and and so as


---------44:59----------
long as you do that by the end like the


---------45:01----------
person is asking me questions they're


---------45:03----------
like you know and then sometimes you you


---------45:05----------
know you toss out statistics and you


---------45:07----------
quote things and things like that and


---------45:09----------
then you you know there's a part of you


---------45:10----------
that really wants to beat them into


---------45:12----------
submission by quoting studies because


---------45:14----------
they can't do that and I can but we try


---------45:17----------
to step away from that right
