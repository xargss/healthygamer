---------00:09----------
okay hi would you ever want want to or


---------00:11----------
be willing to do an informational type


---------00:13----------
of interview on stream we've talked a


---------00:14----------
bit about your history and how you got


---------00:16----------
to your point as a psychiatrist but I


---------00:18----------
and probably other people have several


---------00:20----------
questions on what led you to your path


---------00:22----------
why the medical field why psychiatrist /


---------00:24----------
psychologist thoughts on psychotherapy


---------00:26----------
versus medication what factors do you


---------00:27----------
think led you to being accepted to


---------00:29----------
medical school


---------00:31----------
um yeah so I can talk about that now so


---------00:35----------
it sounds like people are interested in


---------00:37----------
my bio in my background


---------00:42----------
what led me to my path so I'll start


---------00:46----------
and there are a couple of so the


---------00:48----------
question is what led me to my path why


---------00:50----------
the medical field why a psychiatrist / a


---------00:52----------
psychologist thoughts on psychotherapy


---------00:54----------
versus medication what factors led you


---------00:57----------
to think that you think led you to being


---------00:59----------
accepted into Medical School so let's


---------01:01----------
start with


---------01:04----------
oh okay let's just start with with the


---------01:07----------
first question okay so how did I get


---------01:09----------
here so I think my journey starts with


---------01:12----------
playing a bunch of video actually I mean


---------01:15----------
if you guys really want to get into it I


---------01:16----------
think my journey starts with playing


---------01:17----------
video games because I was a year ahead


---------01:20----------
so I went to this like very like small


---------01:23----------
school that had a very high teacher to


---------01:25----------
student ratio


---------01:27----------
and so in the span of being like in in


---------01:30----------
that school for two years I basically


---------01:32----------
like skipped a grade and so then what


---------01:35----------
happened as I entered the first grade is


---------01:37----------
like a five year old and a six year old


---------01:41----------
I guess a second grade is a six year old


---------01:44----------
or something with that I was one year


---------01:45----------
younger than than all of my classmates


---------01:47----------
and so the first thing that happened is


---------01:49----------
I sucked at sports because I was like a


---------01:52----------
five-year-old competing against


---------01:53----------
six-year-olds if you think about that


---------01:56----------
like a five-year-old is just not gonna


---------01:58----------
compete on any level with six-year-olds


---------02:01----------
and so I think that you know what what


---------02:08----------
happened is like I started off being bad


---------02:09----------
at sports and then I gravitated towards


---------02:12----------
video games because like in video games


---------02:14----------
I could be just as good as my colleagues


---------02:15----------
and the reason that I was I started to


---------02:17----------
believe I was bad at sports and I was


---------02:19----------
unathletic but the truth was just I was


---------02:21----------
just a year younger so there's no way


---------02:23----------
that a five-year-old is gonna be able to


---------02:24----------
run as fast as a six year old six year


---------02:27----------
olds ROP absolutely correct unless


---------02:29----------
you're a six year old competing against


---------02:30----------
seven year olds


---------02:32----------
and then so I started playing a lot of


---------02:35----------
video games and then like started sort


---------02:37----------
of become directionless fall behind had


---------02:39----------
a bunch of ego and stuff like that in


---------02:41----------
high school and then basically was


---------02:43----------
failing out of college and then ended up


---------02:44----------
going to India at the age of 21 because


---------02:48----------
my life was going nowhere I had like


---------02:50----------
less than a 2.0 GPA was failing all that


---------02:52----------
good stuff


---------02:54----------
and when I was in India like discovered


---------02:57----------
yoga and meditation and really loved it


---------02:59----------
so I loved that like so we study stuff


---------03:03----------
right like we study mathematics and we


---------03:05----------
study science and we study neuroscience


---------03:06----------
and we study economics and sociology and


---------03:09----------
psychology and we formally like sit down


---------03:12----------
and say like I can get mastery over this


---------03:16----------
field of the world if I sit down and


---------03:18----------
systematically learn


---------03:21----------
what I found with like yoga and


---------03:22----------
meditation and Ayurveda was a system to


---------03:25----------
understand myself in like a methodical


---------03:28----------
way then I can sit down and study Who I


---------03:32----------
am and how I work as a person and then I


---------03:35----------
can get better at like being me and I


---------03:38----------
love that like I I found answers to so


---------03:41----------
many questions like everything that


---------03:42----------
we're talking about on stream like these


---------03:44----------
urges that we have like I feel like


---------03:46----------
cleaning more after I clean like how


---------03:47----------
does that work there is a principle


---------03:49----------
under which that works like why you feel


---------03:53----------
like claiming cleaning why you feel the


---------03:55----------
shame why you want to ask someone out


---------03:57----------
why you can't ask someone out why you


---------04:00----------
play video games why you can't stop


---------04:02----------
playing video games why you can't like


---------04:04----------
start writing a 10 page paper why you


---------04:07----------
can't start approach reading a really


---------04:10----------
long text book this is all random crap


---------04:13----------
but there's a system to understand how


---------04:15----------
all of it works right this is the system


---------04:19----------
of understanding a human being which is


---------04:21----------
literally what yoga is


---------04:24----------
Yoga is about understanding eat not like


---------04:26----------
Asin which is what they do at yoga


---------04:28----------
studios but true yoga in its original


---------04:31----------
like form in its truest form which


---------04:33----------
didn't really get translated over to the


---------04:35----------
West didn't really cross the pond mostly


---------04:37----------
stayed in India it's about understanding


---------04:39----------
how human being works because there are


---------04:43----------
laws and principles that govern your


---------04:44----------
physiology or neuroscience psychology


---------04:46----------
right and so then like getting back to


---------04:51----------
my life so I was like okay this is


---------04:53----------
really cool that I'm learning all this


---------04:54----------
stuff from a yoga perspective but I'm a


---------04:56----------
skeptic by nature and I like references


---------04:58----------
so I'm gonna understand the sign so I


---------05:00----------
became a researcher as I started to have


---------05:03----------
like experiences in meditation that were


---------05:05----------
super trippy and like really cool I was


---------05:07----------
like what the f is going on in my brain


---------05:09----------
during these times like I have a brain


---------05:11----------
like how does that work so I started off


---------05:14----------
doing EEG studies on meditators so this


---------05:17----------
is measuring the electrical activity in


---------05:19----------
the brain


---------05:19----------
during meditation I was like that's


---------05:22----------
pretty cool I like that and then I


---------05:24----------
started doing neuroscience research I


---------05:27----------
did that for a couple of years and then


---------05:28----------
I decided that like I wasn't gonna


---------05:30----------
become a monk because I met my wife fell


---------05:32----------
in love et cetera and so I was like well


---------05:35----------
I have to do something so what do I want


---------05:37----------
to do


---------05:38----------
and I decided to become a doctor for a


---------05:40----------
couple of reasons the truest reason I


---------05:43----------
became a doctor is because my one of my


---------05:45----------
teachers told me that unless you can


---------05:47----------
succeed in in material in the material


---------05:50----------
world you're not gonna succeed in the


---------05:51----------
spiritual because anything you do in the


---------05:54----------
material world is gonna be way easier


---------05:56----------
than what you do in the spiritual world


---------05:59----------
because the real world is like like for


---------06:02----------
noobs and the spiritual world is for


---------06:05----------
experts pros go to the spiritual world


---------06:07----------
that's what he told so it's like okay


---------06:10----------
 it I'm gonna just set a goal for


---------06:11----------
myself and was kind of arbitrary to be


---------06:13----------
completely honest it was really somewhat


---------06:15----------
arbitrary I was like I'm gonna become a


---------06:16----------
doctor just because it's hard because


---------06:19----------
it's hard and I have a 2.5 GPA but so


---------06:22----------
that seems impossible so I'm gonna do


---------06:24----------
that because if I can do that then I'm


---------06:27----------
gonna succeed in meditation that's


---------06:29----------
that's literally how it worked and there


---------06:32----------
were a couple of other factors so one


---------06:35----------
was that I didn't while I loved kind of


---------06:37----------
psychology in the mind I didn't so I


---------06:42----------
read that doesn't de Voort like doesn't


---------06:43----------
separate different fields of medicine


---------06:45----------
like they don't think that you don't


---------06:46----------
have a psychiatrist and a cardiologist


---------06:48----------
you have one person who does everything


---------06:49----------
and the reason that they do everything


---------06:51----------
they specialize more in terms of methods


---------06:53----------
but not like organs


---------06:56----------
and so what I what I liked about like so


---------07:02----------
I just didn't believe that like you can


---------07:04----------
understand the mind without


---------07:05----------
understanding the body and that's why I


---------07:07----------
decided to become a psychiatrist instead


---------07:08----------
of a psychologist sort of it's kind of


---------07:11----------
like it's not quite like that because


---------07:14----------
the order of operations was a little bit


---------07:15----------
different but that's why I like becoming


---------07:18----------
a medical doctor and I didn't shift


---------07:19----------
gears because I wanted to understand the


---------07:21----------
body as well as the mind and and I know


---------07:24----------
that psychologists don't get a lot of


---------07:25----------
bodily training and I know that that's


---------07:27----------
kind of how our system works but I think


---------07:29----------
a lot of emerging evidence around like


---------07:31----------
brain got stuff clearly demonstrates


---------07:34----------
that there's a link between the body and


---------07:35----------
the mind and I ultimately the end of the


---------07:38----------
day I feel like if you don't understand


---------07:40----------
the body you're depriving yourself of a


---------07:43----------
lot of tools to help them on


---------07:47----------
I just a fact it doesn't mean that


---------07:49----------
psychologists aren't good at what they


---------07:51----------
do it doesn't mean that they can't do a


---------07:52----------
wonderful job it's just in my opinion I


---------07:54----------
wanted to understand it all


---------07:56----------
like I like understanding spirituality I


---------07:58----------
like understanding neuroscience I like


---------08:00----------
understanding everything I don't like


---------08:02----------
understanding just one part of something


---------08:03----------
like that feels incomplete to me so it's


---------08:06----------
fine to have a trippy experience in


---------08:07----------
meditation what's it doing to my brain I


---------08:09----------
want to know that neuroscientific I want


---------08:12----------
to understand how things work that's why


---------08:14----------
I decided to become a psychiatrist sort


---------08:16----------
of when I went to medical school it was


---------08:18----------
still sort of this idea of like okay I'm


---------08:20----------
just gonna like set a target and it's


---------08:21----------
gonna be kind of arbitrary so I actually


---------08:23----------
decided to become a oncologist first and


---------08:28----------
a switch to psychiatry in my fourth year


---------08:32----------
how do we fix brain gut stuff we'll talk


---------08:35----------
um so I decided to become a psychiatrist


---------08:38----------
actually in my fourth year because I


---------08:39----------
realized that like actually I don't know


---------08:41----------
why I didn't realize this sooner but I


---------08:43----------
actually really liked the mind and


---------08:45----------
that's always been what's interested in


---------08:46----------
me so I decided to do psychiatry um but


---------08:50----------
I you know I some thoughts that


---------08:51----------
psychiatrists aren't real doctors and


---------08:53----------
all that good stuff because like my dad


---------08:54----------
was an oncologist and I sort of


---------08:56----------
idealized him and things like that and


---------08:58----------
like I wanted to be a real doctor


---------08:59----------
does I still had a lot of ego right so I


---------09:01----------
wanted to be someone that saves lives


---------09:03----------
and like treats heart attacks and like


---------09:05----------
I'm gonna cure cancer I'm gonna be a


---------09:08----------
surgeon I was like debating becoming a


---------09:10----------
trauma surgeon for a little while and


---------09:13----------
was like leaning towards oncology


---------09:15----------
because I wanted to be like a holistic


---------09:16----------
cancer doctor use like herbs treat


---------09:20----------
cancer and then like teach them yoga and


---------09:21----------
teach them how to meditate and like help


---------09:24----------
them become what connected with their


---------09:25----------
spirituality before they died and like


---------09:27----------
all this good stuff


---------09:31----------
and so that's kind of how I became a


---------09:35----------
psychiatrist
