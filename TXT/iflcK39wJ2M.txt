---------00:00----------
you should also accept that like you


---------00:01----------
weren't perfect a year ago


---------00:03----------
or two years ago or three years ago or


---------00:05----------
four years ago or


---------00:07----------
shockingly you're not perfect now and


---------00:09----------
that each and every iteration of you.exe


---------00:13----------
has bugs how to know what to fix


---------00:16----------
and change versus accepting who you are


---------00:19----------
i know dr k


---------00:20----------
talks a lot about not trying to be


---------00:22----------
someone you're not


---------00:24----------
but how do you know what you should


---------00:26----------
change about yourself versus accept


---------00:29----------
if i'm not happy with who i am should i


---------00:31----------
try to change or should i learn to


---------00:33----------
accept myself


---------00:34----------
okay let me explain something to y'all


---------00:37----------
really simple accepting yourself has


---------00:40----------
nothing to do with


---------00:41----------
with not changing where on earth and i


---------00:44----------
don't blame this person


---------00:46----------
but where on earth is a society did we


---------00:48----------
say that once you accept something


---------00:50----------
that's the way it is forever


---------00:51----------
this is the biggest problem do you guys


---------00:55----------
get this


---------00:56----------
like this person was conditioned to


---------00:58----------
think that accepting yourself means not


---------01:00----------
doing anything


---------01:01----------
and like this causes so many problems


---------01:04----------
right like


---------01:04----------
if you can't accept me at my worst you


---------01:07----------
don't deserve me at my best


---------01:08----------
therefore i'm gonna be a [ __ ] half of


---------01:11----------
the time


---------01:12----------
and if you don't like me i'm gonna feel


---------01:14----------
self-righteous


---------01:15----------
and call you selfish it's your fault


---------01:18----------
that you can't accept me i don't need to


---------01:20----------
change you don't deserve the good parts


---------01:23----------
of me


---------01:23----------
if you're not willing to take the dumps


---------01:26----------
that i


---------01:27----------
dump in your mouth twice a week


---------01:31----------
where where on earth did we start


---------01:34----------
thinking that accepting people means


---------01:38----------
that they shouldn't change


---------01:39----------
because in my experience like actually


---------01:43----------
changing starts with acceptance so like


---------01:45----------
i'm an addiction psychiatrist chat


---------01:48----------
what that means is i deal with addicts


---------01:51----------
so these people come in and there are


---------01:53----------
two kinds of people that come in


---------01:55----------
one is i'm addicted to alcohol


---------01:59----------
i have a problem does that when someone


---------02:02----------
comes in and they accept


---------02:03----------
that they have a problem do i say to


---------02:05----------
them good job you accepted that you have


---------02:07----------
a problem


---------02:08----------
now don't change at all because


---------02:10----------
acceptance means you don't need to do


---------02:11----------
anything else


---------02:12----------
go out there and drink bro you're an


---------02:14----------
alcoholic so you should just keep


---------02:16----------
drinking and you accept that


---------02:17----------
and that's gonna be peace and


---------02:19----------
mindfulness and all that crap


---------02:21----------
no and then


---------02:25----------
comes in the second type i don't have a


---------02:28----------
problem


---------02:30----------
which one of those people is going to


---------02:31----------
change acceptance is the first


---------02:34----------
step to changing accept where you are


---------02:37----------
and then do something about it


---------02:38----------
the two go hand in hand so when someone


---------02:41----------
comes in and says dr k


---------02:42----------
i'm an alcoholic i'm like sweet now we


---------02:45----------
know what the problem is


---------02:46----------
let's [ __ ] fix it and then for the


---------02:49----------
person who's like i don't have a problem


---------02:52----------
there's nothing to change person's not


---------02:55----------
going to change


---------02:56----------
so this is what i want you all to do how


---------02:58----------
do you know what to accept


---------03:00----------
and how do you know what to change the


---------03:01----------
answer is everything


---------03:04----------
accept each and every aspect of yourself


---------03:07----------
whatever you are right now this is the


---------03:09----------
present i know this sounds kind of weird


---------03:11----------
but you can't do anything about anything


---------03:14----------
that has happened before now


---------03:16----------
there is literally if you were if you


---------03:18----------
have graduated from college and you


---------03:19----------
don't have a job one year


---------03:21----------
out because of the pandemic there is


---------03:23----------
nothing you can do about that


---------03:24----------
so accept it you are a college graduate


---------03:28----------
with no job for one year


---------03:30----------
and then change it the problem is that


---------03:33----------
the reason we tell you guys to accept is


---------03:35----------
because so many people get


---------03:36----------
caught up trying to rewrite history


---------03:39----------
instead of accepting the present


---------03:40----------
if i had done this if i had done that if


---------03:43----------
the pandemic this


---------03:44----------
if this person did that if my parents


---------03:46----------
did this if this if that


---------03:47----------
then i would not be here and all of that


---------03:51----------
thinking is completely useless


---------03:53----------
because that [ __ ] happened there are no


---------03:56----------
ifs


---------03:58----------
life like reality is here you are


---------04:01----------
unemployed


---------04:02----------
accept it and then people are sort of


---------04:04----------
like but then what about all the self


---------04:06----------
blame and shame and all that crap yeah


---------04:07----------
so like work through that right that's


---------04:09----------
what we're here for too


---------04:11----------
but understand that like it's not your


---------04:13----------
fault that you made mistakes


---------04:15----------
before i know it sounds kind of weird


---------04:17----------
you made those mistakes but like the


---------04:19----------
person that's here now


---------04:20----------
has to clean that [ __ ] up like


---------04:23----------
the you of today is not the same you


---------04:25----------
that was there a year ago it's kind of


---------04:27----------
weird


---------04:28----------
right like you have to like whatever you


---------04:31----------
did what you did


---------04:32----------
should you you can beat yourself up for


---------04:33----------
it if you want to you can also accept


---------04:34----------
that you just made mistakes


---------04:36----------
and then change it's not your fault


---------04:39----------
it's the dude from a year ago do you


---------04:42----------
guys get that it's kind of weird


---------04:44----------
but like when i was 21 and failing in


---------04:46----------
college that wasn't me


---------04:48----------
it's not the me of today it's the me of


---------04:50----------
yesterday those are completely different


---------04:51----------
people


---------04:53----------
completely different people you'll get


---------04:55----------
that like 17 years ago when i was


---------04:57----------
failing out of college and went to india


---------04:59----------
for the first time i was not dr k


---------05:01----------
how on earth can i blame that kid for


---------05:04----------
what he did like he didn't know any


---------05:05----------
better


---------05:07----------
the poor kid was so confused


---------05:11----------
he was grown up indian his parents were


---------05:12----------
like you got to be a doctor to mean


---------05:14----------
something in life


---------05:15----------
he had a boner for going to harvard and


---------05:18----------
had zero chance of going there


---------05:20----------
like the kid like needed help why am i


---------05:23----------
going to blame that


---------05:24----------
kid like he didn't know what he was


---------05:25----------
doing


---------05:27----------
like how on earth could i expect that


---------05:30----------
this kid would understand what i


---------05:31----------
understand now


---------05:34----------
clueless kid it's not as bad like he did


---------05:36----------
the best that he could like he was just


---------05:38----------
so clueless like


---------05:39----------
cut the kid a break he did what he could


---------05:41----------
and 17 years later


---------05:43----------
theoretically it's the same mind and the


---------05:45----------
same body but it's a completely


---------05:46----------
different person


---------05:48----------
so accept yourself where you are if you


---------05:50----------
made mistakes you made mistakes


---------05:53----------
right that's the nature of things you're


---------05:54----------
not born you don't


---------05:56----------
pop out of your mother's womb at level


---------05:58----------
100


---------05:59----------
you pop out of your mother's womb at


---------06:01----------
level one and then here you guys are


---------06:03----------
at level 22 beating yourselves up for


---------06:06----------
being


---------06:07----------
level six and not being able to do stuff


---------06:10----------
when you spawn into this world you're


---------06:12----------
level one


---------06:13----------
and depending on the rng sometimes you


---------06:16----------
spawn with good gear


---------06:19----------
sometimes you spawn with like some sweet


---------06:21----------
loot right


---------06:22----------
like you're in a guild and they like


---------06:24----------
give you all these legendaries


---------06:26----------
and so even though you're level one you


---------06:28----------
could still down level 10 mobs


---------06:30----------
and some of y'all are born at level one


---------06:32----------
and you're actually like given debuffs


---------06:34----------
because of your upbringing and then you


---------06:36----------
beat yourselves up for being level 15


---------06:38----------
and we're grinding on level 10 mobs


---------06:41----------
that's because


---------06:42----------
your parents gave you cursed gear and


---------06:44----------
it's like giving you penalties and stuff


---------06:47----------
and so what does it mean to accept it


---------06:48----------
means like this is what self-compassion


---------06:51----------
is


---------06:51----------
you know we talk like oh like just have


---------06:53----------
self-compassion man just forgive


---------06:55----------
yourself bro


---------06:56----------
learn to love yourself like that's what


---------06:57----------
that is how do you do that


---------07:00----------
it's by acknowledging that the kid who


---------07:01----------
was 17 years ago didn't know [ __ ]


---------07:04----------
why am i gonna blame him this guy can't


---------07:06----------
do anything


---------07:07----------
he's a noob i'm gonna get mad at him


---------07:10----------
i don't have i don't have the time to


---------07:12----------
get mad at him i have [ __ ] to do


---------07:15----------
and you guys should realize that too


---------07:17----------
like why are you beating yourself up


---------07:18----------
okay like two years ago you fell in love


---------07:19----------
with a girl


---------07:21----------
and you were like one of these nice guys


---------07:24----------
so you like asked her out


---------07:25----------
and then she said no then you call her


---------07:27----------
the c word and now she won't talk to you


---------07:29----------
and then you feel like such an idiot


---------07:31----------
it's like yeah you were an idiot but


---------07:33----------
like did you know any better


---------07:34----------
really are you gonna do it again so


---------07:37----------
accept that you did it


---------07:39----------
accept that you don't know what you're


---------07:40----------
doing and then like change


---------07:42----------
right become a decent human being work


---------07:44----------
on it try to understand yourself so you


---------07:46----------
should accept


---------07:47----------
each and everything about yourself you


---------07:49----------
should also accept that like you weren't


---------07:50----------
perfect a year ago or two years ago or


---------07:53----------
three years ago


---------07:54----------
or four years ago or shockingly you're


---------07:56----------
not perfect now


---------07:58----------
and that each and every iteration of


---------08:00----------
u.exe


---------08:02----------
has bugs and it's going to make mistakes


---------08:06----------
and you should debug that [ __ ] and


---------08:09----------
improve whatever bugs you have


---------08:11----------
it's like you know you dot exe


---------08:15----------
version 2.29


---------08:18----------
and then u.exe version 2.31


---------08:21----------
but like you got to accept like you got


---------08:24----------
to accept that there are some bugs there


---------08:25----------
before


---------08:26----------
you can fix them right and so life is a


---------08:28----------
process


---------08:29----------
of like balance patches and bug fixes


---------08:34----------
and you are the program so you should


---------08:37----------
absolutely accept


---------08:39----------
and absolutely change nah see look so


---------08:42----------
someone's saying okay be careful i'm so


---------08:45----------
bugged


---------08:46----------
i'm [ __ ] maybe kind of true but let's


---------08:48----------
be clear


---------08:50----------
because one of the tricky things about


---------08:52----------
the process


---------08:53----------
is that our debugging process is


---------08:55----------
sometimes messed up


---------08:56----------
so when you have things like depression


---------09:00----------
like it's gonna tell you that things are


---------09:02----------
way worse than what you are but that's a


---------09:04----------
diagnostic that's produced


---------09:06----------
by your mind so you can't trust it


---------09:10----------
right it's tricky because in the mind of


---------09:12----------
a depressed person they're gonna say


---------09:13----------
it's so hopeless there's nothing that i


---------09:16----------
can ever do to fix it


---------09:17----------
there's no point in trying that's that's


---------09:20----------
a bug it's not a feature


---------09:23----------
your mind telling you that is a bug it's


---------09:26----------
not a feature


---------09:27----------
learning what you can trust about your


---------09:29----------
mind is one of the most useful skills


---------09:31----------
that i've ever learned so it's funny


---------09:33----------
because someone's saying ncs every bug


---------09:35----------
is a feature yeah


---------09:36----------
so we've got a good video about this


---------09:38----------
about on dr k's guide but


---------09:40----------
depression is a feature too chat right


---------09:42----------
so like i want you all to think about


---------09:43----------
this for you it's gonna be wild okay


---------09:44----------
think about this


---------09:46----------
depression is a conserved experience


---------09:48----------
across the human race


---------09:50----------
conservative experiences across the


---------09:52----------
human race tend to have


---------09:53----------
evolution behind them so it's actually a


---------09:56----------
feature


---------09:57----------
and what it comes down to is we have


---------09:58----------
this part of our brain called the


---------10:00----------
default mode network


---------10:01----------
and depression is the evolutionary price


---------10:03----------
we pay for having a default mode network


---------10:06----------
so what happened in our brain is we


---------10:08----------
developed the capacity for


---------10:09----------
self-reflection


---------10:11----------
so like if you look at what's different


---------10:13----------
about humans versus most animals it's


---------10:15----------
metacognition


---------10:17----------
we can think about ourselves so instead


---------10:19----------
of trial


---------10:20----------
just doing pavlovian conditioning and


---------10:22----------
trial and error


---------10:23----------
i can like think about myself right so


---------10:26----------
instead of just figuring out what works


---------10:28----------
in relationships after i have three


---------10:30----------
terrible relationships


---------10:31----------
my brain has the capacity using the


---------10:34----------
default mode network to think about


---------10:35----------
myself


---------10:36----------
and then i can ask myself the question


---------10:38----------
hey am i doing something wrong in


---------10:40----------
relationships


---------10:41----------
it's a meta-level question it's not like


---------10:44----------
if you know there's like the


---------10:45----------
relationship level question there's the


---------10:46----------
metal


---------10:47----------
am i doing something wrong not is this


---------10:50----------
wrong in a relationship


---------10:52----------
am i doing something wrong


---------10:55----------
that capacity for metacognition the


---------10:57----------
ability to think about ourselves


---------10:59----------
is what allows us to dominate the planet


---------11:02----------
because our problem-solving capability


---------11:04----------
it's like we have an


---------11:04----------
ai in our brain that can like problem


---------11:06----------
solve


---------11:08----------
it's not just pavlovian conditioning


---------11:09----------
it's not like stimulus response


---------11:11----------
reinforcement


---------11:12----------
it's like thinking about something on a


---------11:14----------
higher level


---------11:15----------
and that part of the brain is called our


---------11:17----------
default mode network


---------11:18----------
the interesting thing is that default


---------11:20----------
mode network is hyperactive in


---------11:21----------
depression


---------11:23----------
so what happens in depression is we


---------11:25----------
think about ourselves too much


---------11:27----------
the circuit is stuck on oh could i be


---------11:29----------
doing this something better oh i'm so


---------11:30----------
dumb


---------11:31----------
i'm so bad the reason that i didn't get


---------11:32----------
that job is because i'm so bad


---------11:35----------
you're thinking about you instead of the


---------11:37----------
job


---------11:38----------
it's all like up here in a metacognitive


---------11:40----------
level the oh people


---------11:42----------
would be better off without me oh the


---------11:44----------
only reason that people are inviting me


---------11:46----------
is because they're trying to be polite


---------11:47----------
they could never like me


---------11:48----------
it's all metacognitive thoughts about


---------11:50----------
you as a person


---------11:51----------
outside of the actual interaction and so


---------11:55----------
what we discovered is this thing called


---------11:56----------
the default


---------11:56----------
network and when it goes haywire which


---------11:58----------
allows human beings to be metacognitive


---------12:00----------
when it goes haywire we get depressed


---------12:03----------
and so then you can even ask the


---------12:04----------
question okay what about


---------12:06----------
you know so theoretically if i gave


---------12:08----------
someone a chemical


---------12:10----------
that shot off the default mode network


---------12:11----------
would it cure their depression


---------12:13----------
and the answer is yes yes it will


---------12:16----------
we have chemicals that do that now


---------12:18----------
that's how the psychedelics tend to work


---------12:20----------
cure is a strong word but you know it's


---------12:22----------
how they tend to function


---------12:24----------
and then also meditation shuts off the


---------12:26----------
default remote network


---------12:27----------
interesting look at that meditation is a


---------12:31----------
clinically


---------12:32----------
effective treatment for depression and


---------12:34----------
it happens to shut off the default mode


---------12:36----------
network


---------12:36----------
i wonder if there's a connection just


---------12:38----------
from a safety perspective they don't


---------12:40----------
cure depression


---------12:41----------
and secondly all of these things should


---------12:43----------
be used under the guidance of a medical


---------12:45----------
professional


---------12:46----------
because while they may have therapeutic


---------12:48----------
benefits from


---------12:49----------
for treating depression which are being


---------12:51----------
studied in clinical trials


---------12:52----------
jury's still out there we also want to


---------12:54----------
be really careful because i've seen


---------12:56----------
patients who have had


---------12:57----------
ptsd and perm like new anxiety disorders


---------13:00----------
from using psychedelics


---------13:02----------
so it seems like like most things like


---------13:04----------
if you think about anesthesia


---------13:06----------
right anesthesia can keep someone alive


---------13:08----------
after an accident and it can also kill


---------13:10----------
them


---------13:11----------
so most things in medicine like blood


---------13:13----------
thinners are another great example of


---------13:14----------
this


---------13:15----------
blood thinners can prevent you from


---------13:17----------
forming clots and they can cause you to


---------13:20----------
bleed to death


---------13:21----------
so most things in medicine should be


---------13:22----------
done under the guidance of a medic or


---------13:24----------
all things in medicine should be none of


---------13:26----------
the guidance of a medical professional


---------13:27----------
because what we've discovered


---------13:29----------
in medicine is that when you take some


---------13:31----------
random ass compound that exists outside


---------13:33----------
you stick it in your body


---------13:35----------
it can have good effects and it can have


---------13:36----------
bad effects


---------13:39----------
that's why we train people about how to


---------13:41----------
like give them properly
