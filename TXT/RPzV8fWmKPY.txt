coming out soon we're gonna be releasing


---------00:03----------
dr k's guides to mental health the guys


---------00:06----------
are organized into three modules


---------00:08----------
so the depression module is designed for


---------00:10----------
people to understand


---------00:11----------
like how depression works how i think


---------00:13----------
about depression


---------00:15----------
the anxiety module is for people who are


---------00:18----------
interested in learning more about


---------00:20----------
anxiety like not just from a clinical


---------00:22----------
perspective but also understanding from


---------00:24----------
a mental perspective how anxiety works


---------00:26----------
in the mind like where do anxious


---------00:27----------
thoughts come from


---------00:28----------
how do they propagate things like that


---------00:30----------
you know something that i'm super


---------00:30----------
excited about is also the meditation


---------00:32----------
module so for those of you who are


---------00:34----------
curious


---------00:34----------
about understanding you know my approach


---------00:36----------
to meditation like what are the


---------00:37----------
different


---------00:38----------
it's there's a lot of theoretical


---------00:39----------
understanding as well as


---------00:41----------
um you know 20 practices or more so if


---------00:44----------
you guys are interested in that you know


---------00:46----------
go ahead and check out the guides


---------00:48----------
so oh [ __ ] do i have to summarize now


---------00:50----------
okay what we're talking about is


---------00:51----------
dopamine detox


---------00:53----------
okay we're talking about like the actual


---------00:55----------
neuroscience of a dopamine detox


---------00:57----------
and we're about to dive into how to do


---------00:58----------
it so let me give you guys a quick


---------01:00----------
summary


---------01:01----------
so we started off by looking at like


---------01:04----------
you know other people who talk about


---------01:06----------
dopamine detox on the internet


---------01:08----------
and like really don't i don't think


---------01:10----------
there's a whole lot of good


---------01:11----------
clinical or neuroscientific information


---------01:12----------
there we went over like what the


---------01:14----------
dopamine reward circuits are what they


---------01:16----------
look like and how


---------01:17----------
messing with the dopaminergic parts of


---------01:19----------
our brain creates a particular


---------01:22----------
presentation of like dopamine tolerance


---------01:25----------
okay


---------01:26----------
that presentation is characterized by


---------01:28----------
three things so as a clinician


---------01:30----------
the three things that i look for when


---------01:32----------
i'm thinking about recommending a


---------01:33----------
dopamine detox are


---------01:35----------
number one you are compelled towards a


---------01:39----------
behavior


---------01:40----------
that you don't enjoy okay


---------01:43----------
number two there is a war


---------01:47----------
in your brain between the things that


---------01:48----------
you know you should be doing


---------01:51----------
and that but you can't what you should


---------01:53----------
do always


---------01:54----------
loses to like this impulsive like


---------01:57----------
behavioral like fast food kind of


---------01:59----------
enjoyment sort of thing


---------02:01----------
so i should be working on my resume but


---------02:02----------
i'm just gonna queue for


---------02:04----------
a game of valor interleague or whatever


---------02:05----------
okay third thing


---------02:07----------
is that activities that seem pleasurable


---------02:10----------
to other people


---------02:11----------
don't seem to be as enjoyable to you so


---------02:13----------
if you kind of check those three boxes


---------02:15----------
and you have a


---------02:16----------
c constant constant stream of like


---------02:18----------
dopaminergic activity like video games


---------02:20----------
or social media or reddit or whatever


---------02:22----------
then you may be right for dopamine detox


---------02:24----------
okay now we're gonna get to the actual


---------02:27----------
okay so dr k


---------02:28----------
how do you dopamine detox remember


---------02:32----------
that the first thing is that what we


---------02:34----------
want to do is give our brain a chance to


---------02:36----------
down regulate the receptors


---------02:38----------
so what we're talking about is probably


---------02:40----------
a two week minimum


---------02:42----------
of dopamine detox okay otherwise your


---------02:45----------
receptors aren't gonna doubt like


---------02:47----------
they're not gonna upregulate the way


---------02:48----------
that they should


---------02:49----------
that's the first thing the second thing


---------02:50----------
to understand is that the main problem


---------02:52----------
with the dopamine detox


---------02:54----------
is boredom so what i want you all to


---------02:56----------
mentally prepare yourselves for


---------02:58----------
is that the way that your dopamine


---------02:59----------
circuitry is wired


---------03:01----------
things that should feel pleasurable are


---------03:04----------
not going to feel pleasurable


---------03:05----------
so what you're going to deal with is two


---------03:07----------
weeks of boredom that's the raid boss


---------03:09----------
okay


---------03:09----------
it's not about like withdrawal it's not


---------03:12----------
about like


---------03:12----------
you know sweats or like you're just


---------03:14----------
gonna be bored


---------03:16----------
so you need to be mentally prepared that


---------03:18----------
what you're going to be fighting against


---------03:19----------
is boredom


---------03:20----------
okay next thing to consider


---------03:24----------
is that um what we want to really try to


---------03:26----------
do is minimize


---------03:27----------
our dopaminergic activity and what i


---------03:29----------
mean by dopaminergic activity it doesn't


---------03:30----------
mean that you actually can't have


---------03:32----------
fun what i want you all to minimize is


---------03:34----------
that compulsive behavior that you don't


---------03:36----------
actually enjoy


---------03:37----------
so video games social media content


---------03:40----------
aggregation so steer clear of like


---------03:42----------
reddit youtube things like that


---------03:44----------
um some things that involve like


---------03:46----------
technology are totally fine like so for


---------03:48----------
example if you want to watch a movie


---------03:49----------
even watch


---------03:50----------
one movie every day i think that's


---------03:52----------
totally fine


---------03:54----------
time limited not like constant scrolling


---------03:57----------
stuff


---------03:58----------
time limited enjoyable activities even


---------04:01----------
involving technology are completely fine


---------04:03----------
you want to steer clear of the stuff


---------04:05----------
that your brain veges out on so don't


---------04:07----------
binge watch a tv show


---------04:09----------
no vegging out while you're watching


---------04:11----------
like netflix or amazon prime or


---------04:13----------
something like that


---------04:14----------
no binge watching anime you want to


---------04:16----------
watch like


---------04:17----------
a naruto movie like go for it it's not


---------04:19----------
going to be fun either way whether your


---------04:20----------
dopamine system is messed up or not


---------04:23----------
right so you can actually watch like a


---------04:25----------
movie like by all means go for it


---------04:27----------
no big deal so dopamine detox two weeks


---------04:30----------
main thing that you're going to have to


---------04:31----------
deal with is boredom you want to cut out


---------04:34----------
dopaminergic activities


---------04:35----------
so these are like the the the dirty


---------04:39----------
like the mcnuggets of dopamine that you


---------04:42----------
do right so like content aggregation


---------04:45----------
like video games even stuff like twitch


---------04:47----------
like discrete technological activities


---------04:49----------
that are highly enjoyable


---------04:51----------
and like a short limited time span are


---------04:54----------
actually fine if you want to watch


---------04:55----------
one movie a day go for it okay so the


---------04:58----------
other thing that i would recommend so


---------04:59----------
like like the way that you're gonna do


---------05:01----------
this successfully so since boredom is


---------05:03----------
your enemy like planning out your day is


---------05:05----------
gonna be a huge part of it okay


---------05:07----------
books audiobooks doing stuff in nature


---------05:10----------
cleaning cooking


---------05:10----------
adopt uh skills like like a skills


---------05:13----------
learning program or something like that


---------05:15----------
those kinds of things are going to be


---------05:16----------
your your bastion so what i would say is


---------05:18----------
like you know on a


---------05:19----------
let's say you want to start on the


---------05:20----------
weekend so friday evening what you're


---------05:23----------
gonna do is grocery shopping


---------05:25----------
and you're gonna plan out your meals for


---------05:26----------
like saturday and sunday


---------05:28----------
you're gonna plan out okay like this is


---------05:30----------
what i'm gonna do in the morning


---------05:31----------
this is what i'm gonna do in the


---------05:32----------
afternoon get yourself like a good


---------05:34----------
audiobook


---------05:35----------
okay so like good audiobooks are going


---------05:37----------
to be really really important for like


---------05:39----------
relatively boring activities so while


---------05:41----------
you're cleaning your kitchen like listen


---------05:42----------
to an


---------05:43----------
audio book find a good podcast you want


---------05:45----------
to be like doing stuff


---------05:47----------
and the more that you pack your day the


---------05:49----------
better off it's going to be


---------05:50----------
in terms of like you know not relapsing


---------05:54----------
because remember that when you relapse


---------05:56----------
what's gonna happen is your mind is


---------05:57----------
gonna be bored and before you realize it


---------05:59----------
you're gonna pick up your phone and


---------06:01----------
you're just gonna be like on twitch or


---------06:03----------
whatever


---------06:03----------
or youtube or whatever okay so social


---------06:07----------
activities


---------06:07----------
are also really good so like i think


---------06:09----------
board game night totally fine like by


---------06:11----------
all means get together with a few of


---------06:12----------
your buddies


---------06:13----------
play some terraforming mars like play d


---------06:16----------
d like go for it like a good six eight


---------06:18----------
hour session of d


---------06:19----------
with people ideally in person because


---------06:21----------
you got to be careful about computers


---------06:22----------
because it's really easy to open up tabs


---------06:23----------
when you get bored and things like that


---------06:25----------
so i'd steer clear of that but like it's


---------06:27----------
totally fine to do


---------06:28----------
fun activities i think if you want to do


---------06:30----------
something like go camping like that's


---------06:31----------
the perfect time to do a dopamine detox


---------06:33----------
because you got to do things like


---------06:35----------
pitching your tent and like you know


---------06:37----------
making your food and then like you know


---------06:39----------
like changing and like camping like has


---------06:41----------
stuff involved


---------06:42----------
so spending time in nature going hiking


---------06:44----------
those are fantastic opportunities to do


---------06:46----------
dopamine detoxes so if you guys are


---------06:48----------
doing something like going on a ski trip


---------06:50----------
or going on vacation


---------06:51----------
this is a good opportunity for you to


---------06:53----------
like take stuff off of your phone right


---------06:55----------
like remove reddit from your phone


---------06:57----------
remove all that stuff if you have


---------06:59----------
something like a tablet by all means


---------07:00----------
download like three movies over the


---------07:02----------
course of a week


---------07:03----------
and that's like what you're gonna watch


---------07:05----------
but you're not gonna like stream random


---------07:06----------
crap


---------07:08----------
okay so next thing


---------07:11----------
um to remember is that unstructured time


---------07:13----------
is the


---------07:14----------
primary source of failure in dopamine


---------07:16----------
detox okay


---------07:17----------
when your mind is bored and you don't


---------07:19----------
have something planned it's way too


---------07:20----------
easy to like dig into the the easy


---------07:23----------
dopamine mcnugget


---------07:25----------
all right the mcdopamy so next thing to


---------07:28----------
kind of think about is that if you guys


---------07:30----------
are running into trouble


---------07:31----------
i recommend doing it with friends now


---------07:33----------
you don't have to do this necessarily


---------07:34----------
with in-person friends but i'd find like


---------07:36----------
two or three people like


---------07:38----------
um you know maybe like sometimes people


---------07:39----------
will like get together with people on


---------07:41----------
discord and things like that


---------07:43----------
where you know you'll kind of decide


---------07:45----------
okay we're gonna do dopamine detox from


---------07:47----------
you know june 9th to june


---------07:51----------
20th okay or june 22nd whatever


---------07:54----------
and then people kind of plan out okay


---------07:55----------
what's your plan like let's let's like


---------07:57----------
read a book together


---------07:58----------
let's like you know meet every day on


---------07:59----------
discord like we'll check in about how


---------08:02----------
things are going like


---------08:03----------
you know you guys can help each other


---------08:04----------
out a little bit um


---------08:07----------
and yeah that's it so


---------08:11----------
last kind of tip is remember the more


---------08:13----------
accessible the dopaminergic activities


---------08:15----------
are


---------08:16----------
the easier it is going to be to relapse


---------08:18----------
so what you want to do and this is kind


---------08:20----------
of interesting so if you look at the


---------08:21----------
research


---------08:23----------
a lot of relapses are not planned out


---------08:26----------
they're


---------08:26----------
impulse decisions so if you look at


---------08:28----------
alcohol relapses for example like i've


---------08:30----------
been sober for a year


---------08:32----------
i go to a kid's birthday party my kids


---------08:34----------
like my kids friend's birthday party


---------08:37----------
my kid's friend's dad is there and he's


---------08:38----------
like hey do you want a drink and it's


---------08:40----------
like an impulsive decision it's like


---------08:41----------
sure


---------08:42----------
everyone else is having a beer like why


---------08:43----------
can't i have a beer too and then it's


---------08:44----------
like boom relapse


---------08:46----------
then i've had 10 and i'm vomiting and


---------08:47----------
whatever


---------08:49----------
so what you want to do is increase the


---------08:51----------
activation energy and make things less


---------08:53----------
accessible


---------08:54----------
so uninstall all the video games and


---------08:56----------
then like at least you have that


---------08:57----------
amount of time so let's say that i


---------08:59----------
uninstall everything and then i like


---------09:00----------
start reinstalling it when i relapse


---------09:02----------
but then i've got like a 15 30 minute


---------09:04----------
window where i can still like


---------09:06----------
catch myself right i can get out of the


---------09:08----------
house i can go for a walk i can even


---------09:10----------
cancel the installation


---------09:12----------
so you want to give yourself time and so


---------09:14----------
like uninstall all the crap


---------09:15----------
uninstall the dopaminergic activities


---------09:17----------
log out of like your netflix account


---------09:19----------
like log out of your reddit account like


---------09:21----------
if you want to you can even use websites


---------09:23----------
that block things


---------09:24----------
like reddit and stuff like that go for


---------09:26----------
it or tools


---------09:27----------
and so that's kind of a dopamine detox


---------09:29----------
so two weeks highly structured activity


---------09:31----------
plan what you're gonna do cooking


---------09:33----------
cleaning traveling


---------09:34----------
nature books audiobooks some kind of


---------09:37----------
creative work if you want to learn a


---------09:38----------
skill


---------09:39----------
and kind of tell yourself okay at the


---------09:40----------
end of two weeks


---------09:42----------
i could learn i could have learned how


---------09:44----------
to xxx


---------09:46----------
right like whatever you want to do x y z


---------09:48----------
i could have learned how to speak


---------09:50----------
100 words of spanish in two weeks and so


---------09:53----------
work on those goals


---------09:55----------
use people's help and like that's kind


---------09:56----------
of how you do dopamine detox
