---------00:00----------
in fact what you tell me is there's a


---------00:01----------
different thought machine that's kind of


---------00:04----------
like saying like oh this is awesome like


---------00:05----------
you did a great job even though like


---------00:07----------
it's kind of a small impact


---------00:08----------
it feels fulfilling and right to you and


---------00:11----------
there are other times where on some


---------00:14----------
objective criteria in theory you're


---------00:16----------
having a bigger impact but it feels like


---------00:18----------
you're kind of a fraud yeah right so for


---------00:23----------
you to feel like you're a fraud must


---------00:26----------
mean that you believe something about


---------00:28----------
yourself


---------00:32----------
say say goodbye to chat I've never


---------00:38----------
closed chat for a stream before that's


---------00:40----------
weird


---------00:40----------
yeah um what's weird about it it feels


---------00:47----------
like I'm not live well perfect yeah but


---------00:51----------
let's just let's just trick your brain


---------00:53----------
into thinking about thousands of people


---------00:55----------
on the internet or not watching this for


---------00:57----------
sure good start so it's okay if I call


---------01:03----------
you Maya yeah I was just saying that


---------01:05----------
this is actually really fun for me


---------01:07----------
because I actually know what to call


---------01:09----------
someone yeah I just changed my name on


---------01:13----------
switch to Maya


---------01:14----------
prior to that it was my ego which is my


---------01:16----------
name okay yeah he go what is he what is


---------01:21----------
it's Japanese


---------01:23----------
my-my dad's Okinawan okay cool and so


---------01:29----------
what are we talking about today Maya um


---------01:31----------
it was difficult for me to come up with


---------01:34----------
I come up with that what but I guess


---------01:37----------
general anxiety my chat said that I


---------01:40----------
should talk about overthinking because I


---------01:42----------
do that a lot and then I have trouble in


---------01:52----------
I guess like internalizing my success


---------01:55----------
because a lot of I share a lot of my


---------01:58----------
viewership with my boyfriend who you


---------02:00----------
talk to miss Kay there Matt oh yeah says


---------02:05----------
the sky doing he's good he's good and


---------02:08----------
well actually he's playing a game right


---------02:10----------
now that makes him not so good but I


---------02:15----------
think miss Gibbs is fantastic man I like


---------02:17----------
him so much I think so too


---------02:19----------
um yeah so a lot of my growth on Twitch


---------02:23----------
happened after I after I met and started


---------02:25----------
dating him so sometimes I have trouble


---------02:28----------
like owning my success and not thinking


---------02:32----------
that it's just solely attributed to his


---------02:35----------
yeah hmm interesting


---------02:39----------
yeah it's a it's kind of a long story I


---------02:45----------
haven't been on twitch all that long


---------02:46----------
it's been just over a year okay but so


---------02:50----------
can you tell us the story yeah sure I'll


---------02:53----------
try to make it digestible um I started


---------02:59----------
when a nice in like February or


---------03:01----------
something like that and I was maxing out


---------03:06----------
it like a couple hundred viewers and


---------03:08----------
then one day I brought my Hawk out on


---------03:11----------
stream and a clip of that got put on LSF


---------03:15----------
so clips of me started getting put on


---------03:17----------
LSF why she feels um


---------03:19----------
blowing up whatever and then Matt found


---------03:23----------
me off of those clips and called me on


---------03:26----------
stream we started talking that way and


---------03:28----------
then several months later


---------03:30----------
Miska sorry ah um and then several


---------03:33----------
several months later we started dating


---------03:35----------
but my channel blew up after talking to


---------03:40----------
Matt and Hydra LSF okay and and so you


---------03:45----------
feel like your success on twitch is it


---------03:49----------
is attributed to miss get there Matt


---------03:53----------
partially yeah yeah like big partially


---------03:57----------
how do you feel about that um I don't


---------04:06----------
know I mean sometimes it doesn't bother


---------04:08----------
me it doesn't matter because I still


---------04:11----------
like what I'm doing with the platform


---------04:12----------
and I'm proud of it but it also makes my


---------04:19----------
achievements when I think about it feel


---------04:21----------
less satisfying I guess like what's


---------04:24----------
fulfilling hi guys so you're kind of


---------04:28----------
thinking like if you had done it on your


---------04:30----------
own it would mean more right and and


---------04:35----------
help me understand what what you mean by


---------04:37----------
achievements um I do a conservation


---------04:41----------
podcast on my channel every week and


---------04:44----------
I've done solidarity yeah happy Earth


---------04:48----------
Day chat I'm sorry I didn't say that um


---------04:50----------
yeah Earth Day but I do


---------04:53----------
conservation podcast every week and we


---------04:56----------
raise money I talked to a


---------04:57----------
conservationist psychologists biologists


---------04:59----------
special whatever about conservation


---------05:02----------
research and about usually a particular


---------05:04----------
species and we raise money for an


---------05:06----------
organization of their choosing through


---------05:08----------
the podcast alone or I think it's 26


---------05:11----------
episodes we've raised nearly 30 K around


---------05:17----------
and then through my streaming career


---------05:19----------
it's been well over 50 K I did a lot of


---------05:22----------
charity wow so yeah that's very cool


---------05:25----------
yeah and and how do you feel about doing


---------05:29----------
that it's the most important thing that


---------05:33----------
I've done in my life is is the podcast


---------05:36----------
and being like a powerful force in


---------05:41----------
conservation education and being able to


---------05:43----------
teach more people because before I


---------05:44----------
started streaming I had been working at


---------05:46----------
a zoo for several years doing


---------05:48----------
conservation education so like bringing


---------05:50----------
animal ambassadors out and teaching kids


---------05:52----------
and bringing them to birthday parties


---------05:54----------
and stuff like that and that's been my


---------05:56----------
thing in my dream forever so twitch kind


---------05:59----------
of just gave me a platform to do that on


---------06:01----------
a larger scale yeah my kids love that


---------06:04----------
stuff yeah like a fair and there's like


---------06:09----------
a dude there with animals mm-hmm yes and


---------06:14----------
and the interesting thing is that my


---------06:16----------
older one they like different animals so


---------06:19----------
my older one is terrified of all of the


---------06:21----------
animals that my younger one really likes


---------06:26----------
yeah you would think so but it doesn't


---------06:29----------
the younger one is oblivious that you


---------06:31----------
know the older one is scared of large


---------06:33----------
animals and snakes and crocodiles and


---------06:35----------
alligators and the younger one wants to


---------06:38----------
prevent all of them and we have to


---------06:39----------
explain to her sometimes I'll tell her


---------06:41----------
stories about you know friendly


---------06:43----------
alligators and then we actually had an


---------06:44----------
alligator in our backyard oh yeah shoot


---------06:48----------
so we have to explain to her that you


---------06:51----------
can't actually like to go up to the


---------06:52----------
water and pet the alligator it is it's a


---------06:55----------
fine line with having people fall in


---------06:57----------
love with animals and necessarily their


---------07:01----------
friends have you seen Tiger King I have


---------07:04----------
any thoughts about that can I ask you


---------07:06----------
about that or


---------07:07----------
yeah I absolutely despise the entire


---------07:11----------
series the only reason that I watched it


---------07:12----------
is because I felt the responses or the


---------07:15----------
obligation to be able to comment on it


---------07:18----------
but it's the good thing about the series


---------07:22----------
is that it exposes a lot of the really


---------07:26----------
really terrible stuff that happens in


---------07:28----------
the exotic animal industry for in the


---------07:30----------
for-profit exotic animal industry and


---------07:33----------
the exploitation that that comes with


---------07:36----------
cub petting and animal interactions and


---------07:40----------
especially with big cats so I think that


---------07:42----------
the best thing that came out of that


---------07:44----------
series is everyone who watched it I


---------07:46----------
think would now be uncomfortable going


---------07:48----------
to a facility and doing like cub petting


---------07:50----------
you know and that's huge cuz that's


---------07:53----------
that's been going on forever and there


---------07:54----------
are a lot of animals that aren't going


---------07:56----------
to suffer anymore because of the series


---------07:59----------
but it was really frustrating to watch


---------08:01----------
first we rust rating to watch about it


---------08:05----------
the animal husbandry


---------08:07----------
in the series the I mean the dynamics


---------08:10----------
between the people from you know a


---------08:13----------
normal person perspective or pretty wild


---------08:17----------
just the the lack of care for the


---------08:23----------
animals in the amount of care for the


---------08:24----------
for the profit and for the power


---------08:26----------
there's frustrating yeah you see that a


---------08:28----------
lot in in exotics when you have


---------08:30----------
something that people aren't supposed to


---------08:32----------
have you know or that most people don't


---------08:34----------
have so interesting okay yeah so you


---------08:37----------
know I've just been listening for you're


---------08:39----------
overthinking the course of this Congress


---------08:42----------
say I haven't seen it yeah well that I


---------08:48----------
guess that's good okay you're fine and


---------08:53----------
overthinking for me at this point in my


---------08:57----------
life is pretty much only about streaming


---------09:00----------
stuff I think so help me understand what


---------09:04----------
you mean by overthinking or what you're


---------09:06----------
because we're taking advice from chat


---------09:08----------
nowadays what your what your chat feels


---------09:10----------
about you ever thinking I'm trying to


---------09:15----------
think of an example


---------09:20----------
a while ago I set a goal incentive for a


---------09:28----------
sponsored stream well this happened a


---------09:29----------
couple times um yeah no so I sent a goal


---------09:33----------
incentive to add an emote and I don't


---------09:36----------
know if you're familiar with like haha


---------09:38----------
emotes but like it's a so an email like


---------09:42----------
of my face


---------09:44----------
that is like cringing and you're


---------09:46----------
supposed to use it when something or


---------09:48----------
someone says something that's not funny


---------09:49----------
but that kind of emote lens to talk the


---------09:52----------
city in chat cuz it's like you're


---------09:55----------
telling someone that they're not funny


---------09:56----------
and I said that I would add that emote


---------10:00----------
as a goal incentive for a certain amount


---------10:01----------
of downloads I think this is right I


---------10:04----------
think that's why I did that on a


---------10:05----------
sponsored stream and what is a download


---------10:10----------
it was more like I know what download is


---------10:13----------
but I may be getting this confused I'm


---------10:15----------
sure it was an incentive for something I


---------10:18----------
think it was for raid shot of Legends


---------10:20----------
and like the sponsor is they want you to


---------10:22----------
get a certain amount of downloads for


---------10:24----------
this free game you got it um and so you


---------10:26----------
keep track of how many of your viewers


---------10:27----------
have downloaded it and I think that's


---------10:29----------
all okay better um it wasn't incentive


---------10:33----------
for sure and I got I freaked out after


---------10:36----------
doing it because I was like wait are


---------10:40----------
people like do people think that I'm


---------10:41----------
just like a sellout or that I'm that I


---------10:45----------
don't care about like enabling toxicity


---------10:48----------
or are people starting to think that


---------10:50----------
like I'm not a good person because of


---------10:53----------
that emote and I freaked out and then I


---------10:55----------
deleted the emote and then chat freaked


---------10:58----------
out and they got really mad cuz they're


---------10:59----------
like you scammed this so then I added it


---------11:02----------
back shrim


---------11:03----------
yeah that's an example of overthinking I


---------11:10----------
think yeah I think I was overthinking


---------11:14----------
when I like snow balled I guess from


---------11:25----------
so that is to me sorry when I snowballed


---------11:29----------
from like I added this emote to shoot


---------11:31----------
like people think that I'm a bad person


---------11:33----------
okay so emote enabling toxicity uh-huh


---------11:39----------
I'm a bad person


---------11:41----------
Oh No


---------11:46----------
so the first thing is let's let's kind


---------11:48----------
of understand what's happening in your


---------11:50----------
mind there oh okay so let's try to


---------11:55----------
understand what's happening in your mind


---------11:56----------
there first so you say over thinking


---------11:59----------
what I'm gonna toss back at you is that


---------12:03----------
there may be a particular so I want you


---------12:06----------
to envision your mind as having


---------12:08----------
different centers of what I let's call


---------12:10----------
them thought producers so you'll have


---------12:12----------
like some part of your mind let's talk


---------12:14----------
about the internalizing growth for a


---------12:15----------
second right so you have one part of


---------12:17----------
your mind that produces thoughts like


---------12:18----------
yeah you know like at the end of the day


---------12:20----------
sure miss gif gave you a bump but people


---------12:22----------
wouldn't watch your stream if they


---------12:24----------
didn't like your content right so like


---------12:27----------
sure you got exposure through miss gif


---------12:29----------
but I don't think that I mean just based


---------12:31----------
on my understanding of twitch you know


---------12:33----------
our channel got huge bumps from a lot of


---------12:36----------
different places and at the top of the


---------12:39----------
list is probably our stream with reckful


---------12:41----------
and and so I'm grateful for that and I


---------12:44----------
think that that's like a big part of our


---------12:46----------
growth and at the same time I still


---------12:49----------
there's a part of me that says that like


---------12:50----------
sure we got like a gigantic bump from


---------12:52----------
that I mean we went from probably like


---------12:56----------
150 to like 10,000 in in terms of like


---------13:01----------
before and you know during the reckful


---------13:03----------
stream and things like that and so


---------13:05----------
certainly there's there there bumps that


---------13:08----------
happen but one of the things that I've


---------13:10----------
come to understand about twitch is that


---------13:12----------
generally speaking you know sure you can


---------13:14----------
get a bump because of a particular


---------13:15----------
interaction but people usually watch the


---------13:18----------
streams that they enjoy right like I


---------13:20----------
don't think anyone watches stream I mean


---------13:22----------
maybe people do but I generally speaking


---------13:23----------
like I know when I watch a twitch stream


---------13:25----------
i watch a Twitter stream because I enjoy


---------13:26----------
watching a twitch stream I don't do it


---------13:28----------
you know like and I find certain


---------13:30----------
streamers in certain ways but once I


---------13:34----------
find a streamer if I like a streamer I


---------13:35----------
watch the stream so let's say that


---------13:37----------
there's a part of you that sort of


---------13:39----------
understand


---------13:39----------
that produces thoughts right like that


---------13:41----------
says that okay am i you've actually


---------13:42----------
accomplished a lot and and you're you


---------13:45----------
know a good person and you're doing a


---------13:46----------
lot for the world and you're expanding


---------13:48----------
your conservation work and so be it then


---------13:51----------
there's another part of your mind that


---------13:53----------
produces other kinds of thoughts right


---------13:55----------
and this is the kind of with a part of


---------13:57----------
your mind that says ohm like maybe


---------13:58----------
you're an impostor like you wouldn't be


---------14:00----------
what you are without him and this and


---------14:03----------
that like do you see how like those two


---------14:04----------
 it's not like each of these


---------14:06----------
thoughts is independent you have like


---------14:07----------
two like thought producing machines


---------14:09----------
they're like bobble machines yeah I'm


---------14:12----------
kids so bubble machines are very common


---------14:15----------
and and so you know they just kind of


---------14:18----------
like these things in some days like one


---------14:21----------
thought machine is like more active than


---------14:22----------
another thought machine does that make


---------14:24----------
sense yeah like you wake up on one day


---------14:26----------
and you're like oh I'm a


---------14:27----------
impostor today and on another day it's


---------14:30----------
like oh like I you know I'm I'm like


---------14:32----------
trying to make the world a better place


---------14:33----------
and that's awesome so the first thing is


---------14:36----------
when you talk about overthinking I don't


---------14:38----------
know that it's it's so much that you're


---------14:39----------
thinking too much


---------14:40----------
it's I get the sense that on some days


---------14:43----------
you think from the wrong place right so


---------14:48----------
let's try to understand how that is


---------14:50----------
because then maybe we can get a control


---------14:51----------
over overthinking we don't I don't think


---------14:53----------
that thinking too much is a problem like


---------14:55----------
if you're thinking about you know


---------14:56----------
conservation work or how to make the


---------14:58----------
most of your presence on Twitch or


---------15:00----------
things like that


---------15:00----------
we definitely want you to think as many


---------15:02----------
thoughts as you can on that so the first


---------15:05----------
thing is I have an issue with the word


---------15:06----------
overthinking because I think it's a


---------15:08----------
little bit of a misdiagnosis of you know


---------15:12----------
not acknowledging it's not like your


---------15:14----------
thinking is too high or too low it's


---------15:15----------
like there are different kinds of


---------15:16----------
thinking and one source of your thinking


---------15:19----------
is kind of problematic so let's start by


---------15:23----------
understanding where that thought machine


---------15:27----------
comes from and what it looks like


---------15:29----------
so when you started when you had the


---------15:31----------
idea for the emote can you walk me


---------15:34----------
through like how you decided to do that


---------15:37----------
emote is kind of the prize for a


---------15:41----------
particular goal it had been created and


---------15:46----------
I rejected it immediately when it was


---------15:50----------
created because I didn't want it why


---------15:52----------
didn't you want


---------15:54----------
well one cuz it's a picture of my face


---------15:56----------
that I don't particularly like okay so


---------16:00----------
when you say a picture of your face that


---------16:01----------
you don't particularly like help me


---------16:02----------
understand that what I'm making like a


---------16:05----------
weird expression and kind of weird to


---------16:08----------
have face emotes in chat what what when


---------16:13----------
you see a picture of your face with a


---------16:15----------
weird expression how does that make you


---------16:18----------
feel embarrass I guess okay what are you


---------16:27----------
embarrassed by that people are gonna see


---------16:31----------
it and think that I look weird okay so


---------16:36----------
people think that I look weird what do


---------16:41----------
you mean by weird I'm not sure okay


---------16:50----------
have you felt like you look weird in the


---------16:53----------
past not particularly okay do you


---------16:59----------
remember being concerned about your


---------17:00----------
appearance when you were growing up for


---------17:02----------
sure yeah I don't think more so than an


---------17:09----------
average


---------17:09----------
young girl I'm saying yeah I'm like


---------17:14----------
middle school I was super awkward short


---------17:18----------
but weirdly lanky I had a unibrow


---------17:21----------
stringy hair all that um I started


---------17:26----------
worrying more about my appearance at the


---------17:28----------
beginning of high school when I started


---------17:30----------
learning how to use makeup I guess is


---------17:32----------
where I started and other girls started


---------17:35----------
like to me getting prettier and I felt


---------17:40----------
like I was behind the curve


---------17:41----------
so yeah when what do you remember what


---------17:44----------
kind of thoughts you had um I thought


---------17:53----------
that makeup made them look really


---------17:55----------
different in a good way and I thought


---------17:57----------
that makeup either didn't make me look


---------17:58----------
different enough or I wasn't good enough


---------17:59----------
at doing it or it made me look different


---------18:01----------
a bad way


---------18:02----------
so I think why can't I do makeup to make


---------18:04----------
me look better like they can umm why did


---------18:09----------
you need to look better to catch up I


---------18:14----------
think behind the curve is


---------18:17----------
devastating yeah so just to kind of tie


---------18:27----------
things together behind the curve is a


---------18:28----------
thought machine okay what do you think


---------18:30----------
about that sounds toxic does that make


---------18:37----------
sense at all like would because it's


---------18:39----------
kind of a vague statement I'm making I'm


---------18:40----------
like you know does know it does help me


---------18:44----------
understand what you help me understand


---------18:47----------
what you understand when I say behind


---------18:49----------
the curve is a thought machine that if


---------18:56----------
that that thinking can lend itself to a


---------18:59----------
lot like a variety of situations


---------19:02----------
absolutely for me like academically


---------19:05----------
essentially sure right so so let's just


---------19:10----------
think about this for a second so do you


---------19:12----------
feel like you're behind the curve on


---------19:14----------
Twitch a little bit not in terms of like


---------19:25----------
my viewership or my rate of growth but


---------19:28----------
there's a lot that I don't understand


---------19:30----------
about twitch just cuz I haven't been


---------19:32----------
around as long as other people a lot of


---------19:34----------
twitch history that I don't know a lot


---------19:37----------
of intricacies of streaming that I don't


---------19:39----------
understand just because I haven't had


---------19:41----------
enough experience yeah


---------19:44----------
so that doesn't sound to me like that's


---------19:45----------
a behind the curve thought that sounds


---------19:48----------
to me like someone who recognizes that


---------19:49----------
that they've been doing this for about a


---------19:51----------
year and they have a lot to learn


---------19:53----------
that doesn't mean you're behind the


---------19:55----------
curve that just means you're one year


---------19:56----------
into the car does that make sense


---------19:57----------
right yep yeah do you see the difference


---------20:00----------
there yeah like do you feel bad when you


---------20:03----------
say I have a lot to learn about twitch


---------20:06----------
no okay so now let's talk about


---------20:09----------
internalizing growth for a second do you


---------20:12----------
feel like mischief is sort of the make


---------20:16----------
that makes you look better than you


---------20:17----------
truly are is that sometimes how you feel


---------20:22----------
about it I'm having a hard time like


---------20:32----------
putting those things together okay so


---------20:34----------
maybe they're not connected let me put


---------20:36----------
it another way I'm noticing something


---------20:39----------
that you have a sense of your worth that


---------20:42----------
sometimes is low and that you have an


---------20:46----------
idea that you can do certain things to


---------20:49----------
artificially elevate your sense of worth


---------20:52----------
so let's say makeup is one example right


---------20:55----------
now we're not saying that you're


---------20:57----------
different for most people I mean most


---------20:58----------
people are like this okay that's how we


---------20:59----------
can talk about this because these are


---------21:01----------
patterns that exist with like basically


---------21:02----------
everyone I've ever talked to


---------21:04----------
and and so I'm kind of thinking if we


---------21:07----------
take this idea that like my is not good


---------21:09----------
enough and then unless she can like do


---------21:12----------
something external that makes her good


---------21:14----------
enough or makes her appear to be good


---------21:16----------
enough I think makeup falls into that


---------21:17----------
and I'm wondering whether miss gifs bump


---------21:21----------
on your stream also sort of qualifies


---------21:23----------
under that framework of oh you couldn't


---------21:27----------
make it yourself but he's basically the


---------21:30----------
thing that elevates you beyond where you


---------21:32----------
normally belong and so the success is


---------21:36----------
not yours yeah I don't know if it's so


---------21:40----------
closely tied to music if as it is like


---------21:43----------
the bump in viewership and you're like


---------21:46----------
general like numbers I have on twitch


---------21:50----------
now like the numbers make me look like


---------21:52----------
I'm a better streamer than I am look


---------21:56----------
like a better stream of beautiful that's


---------21:58----------
exactly what I'm talking about right


---------21:59----------
where do you get the idea of what your


---------22:02----------
true like that implies that there's like


---------22:06----------
a false streamer quality in a true


---------22:09----------
streamer quality right like oh my


---------22:11----------
numbers are better than what I deserve


---------22:13----------
so where do you get the idea of like


---------22:16----------
what your gold standard is how do you


---------22:18----------
determine what you deserve how do you


---------22:20----------
determine what's right because it's


---------22:22----------
inflated yeah so where do you get the


---------22:26----------
idea of like what's true north


---------22:31----------
maybe it's because I haven't been on


---------22:37----------
Twitch that long or because my my like


---------22:42----------
life purpose or my life goal for years


---------22:44----------
has been to be a force in conservation


---------22:48----------
and before when I was working at the zoo


---------22:52----------
I was completely and fully satisfied


---------22:55----------
doing a presentation for like 30 people


---------22:57----------
a class of 30 people or like a crowd of


---------22:59----------
max a hundred people you know I was like


---------23:02----------
that's huge and I would go home and feel


---------23:04----------
really good about it and think like I


---------23:05----------
just inspired this many people today and


---------23:07----------
that's a big deal for me um I think it's


---------23:14----------
unfathomable to imagine a thousand two


---------23:19----------
thousand three thousand people watching


---------23:21----------
me and me having the same effect on that


---------23:25----------
many people so I maybe feel like there's


---------23:29----------
something not wrong but like there's no


---------23:33----------
way that I can influence this many


---------23:38----------
people just because I'm like good at


---------23:41----------
what I'm doing I like because I'm a good


---------23:43----------
stream like there must be something that


---------23:45----------
they're missing or that like I'm like


---------23:48----------
they're like being tricked into thinking


---------23:51----------
I'm some expert that I'm not or that I


---------23:55----------
like deserve this like platform and I


---------23:57----------
don't I don't know that makes sense yes


---------24:00----------
sort of okay so I'd like to ask you a


---------24:02----------
few questions about that if that's okay


---------24:04----------
sure so the first thing is I'm hearing a


---------24:07----------
common theme of like you deserve


---------24:09----------
something and you get more than you


---------24:11----------
deserve


---------24:12----------
yeah right so let me so I think the the


---------24:16----------
main question is like where do you get


---------24:19----------
the idea of what you deserve right so I


---------24:23----------
think that's a thought machine this idea


---------24:26----------
that like I don't deserve this or I'm


---------24:28----------
not good enough or I wouldn't be


---------24:31----------
somewhere because like you don't have


---------24:32----------
intrinsic value and who you are and and


---------24:36----------
that's not like a it's not an all the


---------24:38----------
time thing and I think it's beautiful


---------24:39----------
that you gave the are the


---------24:41----------
the example of when you give a


---------24:42----------
conservation lecture for 30 people


---------24:44----------
because at that time the thought machine


---------24:47----------
of I don't deserve this or I'm not a


---------24:49----------
good person or I'm not good enough is


---------24:51----------
not producing thoughts in fact what you


---------24:53----------
tell me is there's a different thought


---------24:54----------
machine that's kind of like saying like


---------24:57----------
oh this is awesome like you did a great


---------24:59----------
job even though like it's kind of a


---------25:00----------
small impact


---------25:01----------
it feels fulfilling and right to you and


---------25:04----------
there are other times where on some


---------25:07----------
objective criteria in theory you're


---------25:09----------
having a bigger impact but it feels like


---------25:11----------
you're kind of a fraud Yeah right so for


---------25:16----------
you to feel like you're a fraud must


---------25:19----------
mean that you believe something about


---------25:21----------
yourself so like if I pretend to be a


---------25:25----------
doctor if I think I'm not a real doctor


---------25:27----------
if I feel like I'm a fraud doctor even


---------25:30----------
if I'm performing the duties of a doctor


---------25:31----------
I have to have a belief that I'm not a


---------25:33----------
real doctor that comes from somewhere


---------25:35----------
right so what I'm really curious about


---------25:38----------
and I think if we really want to try to


---------25:39----------
help you Maya it's to help you


---------25:42----------
understand like where you get the idea


---------25:44----------
that you're a fraud we have to find out


---------25:47----------
where that thought machine came from do


---------25:50----------
you have any idea I think that that's


---------25:54----------
actually something that I've had for a


---------26:00----------
long time or like the idea of like I'm


---------26:02----------
the fraud thing even before before


---------26:05----------
streaming yeah I I grew up in a super


---------26:10----------
super competitive School District now we


---------26:13----------
got in there and ventured academics


---------26:18----------
early earlier and behind the curve yeah


---------26:21----------
we had like we I mean we easily have one


---------26:26----------
of the highest suicide rates in the


---------26:27----------
country like not just at my high school


---------26:30----------
but a bunch of high schools in the area


---------26:32----------
and I've always said I still say now


---------26:36----------
even though I shouldn't that and I've


---------26:40----------
said it on streem before to that I come


---------26:43----------
across as more intelligent than I am


---------26:46----------
because I've been taught in school to


---------26:49----------
like be articulate or like I have been


---------26:52----------
taught to like come across as being


---------26:54----------
intelligent but I'm not so my I want you


---------26:57----------
to I'm gonna repeat back your statement


---------27:00----------
okay I come across as more intelligent


---------27:04----------
than I am


---------27:05----------
help me understand what you see in that


---------27:08----------
statement what do you mean what I see


---------27:13----------
like what like help quick so in I guess


---------27:18----------
it's kind of read my mind question so in


---------27:20----------
that statement I see once again the


---------27:22----------
presumption that you are one thing and


---------27:24----------
that you're a fraud do you see that like


---------27:27----------
in that statement we see the same thing


---------27:29----------
I'm not I'm smarter than I appear to be


---------27:32----------
I'm not as good-looking as I appear with


---------27:34----------
makeup I'm not as successful of a


---------27:36----------
streamer as I would be unless I got the


---------27:39----------
bumps from LSF or this or that


---------27:41----------
like it's sort of this idea of act


---------27:42----------
intrinsic value and the way that the


---------27:46----------
world perceives you and the world


---------27:47----------
perceives you like you're over here but


---------27:49----------
you feel like you're over here yeah and


---------27:52----------
absolutely that started way before you


---------27:53----------
started streaming on twitch twitch is


---------27:55----------
just one manifestation that activates


---------27:58----------
that thought machine do you see like


---------28:00----------
this is like a core part of you that


---------28:02----------
frequently whether it's academics


---------28:04----------
whether it's social stuff you feel


---------28:06----------
behind the curve you feel like you're


---------28:08----------
not that other people think you're


---------28:10----------
something that you're not


---------28:12----------
yes and can I ask you some questions I


---------28:15----------
mean I know I mean I learned this lesson


---------28:17----------
the hard way where sometimes I would ask


---------28:19----------
people personal questions about whether


---------28:20----------
they grew up or where they are and you


---------28:22----------
know you don't do that on Twitch and


---------28:24----------
that's just because you know I usually


---------28:26----------
see people in the privacy of my office


---------28:28----------
where no one is watching so they can


---------28:29----------
give me details about you know what


---------28:31----------
street they grew up on but do you mind


---------28:33----------
if I ask a couple of questions because


---------28:35----------
you mentioned that we have the highest


---------28:37----------
suicide rate I thought that was a weird


---------28:39----------
thing and I'm really curious about that


---------28:40----------
can I ask I mean my my first move on


---------28:43----------
Twitch was leaking my full name so so


---------28:48----------
can you tell me where you grew up


---------28:50----------
yeah Silicon Valley okay California and


---------28:56----------
I just laughing so and tell me a little


---------29:01----------
bit about what growing up was like for


---------29:03----------
you that explains so much


---------29:05----------
oh yeah I work with a fair number of


---------29:09----------
people who are in Silicon Valley and


---------29:11----------
also have children of parents who are in


---------29:14----------
Silicon Valley so growing up I grew up


---------29:20----------
on a small farm so I've always been


---------29:24----------
around animals I was the only one out of


---------29:27----------
four I have three other siblings that


---------29:30----------
was really into animals my sister and I


---------29:36----------
are super close in age or 18 months


---------29:38----------
apart she's older I'm 21 um she's far


---------29:49----------
more academically inclined than I am she


---------29:51----------
went to an Ivy she played soccer all


---------29:56----------
through high school I also played soccer


---------29:57----------
in high school who's older she is okay


---------30:02----------
she's older by 18 months and I played a


---------30:07----------
bunch of sports


---------30:08----------
I rode horses I've been riding horses


---------30:10----------
all my life and I'm a senior at Cal Poly


---------30:15----------
San Luis Obispo but not in school right


---------30:19----------
now because of the virus okay what are


---------30:22----------
you studying agriculture agricultural


---------30:25----------
communications that's my major hmm that


---------30:28----------
sounds cool can you tell me a little bit


---------30:30----------
about that the idea of the major is to


---------30:35----------
crank out people that can work in the AG


---------30:39----------
industry that are capable of


---------30:40----------
communicating messages to consumers


---------30:44----------
better so marketers journalists


---------30:48----------
environmental lawyers stuff like that


---------30:51----------
interesting so you mentioned that she


---------30:54----------
went to an Ivy mm-hmm how do you how do


---------30:58----------
you feel about that they're mixed


---------31:01----------
feelings for sure I mean absolutely


---------31:03----------
proud she got recruited for d1 soccer as


---------31:06----------
well my sisters always been like a like


---------31:08----------
better than you in a lot of ways shay


---------31:11----------
yeah um but I was super proud that she


---------31:17----------
went to an Ivy shouldn't end up being


---------31:18----------
all that happy there


---------31:19----------
but it was cool too


---------31:23----------
to know that she got like when she got


---------31:26----------
in it was like a really big deal and


---------31:27----------
that she was going for engineering she's


---------31:30----------
always want to do engineering so it was


---------31:32----------
exciting


---------31:34----------
it also was a little bit nerve-wracking


---------31:36----------
because her going to an Ivy kind of set


---------31:38----------
the precedent that I would also I felt


---------31:43----------
that way to go to Cornell but where are


---------31:46----------
your other two siblings in terms of your


---------31:48----------
eight y'all's agency she's 23 22 23


---------31:52----------
you're 21 where where are they one of my


---------31:54----------
brothers they're half-brothers so


---------31:57----------
they're much older over there 33 and 29


---------32:03----------
and so you said it set the bar for you


---------32:11----------
and and how did you feel when that bar


---------32:14----------
was set do you remember


---------32:19----------
well I think I knew that it wasn't my


---------32:23----------
like whole life it was kind of like cuz


---------32:26----------
she's I mean she's 18 months older so


---------32:28----------
everything that she did like I was next


---------32:30----------
for you know like going to high school


---------32:33----------
than making this soccer team she was


---------32:35----------
like always setting a bar this is so


---------32:37----------
depressing


---------32:38----------
she was always setting a bar that I knew


---------32:39----------
like I couldn't hit true so um would you


---------32:44----------
say that that's when he started to feel


---------32:45----------
behind the curve yeah okay so so how did


---------32:56----------
it feel when she got into an IV cuz you


---------32:58----------
said mixed feelings like obviously


---------32:59----------
you're proud you love your sister you


---------33:01----------
respect her a lot you want her to be


---------33:02----------
happy


---------33:04----------
but and


---------33:13----------
kind of like a oh feeling what's


---------33:21----------
way in that I'm gonna ask you to dig a


---------33:24----------
little bit and if we can't get anywhere


---------33:27----------
I'll offer you some hypotheses about


---------33:29----------
what oh means yeah that I I've


---------33:33----------
never really been interested in


---------33:34----------
attending an IV I wanted to go somewhere


---------33:40----------
where I knew there was like a lot of


---------33:41----------
outdoorsy stuff and where people were


---------33:44----------
super relaxed and I might buy me my


---------33:45----------
university it's been perfect for that


---------33:47----------
but I didn't want to do like a hardcore


---------33:52----------
academics thing say I would just like


---------33:54----------
heaven I've never been into it so it was


---------33:56----------
kind of like a oh


---------33:57----------
um is this gonna make me feel worse


---------34:01----------
about not doing something as challenging


---------34:05----------
as she's choosing to do I think and did


---------34:10----------
it make you feel worse then if she


---------34:16----------
didn't know I mean so when so so you


---------34:20----------
kind of said is this gonna make me feel


---------34:23----------
okay so let me take a step back for a


---------34:25----------
second so this is what I'm envisioning


---------34:26----------
you have an idea of who you are hmm


---------34:29----------
you actually do have an idea who you are


---------34:31----------
right so we see leo Maya which is Maya


---------34:34----------
who knows she wants to like not be an


---------34:36----------
engineer and go to a school where she


---------34:39----------
can be outdoors and be involved in the


---------34:41----------
AG industry or animals or things like


---------34:43----------
that


---------34:44----------
conservationist Maya Maya who works


---------34:46----------
summers and educates kids about animals


---------34:49----------
and teaches them about conservation the


---------34:51----------
Maya who raises money for charity on


---------34:53----------
Twitch of all places this is real Maya


---------34:57----------
that Maya is one thought machine right


---------35:01----------
it makes you happy with what you


---------35:02----------
accomplish even if you're what you


---------35:04----------
accomplish this quote-unquote small and


---------35:06----------
then there's also behind the curve Maya


---------35:10----------
and what I'm hearing in oh is like


---------35:14----------
a conflict between real Maya and behind


---------35:18----------
the curve Maya so then you start to


---------35:20----------
think like oh like maybe I'm making a


---------35:22----------
mistake like maybe I should do what she


---------35:24----------
does is this good enough


---------35:27----------
my capable you said that you're not


---------35:29----------
interested in doing what she does but I


---------35:31----------
would hypothesize that you felt on some


---------35:34----------
level that you're not capable and if you


---------35:36----------
chose absolutely - yeah right I don't


---------35:40----------
think I am and and so how do you feel


---------35:44----------
about not being capable how does that


---------35:49----------
feel


---------35:54----------
I mean I recognized that I'm capable of


---------35:57----------
a lot of things that my sister's not in


---------36:02----------
being a communicator in public speaking


---------36:05----------
and you know like being internet famous


---------36:08----------
sure but like the feeling in high school


---------36:17----------
like all my friends I didn't have a


---------36:19----------
single friend that didn't attend college


---------36:21----------
and the vast majority of them went to


---------36:24----------
that are better or like more difficult


---------36:27----------
to get in colleges and I did everyone


---------36:28----------
had a higher SAT AC T Square than I did


---------36:32----------
and it always felt like I was like chat


---------36:37----------
I mean we've already talked about this


---------36:39----------
that I was just like trying to like fake


---------36:41----------
that I was as smart as they were so in


---------36:44----------
thinking that I'm not capable of going


---------36:46----------
to an IV of being an engineer or


---------36:47----------
whatever it's just kind of like it feels


---------36:50----------
like me like exposing myself like saying


---------36:52----------
like yeah like you're you're at least


---------36:54----------
being honest with yourself that you're


---------36:56----------
not well yeah I mean so when you say


---------36:59----------
exposing so being honest with yourself


---------37:01----------
sounds like a good thing exposing


---------37:03----------
yourself


---------37:03----------
sounds like a not good thing yeah right


---------37:06----------
and and so what I'm hearing is that like


---------37:09----------
the gig is up but you've been revealed


---------37:11----------
to be a fraud because you ended up at


---------37:13----------
some school that's not an IV and now the


---------37:16----------
like you know the cats out of the bag


---------37:17----------
my is actually kind of dumb is that how


---------37:21----------
you feel yeah I think that okay what is


---------37:27----------
it like to hear me say that


---------37:28----------
does it hurt


---------37:34----------
I mean my first reaction was not really


---------37:38----------
but maybe a little bit I don't know okay


---------37:45----------
so let's think about that like that's


---------37:47----------
weird right like so I think if we think


---------37:49----------
about you know your emote this would be


---------37:53----------
no this would have been a prime time to


---------37:56----------
spam the emote in this channel because I


---------37:58----------
just said something to you that seems


---------38:00----------
like it should be really hurtful right


---------38:02----------
okay like I mean literally the sentence


---------38:05----------
that I the phrase that I used or close


---------38:07----------
to it was like the cats out of the bag


---------38:08----------
oh my is dumb and isn't that what you're


---------38:13----------
afraid of people saying I feel like


---------38:16----------
people already know but that doesn't


---------38:20----------
make sense


---------38:21----------
that doesn't matter you're damn right it


---------38:24----------
does it let's do it right so what what's


---------38:28----------
weird because like even though you feel


---------38:30----------
like people already know you don't want


---------38:32----------
them to say right you want to try to


---------38:36----------
hide what you're afraid they already


---------38:38----------
know yeah so why is what happens why


---------38:45----------
doesn't it hurt when I bring it out into


---------38:47----------
the open I can't logically think of a


---------38:52----------
reason for that yeah okay great answer


---------39:01----------
no that's an accident why because it's


---------39:05----------
 confusing let me think about how


---------39:16----------
to explain this so when people find out


---------39:18----------
that you're a fraud mm-hmm what do you


---------39:21----------
envision how do they react


---------39:28----------
[Music]


---------39:31----------
I don't know how to articulate it yeah


---------39:35----------
because I don't think it's actually like


---------39:37----------
a vision right so look what are the


---------39:38----------
feelings like what like help me


---------39:41----------
understand that like what are you afraid


---------39:42----------
of them how do they make you feel or how


---------39:47----------
do you feel once they know let's start


---------39:50----------
there I've that I have some sort of like


---------39:57----------
malicious intent to like trick people or


---------40:00----------
that I've been lying I thought I'm like


---------40:03----------
not genuine mmhmm right yeah so I think


---------40:09----------
what you're afraid of in terms of a


---------40:12----------
negative reaction is that right like


---------40:14----------
it's not just them finding out it's the


---------40:16----------
judgment that they place upon you after


---------40:22----------
they find out yes it's the way that they


---------40:25----------
perceive you so now let me ask you a


---------40:28----------
question is it the fraud that hurts or


---------40:31----------
the judgment that hurts


---------40:37----------
absolutely.thank right so just think


---------40:39----------
about that for a second right because


---------40:40----------
like if someone you know if and so I


---------40:43----------
think the reason that I mean maybe this


---------40:44----------
does hurt you and you're not telling me


---------40:46----------
or tricking me but you know I think the


---------40:51----------
reason that you can hear those words for


---------40:53----------
me is because I from me is because I


---------40:55----------
actually don't judge you negatively at


---------40:57----------
all so I'm saying the words without the


---------41:00----------
judgement we're talking about you being


---------41:02----------
a fraud I see that you think you're a


---------41:04----------
fraud and I don't believe you're a fraud


---------41:05----------
at all so I think because you're an


---------41:07----------
empathic person when you look at me I


---------41:10----------
don't I don't judge you for that in fact


---------41:11----------
I think that yeah this is gonna sound


---------41:15----------
weird how can I say this it's very clear


---------41:19----------
to me that you're not a fraud the only


---------41:21----------
thing that is like wrong about you is


---------41:22----------
that you think you're a fraud like you


---------41:26----------
know who you are and I think you're


---------41:28----------
amazing and the only issue is that like


---------41:31----------
sometimes you think you should be


---------41:33----------
something that you're not and not all


---------41:35----------
the time but there are two thought


---------41:36----------
machines one thought machine is like the


---------41:38----------
genuine Myo who does like real stuff I


---------41:40----------
think that person is awesome I think the


---------41:42----------
only problem that I have is that some


---------41:43----------
times there's a part of your mind that


---------41:45----------
tells you you should be someone else and


---------41:47----------
that's the part of you that makes you


---------41:48----------
feel dumb I don't think you're dumb


---------41:50----------
first of all I don't know how many like


---------41:53----------
actual score reports you saw for SAT


---------41:55----------
scores or a CT scores but there's a


---------41:57----------
decent chance that not everyone did as


---------41:59----------
well as they they said they did right


---------42:01----------
there's also a decent chance that I


---------42:03----------
doubt that you actually had the lowest


---------42:05----------
SAT score because statistically that's a


---------42:08----------
very very unlikely I think that's


---------42:09----------
probably a cognitive bias on your part


---------42:11----------
in the same way that you had a cognitive


---------42:13----------
bias that oh like makeup makes other


---------42:15----------
people look better but it makes me look


---------42:16----------
out right yeah right so some something


---------42:22----------
about this how are you feeling right now


---------42:23----------
by the way thank okay something about


---------42:26----------
this I think comes back to this core


---------42:28----------
idea of like you're someone who's behind


---------42:30----------
the curve you're not as good as everyone


---------42:31----------
else and if it's a does that make sense


---------42:33----------
about actually before I go there does


---------42:35----------
that make sense why those words may not


---------42:37----------
hurt you because I don't I say those


---------42:38----------
words but I don't have any judgment in


---------42:40----------
fact I have a positive judgment with it


---------42:41----------
which is probably why it's confusing for


---------42:43----------
you and you're picking up my positive


---------42:45----------
judgment and you're hearing my negative


---------42:46----------
words and that doesn't fit right


---------42:49----------
okay so let me ask you this like can you


---------42:53----------
tell me a little bit more about like


---------42:54----------
growing up sure what was it like growing


---------43:01----------
up in your house pretty pretty good um


---------43:06----------
I've always made my sister I've always


---------43:09----------
been super close we did everything


---------43:10----------
together a little my brother's because


---------43:14----------
they're older I mean I grew up with them


---------43:16----------
but they left for college when I was


---------43:20----------
like on the younger side so yeah it's a


---------43:23----------
little different my parents both Silicon


---------43:29----------
Valley work full-time so we were we were


---------43:34----------
pretty much raised by babysitter's


---------43:37----------
mostly one babysitter and then she she


---------43:42----------
just like didn't pick us up one day so


---------43:43----------
then random teenage babysitters


---------43:47----------
throughout elementary school some in


---------43:50----------
middle school and


---------43:52----------
[Music]


---------43:59----------
what's it like being raised by


---------44:01----------
babysitters fine I don't I don't feel


---------44:07----------
like I ever really had a problem with


---------44:09----------
that um I didn't realize until like high


---------44:13----------
school that it was weird that they like


---------44:17----------
we only called one of them mom


---------44:19----------
but I didn't realize until high school


---------44:21----------
that that was like strange like okay I'm


---------44:25----------
gonna repeat back what I heard we only


---------44:28----------
called one of the mom yes yes I yeah


---------44:32----------
yeah but I didn't realize growing up


---------44:34----------
that that was abnormal sure what kind of


---------44:38----------
work did your parents do uh tech okay


---------44:43----------
and do you remember what your so it


---------44:51----------
sounds like you were raised by


---------44:52----------
babysitters do you understand what


---------44:56----------
happened when one of them didn't pick


---------44:57----------
you up like you said yeah yeah so she


---------45:01----------
was she was there I mean she was there


---------45:05----------
the day my sister was born so she's


---------45:06----------
absolutely there the day I was born


---------45:08----------
and then she was with us until I was in


---------45:11----------
third grade or something okay second or


---------45:15----------
third grade every day


---------45:16----------
and then she just she just didn't pick


---------45:19----------
us up from school one day and I guess


---------45:21----------
she had some sort of nervous breakdown


---------45:23----------
um but I've I mean I've well I did talk


---------45:27----------
to her about it once because I'm at some


---------45:29----------
point in high school she reached out to


---------45:30----------
my sister and like wanted to meet up


---------45:32----------
with us which was weird and then she


---------45:33----------
told us that she had a nervous breakdown


---------45:34----------
but I'm not really sure what the what


---------45:40----------
the reason was


---------45:40----------
hmm what if she lost her husband at some


---------45:43----------
point in there so that was probably okay


---------45:47----------
big part of it hmm


---------45:58----------
okay I'm just gonna think for a second


---------46:05----------
is that okay yeah of course


---------46:06----------
how's this going so far by the way good


---------46:09----------
okay you feel like you're learning any


---------46:14----------
what are you learning


---------46:15----------
I I don't usually think about the I


---------46:24----------
don't usually go that far back when I


---------46:26----------
think about anxiety or whatever so yeah


---------46:32----------
it's interesting so I've been in therapy


---------46:35----------
for I've been seeing a therapist for


---------46:38----------
just over two years and I've I do


---------46:40----------
believe Dr for like almost a whole year


---------46:43----------
and I did neurofeedback for a few months


---------46:45----------
so we've talked about it in there yes


---------46:48----------
I'm in a lot I am as why are you doing


---------46:50----------
EMDR um I had I had like deep-rooted


---------46:58----------
insecurities in my former relationship


---------47:01----------
that I wanted to figure out so we did


---------47:04----------
the EMDR and focus a lot actually on


---------47:07----------
that babysitter and about like


---------47:10----------
abandonment issues and stuff like that


---------47:11----------
and then neurofeedback was for a


---------47:15----------
separate trauma that I was hoping to I


---------47:19----------
was hoping for memory recovery because I


---------47:24----------
lost most of it but that's yeah that's


---------47:29----------
what I haven't talked about it on streem


---------47:31----------
side okay don't think you can steer


---------47:34----------
clear of it yeah okay


---------47:42----------
so I guess some things are starting to


---------47:45----------
fit together a little bit more for me so


---------47:48----------
help me understand a little bit about


---------47:50----------
what your relationship with your parents


---------47:53----------
was like my parents are great


---------47:56----------
my dad doesn't talk a lot and he's not


---------48:00----------
very affectionate but he's first


---------48:05----------
generation or he moved here when he was


---------48:08----------
17 and he's always just been really


---------48:11----------
really quiet and then my mom is super


---------48:13----------
loving and she loves animals and yeah


---------48:18----------
well we got along with and we butt heads


---------48:21----------
in high school a lot but that's cuz I


---------48:22----------
was a teenage girl that's a lot like her


---------48:25----------
normal yeah and what when you say that


---------48:29----------
your dad wasn't very affectionate do you


---------48:32----------
remember feeling like you wanted him to


---------48:34----------
be more affectionate no not he was


---------48:41----------
wouldn't be and my sister were little


---------48:42----------
and then when we got older was it but I


---------48:45----------
never thought of it as being anything


---------48:47----------
but normal


---------48:49----------
it sounds like you feel pretty stronger


---------48:51----------
like your parents love you


---------48:52----------
yeah it sounds like they're great yeah


---------48:58----------
can you in once again anything that you


---------49:00----------
don't want to talk about just let me


---------49:01----------
know what we're steering clear up can


---------49:03----------
you tell me what you mean by abandonment


---------49:05----------
issues yeah I was so the reason that I


---------49:10----------
started going to therapy was because I


---------49:13----------
was really insecure in my last


---------49:15----------
relationship like I always thought that


---------49:16----------
he was gonna leave or whatever so I went


---------49:19----------
in to figure out why that was happening


---------49:21----------
and we had a hard time figuring out and


---------49:29----------
talk therapy than my psychologist


---------49:31----------
recommended EMDR because she thought


---------49:33----------
that it was something deeper I went to


---------49:36----------
EMDR we did a bunch of sessions and I


---------49:42----------
don't remember what the session was but


---------49:45----------
we had some breakthrough session where I


---------49:46----------
like started talking about that


---------49:48----------
babysitter and how like


---------49:54----------
like any when a parent figure or


---------49:59----------
something leaves how like the kid feels


---------50:04----------
like it's their fault you know where the


---------50:05----------
kid feels like they're not good enough


---------50:06----------
or whatever what's your understanding of


---------50:08----------
that how does that work do you know like


---------50:18----------
a kid not understanding and thinking


---------50:21----------
that it's their fault that that person


---------50:25----------
left mm-hmm which I know logically isn't


---------50:28----------
the case but what do you mean logically


---------50:31----------
isn't the case like I don't I don't


---------50:34----------
think that she left because she didn't


---------50:36----------
like me oh right because because my


---------50:39----------
fault but yeah my kid brain you know


---------50:46----------
like my my therapist would say still


---------50:49----------
thinks that that's that's a thing so


---------50:53----------
that tendency of thinking that someone's


---------50:55----------
gonna leave because of me or someone's


---------50:57----------
just gonna ditch me after I think that


---------51:00----------
my relationship with them is super


---------51:01----------
secure was leaking into my my current


---------51:04----------
relationship at the time and does that


---------51:06----------
does that did that make sense to you did


---------51:08----------
you find that to be the case like was


---------51:10----------
that hypothesis kind of very helpful and


---------51:12----------
applicable yeah and and after that


---------51:15----------
session it got a little bit better but


---------51:18----------
it remains pretty pretty debilitating


---------51:26----------
throughout that relationship yeah once


---------51:30----------
again if you don't feel comfortable


---------51:31----------
asking answering this just let me know


---------51:33----------
but I was gonna I was just curious is


---------51:35----------
that still pretty active for you and


---------51:37----------
your relationship with Miskin it's not


---------51:39----------
which is really bizarre and I talked to


---------51:44----------
my therapist about that a decent amount


---------51:46----------
now I I took like I had a little over I


---------51:50----------
had about a year of being single and


---------51:53----------
doing that I at that point I had stopped


---------51:55----------
the EMDR and the neurofeedback but it


---------52:01----------
used to be like debilitating like fear


---------52:04----------
and I would be sad and what


---------52:07----------
for about him talking to other girls and


---------52:10----------
and that kind of thing and I'm not sure


---------52:13----------
if that like there's I mean there's


---------52:17----------
jealousy that comes up you know but I


---------52:18----------
don't think that it's abnormal sure for


---------52:22----------
between me and Matt um and I'm not sure


---------52:26----------
if that's because of the work that I've


---------52:27----------
done or because something's changed for


---------52:28----------
me or if it's because of differences in


---------52:31----------
Matt compared to my ex-boyfriend but


---------52:33----------
it's pretty weird which is by me to try


---------52:37----------
to explain what my understanding of that


---------52:39----------
is sure yep so let's start with with


---------52:43----------
your kid brain okay so early on when


---------52:46----------
children are young they lack something


---------52:48----------
called theory of mind in theory of mind


---------52:51----------
is the capacity to like put yourself in


---------52:54----------
other people's minds and like understand


---------52:56----------
that they have thoughts and feelings and


---------52:58----------
intentions okay so the simplest thing


---------53:02----------
the simplest reason why abandonment of a


---------53:05----------
parent parental figure leads to a sense


---------53:08----------
of you are like unlovable or there's


---------53:11----------
something wrong with you is because a


---------53:13----------
child literally does not understand that


---------53:15----------
there are other agents in the world who


---------53:17----------
can do things right they're the only


---------53:19----------
thing that exists because they don't


---------53:21----------
understand that there are other like


---------53:22----------
thinking breathing beings out there and


---------53:24----------
so anything that happens to them is


---------53:26----------
their fault because they're the only


---------53:28----------
their all-powerful in the universe in


---------53:31----------
their mind because they just don't


---------53:32----------
understand that other people exist and


---------53:34----------
this changes drastically especially in


---------53:36----------
your teenagers so you start to develop


---------53:38----------
theory of mind you know around like


---------53:40----------
maybe I mean you develop it relatively


---------53:42----------
early but it becomes really really big


---------53:44----------
when you become when you go through


---------53:46----------
puberty and in puberty the reason that


---------53:49----------
like high school is so hard in middle


---------53:51----------
school is so hard is because this is


---------53:52----------
literally when your brain develops the


---------53:54----------
capacity to understand that other people


---------53:57----------
have like lasting opinions of you and


---------53:59----------
that like if I do something this person


---------54:01----------
is gonna think this about me that


---------54:03----------
capacity like if you talk to a


---------54:05----------
seven-year-old they don't understand


---------54:07----------
that right right they don't understand


---------54:09----------
that like if you go to someone's house


---------54:11----------
and you break their thing that that


---------54:13----------
person is not gonna like you like all


---------54:15----------
they understand is that they're not


---------54:16----------
supposed to do it and they don't


---------54:17----------
understand why they're like it's dumb


---------54:19----------
like I should be


---------54:19----------
 I want right and when you become a


---------54:22----------
teenager you start to realize oh like


---------54:24----------
theory of mind is actually thing and


---------54:26----------
people think things about me and that's


---------54:27----------
really terrifying because now you have


---------54:30----------
to like balance all of these hundreds of


---------54:32----------
people that you know and what they think


---------54:33----------
about you so as for why your current


---------54:37----------
relationship and I'm not surprised at


---------54:38----------
all that it's better and that's because


---------54:41----------
I think you figured out the thought


---------54:42----------
machine so you discovered through EMDR


---------54:45----------
you figured out oh there's a thought


---------54:47----------
machine that that gives me that sources


---------54:49----------
my thoughts of insecurity and once you


---------54:53----------
discover the source of the thought


---------54:54----------
machine you can start the process of


---------54:56----------
turning it off and so I would like


---------54:58----------
literally if I were to record your


---------55:00----------
thoughts from your last relationship in


---------55:02----------
this relationship I think one of them


---------55:04----------
just had way more thoughts coming from


---------55:07----------
that thought machine and they just don't


---------55:08----------
come from this thought machine because


---------55:10----------
you just kind of turned it off and I


---------55:13----------
know it sounds kind of simple but like


---------55:14----------
honestly it kind of is and so the


---------55:17----------
interesting thing here is that I think


---------55:18----------
that you have another thought machine


---------55:21----------
which is behind the curve and somewhere


---------55:24----------
along the way and I'm not sure if it's


---------55:25----------
your parents like everyone wants to say


---------55:27----------
it's your parents like all of us


---------55:28----------
therapists and psychiatrists and stuff


---------55:30----------
like we're like all our experience I


---------55:32----------
mean you know maybe there was something


---------55:34----------
around like your dad not being quite


---------55:35----------
affectionate enough or maybe your


---------55:37----------
parents compared you did your parents


---------55:38----------
compare you a lot with your sister yeah


---------55:43----------
but not like like they wouldn't they


---------55:50----------
wouldn't say or maybe they didn't then


---------55:51----------
maybe I just think that they did but no


---------55:54----------
it's interesting right like how you're


---------55:57----------
analyzing what you said so let's not


---------55:59----------
judge what you said so what how did can


---------56:01----------
feel growing up my dad more so than my


---------56:06----------
mom but yeah I think that they that they


---------56:09----------
compared us a lot and how did you notice


---------56:11----------
that um I guess I'm just like expecting


---------56:18----------
me to do well like my sister in


---------56:21----------
elementary school they were like normal


---------56:23----------
classes in advanced math classes I think


---------56:26----------
that because my sister was always in the


---------56:28----------
advanced ones they expected me to be in


---------56:30----------
those classes as well


---------56:32----------
my sister making varsity


---------56:33----------
soccer freshman year just like it


---------56:36----------
expected me to do the same yeah I guess


---------56:41----------
that like sisters that precedent


---------56:44----------
expected me to reach that precedent and


---------56:47----------
and what was it like to not reach that


---------56:49----------
precedent I mean the interesting thing


---------56:53----------
is I I'm almost interpreting what you


---------56:55----------
said is that you weren't in advanced


---------56:57----------
math classes and you didn't end up in


---------56:59----------
varsity soccer is that true yeah how


---------57:02----------
does it um to hear me say that


---------57:04----------
explicitly what I mean it's too much but


---------57:13----------
um I don't know maybe at first maybe it


---------57:18----------
bothered me actually yes okay it did


---------57:19----------
bother me at first the first like big


---------57:22----------
example that I have is this advanced


---------57:23----------
math stuff and I would like on my own


---------57:26----------
study I actually recently I did this


---------57:28----------
YouTube video where I went through like


---------57:29----------
old school work and old pictures and


---------57:31----------
stuff and I found a letter that I wrote


---------57:34----------
to a teacher it's not in the video I


---------57:36----------
found a letter that I wrote to a teacher


---------57:37----------
about like really wanting to be an


---------57:40----------
advanced math which is like not a thing


---------57:42----------
that I mean it's not like you submit a


---------57:44----------
letter to be in advance


---------57:45----------
I like wrote a letter to my teacher for


---------57:47----------
the following year saying like can I


---------57:50----------
please be in this class which and this


---------57:53----------
was in like third or fourth grade or


---------57:54----------
something yeah and I was never in it so


---------58:02----------
at first I think it was it made me feel


---------58:06----------
bad and then later on in high school


---------58:08----------
like when I didn't get in the varsity


---------58:10----------
soccer at that point it was just like a


---------58:12----------
norm so I think it probably became


---------58:13----------
easier to to deal with oh okay hold on a


---------58:18----------
sec so no my friend i I think I think by


---------58:25----------
the time you hit high school it became


---------58:27----------
chronic right so now what we're dealing


---------58:31----------
with is something that's chronic does


---------58:34----------
that make sense yeah like your sense of


---------58:38----------
being behind the curve like now in a


---------58:40----------
sense when you say be it's become easier


---------58:42----------
to deal with


---------58:42----------
not really you've become better at


---------58:45----------
dealing with something that


---------58:47----------
that point became fact yeah so that's


---------58:52----------
bad okay so like do you understand what


---------58:59----------
I mean by that I don't really understand


---------59:03----------
why it's a bad thing yeah I understand


---------59:06----------
that you don't understand that what I'm


---------59:08----------
saying is that like you think that this


---------59:10----------
is just the way that you are yes right


---------59:14----------
so like I think that that's bad because


---------59:16----------
I don't think you're that way okay so I


---------59:19----------
think you so I think so let's just let's


---------59:22----------
think through this okay


---------59:25----------
and is it okay that we're being a little


---------59:27----------
bit more analytical instead of emotional


---------59:29----------
okay were you hoping to come in here and


---------59:33----------
have like a cathartic like oh so so I'm


---------59:39----------
gonna try it because I think you're


---------59:40----------
you've done a lot of that kind of stuff


---------59:42----------
I don't know why I believed that but now


---------59:44----------
it sort of makes sense so so I want you


---------59:51----------
to just think so first let's think about


---------59:53----------
the third grader who writes a letter to


---------59:55----------
their math teacher to be an advanced


---------59:57----------
math yeah let's talk about her like what


---------59:59----------
do you think a third grader how do you


---------60:03----------
think that third grader feels well it


---------60:07----------
definitely wasn't because I liked math


---------60:09----------
and I wanted to challenge myself third


---------60:15----------
graders don't want to challenge


---------60:16----------
themselves in any way sure yeah I've


---------60:19----------
always hated it when I was reading the


---------60:22----------
letter it felt like a really sad like


---------60:24----------
desperate attempt to find another way to


---------60:28----------
get in because I knew that I wouldn't


---------60:30----------
get him because of my test score yep so


---------60:34----------
it is sad and desperate what does that


---------60:37----------
person feel about themselves


---------60:46----------
I probably just that they're not smart


---------60:49----------
enough yeah they're not good enough


---------60:52----------
right yeah and that they have to put on


---------60:55----------
makeup to fool people they have to do


---------60:59----------
something that is outside the norm of


---------61:01----------
what normally like normal people normal


---------61:04----------
kids get in the math class by being


---------61:06----------
smart and normal people are pretty and


---------61:10----------
they can put on makeup and I'm sorry if


---------61:12----------
I'm bludgeoning you with this I think


---------61:14----------
it's related but like you know normal


---------61:16----------
people can put on makeup and look better


---------61:18----------
but like I'm fundamentally different and


---------61:21----------
so I have to go the extra mile to catch


---------61:24----------
up and be normal right you start behind


---------61:27----------
people is that how you feel about


---------61:29----------
yourself yep


---------61:31----------
so can you see how like that's what the


---------61:35----------
third grader feels about themselves


---------61:36----------
right so like you kind of said this runs


---------61:38----------
deep I completely agree and then let's


---------61:41----------
think about so let's just pause and


---------61:43----------
think about that for a second what do


---------61:45----------
you think about that third graders


---------61:46----------
beliefs do you think that those are


---------61:48----------
accurate I mean I wish that I could say


---------61:55----------
no but yeah cuz I I know that according


---------62:00----------
to that I mean if we're talking about


---------62:02----------
the math class like I know that even if


---------62:04----------
I I don't know I mean I could but even


---------62:07----------
if I were to like study harder or like


---------62:10----------
really make an effort to to test to get


---------62:14----------
in that class that I I don't think I


---------62:16----------
would have so yeah I mean I think I was


---------62:20----------
accurate and thinking that I needed to


---------62:21----------
do more to try to get in I I'm glad


---------62:24----------
you're saying that because this is so


---------62:26----------
this is where we get into a really


---------62:27----------
really tricky trap which is that we want


---------62:30----------
to be positive right what we should say


---------62:33----------
is that yeah third grader you can do it


---------62:35----------
yeah yeah like you're not actually dumb


---------62:39----------
you don't actually have to work as hard


---------62:41----------
but like the truth is that like maybe I


---------62:43----------
mean I don't think you're dumb I mean


---------62:45----------
that was kind of an inflammatory


---------62:45----------
statement but I I don't I think it's


---------62:48----------
good that you can recognize that you're


---------62:50----------
not your sister the big difference is


---------62:52----------
that third year old three third grader


---------62:55----------
you placed a value judgment on not being


---------62:59----------
yours


---------63:00----------
yeah you assumed that your sister was


---------63:04----------
like objectively better than what you


---------63:06----------
are you assumed that being an advanced


---------63:09----------
class advanced math is objectively


---------63:12----------
better than not being an advanced math


---------63:14----------
yes what I would like to help you do


---------63:17----------
Maya is to let go of that second part


---------63:20----------
the judgment because I think you're


---------63:22----------
accurate right like if you're not good


---------63:24----------
at math and you're not gonna go like if


---------63:26----------
you're not gonna study engineering in an


---------63:27----------
Ivy League university like you shouldn't


---------63:29----------
study Utley that all right you know


---------63:33----------
be the person that you want to be I


---------63:35----------
think the tricky thing is that somewhere


---------63:36----------
along the way you started judging


---------63:37----------
yourself for being who you are and you


---------63:40----------
tried to be someone else and then what


---------63:44----------
happened is when high school came along


---------63:46----------
you sort of got so good at that that it


---------63:50----------
stopped being painful hmm you just sort


---------63:53----------
of accepted it you're smiling yeah no


---------63:56----------
it's just true what's true about it what


---------63:59----------
are you thinking it's just how so that


---------64:12----------
that like that I had like tried to be


---------64:14----------
something else and then by the time I


---------64:15----------
got the high school it was it was I just


---------64:20----------
gotten used to doing that yeah right so


---------64:23----------
at that point like the problem is that


---------64:25----------
at that point it becomes fact and it


---------64:26----------
becomes baked in its like baked like you


---------64:29----------
can't take it out anymore like once you


---------64:31----------
bake a cake you know everything's in


---------64:33----------
there right and and now I think the


---------64:35----------
problem is that we see that part of you


---------64:38----------
right like we see the 3rd grader who's


---------64:39----------
not good enough for advanced math who in


---------64:43----------
your teenage years needed makeup to look


---------64:45----------
normal and and now we still see it with


---------64:47----------
your twitch stream we're like oh I


---------64:49----------
couldn't have done this on my own


---------64:51----------
because I'm not good enough like miss


---------64:53----------
kif is like I'm I'm less good and I need


---------64:56----------
these I need letters to math teachers in


---------64:59----------
order to be like the others and it's


---------65:03----------
just become true for you what do you


---------65:07----------
think about that


---------65:09----------
I think that it's accurate yeah yeah and


---------65:15----------
I think that it makes sense I'm not sure


---------65:17----------
what that means for for me or like my


---------65:22----------
identity aired what I should do about it


---------65:26----------
that I'm sure it's so let's answer that


---------65:28----------
question because that's an important


---------65:30----------
right so the first is oddly enough I


---------65:32----------
don't want you to make that untrue


---------65:36----------
it's not my place to tell you it isn't


---------65:37----------
true what I'd like for you to be able to


---------65:40----------
do and what I'd like to help you do is


---------65:42----------
free yourself of the judgment that comes


---------65:44----------
with that all right


---------65:47----------
do you play games okay I mean like I've


---------65:52----------
played some all of my allergies go No


---------65:57----------
yeah I won't worry I won't understand a


---------66:00----------
few if you make it reference so so you


---------66:02----------
work with animals right I do you have a


---------66:04----------
hawk she's an American Kestrel


---------66:10----------
okay so Kestrel is a pretty small bird


---------66:13----------
right it's not good at North America


---------66:15----------
yeah yeah so like let's think about that


---------66:18----------
for a second okay so like a Castrol is


---------66:24----------
like a Kestrel isn't as big and like


---------66:30----------
does that mean that it's worse but


---------66:37----------
generally speaking no right so so like I


---------66:41----------
want you to think about that right so


---------66:43----------
like the problem is not that factually


---------66:45----------
you aren't as smart as other people the


---------66:48----------
problem is that you don't think about it


---------66:52----------
depends on what you want to do do you


---------66:56----------
see that like it's that part of the


---------66:58----------
thought process that's missing you just


---------67:00----------
look at size you don't look at like


---------67:02----------
adaptability and it's sometimes you do


---------67:05----------
but does that make sense yeah and I


---------67:08----------
think that that's been ingrained in me


---------67:10----------
and all of my peers since we were in


---------67:13----------
preschool for that but like what you


---------67:18----------
should do is do really well in school be


---------67:21----------
really good at math be an engineer


---------67:23----------
or comp sigh and goes to school but no


---------67:31----------
one ever no one ever said like you


---------67:34----------
should like you should learn how to


---------67:40----------
train animals and you should try to go


---------67:42----------
into the AG industry and you should like


---------67:44----------
if you like doing outdoor stuff like you


---------67:46----------
should get really into it you know and


---------67:49----------
and like nurture that passion nothing to


---------67:54----------
be talks about that yeah what do you


---------67:57----------
think about that if I liked math a lot


---------68:04----------
and wanted to be an engineer and went to


---------68:08----------
a school for that I probably wouldn't


---------68:10----------
feel a lot of the things that I feel


---------68:13----------
yeah so I I think actually my I think


---------68:17----------
you are just truly remarkable and the


---------68:20----------
reason is because like you said all of


---------68:22----------
those kids were do you know why your kit


---------68:26----------
your high school has a high suicide rate


---------68:29----------
probably cuz not all of them like math


---------68:31----------
and engineering and what do they do when


---------68:36----------
they don't like math or engineering I


---------68:42----------
mean not all of them but yeah a lot of


---------68:45----------
them yeah why do they kill themselves


---------68:47----------
because they don't like math and


---------68:48----------
engineering like what do they end up


---------68:50----------
majoring in college well most the ones


---------68:55----------
that I mean kill themselves off you know


---------69:02----------
like those kids like you know the ones


---------69:04----------
that didn't kill themselves the ones


---------69:05----------
that are just depressed yeah so like I


---------69:08----------
mean I know a lot of people I know a lot


---------69:10----------
of people that that went to school like


---------69:12----------
my best friend went to school for


---------69:14----------
business and she was super super unhappy


---------69:19----------
and she changed her major it's an art


---------69:21----------
and design and now she's really happy


---------69:24----------
but she went through credit quite a


---------69:25----------
crisis in deciding to change her major


---------69:28----------
and I think there are probably a lot of


---------69:31----------
my peers from high school that have


---------69:34----------
pursued business or


---------69:36----------
or engineering and are unhappy but feel


---------69:40----------
like they're doing what's right and I


---------69:44----------
think that the kids that couldn't take


---------69:45----------
that or the kids that were depressed in


---------69:47----------
high school or the ones that did take


---------69:49----------
their lives probably just thought that


---------69:50----------
like they knew that they wouldn't be


---------69:54----------
happy doing what we were supposed to do


---------69:59----------
and you get where I'm going no I'm sorry


---------70:09----------
or not and they knew they wouldn't be


---------70:12----------
happy doing what they're supposed to do


---------70:13----------
so they I mean they just they took their


---------70:22----------
lives because they knew that they


---------70:23----------
wouldn't be happy because they want to


---------70:25----------
do other things so why do I think you're


---------70:27----------
remarkable what does I did in high


---------70:32----------
school you didn't what commit suicide


---------70:38----------
not only that I mean and now I'm curious


---------70:42----------
about whether you were suicidal but what


---------70:44----------
I think makes you remarkable is that you


---------70:46----------
chose to be what you are right that you


---------70:52----------
had like that you chose to like be the


---------70:56----------
person that you shouldn't be that's what


---------71:02----------
I think makes you amazing like so I


---------71:04----------
think you know you're in a world of I


---------71:05----------
forget you know what kind of like what a


---------71:08----------
red-tailed hawk is pretty big yeah so


---------71:11----------
like you know you're in a world of where


---------71:12----------
everyone's saying that a red-tailed hawk


---------71:14----------
is what you should be in you're a


---------71:15----------
Kestrel and I think the people that


---------71:18----------
killed themselves were kestrels that


---------71:20----------
pretended to be red-tailed Hawks and


---------71:22----------
then realized that they couldn't take


---------71:24----------
down the kind of prey that red-tailed


---------71:25----------
Hawks go for yeah yeah no that makes


---------71:30----------
sense what are you feeling right now


---------71:43----------
I feel bad I don't know I don't I don't


---------71:52----------
talk about or reflect on the case from


---------71:57----------
my high school like ever but it's it's


---------72:03----------
not something that I ever put thought I


---------72:04----------
did the most thought that I've ever put


---------72:05----------
into it was that like it was just like


---------72:09----------
too much pressure you know and I've like


---------72:12----------
a lot of the language and like high


---------72:16----------
school and stuff when we talked about it


---------72:17----------
was that like they like couldn't take it


---------72:20----------
you know or like they couldn't handle


---------72:21----------
the pressure so I think that you're very


---------72:27----------
similar to those kids in high school


---------72:29----------
what do you think about that yeah I mean


---------72:34----------
I wasn't I was never depressed or


---------72:36----------
suicidal in high school I was in college


---------72:39----------
like a year and a half I'm wondering


---------72:46----------
like Maya do you think that those kids


---------72:48----------
in high school felt the way that you


---------72:51----------
felt in the third grade when you wrote


---------72:53----------
that letter


---------72:56----------
yeah I bet um I bet a lot of them felt


---------73:03----------
like frauds or like they weren't


---------73:05----------
supposed to like they weren't like


---------73:08----------
everyone I would say like they were just


---------73:09----------
faking it while everyone else was


---------73:10----------
actually smart yeah I think that's why


---------73:15----------
it hurts right because like when you


---------73:18----------
think about it you recognize that like


---------73:20----------
you know what they felt like like you


---------73:23----------
don't know what you know but you feel I


---------73:27----------
mean to be honest I was a little bit


---------73:29----------
surprised to see your reaction there but


---------73:32----------
I think just that you got emotional kind


---------73:35----------
of it when we were sort of oh me too


---------73:37----------
yeah I've never I've never cried about


---------73:39----------
that yeah yeah and I mean so I was gonna


---------73:46----------
ask you why do you think you did but I I


---------73:47----------
think the reason that you did is because


---------73:49----------
you know what it's like to be them you


---------73:51----------
know what it's like to feel those


---------73:52----------
feelings you know what it's like to be


---------73:53----------
eight years old and like


---------73:56----------
start to think that you're not good


---------73:59----------
enough and between the ages of 8 and 15


---------74:03----------
every year that goes by to think more


---------74:06----------
and more that oh maybe I'm not good


---------74:08----------
enough maybe I'm not good enough and


---------74:09----------
maybe I'm not good enough and then what


---------74:11----------
happens in high school then it's not a


---------74:13----------
maybe yep right then it's like I'm not


---------74:17----------
good enough and I'm not gonna make it


---------74:19----------
and then they hold on to hope and they


---------74:21----------
hold on to hope that maybe they're wrong


---------74:23----------
maybe they're wrong maybe they're wrong


---------74:24----------
but their mind tells them no you're not


---------74:26----------
wrong you're not wrong you're not gonna


---------74:28----------
get into an ivy


---------74:29----------
you're not as good at math you're not


---------74:32----------
you're not a redtail talk right and they


---------74:36----------
can't what I think really I'm very


---------74:38----------
impressed by and and what I think really


---------74:40----------
makes you an amazing person has nothing


---------74:42----------
to do with your skills at math or even


---------74:44----------
you're not necessarily your conservation


---------74:47----------
work it's that you let yourself be a


---------74:50----------
Kestrel and I think that's what saved


---------74:55----------
you and I think that like the world has


---------75:00----------
made a better place by people


---------75:02----------
acknowledging that they're not by being


---------75:05----------
who they are right like that's what


---------75:08----------
makes your conservation work impactful


---------75:09----------
because you actually like give a


---------75:11----------
about it like imagine an alternate


---------75:13----------
universe we're in Silicon Valley


---------75:15----------
everyone went into conservation work and


---------75:17----------
you were the one kid that liked


---------75:19----------
mathematics it doesn't matter it's just


---------75:22----------
like being who you are and what I love


---------75:25----------
it if you could do is just recognize


---------75:27----------
that you know when you feel so now I'll


---------75:31----------
try to tie things up for you okay and


---------75:33----------
then you can ask questions or we can


---------75:34----------
meditate or whatever we can talk further


---------75:35----------
but I'd like to I'd love it if I could


---------75:41----------
help you walk away from this


---------75:43----------
conversation with something kind of


---------75:44----------
concrete that hopefully you can sort of


---------75:47----------
like implement in some way in that


---------75:51----------
concrete thing is recognized that you


---------75:53----------
have this thought machine of Maya is not


---------75:55----------
good enough and that same thought


---------75:57----------
machine is what drove people to kill


---------75:59----------
themselves in high school in that same


---------76:01----------
thought machine is what drove you is a


---------76:03----------
3rd grader to write a letter to your


---------76:05----------
math teacher to like one


---------76:06----------
in advanced math class and just think


---------76:09----------
about the desperation and sadness right


---------76:12----------
like that's where suicide comes from it


---------76:15----------
comes from a combination of sadness and


---------76:17----------
desperation I can hear you know all


---------76:29----------
right I was saying that that I was


---------76:31----------
getting myself going just a discord


---------76:37----------
 me out me um no it's not your it's


---------76:40----------
my internet so I was just thinking that


---------76:42----------
you know what I think about suicide I


---------76:44----------
think about if you want to understand


---------76:46----------
suicide its sadness and desperation it's


---------76:49----------
those two things right that's what leads


---------76:51----------
to suicide and that you understood like


---------76:54----------
a third grade you like understood what


---------76:56----------
that was like and now what I want you to


---------76:59----------
recognize is that third grade you lives


---------77:01----------
with you today that all throughout it


---------77:04----------
started and like there's a part of you


---------77:06----------
that just believes and then like you you


---------77:08----------
thankfully were able to find yourself


---------77:10----------
quote-unquote right you found Miss


---------77:12----------
gifting you found twitch and you found


---------77:13----------
us and we embraced you and we love you


---------77:16----------
for who you are and you absolutely


---------77:18----------
deserve the success that you have


---------77:20----------
because I don't think I mean you can't


---------77:22----------
fake it on Twitch you just can't like


---------77:24----------
twitch is actually really really good at


---------77:27----------
like picking up things they're they're


---------77:30----------
kind of visceral and primitive but


---------77:32----------
they're like very instinctual and so so


---------77:38----------
the next time can you hear that it


---------77:45----------
sounds like one of my children is it


---------77:46----------
hurt hurt herself okay let me try the


---------77:52----------
rock so I was just gonna say so I want


---------77:55----------
you to notice that when you start to


---------77:57----------
feel not good about yourself or you


---------77:59----------
notice those thoughts or you start to


---------78:01----------
think like now we're gonna go back to


---------78:02----------
the hemo right thinking that if you use


---------78:06----------
this emote you're a bad person and this


---------78:08----------
and this and this and recognize like try


---------78:10----------
to see like what of those thoughts is


---------78:12----------
coming from the thought machine of third


---------78:14----------
year the third grader Maya and even if


---------78:19----------
it's coming from those that you don't


---------78:21----------
have to like follow those like even


---------78:24----------
though you're not as smart as other


---------78:26----------
people it doesn't like you who the


---------78:28----------
this is my point is like there's no I


---------78:30----------
want you to let go of your judgment of


---------78:32----------
not being as smart as other people


---------78:33----------
mm-hmm right like if you're not as good


---------78:36----------
of a streamer as Miss gift for other


---------78:38----------
people like so be it like what's wrong


---------78:39----------
with that yeah right you're not a


---------78:42----------
red-tailed hawk you're a Kestrel fine so


---------78:45----------
like be the Kestrel and as best as you


---------78:47----------
can recognize that that part of you is


---------78:49----------
like there and that's gonna be like


---------78:50----------
bubbling up thoughts but you have this


---------78:52----------
other thought machine in which you're


---------78:54----------
not behind the curve that thought


---------78:55----------
machine doesn't care about whether


---------78:56----------
you're behind the curve or not it


---------78:58----------
doesn't care about whether you convince


---------78:59----------
30 people or a thousand people or 3,000


---------79:01----------
people you just care about convincing


---------79:03----------
people and you just care about pushing


---------79:06----------
forward in the more that you can listen


---------79:09----------
to that part of yourself I think the


---------79:11----------
less power


---------79:12----------
this internalizing your success and


---------79:16----------
insecurity and anxiety and overthinking


---------79:19----------
will have over you thoughts questions


---------79:32----------
I like the because I've had I've had a


---------79:41----------
red day on the Kestrel so I have and


---------79:49----------
that does make sense


---------79:54----------
but I don't think I have any questions


---------79:56----------
okay great any last I mean thoughts are


---------80:01----------
we or we can say goodbye you good one


---------80:04----------
not the drips have to say something I


---------80:06----------
just yeah I don't I don't think so I


---------80:08----------
mean this was a really cool conversation


---------80:10----------
thank you you're doing really really


---------80:11----------
cool stuff on Twitch I mean you know


---------80:13----------
that a cuter but um yeah a lot of people


---------80:17----------
have been have been like touched or like


---------80:20----------
affected by by watching your stream so


---------80:22----------
it's it's cool that you're doing what


---------80:24----------
you're doing appreciate it I try to


---------80:26----------
touch and fondle as many people as I can


---------80:37----------
all right well listen Maya I've had a


---------80:40----------
blast too and I think it's awesome that


---------80:42----------
you're doing this conservation work


---------80:43----------
because of people like you like my kids


---------80:45----------
have you know alligators in the backyard


---------80:47----------
so thank you for that actually the


---------80:51----------
reason we have alligators in our


---------80:52----------
backyard is because there's a there's a


---------80:54----------
swamp or Marsh that has this gigantic


---------80:56----------
development that they're destroying


---------80:58----------
their habitat so they're moving into the


---------81:00----------
lake but um I really I think it's


---------81:04----------
awesome what you're doing and I share


---------81:07----------
that sentiment I think you're you know I


---------81:08----------
I don't doubt for a minute that you


---------81:10----------
bring real value to twitch and that


---------81:12----------
you're an awesome person I don't think


---------81:14----------
you know I agree with you that you're


---------81:16----------
not good at math I mean you're probably


---------81:19----------
still good at math you're just not know


---------81:21----------
okay fine so and that's like that's


---------81:27----------
perfectly fine in my book and I think


---------81:29----------
the only reason that you're behind the


---------81:31----------
curve is because like you're on a curve


---------81:34----------
that you don't belong yeah and so of


---------81:38----------
course you're gonna be behind and and


---------81:42----------
then somewhere along the way you started


---------81:43----------
to think that you're behind on all


---------81:44----------
curves because my is the girl who's


---------81:47----------
behind on the curve no that's not true


---------81:48----------
it's just because you were in on so many


---------81:51----------
curves that weren't your curves so


---------81:54----------
anyway good luck to you and you know let


---------81:57----------
us know if we can support you in some


---------81:58----------
other way or sometimes people have an


---------82:00----------
aftermath from these conversations and


---------82:03----------
I'm glad you have a therapist that you


---------82:05----------
can lean on


---------82:05----------
because then ya know but if you want to


---------82:08----------
you know if you need some kind of


---------82:09----------
support or something just let us know


---------82:13----------
you're very welcome and good luck all


---------82:16----------
right and thank you for making the world


---------82:18----------
a better place take care okay so oh


---------82:31----------
I forgot meditation yeah I don't I don't


---------82:32----------
know she's done EMDR so I don't think


---------82:34----------
we're gonna meditate I think it's okay


---------82:36----------
we're gonna let her slide


---------82:39----------
I just have to think I don't think


---------82:47----------
meditation is actually good for her


---------82:48----------
right now


---------82:48----------
I think she just needs to not just


---------82:51----------
process whatever she's thinking or


---------82:54----------
feeling can we see the notes that you


---------82:59----------
took okay let me just think for a second


---------83:10----------
let's see if we want to do we want to do


---------83:12----------
questions let's do questions then we'll


---------83:14----------
do reaction


---------83:15----------
let's do questions while things are hot


---------83:16----------
so let's start with a couple of things


---------83:18----------
one is what does EMDR so EMDR is


---------83:23----------
essentially it's something called a


---------83:24----------
movement a movement desensitization


---------83:30----------
something I forget what the R is and


---------83:33----------
it's a technique that's heavily related


---------83:36----------
to actually meditation actually so I


---------83:41----------
think the the developers of EMDR it's


---------83:45----------
essentially ad hot or not if you guys


---------83:46----------
have heard me talk about that but it's


---------83:49----------
this thing where you move your eyes and


---------83:51----------
it's in a particular way and while


---------83:54----------
you're moving your eyes you explore


---------83:57----------
traumatic events and so since your


---------84:02----------
attention is focus on the eye movement


---------84:05----------
it desensitizes you to some of the


---------84:07----------
reactions of the traumatic events so


---------84:10----------
it's essentially a way of maintaining


---------84:11----------
awareness and not getting sucked into


---------84:14----------
the trauma and then as you talk about


---------84:16----------
the trauma and you kind of open that up


---------84:18----------
but like retain your anchor and the eye


---------84:20----------
movement it sort of helps you process


---------84:22----------
the trauma more easily so yes a ruby


---------84:31----------
light accessing I heard EMDR is used to


---------84:33----------
help patients with trauma PTSD but the


---------84:35----------
effect effectiveness is still


---------84:36----------
questionable yeah so they're they're


---------84:38----------
mixed studies right so there's some


---------84:40----------
studies that show that EMDR is effective


---------84:42----------
and there are other studies that show


---------84:43----------
that it doesn't seem to be that


---------84:44----------
effective which is common for a lot of


---------84:47----------
things in medicine and I think that like


---------84:49----------
you know we think about effectiveness is


---------84:52----------
like monolith like its effectiveness is


---------84:55----------
questionable


---------84:56----------
well that just presumes that everyone is


---------84:58----------
going to benefit from the same thing and


---------84:59----------
in my experience some things are


---------85:01----------
effective for some people and some


---------85:03----------
things are not effective for people and


---------85:05----------
generally speaking you know it takes


---------85:07----------
time for medicine to tease apart those


---------85:10----------
differences so for example we know that


---------85:13----------
you know different kinds of people will


---------85:16----------
respond to different treatments for


---------85:18----------
depression for some people psychotherapy


---------85:20----------
works really well and psychotherapy is


---------85:22----------
like for other people stuff like


---------85:24----------
behavioral activation works well for


---------85:25----------
other people medication works well for


---------85:27----------
some people exercise works well so


---------85:30----------
there's a heterogenous population so


---------85:33----------
treatment you shouldn't think about a


---------85:35----------
treatment as quote unquote effective or


---------85:37----------
not effective although there are some


---------85:38----------
treatments that really don't work for


---------85:40----------
anyone but you know so I think it's fine


---------85:44----------
if a treatment has mixed results like it


---------85:48----------
just to me when you have a study that


---------85:50----------
shows that something is effective in


---------85:53----------
another study that shows that it is an


---------85:54----------
effect or the first question you should


---------85:55----------
ask yourself is you know what are the


---------85:57----------
perspectives of the researchers because


---------85:59----------
sometimes bias can lead to that result


---------86:01----------
but if there isn't too much bias or you


---------86:04----------
think that the study was done in a high


---------86:06----------
quality way it probably means that the


---------86:08----------
responses are heterogenous


---------86:10----------
or especially something like EMDR I


---------86:12----------
think there's a lot of variability and


---------86:14----------
the quality of people who D EMDR so it's


---------86:18----------
not like standardized it's like a pill


---------86:20----------
right so like a pill has a particular


---------86:22----------
concentration of a substance that's made


---------86:24----------
in a factoring is guaranteed for


---------86:25----------
everyone who gets it the variability


---------86:27----------
between practitioners of EMDR is high in


---------86:31----------
my experience anyway so let's do let's


---------86:38----------
do questions and then we'll do reaction


---------86:40----------
POG ready to go bro okay so hello Hey


---------86:51----------
okay so my question


---------86:55----------
is I guess watching my I saw kind of how


---------86:59----------
she was like influenced by other things


---------87:03----------
and people and how she grew up on how


---------87:05----------
much like what she's supposed to be I


---------87:07----------
guess and what she's supposed to do yeah


---------87:10----------
um but it seems like she was kind of


---------87:13----------
able to figure herself and like figure


---------87:16----------
out like what she is meant to be and


---------87:18----------
stuff okay I wonder if it's not that


---------87:22----------
clear to somebody what they are and how


---------87:25----------
they're supposed to be how they can


---------87:27----------
figure that out I guess I don't know if


---------87:29----------
that's like a good question or if it's


---------87:30----------
too much that's a fantastic question


---------87:33----------
so first let's understand a couple of


---------87:35----------
things one is that even though Maya is


---------87:38----------
moving in the right direction for her


---------87:40----------
life she still carries her demons with


---------87:42----------
her right is that so I think that like a


---------87:46----------
lot of people assume that once you


---------87:49----------
figure out what you want to do in your


---------87:51----------
life that the demons go away but the


---------87:54----------
first thing that I just want to point


---------87:55----------
out is that you carry your demons with


---------87:57----------
you the processing the process of


---------87:59----------
exercising your demons and then like you


---------88:01----------
know finding out what you want to do in


---------88:03----------
life is separate right and I and I


---------88:07----------
recognize that's not your question I


---------88:08----------
just think it's an important distinction


---------88:10----------
so question your question is like how do


---------88:12----------
you find out if you've been told that


---------88:13----------
you should do something your entire life


---------88:15----------
like how do you figure out what you're


---------88:17----------
supposed to do yes because like it might


---------88:20----------
not be as simple in a way not simple but


---------88:23----------
like specific maybe as to like how


---------88:27----------
you're supposed to study a certain thing


---------88:29----------
it might be just a general thing like


---------88:31----------
for me it's like how I'm generally


---------88:33----------
supposed to be right so then I find


---------88:34----------
myself conflicted as like how are we or


---------88:38----------
am i really annoying or am I really


---------88:40----------
funny or am i what am i you know in many


---------88:43----------
different things that kind of thing like


---------88:45----------
I don't know it's just what have you


---------88:48----------
been taught that you should be I guess


---------88:52----------
that's like a huge response but long


---------88:55----------
story short I guess like I was


---------89:01----------
that I'm supposed to be respectful in


---------89:03----------
anyway in some ways and like I'm I don't


---------89:06----------
know it's like a very traditional way I


---------89:08----------
grew up I guess sure so there's like a


---------89:10----------
lot of things with that thay has to do


---------89:13----------
with behavior has to do with like maybe


---------89:15----------
academics like similar to Maya there


---------89:19----------
where you're supposed to go to a good


---------89:20----------
Union all that but then I just end up


---------89:23----------
finding myself conflicted in general so


---------89:24----------
what I so what's the conflict so on the


---------89:27----------
one side is be respectful go to detox


---------89:31----------
and what's on the other side that's the


---------89:36----------
thing I don't really know because in


---------89:38----------
reality I'm just I'm just so used to


---------89:41----------
following the path that I was supposed


---------89:43----------
to take but like now I have different


---------89:46----------
behaviors that don't go together and I


---------89:48----------
don't know which one is like real and


---------89:50----------
which one is not me


---------89:52----------
I don't know makes any sense yeah so so


---------89:55----------
I I think I think that it makes a lot of


---------89:57----------
sense and I think your answer is


---------89:58----------
actually closer than you think it is so


---------90:00----------
let's put it this way right so like


---------90:02----------
there are some people and and do you


---------90:04----------
mind if I ask what your ethnicity is


---------90:05----------
yeah I'm great I don't mind okay


---------90:08----------
so like there are some people who you


---------90:11----------
know you've been taught that you should


---------90:13----------
go to good uni you should do this you


---------90:14----------
should do that and then there are some


---------90:16----------
people like in your social circle that


---------90:20----------
did those things are not completely fine


---------90:23----------
with it


---------90:23----------
yes right yes so then you're asking how


---------90:26----------
do I figure out like who's the real me


---------90:28----------
and my point is that first of all


---------90:30----------
there's a gigantic data point because


---------90:32----------
you're not one of those people yes I'm


---------90:35----------
definitely not I never felt like a fit


---------90:36----------
in perfect so then it goes back to this


---------90:39----------
conflict so then the question is like so


---------90:41----------
you have the real you that's actually


---------90:43----------
trying to come out and that's why you


---------90:45----------
have conflict that's why you didn't you


---------90:47----------
can't be one of those people so all you


---------90:49----------
ready to do is pay attention to where


---------90:52----------
the source of that conflict is coming


---------90:53----------
from because there's the path that you


---------90:56----------
should take and then there's the part of


---------90:58----------
you that rebels against that path so all


---------91:01----------
you have to do is figure out like what


---------91:02----------
is that part of you that's rebelling


---------91:04----------
like why do I feel like not doing this


---------91:06----------
what about this doesn't feel right to me


---------91:10----------
that make sense


---------91:11----------
and as


---------91:12----------
to explore like why you're conflicted


---------91:14----------
you're gonna find your answer so like if


---------91:18----------
we think about Maya she was told in the


---------91:21----------
third grade she wanted to be an advanced


---------91:22----------
math class and then as she went to high


---------91:25----------
school she I'm sure there were kids who


---------91:28----------
went to like technology camp or math


---------91:30----------
camp or like that and she said


---------91:32----------
instead of doing that that doesn't feel


---------91:34----------
right to me what I really want to do she


---------91:37----------
had I'm sure she was offered to go to


---------91:39----------
you know summer soccer camp or math camp


---------91:42----------
or something like that and then she


---------91:43----------
noticed a little bit of conflict within


---------91:45----------
herself that she really didn't want to


---------91:47----------
do that what she wanted to do is do


---------91:48----------
conservation where she wanted to be with


---------91:49----------
animals and then she listened to that


---------91:52----------
voice because she there was some kind of


---------91:54----------
conflict and I think if you just listen


---------91:56----------
if you tunnel down into why you're


---------91:59----------
conflicted you'll find out who you are


---------92:01----------
okay that makes a lot of sense awesome


---------92:06----------
good luck thanks for your question yep


---------92:10----------
ready for the next one hello Hey so my


---------92:18----------
question is how do you enhance went of


---------92:21----------
machine over another thought machine for


---------92:25----------
example my Myatt or a third machine and


---------92:27----------
the other one how do you what can you


---------92:31----------
ask your question again please yeah so


---------92:33----------
oh do you enhance one thought machine


---------92:37----------
over another thought machine perfect so


---------92:41----------
that's a wonderful question so the first


---------92:43----------
is you it starts with noticing which


---------92:47----------
thought machine is active so the biggest


---------92:50----------
problem is that when a thought machine


---------92:52----------
is active we don't accept we don't


---------92:56----------
recognize that those are just thoughts


---------92:58----------
we believe them yeah right so like like


---------93:02----------
when Maya


---------93:03----------
you know believes factually that she's


---------93:05----------
not as good as others twitch streamers


---------93:07----------
we're like so the first thing you've got


---------93:09----------
to do is recognize that one of your


---------93:10----------
thought machines is going to how can I


---------93:15----------
say this so the first


---------93:19----------
to recognize that it's a thought machine


---------93:21----------
that's active instead of truth okay and


---------93:25----------
and so do you recognize like do you have


---------93:28----------
a particular thought machine that you're


---------93:30----------
aware of yeah I can notice a thought


---------93:36----------
machine that it's filled with fear like


---------93:39----------
for an anxiety about something okay so


---------93:44----------
it starts with recognizing the fear and


---------93:47----------
then there are two or three other


---------93:48----------
principles so when you're trying to


---------93:50----------
figure out when you're saying enhance


---------93:52----------
one thought machine over another let's


---------93:54----------
just think about the different things


---------93:55----------
you can do with a thought machine so one


---------93:58----------
is that you can prioritize one thought


---------93:59----------
machine over the other the second thing


---------94:01----------
that you can do is directly shrink a


---------94:03----------
thought machine so if we look at Maya's


---------94:06----------
case what we see is that she had a


---------94:08----------
breakthrough with EMDR that essentially


---------94:12----------
unpowered or reduced the power to her


---------94:15----------
thought machine that was like about


---------94:17----------
abandonment did you catch that part yep


---------94:20----------
and so in the same way if you figure out


---------94:23----------
where does this thought machine get its


---------94:25----------
power from where does it originate from


---------94:27----------
I mean if you can find the origin of the


---------94:29----------
thought machine and you can figure out


---------94:31----------
oh like this is like these thoughts are


---------94:33----------
coming from third-grade me who felt this


---------94:36----------
way this isn't actually like true now


---------94:38----------
it's just like thoughts that are left


---------94:40----------
over from like this traumatic experience


---------94:43----------
so again thank you huh


---------94:46----------
yes or in my case for example it came


---------94:48----------
from a another movie which stressed me a


---------94:53----------
lot so when I watched something that


---------94:56----------
could be stressful I'm like I'm I'm


---------94:59----------
scared it could stress me don't know


---------95:01----------
there under the way I have watched like


---------95:03----------
thousand movies so I'm like oh no don't


---------95:06----------
worry it will be nice yeah that's that's


---------95:13----------
really good so so that's good that you


---------95:15----------
notice that so then what you have to do


---------95:16----------
is the next time you approach a movie


---------95:18----------
you need to be aware of like okay is


---------95:21----------
this the fear from the last horror movie


---------95:24----------
that's left over or is this like a fear


---------95:27----------
from now the other thing that I worry a


---------95:29----------
little bit about is that the horror


---------95:31----------
movie may not actually


---------95:32----------
be the origin of it it may have been the


---------95:34----------
way like the surface of it yeah so did


---------95:38----------
the horror movie relate to something


---------95:41----------
else that happened to you before


---------95:45----------
[Music]


---------95:48----------
that's better


---------95:50----------
but it's so it's so what I did they


---------95:53----------
didn't to be sure absolutely so here's


---------95:56----------
the way that I would like you to explore


---------95:57----------
that so the way that you felt when you


---------96:00----------
think about the horror movie that


---------96:01----------
created this for you think about the way


---------96:04----------
that you felt in that horror movie and


---------96:05----------
then ask yourself have you felt that way


---------96:08----------
before I mean if the answer is yes go


---------96:12----------
back to and reflect about how did I feel


---------96:16----------
then why did I feel then because I would


---------96:18----------
be really surprised if it was created by


---------96:20----------
the horror movie yes I don't find the


---------96:22----------
root of the primitive absolutely and


---------96:24----------
then as you process that root you can


---------96:27----------
see a therapist or just reflect about it


---------96:29----------
or think about it then the thought


---------96:32----------
machine will start to get powered down


---------96:34----------
and then the second thing that you can


---------96:36----------
do is as those thoughts or that anxiety


---------96:38----------
starts to rise you can shift towards


---------96:41----------
another one through a technique like


---------96:42----------
alternate nostril breathing or something


---------96:44----------
like that you can actually like just


---------96:46----------
shift and then start to you know you're


---------96:48----------
gonna have different thoughts or


---------96:49----------
conflicting thoughts and then you can


---------96:51----------
literally steer your mind so you can ask


---------96:54----------
yourself if you say like oh I should


---------96:55----------
watch this movie and I shouldn't watch


---------96:57----------
this movie and then notice that you have


---------96:59----------
the two conflict right you say oh it's


---------97:01----------
okay to watch the movie it'll be a great


---------97:03----------
movie and then kind of notice okay I'm


---------97:04----------
gonna choose to watch the movie and


---------97:06----------
there's gonna be a part of my mind that


---------97:08----------
is gonna be afraid and I'm just gonna


---------97:10----------
watch that thing and I'm gonna let it be


---------97:12----------
I'm not gonna try to not be afraid I'm


---------97:14----------
gonna let it be afraid but I'm also


---------97:16----------
going to try to enjoy the movie yeah


---------97:18----------
absolutely


---------97:20----------
it's like and they are technique


---------97:23----------
absolutely very good excellent


---------97:25----------
yeah perfect all right good luck man


---------97:28----------
thanks a lot for everything you that you


---------97:31----------
do yeah of course man


---------97:33----------
my pleasure
