---------00:00----------
so for all of you guys who were


---------00:01----------
wondering like how does change happen


---------00:03----------
just watch that interview and you'll see


---------00:05----------
it at the end you can see it in his face


---------00:06----------
his degree of animation his posture like


---------00:10----------
there's something very subtle and small


---------00:12----------
changing inside him


---------00:23----------
okay so um what why don't you just start


---------00:26----------
by telling it what would you like me to


---------00:27----------
call you on stream i think Gork is fine


---------00:30----------
okay it's the easy so Gord can you tell


---------00:32----------
us a little bit about what's bringing


---------00:36----------
you on today and how we can be helpful I


---------00:38----------
know we just talked about um yeah so


---------00:40----------
what's bringing me I guess is well I've


---------00:43----------
been friends for with reckful for the


---------00:44----------
past couple months years or so we talked


---------00:47----------
a bit about let's say that the pressures


---------00:50----------
of streaming is stuff like that yeah and


---------00:52----------
I saw the stream you had with you and I


---------00:54----------
mean that really made me wake up and


---------00:56----------
realize maybe I should also talk to a


---------00:58----------
therapist in general and deal with my


---------00:59----------
[ __ ]


---------00:59----------
yeah I guess so what is said [ __ ]


---------01:04----------
said [ __ ] what do you mean what what is


---------01:06----------
thought your [ __ ] what is it that you


---------01:08----------
need to deal with well I mean I have an


---------01:11----------
entire list of mental issues I guess


---------01:13----------
that I need to address one by one but


---------01:15----------
they're all I guess rooted in the fact


---------01:18----------
that I'm not so happy I guess always


---------01:21----------
unhappy with myself okay and tell me a


---------01:24----------
little bit more about that so my main


---------01:29----------
issue I guess is that no matter how well


---------01:31----------
I do in a stream or how how well I do


---------01:35----------
during the stream how good my numbers


---------01:37----------
are there's always something I could do


---------01:38----------
better and I'm always unhappy with it


---------01:40----------
and when I couldn't understand it enough


---------01:42----------
that this is very like deep deep and


---------01:44----------
happiness that I haven't felt before in


---------01:46----------
my life because I feel an immense amount


---------01:48----------
of pressure because I care a lot about


---------01:50----------
my stream and what I'm doing okay what


---------01:54----------
is it that you help me understand why


---------01:57----------
you care so much uh well I don't know I


---------02:01----------
really I I just care about it a lot


---------02:04----------
because it feels like I accomplished


---------02:07----------
something nice and I guess I have a fear


---------02:10----------
of losing it all the time as well so I


---------02:12----------
need to keep it up I feel like I don't


---------02:14----------
know what if maybe through it and I've


---------02:16----------
thought about this myself before maybe


---------02:18----------
zero didn't money but I don't think so


---------02:19----------
maybe it's rooted in some kind of


---------02:21----------
validation from other people I'm not


---------02:22----------
actually sure yeah sure so let's maybe


---------02:26----------
let's see if we can understand that a


---------02:27----------
little bit better so I just want to try


---------02:29----------
to summarize because because Gork and I


---------02:31----------
talked a little bit before we came on


---------02:33----------
and this was kind of last minute so Gork


---------02:35----------
was kind of telling me that


---------02:37----------
he has this sense of inadequacy or not


---------02:39----------
inadequacy but that you know it's almost


---------02:43----------
like your success is like temporary and


---------02:45----------
like you wanna know and that you can do


---------02:48----------
really really well and then you still


---------02:50----------
sort of feel like you didn't do a great


---------02:52----------
job or you could have done better and


---------02:53----------
that many times things start to go south


---------02:56----------
for you like if you're if you're losing


---------02:58----------
a game or something like that and what


---------02:59----------
do you play by the way I play dota 2


---------03:01----------
okay I mean that when you're losing a


---------03:04----------
game like you start to feel what


---------03:07----------
well I start to feel inadequate like you


---------03:10----------
said and the snowballs out of control


---------03:13----------
where mine adequacy leads to me playing


---------03:15----------
worse and being less funny in my opinion


---------03:18----------
at least and being more whiny or


---------03:20----------
whatever which also gets into my head


---------03:22----------
even further and then that cycles


---------03:24----------
throughout the entire stream and even


---------03:25----------
into the next days which makes me just


---------03:27----------
feel awful


---------03:28----------
okay almost all the time why does your


---------03:32----------
stream have to be successful uh I don't


---------03:36----------
know I feel like I guess more than


---------03:39----------
anything was important to me it's sort


---------03:43----------
of forward momentum and also I guess I


---------03:46----------
feel some kind of validation of me being


---------03:49----------
more successful than other streamers


---------03:51----------
just make yeah I don't know if that


---------03:53----------
makes any sense but when I look at other


---------03:55----------
streamers and I see that I'm more


---------03:57----------
successful than them it makes me feel


---------03:58----------
good but I don't know why okay because


---------04:01----------
the reason I say that is because when I


---------04:03----------
see let's say an undersea man competing


---------04:05----------
with do really well then I feel unhappy


---------04:07----------
for some reason even though maybe I


---------04:08----------
shouldn't okay so I


---------04:11----------
Gork the first thing that I want to do


---------04:13----------
is actually give you a pat on the back


---------04:14----------
because I think you're doing a fantastic


---------04:16----------
job of facing some feelings that I think


---------04:19----------
other people would shy away from mm-hmm


---------04:22----------
so the number of people that I know that


---------04:24----------
you know feel that like people delude


---------04:27----------
themselves into thinking that they


---------04:29----------
actually don't feel satisfaction when


---------04:31----------
they do better than someone else yeah


---------04:33----------
like if you're you know if you get an a


---------04:36----------
on a test and someone else gets a B like


---------04:38----------
there are a lot of people who like lie


---------04:40----------
to themselves and say yeah like yeah the


---------04:42----------
only reason that I I'm happy is because


---------04:44----------
I got an A I don't care what I knew and


---------04:45----------
I'll Scott but it's a very simple truth


---------04:48----------
that sometimes


---------04:50----------
the way that we feel about ourselves and


---------04:52----------
other people has to do with like us


---------04:54----------
being better than them no I really don't


---------04:57----------
want to feel that way but I feel like if


---------04:58----------
I had to be honest with you and with


---------05:00----------
myself then that is at least mature yeah


---------05:04----------
and I just want to commend you for that


---------05:06----------
because you know one of the simplest


---------05:08----------
problems that people run across is that


---------05:10----------
like they don't believe they don't


---------05:12----------
accept things about themselves that they


---------05:13----------
don't want to be true and so I think


---------05:16----------
you've taken the first and most


---------05:17----------
important step in recognizing that the


---------05:20----------
person that you are depends a little bit


---------05:22----------
on the way that you relate to other


---------05:24----------
people yeah so now let's try to


---------05:27----------
understand a little bit about where that


---------05:29----------
comes from so how long have you felt


---------05:31----------
that way I don't know I mean I guess if


---------05:35----------
I'm feeling that way for as long as I


---------05:37----------
can remember with streaming and me


---------05:40----------
comparing myself to others I mean back


---------05:42----------
in school wave and the only reason I


---------05:44----------
felt like I even tried to get good


---------05:45----------
grades at all was just because I wanted


---------05:47----------
to be better than my than the other guys


---------05:50----------
in my class it was nothing about and I


---------05:52----------
don't really know what else motivated me


---------05:54----------
really okay and and when you were saying


---------05:57----------
that you wanted to be better than other


---------05:58----------
people in your class like how old what


---------06:00----------
are we talking about I don't know I feel


---------06:03----------
like I was always like a goofball up


---------06:05----------
until like eighth grade because that's


---------06:07----------
when in Sweden they add like grades and


---------06:09----------
when they added grades for some reason I


---------06:11----------
straighten up my act completely I would


---------06:14----------
say I still did the very bare minimum to


---------06:16----------
get an A but I always made sure I try to


---------06:18----------
get an A in the class before that I


---------06:21----------
didn't care about school at all but as


---------06:23----------
soon as they come some kind of grading


---------06:24----------
system came I start caring but I still


---------06:28----------
played a lot of video games obviously


---------06:29----------
and stuff but I at least I did the bare


---------06:31----------
minimum to be better than others that's


---------06:33----------
what I felt like and when you were


---------06:34----------
better than others how did you feel uh I


---------06:38----------
don't know a sense of satisfaction I


---------06:40----------
guess I'm not sure okay so we have to


---------06:43----------
understand that right so what do you


---------06:45----------
remember about my cat sling on my


---------06:48----------
keyboard yes sorry what do you remember


---------06:50----------
about how you felt in high school when


---------06:53----------
you got is I don't know really I've


---------06:57----------
always I mean I guess something that


---------06:59----------
also drove me except for feeling better


---------07:03----------
than others was


---------07:04----------
the fact that if I had good grades or if


---------07:07----------
I did well I had a sort of a secure or a


---------07:10----------
cushy future or whatever so now it just


---------07:14----------
made me feel secure I guess that I'm not


---------07:18----------
bad I'm not sure I've never really


---------07:21----------
thought about it I'm just gonna think


---------07:26----------
for a second because I'm trying to


---------07:27----------
figure out how to phrase this yeah I


---------07:29----------
think oddly enough


---------07:31----------
Gork I I don't think the issue is about


---------07:33----------
feeling better than others I'm really


---------07:36----------
curious about


---------07:37----------
I think it's that's the that's the side


---------07:42----------
of the coin that's one side of the coin


---------07:44----------
is when you feel adequate you feel


---------07:47----------
superior and you feel better


---------07:49----------
mm-hmm what I'm really curious about is


---------07:52----------
like how do you feel when you get a beat


---------07:55----------
yeah I don't know I feel like I feel


---------08:00----------
like a disappointment to myself more


---------08:01----------
than anything okay in in what way are


---------08:04----------
you disappointing yourself


---------08:06----------
I just I mean I don't know ever since I


---------08:09----------
was like a small kid everybody just said


---------08:11----------
I'm the smart kid or whatever and then I


---------08:12----------
feel like I'm just betraying that image


---------08:14----------
of myself which made me feel so good I'm


---------08:17----------
such a smart kid or whatever and then


---------08:19----------
all of a sudden it all comes crumbling


---------08:20----------
down as soon as I don't perform and the


---------08:23----------
same with streaming you know when people


---------08:24----------
put pressure on you that oh you're the


---------08:27----------
biggest dota 2 streamer right now


---------08:28----------
wherever as soon as I feel like I'm not


---------08:30----------
the biggest or I'm not growing fast


---------08:31----------
enough I feel like my entire entire


---------08:34----------
self-image just crumbles yes okay so I


---------08:38----------
think that's where the money is


---------08:39----------
okay so we're gonna talk about that so


---------08:41----------
what we're talking about here is


---------08:46----------
hold on


---------08:53----------
is living up to expectations yeah


---------08:58----------
that's what this does that make sense


---------09:00----------
like what I'm hearing from you is that


---------09:01----------
like you have expectations that you need


---------09:03----------
to live up to and if you don't live up


---------09:05----------
to those expectations then you're kind


---------09:08----------
of letting everyone down and you feel


---------09:09----------
bad about yourself


---------09:11----------
no and the scary thing yeah so I yeah so


---------09:16----------
we can get into it more later but it's


---------09:18----------
not like I just feel bad I literally


---------09:19----------
feel like I don't want to live anymore


---------09:22----------
it like it gets to that point where I


---------09:23----------
shut out everybody out of my life and


---------09:26----------
like I totally isolate myself in-between


---------09:30----------
my streams


---------09:30----------
I just feel what other people out what


---------09:33----------
it what is it that you don't want them


---------09:34----------
to see


---------09:36----------
I don't know I just feel like I feel


---------09:38----------
like even an even angrier version of


---------09:40----------
myself as soon as I start sharing with


---------09:42----------
other people it's kind of hard for me to


---------09:43----------
share with other people because all that


---------09:46----------
builds up to me is this like self


---------09:48----------
conflicting thing where I I'm not really


---------09:51----------
who I present myself to be so I just


---------09:54----------
feel shamed I guess yeah in the way I am


---------09:57----------
or acted or I'm not succeeding yeah so


---------10:01----------
you feel ashamed for not living up to


---------10:04----------
expectations yeah mostly the ones I put


---------10:08----------
on myself with you I don't think anybody


---------10:10----------
else but what's really hi expecting them


---------10:12----------
not my parents or anything okay and so


---------10:16----------
if there are expectations that you put


---------10:19----------
on yourself why do you have to shut


---------10:20----------
people out what is it that makes you


---------10:22----------
shut people out when you're not living


---------10:23----------
up to them no no it just feels like I


---------10:29----------
don't know whenever I talk about it like


---------10:33----------
now talking about it with you it's not


---------10:34----------
so bad but I never talk about other


---------10:36----------
people it just brings back those


---------10:38----------
feelings of inadequacy and those make me


---------10:41----------
so angry that even feel like that in the


---------10:42----------
first place so it just cycles my anger


---------10:46----------
yes okay so fantastic I mean ah so I do


---------10:50----------
this thing on stream where I say


---------10:51----------
positive things but it's not that yeah


---------10:53----------
it's no no it's just I think it's a


---------10:56----------
really important point okay because


---------10:57----------
you're noticing there are two things


---------10:58----------
going on there is the original thing


---------11:01----------
that happens in your mind and then there


---------11:03----------
is the way that you judge yourself for


---------11:05----------
having that thing mm-hmm


---------11:07----------
there's the initial thing and then


---------11:09----------
there's the reaction to the thing


---------11:11----------
there's the feeling ashamed and then


---------11:13----------
getting angry at yourself for feeling


---------11:15----------
the way that you do mm-hmm those are two


---------11:18----------
separate things each of them have their


---------11:21----------
own origin let's start with let me just


---------11:26----------
think for a second


---------11:31----------
when did you start beating yourself up


---------11:36----------
I don't know I've never really beaten


---------11:37----------
myself as much as when I started


---------11:39----------
streaming I guess that's when all this


---------11:41----------
pressure came okay and tell me about


---------11:44----------
beating yourself up when since you


---------11:45----------
started streaming


---------11:49----------
I don't know I guess I feel like it all


---------11:52----------
goes back to the an image I build up


---------11:54----------
about myself that I don't feel like I


---------11:56----------
live up to so like I build up an image


---------11:59----------
of you know like whatever up-and-coming


---------12:01----------
or big streamer or whatever kind of


---------12:03----------
label I want to put on it when as soon


---------12:05----------
as I don't feel like I live up to it


---------12:06----------
even living up to something like as I'm


---------12:08----------
funny or good at the game anything


---------12:10----------
really as soon as I don't feel like I'm


---------12:12----------
like I'm doing it I just get so angry at


---------12:14----------
myself and I really hate it okay why is


---------12:18----------
it important for you to be a big person


---------12:21----------
I don't know actually


---------12:26----------
I don't have a clue it's just something


---------12:28----------
that drives me okay do you feel like a


---------12:31----------
small person


---------12:34----------
okay can you tell me about can you tell


---------12:39----------
me about your upbringing a little bit


---------12:43----------
hmmm I don't know what's what's much to


---------12:45----------
say like I was mostly raised by my mom


---------12:47----------
pretty relaxed parents I could play


---------12:50----------
however late into the night I wanted to


---------12:53----------
I was kind of free to set my own goals


---------12:55----------
and expectations about school and I did


---------12:57----------
that I never had really any pressure to


---------12:59----------
do anything maybe sometimes I got like


---------13:02----------
foreign parents they're like why don't


---------13:03----------
you become a doctor I mean like maybe I


---------13:05----------
mean that's that's as far as it went


---------13:07----------
there's nothing like super pressure


---------13:08----------
about it mmm I don't know I I had a


---------13:12----------
pretty normal childhood I guess I wasn't


---------13:14----------
I was kind of a class clown in my first


---------13:18----------
years and then I became like more of a


---------13:20----------
gamer / odden type of person mm-hmm in


---------13:23----------
my high school years I was never them


---------13:26----------
never the most popular kid but I was


---------13:27----------
never bullied either or anything like


---------13:29----------
that okay so what I'm hearing from you


---------13:31----------
is that there's like there's no like


---------13:33----------
sometimes when people come on stream you


---------13:35----------
know there's something really bad that


---------13:37----------
happened to them or someone that treated


---------13:38----------
them very badly or something like that


---------13:40----------
and I'm not hearing any of that from you


---------13:41----------
know I wouldn't say so okay no can you


---------13:45----------
tell me a little bit about you have


---------13:46----------
siblings by the way I have one older


---------13:49----------
brother but he's like nine or 10 years


---------13:50----------
older me so we're not super close what


---------13:53----------
do you remember about him growing up


---------13:55----------
well I remember he didn't let me pray


---------13:57----------
and play on the computer a lot which


---------13:59----------
annoyed me other than that I mean we


---------14:02----------
weren't we're there was such a big age


---------14:04----------
difference between us that he was like


---------14:05----------
living his own life and I was living


---------14:07----------
mine he was almost like a father figure


---------14:08----------
to me in some ways because my dad wasn't


---------14:10----------
around um I don't know what there's to


---------14:16----------
say it was like I met him every other


---------14:18----------
weekend


---------14:20----------
he was an alright dad he was okay and I


---------14:25----------
don't really know what to say about it


---------14:27----------
me he wasn't he he liked me / he loved


---------14:31----------
me a lot but he wasn't very nice to my


---------14:33----------
mother he wasn't a very nice to my


---------14:34----------
family in overall so my mother alienated


---------14:37----------
from me me from him


---------14:39----------
the first 10 or 12 years of my life I


---------14:41----------
guess but yeah we got closer in in the


---------14:44----------
end he got sick and he died when I was


---------14:46----------
about 15 by then we had gotten pretty


---------14:49----------
close to each other at least yeah so but


---------14:52----------
I wouldn't say he was a big part of my


---------14:54----------
life before


---------14:55----------
last part of his I guess if that makes


---------15:00----------
sense yeah it makes a lot of sense it


---------15:01----------
sounds like he wasn't really a big part


---------15:03----------
of your life and then just when you guys


---------15:06----------
were getting closer he sort of


---------15:07----------
unfortunately ended up passing away no


---------15:12----------
how do you feel about that uh well I


---------15:18----------
feel like some in some ways I feel like


---------15:21----------
I got robbed a bit kind of a dad cuz you


---------15:23----------
know he wasn't really there when in my


---------15:26----------
teenage years so I feel like I need him


---------15:27----------
a lot I feel like my late teen years are


---------15:30----------
pretty rough


---------15:31----------
I think my dad could have helped a lot


---------15:32----------
but I don't know the thing I think about


---------15:35----------
my dad was the most guilty like the most


---------15:38----------
guilty thing I've ever feel about my


---------15:39----------
life was when my dad was dying he was


---------15:42----------
like sick in the hospital I didn't go


---------15:44----------
visit him because I felt I think I


---------15:46----------
justify it I felt like it was too hard


---------15:49----------
to sit there with him as he was dying it


---------15:51----------
was but instead I just sat formalist


---------15:54----------
played video games and I every time I


---------15:55----------
think about him I just think about I


---------15:57----------
should have [ __ ] been there you know


---------15:58----------
that's what I think about when I think


---------16:00----------
about my dad I'd only think about much


---------16:02----------
else cuz that's when we were the closest


---------16:03----------
yeah so let me ask you something Gork


---------16:07----------
what were you in that moment when you


---------16:10----------
didn't go see your dad what kind of


---------16:12----------
person were you I was just I don't know


---------16:18----------
I wasn't a person I feel like I was just


---------16:19----------
floating in the clouds playing video


---------16:20----------
games if I had to say what kind of


---------16:22----------
person I was it wasn't really a person


---------16:24----------
it was just you know is the boy playing


---------16:26----------
video games didn't care about anything


---------16:28----------
in the world


---------16:29----------
yeah let me try word inadequate


---------16:33----------
inadequate by not going to see him I


---------16:38----------
like guilting myself about stuff that's


---------16:40----------
one other thing the most simple form of


---------16:42----------
inadequacy right


---------16:43----------
the most simple the most devastating how


---------16:51----------
can I say this you know in order to be a


---------16:56----------
good person in order to be a good son in


---------16:59----------
order to you know do the right thing no


---------17:05----------
just had to do one thing and that was go


---------17:08----------
stood us up to be there yeah and you


---------17:10----------
didn't do that no so what kind of person


---------17:16----------
doesn't do that well I don't know I feel


---------17:21----------
like now to think about it if I was


---------17:24----------
older I would feel really bad about it


---------17:26----------
but I don't know I feel like then I was


---------17:28----------
just a kid and I was a stupid but I


---------17:30----------
still feel guilty about it because I was


---------17:31----------
not that young I was like 14 15 yeah so


---------17:34----------
we're gonna get to that and how that


---------17:36----------
part of your mind works but let me ask


---------17:38----------
you this when you're losing a game


---------17:40----------
mm-hmm and people are trolling you yeah


---------17:47----------
does that feel at all like how when they


---------17:51----------
attack you is that how you feel is that


---------17:54----------
what you tell yourself when you feel


---------17:57----------
guilty does that make sense uh when they


---------18:02----------
attack me what do I do you attack


---------18:04----------
yourself in the same way like when you


---------18:06----------
get angry with yourself yeah I mean I'm


---------18:08----------
already very angry with myself I like


---------18:10----------
most of my anger doesn't like come from


---------18:12----------
other people putting pressure on me I


---------18:13----------
feel like it just affirms it yeah in a


---------18:16----------
way that's exactly right so I think the


---------18:19----------
problem here the reason that you're so


---------18:21----------
sensitive to other people attacking you


---------18:23----------
is because


---------18:25----------
those guys are actually like like when


---------18:27----------
people attack you on stream those are


---------18:29----------
the people that you're queueing with


---------18:32----------
okay those are the people in your party


---------18:34----------
that make sense now guess who's the


---------18:38----------
captain I'm the captain


---------18:42----------
absolutely mm-hmm right and what's the


---------18:45----------
goal to win and what does winning mean


---------18:49----------
with those guys and use the captain


---------18:53----------
beating the opponent yeah in the


---------18:56----------
opponent this time is like proving to


---------18:58----------
yourself that you're kind of like a


---------18:59----------
piece of [ __ ] it's attacking you right


---------19:02----------
now they're like you're attacking you


---------19:03----------
they're attacking you mm-hmm


---------19:06----------
and that's like because you just like


---------19:11----------
there's a part of you that feels like


---------19:12----------
you deserve it you know for sure and


---------19:17----------
let's just think about this for a second


---------19:19----------
why do you deserve it because I'm not


---------19:25----------
good enough for myself yes and when did


---------19:29----------
you start becoming not good enough uh I


---------19:33----------
don't know whenever I put these


---------19:35----------
standards on myself I guess I started


---------19:37----------
streaming and people built up an image


---------19:39----------
about me that I needed to uphold I think


---------19:42----------
it goes deeper than that right cuz I


---------19:43----------
think at that point you were already you


---------19:45----------
were already the party leader okay and


---------19:48----------
the stream just started to grow things


---------19:50----------
it was like accelerant or fertilizer for


---------19:53----------
what was already there so I absolutely


---------19:57----------
believe because that's what streaming


---------19:58----------
does like streaming this is something


---------20:01----------
that everyone needs to understand social


---------20:02----------
media just amplifies the feelings that


---------20:05----------
you already have right like when you


---------20:08----------
watch like when you think about


---------20:09----------
something like FOMO like fear of missing


---------20:10----------
out right like you already feel like


---------20:13----------
you're missing out in some things in


---------20:15----------
life and when social media like shows


---------20:17----------
all the things that you're missing out


---------20:19----------
it amplifies like all of your weaknesses


---------20:21----------
and vulnerabilities it amplifies your


---------20:23----------
inadequacies I don't think it creates


---------20:25----------
them I think it just takes what's there


---------20:28----------
and like messes with our brain because


---------20:31----------
suddenly like when it comes to your


---------20:32----------
sense of self-worth


---------20:34----------
Gork


---------20:35----------
that's kind of like a nebulous thing


---------20:36----------
like you can't quantify your sense of


---------20:39----------
self-worth until you start streaming and


---------20:42----------
then you can modify it right like you


---------20:44----------
can look and you can see like okay like


---------20:46----------
I'm half as good as I used to be


---------20:48----------
yesterday and there's a lot of


---------20:51----------
protection in not being able to quantify


---------20:53----------
stuff you're like ah that's just a


---------20:55----------
feeling but now you have proof about how


---------20:59----------
you're becoming a worse person no and


---------21:02----------
that can be very damaging so I do


---------21:04----------
believe that the stream sort of made a


---------21:05----------
lot of this stuff worse but it sounds to


---------21:07----------
me like you had some of these feelings


---------21:09----------
of inadequacy like way before that yeah


---------21:12----------
I guess I've always had them they're


---------21:14----------
just gone a lot worse the past couple


---------21:16----------
years that I believe in I'm sorry about


---------21:18----------
that and I hope today we'll be able to


---------21:20----------
help you some and we can also talk a


---------21:22----------
little bit more afterward about thinking


---------21:24----------
about how how to better manage this


---------21:26----------
stuff okay so a couple of other things


---------21:28----------
cork I I know I just wanted you know you


---------21:31----------
were a little bit concerned about coming


---------21:32----------
on because there are some people who


---------21:34----------
troll you and you were worried about


---------21:35----------
giving them ammo which i think is yeah


---------21:38----------
yeah I mean I don't know I feel like


---------21:42----------
it's I already exposed myself a lot on


---------21:44----------
my stream and I feel like I don't know


---------21:47----------
even exposing myself even more sounds


---------21:49----------
like a dangerous thing talking about why


---------21:51----------
I feel the way I feel and stuff yeah so


---------21:53----------
many people are gonna press on it more


---------21:54----------
but when I'm feeling down yeah so I


---------21:56----------
appreciate you coming on because I think


---------21:58----------
you're actually doing something really


---------22:00----------
important for everyone who's watching


---------22:01----------
and this doesn't work unless people are


---------22:04----------
willing to come on and be authentic and


---------22:06----------
that's like I think the thing from


---------22:08----------
reckful stream that people are kind of


---------22:10----------
running with his AoE healing okay and


---------22:13----------
and it doesn't like it requires people


---------22:15----------
like you so I want to thank you for


---------22:16----------
coming on even at risk to yourself the


---------22:19----------
other thing that I want to tell you is


---------22:20----------
that if does if [ __ ] does go south for


---------22:23----------
you please let me know and I'm happy to


---------22:25----------
try to help you work through that like


---------22:26----------
online or offline like if it's there


---------22:28----------
attacking you then we should probably do


---------22:29----------
it offline all right thanks but you know


---------22:33----------
I I don't want to yeah I don't want


---------22:35----------
anything that we do here to actually


---------22:36----------
hurt you in any way so I'm here for you


---------22:39----------
thanks I want to get back to this thing


---------22:42----------
though because I think to me like it's


---------22:44----------
kind of interesting that


---------22:46----------
you know you're angry at yourself for


---------22:48----------
being we use the word inadequate but I


---------22:51----------
wonder if it actually even runs deeper


---------22:53----------
like it's almost like the world realizes


---------22:56----------
sometimes that you're a shitty person


---------22:59----------
yeah that maybe I feel like I mean


---------23:02----------
definitely something I've thought about


---------23:04----------
a lot whenever I'm feeling bad am i


---------23:06----------
myself I feel like oh [ __ ] people are


---------23:08----------
gonna find out I'm a fraud or something


---------23:09----------
like that that's a shitty feeling to


---------23:11----------
have yeah so so this is important right


---------23:14----------
because like why do you think that


---------23:16----------
you're a fraud to begin with like where


---------23:18----------
does that sense of being a fraud because


---------23:21----------
I think this is what happens like when


---------23:22----------
you succeed it doesn't actually build


---------23:25----------
your confidence all it does is increase


---------23:27----------
your terror yeah oh yeah for sure right


---------23:31----------
which is weird like you'd think that


---------23:33----------
like people think that confidence comes


---------23:34----------
from success like they think like oh


---------23:36----------
like Gork is a sucessful streamer like


---------23:38----------
he does such a good job like why isn't


---------23:40----------
he confident but the funny thing is that


---------23:42----------
the higher you rise the more unstable


---------23:46----------
you become yeah why what goes on in the


---------23:51----------
longer the fall and this is the other


---------23:54----------
thing this is important to understand


---------23:56----------
Gork you feel like it's inevitable that


---------23:59----------
you're gonna fall it feels like it I


---------24:01----------
mean I don't know my success was very


---------24:04----------
rapid I guess mm-hmm in a sense so why


---------24:07----------
wouldn't the downfall be as well I think


---------24:09----------
it's goes deeper than that that's just


---------24:11----------
logic


---------24:11----------
this isn't logic okay so the let me I'm


---------24:14----------
gonna I would ask you but I think it's


---------24:16----------
like a little bit too much of read my


---------24:18----------
mind so I'm gonna start just kind of


---------24:19----------
offering some ideas right so the person


---------24:23----------
who


---------24:25----------
knows that the fall is coming eventually


---------24:27----------
is the person who like it doesn't have


---------24:29----------
faith in who they are so like if I


---------24:37----------
calibrate to be I'm gonna use dota


---------24:38----------
terminology because I know it cork tape


---------24:40----------
plays dota and I play DotA so for people


---------24:41----------
who don't play dota apologies funny


---------24:44----------
video so so like like if I calibrate to


---------24:47----------
Ange so actually this happened to me so


---------24:49----------
I played my first calibration game for


---------24:51----------
for court and I was in a group of like I


---------24:53----------
was in an ancient game so it was like a


---------24:57----------
bunch of ancient slurs like oh [ __ ] and


---------24:58----------
then like actually a turtle I played a


---------25:01----------
Elsi offlane game and I ended up winning


---------25:03----------
and I've actually played really well and


---------25:05----------
so then like but I was I was actually


---------25:07----------
terrified because I was like oh [ __ ]


---------25:09----------
that means like my next calibration game


---------25:10----------
is gonna be like higher than a [ __ ]


---------25:12----------
right or it's like instead of being like


---------25:14----------
ancient once and ain't you - so it's


---------25:15----------
gonna be like high ancient and then then


---------25:18----------
I ended up losing that second game but


---------25:20----------
like even though like I didn't gain


---------25:23----------
confidence from the game


---------25:25----------
I gained fear I became more afraid


---------25:27----------
because I knew in my heart that I wasn't


---------25:30----------
an ancient okay I know that I'm like


---------25:33----------
somewhere between Archon and legend like


---------25:35----------
that's like in my heart of hearts that's


---------25:36----------
what I believe about myself and I'm not


---------25:39----------
actually nature that's like a self


---------25:41----------
damaging belief yeah but I believe it


---------25:44----------
right okay like I mean I know that about


---------25:47----------
myself


---------25:48----------
mmm-hmm and so what do I think is gonna


---------25:52----------
happen like let's say I play another


---------25:53----------
ancient game and if I believe that I'm


---------25:55----------
an Archon player and I play like ancient


---------25:57----------
and I win again like what happens to


---------25:59----------
that belief I mean it kind of depends


---------26:03----------
but I guess it stays there or maybe


---------26:05----------
disappear and I'm like oh it's only a


---------26:07----------
matter of time before I start [ __ ] up


---------26:09----------
and my MMR begins to fall only a matter


---------26:13----------
of time


---------26:15----------
yeah that's how you feel about yourself


---------26:17----------
right for sure absolutely


---------26:21----------
so now we get to the point Gork why do I


---------26:24----------
believe I'm an Archon why do I have your


---------26:28----------
words that self damaging belief where


---------26:30----------
does that come from


---------26:32----------
I don't know something you made up


---------26:35----------
yourself comes from somewhere right like


---------26:37----------
somewhere along the way like I had some


---------26:39----------
idea that like I'm an Archon so in your


---------26:43----------
case


---------26:45----------
what do you believe about yourself I


---------26:49----------
don't know I mean it varies from day to


---------26:53----------
day when I have a good day I feel good


---------26:55----------
about myself I feel like I'm the man no


---------26:58----------
no no no I know you feel like you're man


---------27:00----------
you're the man so that's a good yeah so


---------27:02----------
on those good days when things get quiet


---------27:05----------
and you have a moment that you stop


---------27:07----------
thinking that you're the man what's the


---------27:09----------
scary thought that's floating around in


---------27:10----------
the back of your mind you know should I


---------27:13----------
can't wait to have a bad day it's coming


---------27:15----------
soon yes right that's an Archon inside


---------27:19----------
you so then the question becomes like


---------27:21----------
like what do you think about yourself in


---------27:23----------
that moment


---------27:24----------
give me color give me flavor well I


---------27:28----------
think about myself on the bed I don't


---------27:30----------
know it's mostly just fear all the time


---------27:33----------
I feel like I fear sometimes after had a


---------27:35----------
good serum I don't even want to scream


---------27:37----------
the next day because I fear having a sad


---------27:39----------
stream I've been in a bad mood yes what


---------27:41----------
are you afraid of what does that mean if


---------27:43----------
you have a bad stream I will feel


---------27:46----------
terrible in myself I'll beat myself up


---------27:47----------
about it so then I don't want to feel


---------27:49----------
that way and why are you beating


---------27:51----------
yourself up because I am not good enough


---------27:57----------
and where did you learn that you're not


---------27:59----------
good enough I don't know I'm not sure


---------28:04----------
and in your life so if we think about


---------28:07----------
someone who isn't good enough it means


---------28:08----------
that they don't do a good job right yeah


---------28:11----------
and you have a really powerful belief


---------28:13----------
that you're not good enough agreed you


---------28:15----------
have a really deep seat deep-seated


---------28:17----------
belief that you're like Guardian like


---------28:19----------
not even calm but gardener like I


---------28:21----------
believe I'm an Archon but you believe


---------28:23----------
deep down that you're a guardian or


---------28:24----------
whatever there's nothing below Guardian


---------28:26----------
is so like that belief is potent and


---------28:29----------
that you're not good enough mm-hmm and


---------28:32----------
if we think about it like for you to not


---------28:33----------
be good enough you had to do you had to


---------28:37----------
really [ __ ] up something like really


---------28:39----------
simple


---------28:40----------
like us just play a really shitty game


---------28:43----------
of dota and that got like burned in your


---------28:45----------
mind what what did you [ __ ] up that was


---------28:51----------
just so incredibly simple that the only


---------28:55----------
person who would [ __ ] it up would be the


---------28:58----------
person that like is just completely


---------29:00----------
incompetent right that belief about


---------29:03----------
yourself comes from somewhere no I don't


---------29:07----------
I can't really I don't I can't really


---------29:09----------
think back that far I pop into my mind


---------29:11----------
right away how did you feel like in the


---------29:13----------
post my mind is I guess I felt like I


---------29:19----------
felt like [ __ ]


---------29:21----------
actually that's not even the truth I


---------29:23----------
didn't even feel like [ __ ]


---------29:24----------
the first Wow itself sounds really bad


---------29:27----------
no way I really felt like I think I got


---------29:32----------
older and more mature I was like holy


---------29:33----------
[ __ ] I was so stupid back then that no


---------29:36----------
when I got a little bit older that's


---------29:37----------
when I felt like it's is really so


---------29:40----------
simple and if I was in his seat how


---------29:42----------
would I feel by my kid not coming I


---------29:44----------
don't know like you hear that it's so


---------29:48----------
simple no right that's the Guardian


---------29:52----------
level language it's so simple all you


---------29:55----------
had to do hold on one second


---------30:06----------
so all you had to do was show up and


---------30:09----------
it's so simple like you see what I mean


---------30:12----------
like that's Guardian level like all you


---------30:14----------
have to do is [ __ ] like you know just


---------30:19----------
right-click the enemy hero that's all


---------30:21----------
you've got to do mmm


---------30:23----------
you couldn't even do that and then as


---------30:25----------
you grew older how did you start to feel


---------30:28----------
about yourself


---------30:31----------
I've always felt worse and worse every


---------30:33----------
year


---------30:34----------
I feel like worse and worse right and


---------30:36----------
worse in what way I mean it kind of


---------30:43----------
depends I feel worse in a lot of ways I


---------30:45----------
think there are too many ways there are


---------30:48----------
two things I mean how did 18 year old


---------30:50----------
feel how did 18 year old you feel about


---------30:53----------
14 year old you thought I was an idiot


---------30:56----------
just that was plain and simple wasn't


---------30:58----------
like I had the wrong priorities back


---------31:02----------
then or so I'm not really sure yeah so


---------31:05----------
I'm getting a lot of so Gorka I'm asking


---------31:07----------
you a lot of sort of repetitive


---------31:08----------
questions does it feel like that do ya


---------31:11----------
no no no okay so I think part of what


---------31:14----------
we're going through is something called


---------31:15----------
alexithymia so I think that that I can I


---------31:19----------
can like you understand when I explain


---------31:20----------
analogies right like you understand that


---------31:23----------
like what I mean by Guardian love will


---------31:24----------
belief and that you have like a really


---------31:25----------
deep seat set believe that you're in


---------31:28----------
your lack like in who you are like you


---------31:31----------
think that you're just a fundamentally


---------31:32----------
like a failure


---------31:33----------
yeah and so despite all of your


---------31:36----------
successes you can't shake that feeling


---------31:39----------
and that's because that feeling doesn't


---------31:41----------
come from done' it comes from somewhere


---------31:43----------
else so it's kind of like saying like oh


---------31:45----------
like you know you keep on losing the


---------31:48----------
game because you're not my mid isn't


---------31:49----------
rotating enough and but that's not the


---------31:52----------
reason you're losing the reason you're


---------31:53----------
losing is because you always [ __ ]


---------31:55----------
pick alchemist and you build you by 14


---------31:58----------
tangos at the beginning yeah and so it's


---------32:01----------
a misdiagnosis which is why it's not


---------32:03----------
fixing the problem mm-hmm


---------32:06----------
and so I think that the challenge here


---------32:10----------
is that like you understand this stuff


---------32:12----------
on an intellectual level but whenever I


---------32:13----------
ask you about how you felt it's hard for


---------32:16----------
you to come up with words yeah


---------32:19----------
because I really genuinely feel like I


---------32:21----------
didn't feel anything like them yes and


---------32:23----------
and this is because of gaming so it's


---------32:26----------
partially because you're male partially


---------32:28----------
because of your biology and partially


---------32:30----------
because you're gaming so when we play


---------32:33----------
video games so you kind of said like


---------32:34----------
what were you doing when your dad was


---------32:35----------
dying I was playing World of Warcraft


---------32:38----------
and so what what do you think that does


---------32:43----------
to the way that you feel numb absolutely


---------32:48----------
so the problem here is that when I'm


---------32:50----------
asking you about how you felt you don't


---------32:53----------
remember because you didn't feel it and


---------32:55----------
the reason you didn't feel it is because


---------32:58----------
you were playing World of Warcraft and


---------32:59----------
World of Warcraft has a wonderful effect


---------33:02----------
on your brain there's a part of your


---------33:04----------
brain called the amygdala and there's a


---------33:06----------
car part of your brain called the limbic


---------33:07----------
system the amygdala is sort of our fear


---------33:10----------
and survival center our limbic system is


---------33:13----------
our emotional center of the brain if I


---------33:17----------
do a study and I take a bunch of people


---------33:20----------
who are playing World of Warcraft what


---------33:22----------
do you think I'll see in their amygdala


---------33:23----------
a limbic system what does it do to that


---------33:25----------
part of the brain


---------33:27----------
well as Olga we flat land right there


---------33:29----------
good absolutely exactly correct shuts it


---------33:33----------
off so when we play video games weeks


---------33:36----------
the the experience of negative emotion


---------33:38----------
goes away yeah right


---------33:41----------
so like I'm hearing a couple of really


---------33:43----------
interesting things which suggests to me


---------33:45----------
that the money is somewhere around early


---------33:47----------
high school so here's what I forgot so


---------33:50----------
far I used to be a class clown what


---------33:52----------
happened in high school my dad thought


---------33:55----------
yeah right and then you became isolated


---------34:00----------
you started playing video games I think


---------34:03----------
it's unfair to say I was playing a lot


---------34:05----------
of video games before that as well sure


---------34:07----------
but yeah so and that but but the


---------34:10----------
isolation started around then right yeah


---------34:13----------
okay so the other thing that you were


---------34:15----------
mentioning is that when did you start


---------34:19----------
comparing yourself to other people and


---------34:20----------
caring about grades that was in eighth


---------34:23----------
grade okay that's when you're on of


---------34:26----------
thirteen or something for yeah I'm not


---------34:28----------
sure and what when did your dad get sick


---------34:31----------
around 13 or 14 I guess okay


---------34:34----------
it was around there is one half year of


---------34:37----------
cancer Yeah right so like I think some


---------34:41----------
things like there's just too many things


---------34:42----------
and when I asked you like before we


---------34:44----------
started talking to streaming I'd asked


---------34:46----------
you like you know when did the feelings


---------34:48----------
of inadequacy begin like when did you


---------34:50----------
start compare actually not of to


---------34:51----------
feelings of inadequacy this is different


---------34:52----------
when did you start getting satisfaction


---------34:54----------
by being better than other people and


---------34:56----------
what did you say


---------34:57----------
do you remember I don't remember but I


---------35:00----------
guess it was around eighth grade then


---------35:02----------
right with the grades yeah so there are


---------35:05----------
a lot of logical reasons why you know


---------35:08----------
like you didn't have grades before


---------35:09----------
eighth grade yeah you know actually you


---------35:13----------
had been gaming before but like to me it


---------35:15----------
seems like bizarre that in a span of 45


---------35:17----------
minutes we come to like this one time


---------35:19----------
zone over and over and over again yeah


---------35:24----------
and so I think something really powerful


---------35:25----------
happened to you during that time and I


---------35:28----------
think you don't even know what happened


---------35:29----------
to you because there were parts of your


---------35:31----------
brain like you were blocking it out so


---------35:33----------
heavily that like you didn't even


---------35:35----------
understand what was happening yeah but I


---------35:37----------
don't you don't keep on talking about


---------35:39----------
when you were eight you don't keep on


---------35:40----------
talking about when you were 18 you don't


---------35:42----------
keep on talking about when you were 21


---------35:44----------
mm-hmm I don't remember those days so


---------35:47----------
well I feel like I'm well I'm also not


---------35:50----------
something to mention I don't think I've


---------35:51----------
cried since then neither since I was 13


---------35:53----------
yeah I have definitely not cried at all


---------35:56----------
I've been through breakups and many


---------35:59----------
deaths and families of I've never really


---------36:01----------
felt like a visceral emotional response


---------36:03----------
to it even though I'm not I don't think


---------36:05----------
I'm a psychopath or anything but I just


---------36:06----------
can't express myself that yeah so this


---------36:09----------
is also so the alexithymia means


---------36:11----------
inability to determine your internal


---------36:15----------
emotional environment so you don't know


---------36:18----------
what you feel yeah like your brain has


---------36:20----------
become so that limbic system that


---------36:23----------
amygdala has become so shut off that you


---------36:26----------
don't it's almost like you don't have


---------36:27----------
the capacity to cry no like when when


---------36:31----------
people think like Oh someone hasn't


---------36:32----------
cried like they must be really strong


---------36:34----------
like it's not that you're strong


---------36:36----------
although you are it's just that you


---------36:39----------
literally don't know how to yeah and so


---------36:44----------
I think that that like to me it sounds


---------36:47----------
to me like you've really done one thing


---------36:48----------
that I can think of that justifies the


---------36:54----------
way that you feel about yourself which


---------36:56----------
is that you're inadequate and that


---------36:58----------
you're kind of like fundamentally a


---------36:59----------
failure and that people are gonna see


---------37:01----------
like even though you pretend to be


---------37:03----------
something big and wonderful and glorious


---------37:05----------
people are gonna see one day that you're


---------37:07----------
a complete piece of [ __ ] and what do you


---------37:11----------
think I think that thing is well I think


---------37:16----------
that's related to me not visiting my dad


---------37:18----------
absolutely because that is the most


---------37:23----------
basic thing no what do you think


---------37:28----------
I think you're it's kind of hard for me


---------37:32----------
to like agree with you because I know it


---------37:34----------
like you said I feel like my emotions


---------37:36----------
have flatlined so I can't really fully


---------37:39----------
agree with you because I don't know


---------37:41----------
really if that's the case or not yep


---------37:43----------
so now now this is kind of an


---------37:45----------
interesting place right so sometimes


---------37:46----------
people come on stream and they like have


---------37:48----------
these like big emotional like oh like


---------37:50----------
you know like reckful was like really


---------37:52----------
emotional and like Scotty was really


---------37:53----------
emotional and people get really


---------37:54----------
emotional and I think like there's I'm


---------37:56----------
almost concerned that there's like an


---------37:58----------
expectation that that's what's gonna


---------37:59----------
happen it's not and I can't put on the


---------38:01----------
waterworks I'm sorry yeah and I I don't


---------38:03----------
think you should alright so like even


---------38:06----------
that like I feel the pressure of like


---------38:07----------
making you cry but I don't you're going


---------38:10----------
in for the kill okay I mean I think


---------38:12----------
we're there I think it's just you're


---------38:14----------
just so emotionally flatlined that


---------38:16----------
that's not gonna happen so what we have


---------38:18----------
to do is like like you know we have to


---------38:20----------
explore those emotions you got to like


---------38:22----------
learn how to experience and remember and


---------38:25----------
I think that the way that this is gonna


---------38:27----------
happen is through like actually your


---------38:29----------
anger because you can experience anger


---------38:31----------
Oh anger can experience a lot yes let


---------38:36----------
let's talk about this for a second like


---------38:40----------
I'm gonna just explain something to you


---------38:42----------
Gork so and feel free to jump in if you


---------38:45----------
have questions or thoughts or agree or


---------38:46----------
disagree so anger I want everyone to


---------38:48----------
understand this anger is a protective


---------38:50----------
emotion right so like anger is the


---------38:53----------
emotion that we feel to bury all of our


---------38:56----------
other emotions yeah so when I when I get


---------38:59----------
like when I get dumped by my girlfriend


---------39:02----------
can you guys imagine like sure sometimes


---------39:05----------
I'll feel sad but other times like I


---------39:07----------
won't feel sad at all be I'll just be


---------39:10----------
[ __ ] pissed I'll be angrier mmm-hmm


---------39:12----------
I'll be like [ __ ] her like she doesn't


---------39:14----------
know what she's missing she doesn't she


---------39:17----------
she's not gonna end up with anyone good


---------39:18----------
like she's a piece of [ __ ] how could she


---------39:21----------
do this to me like [ __ ] her does that


---------39:23----------
make sense to you that someone could


---------39:24----------
feel that way


---------39:25----------
of course right so what there are other


---------39:29----------
emotions too like there are other


---------39:31----------
thoughts and feelings that they could be


---------39:32----------
having like what else do you think they


---------39:33----------
could be feeling


---------39:35----------
instead of anger yeah or underneath the


---------39:38----------
anger well I guess a bunch of emotions


---------39:44----------
like jealousy and a hatred I guess it's


---------39:48----------
kind of like anger sadness of course


---------39:50----------
yeah right so there are other thoughts


---------39:52----------
that they could be having but they don't


---------39:53----------
realize they're having these thoughts


---------39:54----------
which is that if she dumped me


---------39:56----------
is everyone else going to as well like


---------39:59----------
that thought almost always is there but


---------40:01----------
people don't they don't realize that but


---------40:03----------
there are other like deeper thoughts


---------40:05----------
like am i fundamentally unlovable is


---------40:07----------
something wrong with me yeah all that


---------40:11----------
stuff is there but we just don't feel it


---------40:13----------
so in your case Gork I think that this


---------40:17----------
may feel a little bit unsatisfying but I


---------40:19----------
think in your case you've got to learn


---------40:21----------
how to do a couple of things one is


---------40:24----------
recognize that there's something inside


---------40:26----------
you which I think you've already done


---------40:27----------
which sort of fundamentally like you


---------40:29----------
start with this idea that like you're


---------40:31----------
like a guardian level player okay you


---------40:34----------
have to think about like that comes from


---------40:36----------
somewhere right and and out of


---------40:38----------
everything that we've put to you I think


---------40:39----------
logically I think I can win you over


---------40:42----------
although I fully understand that it


---------40:43----------
doesn't feel right that it has to do


---------40:47----------
with your dad but I think that's because


---------40:49----------
you're so separated from your feelings


---------40:50----------
that it's not gonna feel like anything


---------40:52----------
if you were if you were in touch with


---------40:54----------
because this is comes from a feeling


---------40:55----------
it's not logic right and then and since


---------40:59----------
you're so since you're not capable of


---------41:00----------
feeling things besides anger right now


---------41:03----------
you're not gonna be able to find the


---------41:05----------
source of it because you're blind it's


---------41:08----------
like you're playing dota with your


---------41:10----------
monitor off and then like you know it's


---------41:13----------
not going to be able to tell what's


---------41:14----------
going on like it's just impossible so we


---------41:16----------
have to teach you how to feel your


---------41:18----------
emotions and I think the first thing


---------41:21----------
that we're gonna do is through anger


---------41:23----------
like anger is gonna be your clue the


---------41:25----------
other thing at some point that I think


---------41:27----------
you should do is learn how to forgive


---------41:28----------
yourself mm-hmm


---------41:31----------
what do you think that's hard yeah


---------41:33----------
that's my main issue I can't do that


---------41:36----------
it's impossible why not


---------41:38----------
well we said a couple words before the


---------41:41----------
sodastream but it was it's basically


---------41:43----------
because I feel like me not forgiving


---------41:45----------
myself is feeling like me giving up on


---------41:47----------
improving


---------41:49----------
like I think a reason I even had success


---------41:52----------
in the first place of because I always


---------41:54----------
no matter what like started my stream


---------41:56----------
every day no matter how bad I felt I


---------41:57----------
just I just started and even though I


---------42:01----------
hate like how I performed I started


---------42:03----------
every day I'm like vigilant and if I


---------42:06----------
forgive myself and started taking it


---------42:07----------
easy on myself I feel like I'm gonna


---------42:09----------
stop improving that's the fear I have


---------42:11----------
all the time so let me ask you this what


---------42:14----------
is forgiving what what is what what do


---------42:18----------
you think forgiving yourself means I


---------42:22----------
don't know giving yourself a break from


---------42:24----------
failures


---------42:28----------
okay


---------42:31----------
and


---------42:33----------
you're not willing to do that it's hard


---------42:37----------
I know it's probably better to do it but


---------42:40----------
I I just can't there's like the block


---------42:42----------
for me not yeah I've thought about it


---------42:45----------
it's destructive behavior like hating


---------42:47----------
myself and it only leads to me being


---------42:50----------
worse person and being more unhappy but


---------42:53----------
I just can't stop doing it's like the


---------42:54----------
main issue I have yeah so we did talk a


---------42:57----------
little bit before it and and this is the


---------42:59----------
thing that I explained to Gork which


---------43:01----------
I'll explain to everyone else I did I


---------43:02----------
think in gorks case this is dangerous


---------43:03----------
because the way that he treats him the


---------43:07----------
way you treat yourself court is


---------43:09----------
responsible for a lot of your success


---------43:12----------
mm-hmm right that being unable to


---------43:16----------
forgive yourself is a lot of what keeps


---------43:19----------
you as successful because that's where


---------43:21----------
your drive comes from that's where your


---------43:22----------
work ethic comes from you don't know if


---------43:24----------
you don't deserve to rest you don't


---------43:26----------
deserve forgiveness you just need to do


---------43:28----------
better and better and better and better


---------43:30----------
and then like it's like you're whipping


---------43:31----------
yourself right like you're whipping


---------43:34----------
yourself like you're like like whipping


---------43:35----------
like a horse or cattle or something to


---------43:37----------
run you're like harder Gork harder more


---------43:40----------
and more it's not good enough it's not


---------43:42----------
good enough keep going


---------43:44----------
I don't care if it hurts you keep going


---------43:47----------
and then what happens to social media


---------43:49----------
and twitch come along and they say hey


---------43:52----------
look when you do this to yourself


---------43:54----------
you become what door angry


---------43:58----------
angry sure but I was going for


---------44:00----------
successful okay right so then the world


---------44:05----------
tells you hey this is a winning strategy


---------44:07----------
this works for you look at all the


---------44:09----------
viewers you're getting so beat yourself


---------44:11----------
up more man yeah and there's pie little


---------44:16----------
it they just what they help help beating


---------44:19----------
me as well a little bit right and that's


---------44:23----------
you guys are like that's why you you


---------44:26----------
know like here's the thing gorg do you


---------44:27----------
think you would stream do you think that


---------44:29----------
it would help or hurt your motivation if


---------44:31----------
everyone in stream loved you constantly


---------44:33----------
sorry if you cut out there for a second


---------44:36----------
sorry do you think it would help or hurt


---------44:39----------
your motivation if everyone on stream


---------44:41----------
loved you constantly no I will just feel


---------44:44----------
like it would something would be wrong


---------44:46----------
then like okay good


---------44:49----------
what would be wrong I mean I've had this


---------44:51----------
before where I feel mad about myself and


---------44:55----------
stuff but people feel sympathy for me


---------44:57----------
and I mean there are generally some very


---------44:58----------
nice people out there that feel sympathy


---------45:00----------
for me but then I feel like I don't


---------45:01----------
deserve it


---------45:02----------
and then it just gets worse like I just


---------45:05----------
give you an anger because forehand


---------45:07----------
there's so many people out there you


---------45:08----------
know they're gonna be supported and


---------45:09----------
stuff and it's like it's just but I it's


---------45:12----------
not right you know I didn't do well


---------45:13----------
enough to deserve it


---------45:14----------
yeah so when did you deserve when did


---------45:17----------
you how did you learn that you don't


---------45:18----------
deserve other people's kindness what


---------45:20----------
kind of person doesn't deserve people's


---------45:21----------
kindness


---------45:22----------
Gork


---------45:24----------
I don't know nobody I guess but so what


---------45:30----------
kind of person like why don't you


---------45:31----------
deserve other people's kindness like


---------45:33----------
everyone does except you okay yeah right


---------45:37----------
yeah but I don't know why like what is


---------45:44----------
because I'm not good enough that's it


---------45:45----------
pretty much it yeah I just didn't


---------45:47----------
perform well enough from you you're not


---------45:50----------
good enough yeah


---------45:55----------
did you feel that way when you were like


---------45:56----------
growing up


---------45:58----------
yeah a lot of the time I always had my


---------46:02----------
older brother to compare with and he was


---------46:04----------
always better is older stronger bigger


---------46:05----------
mm-hmm never quite as good as him okay


---------46:11----------
[Music]


---------46:12----------
I'm smiling because I think I'm I'm a


---------46:17----------
I have one more thing that I'd like to


---------46:18----------
ask you about so tell me about you said


---------46:20----------
that when you were growing up your


---------46:23----------
parents were divorced yeah since I was


---------46:25----------
four okay and what were what were things


---------46:28----------
like you said something about your your


---------46:30----------
dad didn't treat your mom well well my


---------46:33----------
earliest childhood memories was my dad


---------46:36----------
like yelling a lot of my mom and my mom


---------46:40----------
complaining a lot about my dad basically


---------46:42----------
and I was kind of in between all that


---------46:46----------
stuff and it sucks as a kid


---------46:50----------
okay what sucked about it


---------46:55----------
sucked I don't know


---------46:58----------
suck just the knowing that my dad is so


---------47:03----------
[ __ ] according to my mom and that they


---------47:05----------
hate each other so much and I didn't


---------47:06----------
understand why when I was a kid I didn't


---------47:08----------
know what my dad had done wrong only


---------47:10----------
that I was taught to hate him too for


---------47:11----------
the first like 10 years of my life


---------47:13----------
mm-hmm and then after that I realized


---------47:15----------
maybe that wasn't the full truth but


---------47:17----------
yeah how did tell me about that how were


---------47:20----------
you taught to hate your dad well


---------47:23----------
basically it was a piece of [ __ ] because


---------47:25----------
well one reason I do think justifiably I


---------47:28----------
should maybe not like my dad my dad was


---------47:30----------
pretty well-off not super well-off but


---------47:32----------
he was well-off my mom didn't have like


---------47:34----------
a job and she was struggling a lot she


---------47:36----------
was like I remember her even crying in


---------47:38----------
the kitchen one day because you didn't


---------47:39----------
have a job and I knew my dad had money


---------47:41----------
and could help us out but he'd like bail


---------47:43----------
on us and that made me start hate my dad


---------47:46----------
as well a lot and also made me really


---------47:51----------
fearful of also running out of money one


---------47:53----------
day though that would suck a lot being


---------47:55----------
like my mom crying on the table like in


---------47:56----------
front of my kids that it's very shitty


---------47:58----------
she like drained my brother's bank


---------48:00----------
account just to be able to pay month's


---------48:02----------
rent and stuff and that's really


---------48:04----------
something that [ __ ] with me and in


---------48:06----------
what way well ever since ever since that


---------48:10----------
moment I remember that moment very


---------48:11----------
clearly ever since that moment I've


---------48:13----------
never liked I never liked spending money


---------48:15----------
like whatever money I make right now I


---------48:17----------
save everything because I'm really


---------48:18----------
fearful of running out of it and I hate


---------48:21----------
spending on anything that's excessive


---------48:23----------
for myself mm-hmm because I'm afraid of


---------48:25----------
losing all my money and yeah well like I


---------48:27----------
said my dad could have helped us out but


---------48:28----------
he didn't and my mom was stuck in a


---------48:30----------
shitty situation and do you remember I


---------48:32----------
mean so it sounds like you remember a


---------48:33----------
specific instance where your mom was


---------48:35----------
crying yeah I remember that very clearly


---------48:37----------
how did it do you remember what it felt


---------48:40----------
like to watch her cry


---------48:42----------
I don't know I just remember I felt I


---------48:45----------
felt like angry and I felt sad because I


---------48:48----------
think that that's as I mean genuinely


---------48:50----------
when I thought about is that I think


---------48:52----------
that's what a lot of things that drives


---------48:53----------
me is the fact that I don't want to be


---------48:55----------
poor like that and you know I don't want


---------48:58----------
my mom to be out of money again she's


---------49:00----------
better now but what were you sad about I


---------49:04----------
don't know I was sad about her being sad


---------49:09----------
I'm not sure I was too young to


---------49:11----------
understand really yeah hmm and what


---------49:17----------
changed for you around the age of 10


---------49:20----------
well like I said I just got a lot more


---------49:25----------
money conscious at a very young age I


---------49:27----------
didn't spend my allowance I didn't do


---------49:29----------
anything like that I just gave it all


---------49:30----------
back to my mom hmm that's rare


---------49:35----------
I felt very different from other kids in


---------49:39----------
that regard but I just didn't feel right


---------49:41----------
how are you different from other kids


---------49:44----------
that I didn't like spending money I


---------49:47----------
didn't like buying toys and [ __ ] like


---------49:48----------
that okay hmm I'm gonna think for a


---------49:55----------
second is that okay no of course I'm


---------50:03----------
debating between asking you what you


---------50:05----------
want help with and trying to figure out


---------50:07----------
what you need help with sorry you cut


---------50:09----------
off for last aren't there I was I'm


---------50:11----------
debating in my mind between asking you


---------50:14----------
what you want help with like how can I


---------50:16----------
help you and trying to figure out for


---------50:18----------
myself what I think you need yeah the


---------50:23----------
thing is I feel like I have so many


---------50:24----------
aspects that I could need help with I


---------50:26----------
guess I mean not many but a couple of


---------50:29----------
aspects like I mentioned feeling


---------50:30----------
inadequate and always having a fear of


---------50:32----------
running out of money and stuff but yeah


---------50:36----------
I guess if you ask me what I need help


---------50:37----------
with I guess it's dealing with my ego in


---------50:41----------
a way and breaking out of this cycle of


---------50:43----------
constant self-hatred about everything


---------50:46----------
basically


---------50:48----------
okay so breaking out of that cycle of


---------50:53----------
constant cycle of self-hatred involves


---------50:55----------
two approaches one is that we have to


---------50:57----------
get to the root of where the self-hatred


---------50:58----------
exists okay and we have to fix that we


---------51:02----------
have to heal it know the other thing


---------51:05----------
that we can do is stop the process of


---------51:08----------
the cycle not get the root but just like


---------51:12----------
cancel it in the middle so I'm gonna do


---------51:14----------
both we're gonna do both okay now the


---------51:17----------
first thing is that as I mentioned to


---------51:21----------
you before so let me just think for a


---------51:24----------
second so I think this actually segues


---------51:25----------
well into what we normally do on Sunday


---------51:27----------
so I'm gonna try to explain to you gore


---------51:29----------
how your mind works and like like a


---------51:32----------
function of it okay so you have this


---------51:35----------
unshakable belief that you're inadequate


---------51:37----------
and not good enough and that the rest of


---------51:39----------
the world it's only a matter of time


---------51:41----------
before everyone knows you know that's


---------51:45----------
one part of your mind and whether that


---------51:47----------
comes from whether it's too simplistic


---------51:48----------
for me to sort of believe that that


---------51:50----------
comes from your dad and like watching


---------51:52----------
your dad die I think it's actually more


---------51:53----------
complicated than that I don't think you


---------51:55----------
are quite as emotionally dead as you


---------51:58----------
sometimes come across I think actually


---------52:01----------
we're missing it by a little bit and I'm


---------52:03----------
actually getting I'm overvaluing your


---------52:05----------
dad's passing I think there's something


---------52:08----------
actually before your dad's passing that


---------52:10----------
is actually where the money is and it's


---------52:12----------
gonna take more time to explore and


---------52:14----------
figure that out


---------52:14----------
mmm-hmm there's something weird about


---------52:17----------
judgement and self-worth and like


---------52:20----------
there's one question that I've been


---------52:22----------
wanting to ask you and I just haven't


---------52:24----------
figured out


---------52:27----------
how to frame this and it's like did you


---------52:33----------
think that if you had done a better job


---------52:36----------
your dad would have been nicer to you


---------52:39----------
guys or would have been around more no I


---------52:43----------
don't think I blame myself for that okay


---------52:45----------
I couldn't find kind of in a real like


---------52:50----------
usually I ask one question related to


---------52:53----------
another question I couldn't find


---------52:54----------
anything relating to that but I just


---------52:56----------
have to wonder something about you know


---------52:58----------
it just sounded strange that he was kind


---------53:00----------
of demonized and around the age of ten


---------53:02----------
you started to like think like maybe


---------53:05----------
this is different


---------53:05----------
yeah because we started having more


---------53:08----------
contact with each other basically we


---------53:10----------
started meeting up on every weekend took


---------53:11----------
me out doing stuff I guess yeah and you


---------53:14----------
say that your dad loved you a lot


---------53:16----------
yeah I think so yeah and and so I mean I


---------53:20----------
I think you blame yourself a lot for not


---------53:25----------
going to see him before you died before


---------53:27----------
he died sorry yeah I did I do and and I


---------53:31----------
think when you blame yourself for that


---------53:33----------
like you start to think that your aim it


---------53:35----------
was such a simple thing and such like a


---------53:37----------
core thing for a son to do for their


---------53:39----------
father mm-hmm that like that that crime


---------53:42----------
in your mind I think is unforgivable


---------53:47----------
yeah I don't like to think about it a


---------53:49----------
lot because it feels so I guess it feels


---------53:51----------
pointless cuz he's already dead because


---------53:54----------
I can't really do anything about it


---------53:55----------
anymore so when I said that first second


---------53:58----------
you bit your lip what did you feel in


---------54:00----------
your body I don't know okay I don't know


---------54:05----------
how to put it into words okay close your


---------54:08----------
eyes okay tell me what you feel in your


---------54:11----------
body right now


---------54:12----------
I don't know I feel so emotionally numb


---------54:18----------
but I don't really feel anything


---------54:19----------
I'm not asking about emotions I'm


---------54:20----------
talking about physical sensations okay


---------54:23----------
well I was very aware that my breathing


---------54:25----------
was very shitty now so now is our


---------54:26----------
breathing better okay well I feel like


---------54:28----------
my breathing was extremely shallow okay


---------54:30----------
I'm just in the stomach yeah for okay


---------54:32----------
and and what were you feeling in your


---------54:35----------
stomach or your chest or your throat


---------54:38----------
well I was feeling really uncomfortable


---------54:39----------
because my palms are really sweaty and I


---------54:43----------
guess in my chest I was feeling a little


---------54:45----------
bit of trembling for some reason I don't


---------54:47----------
know why yeah


---------54:51----------
might be related to the breathing okay


---------54:54----------
what are you are you still feeling the


---------54:55----------
trembling maybe a little bit I'm feeling


---------54:59----------
some discomfort in the chest there eyes


---------55:01----------
closed okay sorry so I want you to put


---------55:05----------
yourself in the shoes of 18 year old


---------55:07----------
Gork I'm thinking about 14 year old cork


---------55:11----------
yeah what do you what do you what do you


---------55:16----------
feel in your body when you like remember


---------55:20----------
the way that you used to think about


---------55:21----------
yourself for not going to see your dad


---------55:28----------
doesn't feel some guilt but it's not


---------55:30----------
overbearing because I feel like it 18 I


---------55:33----------
was still in the clouds playing my video


---------55:35----------
games so when did it start when did the


---------55:38----------
guilt start to get bad the guilt started


---------55:43----------
to get worse the older again so I feel


---------55:44----------
like this is the worst right now


---------55:46----------
I'm 26 because when you think about your


---------55:49----------

---------56:15----------
dad was sick how do you feel about


---------56:17----------
yourself I just feel stupid but I feel


---------56:22----------
like I wouldn't have done anything


---------56:23----------
different today because I have not


---------56:25----------
matured since then really I'm just the


---------56:28----------
same idiot playing games and only


---------56:30----------
thinking about myself


---------56:34----------
what do you feel right now in your body


---------56:37----------
as you say that I feel like comfortable


---------56:40----------
as they're filling with my hands I don't


---------56:42----------
know I felt like I started pressing a


---------56:46----------
bit on myself because I mean maybe it


---------56:48----------
was a way to self punish I'm not sure


---------56:50----------
okay uh yeah you guys felt stupid I


---------56:54----------
guess


---------56:55----------
yeah what is what a stupid feel like in


---------56:57----------
your body like flushing hot sensation I


---------57:02----------
guess where my neck throat face okay is


---------57:11----------
the flushing still there a little bit I


---------57:15----------
guess


---------57:15----------
okay so Corky I want you to sit up


---------57:19----------
straight okay okay and I want you to lay


---------57:26----------
your palms face up on your knees I can I


---------57:29----------
look okay yeah and I want you to breathe


---------57:36----------
in slowly and out slowly and then again


---------57:53----------
and I want you to notice continue


---------57:56----------
breathing and notice the temperature of


---------57:59----------
your breath and everybody at home should


---------58:02----------
be doing this to tell me what you notice


---------58:08----------
about your temperature the temperature


---------58:10----------
of your breath now notice it's hot and


---------58:16----------
moist because it my mustache is


---------58:18----------
absorbing it okay so you're you're


---------58:22----------
noticing the breath on your mustache


---------58:24----------
that's what you're paying attention to I


---------58:26----------
want you to go into the nose what do you


---------58:32----------
notice about the breath in your nose


---------58:39----------
well I noticed it's kinda hot because my


---------58:43----------
room is too [ __ ] hot right now


---------58:45----------
hot going in or coming out going in okay


---------58:49----------
so I want you to follow it if you follow


---------58:54----------
that sensation of heat as it enters your


---------58:56----------
nose and where does it go well first it


---------59:01----------
goes in my chest and then I start


---------59:02----------
filling up my stomach okay what happens


---------59:12----------
to it is it goes into your chest and


---------59:14----------
stomach you feel warmth there yeah


---------59:19----------
warmth a little bit of tingling okay and


---------59:23----------
then follow it as you exhale as well so


---------59:27----------
it goes down into your stomach and as


---------59:32----------
you exhale can you follow it back out


---------59:35----------
yeah does it change it all on the way


---------59:40----------
out yeah


---------59:47----------
feels like it's smoother going out okay


---------59:56----------
now I want you to pay attention to your


---------59:58----------
shoulders below your stomach does your


---------60:04----------
breath to go there well it does now but


---------60:14----------
if maybe then before okay follow that


---------60:17----------
sensation we talking about shoulders or


---------60:22----------
below the stomach goes through the


---------60:26----------
stomach mostly no okay so pay attention


---------60:30----------
see if it goes even a little bit beyond


---------60:33----------
the stomach into the hips into the legs


---------60:57----------
what do you feel feel a nice warming


---------61:06----------
calming sensation of my body is okay is


---------61:12----------
that something that you feel often not


---------61:17----------
really what is your production


---------61:20----------
what does your body usually feel


---------61:25----------
uncomfortable I guess a little bit


---------61:30----------
sundar shallow breath okay now I think I


---------61:47----------
know how to help you mm-hmm first of all


---------61:50----------
what did you think of that practice I


---------61:52----------
think it was nice


---------61:54----------
I've tried meditation before but I


---------61:56----------
didn't feel like it helped me a lot but


---------61:59----------
I feel like it helped a lot when you


---------62:01----------
told me what to do


---------62:04----------
so we're not gonna get so you're not


---------62:07----------
gonna be able to forgive yourself unless


---------62:08----------
you first master anger you cut off there


---------62:11----------
so I said you're not gonna be able to


---------62:13----------
forgive yourself until you first master


---------62:16----------
your anger everything is being buried by


---------62:19----------
your anger anger is the only thing you


---------62:21----------
can detect even in terms of so what's


---------62:24----------
happening is like for men especially who


---------62:26----------
are Alexa thymic the way that I help


---------62:29----------
them understand their emotions because


---------62:31----------
many much like yourself like you guys


---------62:33----------
just can't it's like you're colorblind


---------62:35----------
and it just doesn't matter how hard I


---------62:38----------
try to tell you to see the blue or the


---------62:40----------
purple you just can't see color and


---------62:42----------
you're not gonna be able to see color


---------62:43----------
you see just one color which is anger no


---------62:47----------
right


---------62:49----------
so it's my belief that the anger in this


---------62:52----------
we've talked through before that you


---------62:53----------
have some deeper sense of inadequacy or


---------62:56----------
shame or your piece of [ __ ] or you don't


---------62:58----------
deserve like everyone else deserves


---------63:00----------
forgiveness right but who doesn't


---------63:01----------
deserve forgiveness court me absolutely


---------63:04----------
so just like think about that for a


---------63:06----------
second that is not logical at all that


---------63:10----------
absolutely comes from an emotion that


---------63:13----------
comes from a sense of self that comes


---------63:17----------
from a sense of self that is just you


---------63:19----------
have committed crimes so bad that you


---------63:22----------
are unforgivable yeah so somewhere in


---------63:26----------
there you committed something you did


---------63:28----------
something where you got this belief that


---------63:31----------
you are just not worth you're not worth


---------63:33----------
anything and even though we can


---------63:37----------
logically kind of get to it I don't


---------63:38----------
think you can get to it emotionally


---------63:39----------
which is exactly what you need to know


---------63:42----------
but in order to get to it the problem is


---------63:44----------
that your anger protects you from it


---------63:46----------
because when you get angry at yourself


---------63:48----------
and winch it and when those five percent


---------63:50----------
of twitch chat starts hating you you


---------63:52----------
just jump right on board because you're


---------63:53----------
like this is a game I know how to play


---------63:55----------
yeah like I understand how to do this


---------63:57----------
like this make actually in a weird way


---------63:59----------
that makes you feel good it does it


---------64:02----------
makes you feel like it makes it it's


---------64:04----------
just right it makes you feel righteous


---------64:07----------
like this is what I deserve


---------64:10----------
like they see me for the person that I


---------64:13----------
am which is like a real piece of [ __ ]


---------64:14----------
you're like I can get on board with that


---------64:16----------
you guys want to beat the [ __ ] out of me


---------64:17----------
like let me show you how you can get on


---------64:19----------
board with that and as long as that


---------64:23----------
feeling is there you're not gonna be


---------64:25----------
able to get underneath mm-hmm so you


---------64:28----------
have to dismantle the anger how through


---------64:31----------
them by breathing right so the next time


---------64:34----------
you you start to tilt on stream so


---------64:37----------
you've got a couple of options one is


---------64:38----------
that if I can catch you while you're


---------64:40----------
live I would love it like not live isn't


---------64:42----------
streaming but it's so hard to evoke


---------64:45----------
emotion and you that like I want to talk


---------64:46----------
to you while you feel these things while


---------64:49----------
they're in your face and while all of


---------64:51----------
your adaptive mechanisms to protect


---------64:53----------
yourself are too weak


---------64:56----------
yeah uh-huh I just found it completely


---------65:01----------
hilarious thinking that you've been same


---------65:03----------
discord as me while I'm streaming and


---------65:05----------
yelling and you telling me to calm down


---------65:06----------
I'm not gonna tell you to calm down oh


---------65:09----------
no no buddy I'm not gonna tell you to


---------65:12----------
calm down not at all [ __ ] no all right


---------65:15----------
I'm gonna tell you to feel all right


---------65:18----------
because you have you have these earmuffs


---------65:21----------
on right so you can't detect emotion


---------65:23----------
because you're blocking it out so what


---------65:25----------
we need to do is like when the volume is


---------65:27----------
way turned up and you feel a lot of


---------65:29----------
emotion that's what we need to talk


---------65:31----------
because then if I start asking you


---------65:33----------
questions you're gonna be able to feel


---------65:34----------
things yeah yeah I think you have a


---------65:38----------
point there yeah yeah I also saw


---------65:40----------
something in your eyes that I haven't


---------65:42----------
snow at all whoa let's give let's give


---------65:47----------
to a chat a chance what are you guys


---------65:49----------
seeing in gorks face right now they got


---------65:57----------
it are you watching twitch chat I wasn't


---------65:59----------
I avoid it what did they say they said


---------66:03----------
hope okay is that what you feel yeah


---------66:09----------
feels nice talking about it it's very


---------66:13----------
rare to do something like I guess


---------66:16----------
helpful for myself yeah that is not self


---------66:19----------
hatred related then you know like so


---------66:21----------
it's always nice yeah right so like just


---------66:24----------
think about that for a second why don't


---------66:27----------
you do things for yourself Gord


---------66:28----------
why aren't you kind to yourself because


---------66:33----------
I don't deserve it


---------66:34----------
there you go you don't [ __ ] deserve


---------66:38----------
write crimes against humanity so it


---------66:42----------
starts with anger mm-hmm


---------66:45----------
so we have to get you to decompress your


---------66:48----------
anger and we have to see what's


---------66:50----------
underneath because anger is that


---------66:51----------
protective mechanism it's like you know


---------66:54----------
anger is like it's like justice it's


---------66:56----------
righteous it's like you know like you


---------67:00----------
know there's just so much like we have


---------67:02----------
to get underneath that and see what's


---------67:03----------
underneath


---------67:04----------
when you start to tilt when you start to


---------67:07----------
get pissed when you start to feel these


---------67:08----------
things about yourself and I suspect that


---------67:11----------
there's a part of you that actually


---------67:12----------
doesn't want to feel those things when


---------67:14----------
you're talking to me like I don't even


---------67:16----------
think you want to solve this problem


---------67:18----------
like there's a part of you that's like


---------67:20----------
this is my life and like this guy's


---------67:21----------
gonna take it away from me and so you're


---------67:23----------
actually existing like you don't like


---------67:26----------
you want to be helped like there's a


---------67:27----------
part of you that wants to be helped but


---------67:28----------
there's a part of you that's like if


---------67:30----------
this guy does it then I'm gonna be I'm


---------67:33----------
gonna be [ __ ] out of luck because this


---------67:35----------
must be myself I move exactly so just


---------67:38----------
think about that for a second you think


---------67:41----------
this is who you are you think you're


---------67:43----------
unforgivable you think that you're


---------67:45----------
inadequate you think that you don't


---------67:47----------
deserve forgiveness it's it and your


---------67:50----------
words are then I'm not going to be


---------67:52----------
myself anymore this is who you are


---------67:54----------
it's not even think this is who you are


---------67:57----------
you believe you are this is what you


---------67:59----------
know you are mm-hmm and so at some point


---------68:04----------
it's gonna require hope and it's gonna


---------68:07----------
require facing your fear it's gonna


---------68:10----------
require courage it's gonna require


---------68:14----------
you've gotten so comfortable with the


---------68:17----------
idea that you're you're a piece of [ __ ]


---------68:19----------
that you're terrified to even check the


---------68:23----------
thought that you may not be is so scary


---------68:28----------
yeah what would it mean if you weren't a


---------68:34----------
piece of [ __ ] well I don't know


---------68:40----------
everything I've built so far I feels


---------68:42----------
like I've built on being a piece of [ __ ]


---------68:43----------
so what does mean not being one so like


---------68:47----------
your world comes crumbling down around


---------68:49----------
you right and I think it's got to it's


---------68:52----------
got to doesn't mean that you're gonna


---------68:53----------
fail but your world absolutely needs to


---------68:56----------
come crumbling down because the world


---------68:57----------
that you built is like toxic dude yeah


---------69:00----------
it's so toxic it's got to come down all


---------69:02----------
of it


---------69:04----------
that requires courage because once it


---------69:06----------
comes down you don't know what you're


---------69:08----------
gonna see


---------69:10----------
Gork this is crazy okay but yeah you are


---------69:13----------
in an abusive relationship with yourself


---------69:18----------
yeah I can see that right and like


---------69:23----------
people get confused because why don't


---------69:25----------
like people from the outside get


---------69:27----------
confused they're like why don't people


---------69:28----------
just like leave their abusive


---------69:30----------
relationship why don't people move on


---------69:33----------
what do you think because it's familiar


---------69:36----------
absolutely yeah right because at least


---------69:40----------
you know what you're dealing with so the


---------69:43----------
mind prefers the familiar to the good


---------69:45----------
very important thing for everyone to


---------69:47----------
understand the mind prefers the familiar


---------69:50----------
to the good


---------69:54----------
prefers comfortable or known to the


---------69:58----------
unknown


---------70:01----------
and this is a life that you can continue


---------70:03----------
living like you can do this you could


---------70:04----------
beat yourself up you can suffer am I not


---------70:07----------
gonna die when I'm like 40 out of some


---------70:09----------
kind of stress or related disease then


---------70:11----------
let's go feels like where I'm heading


---------70:13----------
through right now yeah good I mean not


---------70:15----------
good that you're yeah I mean good that


---------70:17----------
you're noticing that this is not a way


---------70:19----------
to live your life good that you came on


---------70:21----------
today how do you feel about coming on


---------70:23----------
today I feel glad that I came on I'm


---------70:27----------
glad you're very understanding and I


---------70:29----------
felt like I needed to do something for


---------70:31----------
myself that was productive I had for


---------70:33----------
instance at I like had like a very I had


---------70:37----------
a couple bad streams in a row today


---------70:38----------
today I decided to cut it short because


---------70:40----------
I didn't want to enter that emotional


---------70:41----------
state of anger and sadness so I cut it


---------70:44----------
short but I promise to do something at


---------70:47----------
least to help out that night I'm glad I


---------70:49----------
did something at least I'm glad you did


---------70:51----------
too


---------70:51----------
you know why I'm glad you came on stream


---------70:54----------
or because you did something for


---------70:57----------
yourself you were nice to yourself


---------71:00----------
how did you treat yourself by coming on


---------71:01----------
stream


---------71:02----------
[Music]


---------71:04----------
I treated myself nicely worked on all


---------71:05----------
stream yep you also face your fear you


---------71:08----------
faced your uncertainty you were afraid


---------71:11----------
to come on weren't you yeah for sure


---------71:15----------
so this is like this is awesome because


---------71:17----------
you were afraid of something that


---------71:19----------
absolutely could happen which is that


---------71:20----------
you're trolls could attack you which is


---------71:22----------
the risk that anyone takes by coming on


---------71:24----------
stream is that they'll get attacked yeah


---------71:26----------
I wouldn't say that was yeah that was a


---------71:29----------
maybe there was a big fear but I I then


---------71:31----------
again I realized most people are


---------71:33----------
actually pretty nice online yeah it's


---------71:35----------
just a few people that are rotten apples


---------71:37----------
I guess but so I want you to just think


---------71:40----------
about this for a second Gork because


---------71:42----------
like you realized right but like you


---------71:45----------
realize like you knew that before but


---------71:48----------
you didn't realize it until like


---------71:49----------
recently mm-hmm that's what needs to


---------71:52----------
change because that fear of that 5% used


---------71:56----------
to keep you back it used to control your


---------71:59----------
behavior and already now by this


---------72:01----------
realisation this is important there's a


---------72:03----------
difference between knowing or like


---------72:04----------
information and realization realization


---------72:08----------
is how you break the cycle


---------72:11----------
that you knew this before but before you


---------72:14----------
were letting that knowledge control you


---------72:16----------
whereas now you realize that it's really


---------72:18----------
only 5% yeah


---------72:21----------
does that make sense yeah but that's


---------72:23----------
like my biggest issue I feel like I have


---------72:25----------
the knowledge about a lot of things I


---------72:27----------
need to do right but I don't know what


---------72:30----------
how I realize it you know how do I make


---------72:31----------
it a reality


---------72:32----------
so you do it the same how did you do it


---------72:35----------
today


---------72:37----------
by talking to you yeah that helped I


---------72:42----------
helped them stepping outside of my


---------72:44----------
comfort zone or didn't mean anything no


---------72:46----------
so I think all of the above is the short


---------72:49----------
answer right so I would say the


---------72:51----------
fundamental source so this is important


---------72:53----------
for everyone to understand so I think


---------72:54----------
there's actually great for Sunday stream


---------72:55----------
because this is all about meditation so


---------72:58----------
how do we change the person that we are


---------73:02----------
how do you change it's not information


---------73:05----------
you feel like you already know what you


---------73:06----------
need to do you're unable to do it so how


---------73:08----------
does one change how did you become this


---------73:10----------
way was it through information


---------73:13----------
action action and more importantly


---------73:17----------
experience it was experiences that maybe


---------73:20----------
way this way no and so what you've done


---------73:24----------
today absolutely is correct you acted


---------73:26----------
right and you acted to have an


---------73:28----------
experience outside of your normal realm


---------73:31----------
of experience and if you want to break


---------73:33----------
the cycle you can't keep on putting in


---------73:36----------
the same things like if I'm baking a


---------73:38----------
cake and I put the same [ __ ] in it every


---------73:40----------
time if I put like flour and sugar and


---------73:43----------
egg and milk and then I take a dump and


---------73:46----------
mix it all together and bake it it's


---------73:49----------
gonna taste like [ __ ] if you keep on


---------73:52----------
putting the same inputs you're gonna get


---------73:54----------
the same output so if you want to break


---------73:56----------
the cycle you can't think your way out


---------73:58----------
of it you have to experience your way


---------74:03----------
and so what did you do today like you


---------74:05----------
talked to me you came on stream and by


---------74:07----------
doing so you actually face your fears


---------74:10----------
right the whole reason you wanted to


---------74:12----------
talk in private was because you had very


---------74:14----------
legitimate concerns your concerns are no


---------74:16----------
less true they just hold less power over


---------74:19----------
you and right now the reason that your


---------74:23----------
life is so stuck is because there are


---------74:25----------
things that hold there are things within


---------74:27----------
you that hold power over you


---------74:30----------
so that you're cut off so so the the


---------74:32----------
reason that you're stuck is because


---------74:34----------
there are things within you that hold


---------74:36----------
power over you


---------74:38----------
the only book they hold power over you


---------74:42----------
oh yes yeah right you don't get to


---------74:44----------
control them they control you your anger


---------74:46----------
towards yourself your sense of


---------74:48----------
inadequacy those are the things that


---------74:49----------
dictate your life your inability to


---------74:52----------
relax what else is gonna dick and like


---------74:56----------
this maybe I don't know if you wanted to


---------74:57----------
cut it off here but sure and go if if


---------75:02----------
you release anger and release whatever


---------75:04----------
dictates yours you you to this point


---------75:06----------
while will drive you forward after that


---------75:08----------
that's the thing right so let me ask you


---------75:11----------
like what's behind that question it's


---------75:13----------
fear so fear is gonna drive me know no


---------75:16----------
fear isn't gonna drive you I think the


---------75:18----------
reason you're asking me that question is


---------75:19----------
because you're afraid yeah right the


---------75:23----------
reason you're out asking me because like


---------75:25----------
this is the only thing I've known what


---------75:27----------
happens like am I is my life gonna end


---------75:30----------
if I give up these things if I give up


---------75:32----------
my anger and I give up my shame and I


---------75:36----------
give up like the bad person that I am


---------75:38----------
like how can I move forward and they're


---------75:40----------
you absolutely can but I don't think


---------75:43----------
that I'm gonna answer your question but


---------75:45----------
just understand that this answer is not


---------75:46----------
gonna change you okay you have to


---------75:49----------
realize it I'm giving you information


---------75:51----------
mm-hmm right so in my case it's the


---------75:55----------
Dharma so Dharma means duty or


---------75:57----------
responsibility mm-hmm so the things that


---------76:01----------
drive me are not ego are not being


---------76:03----------
better than other people but for me it's


---------76:04----------
service in your case I think it can be


---------76:07----------
Dharma but I think you have a Dharma


---------76:09----------
also like so you have a duty or


---------76:11----------
responsibility to yourself to be the


---------76:13----------
best person that you can be


---------76:15----------
and being the best person you can be


---------76:17----------
still means you stream everyday that's


---------76:19----------
fine it's just the reason you're


---------76:21----------
streaming is different it's to be the


---------76:23----------
best dota player you can it's not to be


---------76:27----------
better than anyone else it's to be the


---------76:30----------
best there's a subtle but very important


---------76:34----------
distinction between those two because


---------76:36----------
you owe it to yourself to live the best


---------76:39----------
life that you can you owe it to yourself


---------76:43----------
to make lots of money and also spend a


---------76:46----------
fair amount of money you owe it to


---------76:48----------
yourself to build yourself financial


---------76:50----------
security but not to be a miser out of


---------76:53----------
fear because you saw what not having


---------76:55----------
money did to your mom you owe it to


---------76:58----------
yourself to be like free and have fun


---------77:01----------
and to meet people and to fall in love


---------77:05----------
you owe it to yourself to do all these


---------77:07----------
things to take care of yourself


---------77:09----------
physically to increase the ventilation


---------77:13----------
in your room to not die at the age of 40


---------77:16----------
yeah you owe all of these things to


---------77:19----------
yourself


---------77:21----------
by the way do i all these things myself


---------77:24----------
I mean why why do I have to feel it you


---------77:29----------
know I don't have to feel it you owe it


---------77:31----------
to yourself yeah okay but I don't think


---------77:35----------
that you're gonna understand why until


---------77:36----------
you have it mm-hmm but what I would tell


---------77:40----------
you is because generally speaking all we


---------77:44----------
owe to ourselves is to be what we are


---------77:46----------
right like what is a rock oh to itself


---------77:48----------
just to be itself what is the rain oh to


---------77:53----------
itself just to be itself that's all we


---------77:55----------
road is to be what we are but I I don't


---------77:59----------
think that you nor do I believe that


---------78:01----------
human beings their true essence is


---------78:04----------
self-hatred in feelings of inadequacy


---------78:08----------
yeah right and you understand that about


---------78:13----------
other people you understand that the


---------78:15----------
rest of the human race is entitled to


---------78:16----------
self forgiveness like that's obvious to


---------78:20----------
you mm-hmm but not you


---------78:25----------
so you have to live and it starts with


---------78:29----------
this is a very concrete thing is to it's


---------78:33----------
a good question by the way is is to the


---------78:35----------
next time you get angry is if you feel


---------78:38----------
yourself start to tilt or even before


---------78:39----------
you stream like do this practice right


---------78:41----------
as you begin to stream like before you


---------78:43----------
stream before you even like start like


---------78:45----------
stream labs or whatever used to stream


---------78:47----------
like you're gonna you're gonna have


---------78:50----------
these feelings arise like am I gonna do


---------78:51----------
a good enough job today like what if I


---------78:53----------
do a good enough job like and we're


---------78:54----------
gonna let people down like what's gonna


---------78:56----------
happen so notice all that dialogue


---------78:57----------
happen in your mind and then close your


---------79:00----------
eyes and feel what you feel in your body


---------79:02----------
those thoughts are gonna come with some


---------79:04----------
sensations warmth heat tension sweaty


---------79:08----------
palms and your body and your mind are


---------79:11----------
connected so even if your mind doesn't


---------79:13----------
know what the emotion is your body is


---------79:14----------
gonna feel it and so for men the biggest


---------79:19----------
way to overcome alexithymia the door to


---------79:21----------
understanding your emotions is your body


---------79:24----------
so your body will tell you the thing is


---------79:26----------
like when you say like like just think


---------79:27----------
about this for a second I was like what


---------79:29----------
are you what are you feeling Gork and


---------79:31----------
you're like I don't know I'm like


---------79:33----------
physically really hard yeah yeah so like


---------79:35----------
physically like you're like my palms are


---------79:37----------
sweaty like what emotion is associated


---------79:40----------
with sweaty palms fear yeah I guess


---------79:45----------
right fear maybe man because hundreds


---------79:50----------
unreal my room is super hot I'm an open


---------79:52----------
window now because yeah everything could


---------79:53----------
be clouded by the fact I open my window


---------79:56----------
air there we go yeah so so and this is


---------80:01----------
the thing is like you know sweaty palms


---------80:03----------
could be anything could be excitement it


---------80:04----------
could be lust yeah maybe you were


---------80:06----------
feeling horny like did you have an


---------80:07----------
erection like so like yeah but the point


---------80:16----------
is like as you as you experience this


---------80:18----------
you're gonna find something you're gonna


---------80:19----------
find something that you feel in your


---------80:20----------
body right yeah and and then and then


---------80:26----------
you I want you to breathe through it and


---------80:28----------
so you'll like dissolve that emotion a


---------80:30----------
little bit you'll start to understand


---------80:31----------
your emotions a little bit more you'll


---------80:34----------
start to be able to figure things out


---------80:35----------
about yourself


---------80:36----------
and then you'll start to be able to see


---------80:38----------
what's underneath the anger because once


---------80:40----------
you take the anger away the rest of that


---------80:41----------
stuff is gonna be there


---------80:43----------
yeah thoughts questions from chapter


---------80:49----------
from me you first then he first okay


---------80:53----------
well I agree with everything you said


---------80:57----------
the one thing I have a big problem with


---------81:00----------
I guess is finding the motivation to get


---------81:03----------
into action after having like a bad


---------81:06----------
cycle in my head you know yeah I had a


---------81:09----------
bat I've had a bad stream and it goes


---------81:11----------
into the next day and instead of doing


---------81:13----------
anything like I know I've done this


---------81:15----------
before like I've taken walks before


---------81:16----------
scream and I know my stream is gonna be


---------81:18----------
better but the only reason I don't take


---------81:20----------
a walk is because I'm like [ __ ] I don't


---------81:23----------
deserve oh I don't deserve a good stream


---------81:25----------
now or I hate myself so I'm gonna press


---------81:27----------
I'm gonna wake up and I sit down I'm


---------81:28----------
gonna press the shark swim button and do


---------81:30----------
the same thing all over again


---------81:31----------
so how do i how do I actually like it


---------81:35----------
sounds so simple but how do I push


---------81:37----------
myself to not do that and just do what's


---------81:40----------
actually good for me so the answer is


---------81:42----------
actually gonna be a little bit


---------81:43----------
paradoxical you need to stop pushing


---------81:45----------
yourself and you need to let yourself


---------81:48----------
because just think about this we push


---------81:51----------
ourselves when we don't like pushing


---------81:54----------
yourself is the same as like not it's


---------81:56----------
like whipping you're whipping yourself


---------81:58----------
the whole reason you're stuck is because


---------82:00----------
you've gotten everywhere through


---------82:01----------
whipping you need to learn a different


---------82:03----------
way besides whipping okay so like just


---------82:06----------
cut yourself a break


---------82:09----------
right say like hey like I really do not


---------82:11----------
feel like screaming today let me see if


---------82:13----------
I can find some way to do it so you go


---------82:16----------
for a walk you close your eyes you do


---------82:20----------
this practice feel what you feel in your


---------82:22----------
body and then notice that even as you do


---------82:25----------
the practice that part of your mind is


---------82:27----------
gonna start taking over that's gonna be


---------82:30----------
like oh you're [ __ ] doing it wrong


---------82:31----------
like why the [ __ ] do you even like why


---------82:32----------
are you even doing this it's stupid


---------82:34----------
you're stupid you're just sitting there


---------82:37----------
like you can sit there and breathe like


---------82:38----------
it's not gonna do anything just stop


---------82:39----------
don't do it notice that too because


---------82:42----------
those thoughts are gonna create a


---------82:44----------
sensation in your body and look really


---------82:47----------
hard look really deep find where that


---------82:50----------
breath go


---------82:50----------
in your body and that with each breath


---------82:54----------
something within you that's tight is


---------82:56----------
gonna be loosened up and then is going


---------82:59----------
to relax it's like you're stretching out


---------83:01----------
a rubber band like over and over and


---------83:04----------
over again and that rubber band is like


---------83:05----------
tight and it's like angry and it's like


---------83:07----------
I'm gonna be like stiff and you're


---------83:09----------
stretching it and then relaxing it


---------83:11----------
stretching it and then relaxing it and


---------83:13----------
then after a while it's gonna be like -


---------83:16----------
like loose and then it like won't won't


---------83:18----------
hold its tensile strength anymore


---------83:22----------
sanshiro you know let me see if we can


---------83:27----------
find a question let me see if these are


---------83:29----------
about me or you in cells gene site hook


---------83:47----------
all right okay so someone was asking you


---------83:52----------
how do we cope with alexithymia so I


---------83:54----------
think this is the main thing like so


---------83:55----------
this is what I was explaining to Gork is


---------83:57----------
that the way to get through alexithymia


---------83:59----------
is by working through your body right so


---------84:02----------
like when you're in a situation that you


---------84:04----------
don't feel good and you don't understand


---------84:06----------
what you feel focus on your body and


---------84:09----------
that as you do things as you understand


---------84:12----------
your body you can do this breathing


---------84:13----------
practice where you follow the breath to


---------84:15----------
the parts of the body where you feel


---------84:17----------
like some kind of negativity and then


---------84:20----------
like let that breath out because like


---------84:23----------
Gork was kind of saying that the breath


---------84:24----------
was hot coming in and it was hot going


---------84:26----------
out but it was like a better hot going


---------84:28----------
out than it was a hot going in right no


---------84:31----------
it's kind of like weird to say - like


---------84:33----------
when I said just if you guys just walk


---------84:34----------
if you clip this it doesn't make any


---------84:36----------
[ __ ] sense but if you did the


---------84:37----------
practice you know what I'm talking about


---------84:39----------
so that's like experience right like


---------84:41----------
information I can tell you okay so you


---------84:44----------
should do this practice of Gork and it's


---------84:45----------
gonna be hot going in it's gonna be hot


---------84:47----------
going out but when it's hot and going


---------84:48----------
out it's gonna feel better and you're


---------84:50----------
not gonna understand what the [ __ ] that


---------84:51----------
means like I could tell you that but


---------84:53----------
it's not gonna change anything about


---------84:54----------
your life it's the experience that


---------84:56----------
changes things


---------84:58----------
so start with your body and then second


---------85:02----------
thing is breathe into it and follow the


---------85:06----------
breath where it goes and over time we'll


---------85:08----------
will explore a little bit more about


---------85:10----------
what that means but work let me ask you


---------85:12----------
something


---------85:12----------
where does your breath go in your body


---------85:14----------
like physically do you know well


---------85:18----------
I consciously try to get it into my


---------85:20----------
stomach at least I know breathing into


---------85:23----------
the chest is not so great


---------85:24----------
yeah so and when you feel something like


---------85:27----------
does the breath go into your stomach


---------85:28----------
this oxygen go into your stomach I hope


---------85:32----------
so


---------85:33----------
doesn't yes right so oxygen goes into


---------85:36----------
your lungs oh yes yes of course yeah


---------85:38----------
where where do the lungs end do you know


---------85:40----------
uh well somewhere on the stomach I guess


---------85:45----------
yeah like the top of the abdomen right


---------85:47----------
so they end it like somewhere around


---------85:48----------
here in the front and in the back they


---------85:50----------
don't go down pretty far so then what do


---------85:52----------
you do do you have any oxygen in your


---------85:54----------
shoulders no you have a nice zoom in


---------85:58----------
your stomach no so then what are you


---------86:01----------
feeling when you breathe in I mean you


---------86:03----------
feel something there I you know I guess


---------86:08----------
me expanding my stomach for no reason


---------86:09----------
unless you can follow the breath there


---------86:11----------
right like you feel the warmth of the


---------86:13----------
breath go into your nose and into your


---------86:15----------
throat down your chest and into your


---------86:17----------
stomach you feel the warmth in your


---------86:18----------
stomach yeah it's kind of weird so the


---------86:23----------
Yogi's called that branagh or Chi yeah


---------86:26----------
so they said that there's this life


---------86:28----------
force that that flows throughout our


---------86:31----------
body and at the simplest way that I can


---------86:35----------
give people a perception of Chi is


---------86:36----------
through this practice because you don't


---------86:38----------
have any breath in your shoulders like


---------86:39----------
doesn't make any sense but chi or prana


---------86:44----------
is not not like physically correlated


---------86:46----------
it's like not a real thing but it's a


---------86:47----------
sensation it's something that you can


---------86:50----------
feel can you feel the blood oxygen


---------86:54----------
coming into the blood do you think or is


---------86:56----------
it related no okay


---------86:58----------
I mean not that I know of I haven't


---------86:59----------
heard anything I mean you do have


---------87:02----------
receptors that detect the oxygenation of


---------87:05----------
your blood but I don't think that


---------87:06----------
they're certainly not in your shoulders


---------87:08----------
and I don't think that there's any


---------87:09----------
direct perception of that like


---------87:11----------
what we feel from that is like a sense


---------87:13----------
that we need to breathe more or breathe


---------87:15----------
less know but they sure as hell there's


---------87:18----------
no there's no oxygen in our shoulders or


---------87:20----------
our stomach so I don't know what you


---------87:21----------
feel I don't know from a nerves


---------87:23----------
standpoint like what we're detecting but


---------87:29----------
anyway so


---------87:29----------
Gork last thoughts or questions before


---------87:33----------
we wrap up for the day no no no thanks


---------87:35----------

---------87:37----------

---------89:11----------
does that mean I don't want to come help

---------89:18----------
funny


---------89:19----------
is that like okay so it's some of you


---------89:23----------
[ __ ] need to go and you need to help


---------89:25----------
Gork so you need to notice when he's


---------89:26----------
tilting and remind him oh boy that's not


---------89:30----------
gonna help


---------89:33----------
no people already remind me all the time


---------89:35----------
I don't worry about it


---------89:36----------
no no but they need to remind you in a


---------89:38----------
good way is that a bad idea if it's a


---------89:40----------
bad idea I'll tell them not to do it a


---------89:41----------
man if they just come come in and type


---------89:43----------
of pogchamp that's alright you know okay


---------89:46----------
reminder tape or do their breathing


---------89:50----------
practice would that tilt you more


---------89:52----------
maybe it might X should tilt me more but


---------89:56----------
it's helpful to have a reminder yeah


---------89:58----------
yeah so notice that - right so like in


---------90:01----------
that moment is they is they're saying


---------90:03----------
something the part of you that feels


---------90:06----------
inadequate and angry is gonna try to


---------90:08----------
take their messages of love and support


---------90:09----------
and make you feel more inadequate


---------90:12----------
because these [ __ ] in twitch at have


---------90:14----------
to tell you to do it you can't even


---------90:15----------
[ __ ] do it yourself yeah exactly


---------90:17----------
that's what that's what happens in your


---------90:19----------
mind right and notice that be aware that


---------90:22----------
that's gonna happen and that's not what


---------90:23----------
they intend I can tell you right now


---------90:25----------
exactly what's gonna happen in your mind


---------90:26----------
you can be like [ __ ] I can't even do


---------90:28----------
this [ __ ] on my own I'm gonna just turn

off stream and I'm [ __ ] shitty no just


---------90:31----------
just just breathe take a second sit up


---------90:36----------
straight

back needs to be straight feel that


---------90:39----------
feeling and then breathe into it


---------90:41----------
yeah okay right yeah the the the thing


---------90:47----------
is I I think it's great it's just so


---------90:50----------
hard when you're in this state and the


---------90:52----------
only thing I do is cue next game and I'm


---------90:54----------
like reiterating what went wrong the


---------90:55----------
last game but it would be great - I


---------90:57----------
think if I could find the mental


---------90:59----------
strength in between games like sit down


---------91:01----------
and breathe for like a minute yeah


---------91:03----------
twitch app do we need your help with


---------91:06----------
this right because I can't I can't be


---------91:09----------

---------91:12----------

---------91:14----------
Gork you got to tell me if this is not


---------91:15----------
working and then I'll tell them to stop


---------91:17----------

---------91:19----------
just try and then like twitch chat also


---------91:22----------

---------91:24----------
