---------00:00----------
because some of them will just i mean


---------00:01----------
you guys will hopefully realize this too


---------00:03----------
that you just don't have to live like


---------00:04----------
this it's like


---------00:06----------
you know like you can fix this like you


---------00:08----------
can feel


---------00:09----------
better on a day-to-day basis like the


---------00:11----------
sun can be a little bit brighter you can


---------00:13----------
be a little bit happier


---------00:14----------
you can just enjoy things more


---------00:23----------
so about one year ago we had a pretty


---------00:27----------
significant suicide in the gaming


---------00:28----------
community and i think we've had


---------00:30----------
over the last year um we've had


---------00:34----------
a lot of suicides in our community i


---------00:36----------
think some of them are not quite as


---------00:37----------
advertised as others


---------00:39----------
and so i thought what we would do today


---------00:42----------
is try to just do like a quick


---------00:44----------
um sort of like educational segment to


---------00:46----------
help us understand


---------00:47----------
suicide so today what i'd like to talk


---------00:49----------
to you guys about is just sort of like a


---------00:51----------
quick


---------00:51----------
almost like lecture about you know who


---------00:54----------
commits suicide


---------00:55----------
why people commit suicide how like


---------00:58----------
what's the process or what we


---------01:00----------
what do we understand about the how of


---------01:01----------
suicide and what you can do


---------01:03----------
either for yourself or for someone else


---------01:06----------
so we're just going to answer these four


---------01:08----------
basic questions and the reason that i


---------01:10----------
think that this


---------01:11----------
this kind of lecture is important is if


---------01:13----------
you look at medicine


---------01:15----------
um it's advancing and we're winning as a


---------01:18----------
profession


---------01:19----------
so if you look at for example like hiv


---------01:21----------
so hiv used to be a terminal


---------01:23----------
illness and now people with hiv have a


---------01:25----------
regular life expectancy


---------01:27----------
we've all but eliminated some kinds of


---------01:30----------
cancer


---------01:31----------
um at least in terms of people who get


---------01:33----------
the appropriate treatment so for example


---------01:35----------
there are certain kinds of like b-cell


---------01:37----------
lymphomas if i'm remembering correctly


---------01:38----------
that we now have targeted antibodies


---------01:40----------
that we have really good


---------01:41----------
outcomes for we also have for example


---------01:44----------
like hpv vaccines which have done a huge


---------01:47----------
job at sort of reducing or almost


---------01:49----------
eliminating cervical cancer at least in


---------01:51----------
countries that have access to the


---------01:53----------
vaccine so we're


---------01:54----------
like we're doing good like i don't know


---------01:55----------
if you guys get this but like modern


---------01:57----------
medicine is pretty dope like do you guys


---------01:58----------
understand that


---------01:59----------
if my heart is busted i can like


---------02:03----------
literally get a heart from someone else


---------02:05----------
and we can transplant into my body and


---------02:07----------
then i can continue to live a relatively


---------02:09----------
normal life


---------02:10----------
if my kidneys are busted i can literally


---------02:13----------
like


---------02:14----------
transplant someone else's kidney into my


---------02:17----------
kidney


---------02:18----------
i mean into my body and then like i can


---------02:20----------
live off of that kidney


---------02:22----------
so like medical science has advanced in


---------02:25----------
an amazing rate and it is like really


---------02:27----------
awesome so we're seeing


---------02:28----------
generally speaking improved outcomes


---------02:31----------
in most disciplines or just about every


---------02:33----------
discipline of medicine


---------02:35----------
the one place where we don't seem to be


---------02:37----------
doing a good job and in fact arguably


---------02:40----------
things are getting worse


---------02:41----------
is in the mental health realm so we are


---------02:44----------
sort of losing the war


---------02:46----------
against mental illness and so if we look


---------02:48----------
at suicide for example like suicides


---------02:50----------
have not


---------02:51----------
appreciably gone down in fact if i


---------02:52----------
remember correctly they've sort of gone


---------02:54----------
up over time


---------02:56----------
um it's also kind of staggering because


---------02:59----------
uh you know if you look at statistics on


---------03:01----------
suicide like 80


---------03:03----------
of suicides are men if i'm remembering


---------03:05----------
correctly i think that's kind of a


---------03:06----------
ballpark figure


---------03:08----------
depending on what source you kind of go


---------03:09----------
to it'll


---------03:11----------
you know that the numbers may look a


---------03:13----------
little bit different depending on


---------03:14----------
whether you're looking at the world


---------03:15----------
or a particular country developed


---------03:17----------
countries versus developing countries


---------03:19----------
have slightly different um statistics


---------03:22----------
around that


---------03:24----------
and and so we're we're losing this war


---------03:26----------
and so like


---------03:27----------
i don't really know that just given the


---------03:31----------
nature of the human mind i don't know


---------03:33----------
that we're gonna have like a


---------03:35----------
pharmaceutical


---------03:36----------
revelation like we're not gonna have


---------03:38----------
some kind of pharmaceutical discovery i


---------03:39----------
mean if we do that would be great


---------03:41----------
that you're gonna take a pill and it


---------03:43----------
will


---------03:44----------
cure you of your suicidality like we


---------03:46----------
certainly have medications that


---------03:48----------
improve outcomes for people with


---------03:50----------
depression who you know may be somewhat


---------03:52----------
protective against suicidality


---------03:54----------
so we'll talk a little bit about that


---------03:55----------
but as we'll see today the reasons that


---------03:57----------
people kill themselves may not all be


---------03:59----------
solved


---------04:00----------
by medication so the reason that i'd


---------04:02----------
like to talk to you guys about suicide


---------04:03----------
today is because i think that like the


---------04:05----------
first step in


---------04:06----------
in fighting this war is actually like


---------04:09----------
education right so like kind of like sun


---------04:11----------
tzu says


---------04:13----------
you know you have to know your enemy in


---------04:14----------
order to win and so my hope today is to


---------04:16----------
educate


---------04:17----------
our community and whoever's listening


---------04:19----------
whoever watches this down the road


---------04:21----------
to help you understand a little bit


---------04:22----------
about like okay who


---------04:24----------
kills themselves why do they kill


---------04:26----------
themselves how do they kill themselves


---------04:27----------
and what can we do about it


---------04:29----------
whether you are dealing with suicidal


---------04:30----------
thoughts or you're not dealing with


---------04:31----------
suicide or a friend is dealing with


---------04:33----------
suicidal thoughts


---------04:34----------
furthermore we're going to tackle a


---------04:36----------
couple of different myths around


---------04:37----------
suicidality


---------04:39----------
and some of these i think are quite


---------04:40----------
dangerous so it's really more of like a


---------04:42----------
public health educational approach


---------04:44----------
and i will urge you for the first but


---------04:46----------
not the last time that if you're dealing


---------04:48----------
with suicidal thoughts


---------04:49----------
you should really go see a licensed


---------04:51----------
professional and get help


---------04:54----------
and we'll deal with some of the reasons


---------04:55----------
why people don't and why it's a bad idea


---------04:57----------
to listen to the part of your mind that


---------04:59----------
says


---------05:00----------
basically i haven't killed myself yet so


---------05:03----------
i can manage it


---------05:04----------
which we'll we'll look at some


---------05:06----------
interesting data around that


---------05:07----------
so the first question is who kills


---------05:09----------
themselves so what we what we can sort


---------05:11----------
of discover like i sort of mentioned if


---------05:13----------
you actually look at suicidal attempts


---------05:15----------
what you discover is that more women


---------05:18----------
arguably


---------05:20----------
attempt suicide than men


---------05:24----------
but it turns out that when we kind of


---------05:25----------
when we're sort of looking at it


---------05:27----------
attempts what we sort of discover is


---------05:29----------
that not all suicide


---------05:31----------
looking behavior is actually like


---------05:34----------
intended to be suicidal


---------05:35----------
so sometimes for example like i've had


---------05:37----------
patients that will


---------05:39----------
take a bunch of pills and then will


---------05:41----------
proceed to call me


---------05:43----------
or they will call a friend and they'll


---------05:44----------
say hey i just took a bunch of pills


---------05:46----------
so it's sort of a suicide attempt but


---------05:48----------
there's sort of like this kind of


---------05:50----------
idea that like sometimes it's people are


---------05:52----------
looking you know to say goodbye but


---------05:54----------
sometimes they're actually like


---------05:55----------
it's a little bit more provocative and


---------05:57----------
it's sort of almost like a cry for help


---------05:59----------
you're sort of demonstrating to people


---------06:01----------
that um you really need help and you're


---------06:03----------
willing to go to drastic measures but at


---------06:05----------
the same time you're not like


---------06:06----------
you're not using your full faculty


---------06:10----------
of thinking to actually commit suicide


---------06:13----------
and so what we sort of discover is that


---------06:15----------
when you really tunnel down into the


---------06:16----------
research there are a lot of parasuicidal


---------06:18----------
behaviors


---------06:20----------
so things like cutting or self-injurious


---------06:22----------
behavior


---------06:23----------
or like threats for suicide attempts


---------06:26----------
that it seems like statistically


---------06:30----------
we're not entirely sure about you know


---------06:32----------
what's happening where but


---------06:34----------
women seem to make more suicide attempts


---------06:36----------
and men


---------06:37----------
seem to actually kill themselves uh more


---------06:40----------
often


---------06:41----------
and so the about four out of five


---------06:43----------
suicides are men so sometimes


---------06:45----------
as we look at the research what we sort


---------06:46----------
of like look at so one hypothesis is


---------06:49----------
that the manner of suicide sort of


---------06:51----------
determines


---------06:52----------
is responsible for that statistic so for


---------06:55----------
example women are more likely to


---------06:56----------
try to commit suicide by taking pills


---------06:59----------
and men are more likely to commit


---------07:00----------
suicide by using a firearm


---------07:02----------
and if we just sort of think about that


---------07:04----------
from a medical standpoint if someone


---------07:05----------
tries to commit them


---------07:06----------
commit suicide via pills the window to


---------07:09----------
save that person is far


---------07:10----------
larger than someone who you know uses a


---------07:12----------
gun because like


---------07:15----------
you know it's just gg depending so some


---------07:18----------
people have argued that because of the


---------07:19----------
variance in attempts


---------07:21----------
uh that's what sort of alters the


---------07:23----------
statistic in my experience i think it's


---------07:25----------
a little bit more complicated than that


---------07:27----------
and i think that um as we get to the


---------07:29----------
reasons of why


---------07:30----------
people commit suicide i suspect that


---------07:33----------
at least in my clinical experience and i


---------07:36----------
also suspect that epidemiologically that


---------07:39----------
men uh there are more men who are more


---------07:42----------
serious about taking their life


---------07:44----------
than women on average it doesn't mean


---------07:46----------
that women aren't serious about taking


---------07:47----------
their life i'm just saying that


---------07:49----------
that there seems to be something


---------07:51----------
different there which i think is sort of


---------07:52----------
borne out in the statistics


---------07:54----------
could it have to do with just the manner


---------07:56----------
and psychologically both genders are


---------07:58----------
exactly the same it's completely


---------07:59----------
possible


---------08:00----------
in fact there's good evidence for that


---------08:01----------
theory my experience as a clinician and


---------08:03----------
we'll get to the kind of the how


---------08:05----------
or sorry the why and we'll sort of see


---------08:07----------
that suicidality also is not necessarily


---------08:09----------
due to psychopathology which i know


---------08:11----------
sounds weird but it's not all


---------08:12----------
suicidality is due to mental illness


---------08:14----------
so let's talk a little bit more about


---------08:16----------
who commits suicide so


---------08:18----------
um you know men tend to be more of four


---------08:20----------
out of five


---------08:21----------
are men i think we're seeing a rise in


---------08:23----------
suicidality like


---------08:25----------
in younger populations as well just as


---------08:28----------
other kind of interesting examples one


---------08:30----------
is that there's a black box warning


---------08:32----------
on antidepressant medications called


---------08:35----------
serotonin selective serotonin reuptake


---------08:37----------
inhibitors


---------08:38----------
that for the few weeks after you start


---------08:40----------
taking an ssri


---------08:42----------
adolescents especially are more likely


---------08:45----------
to commit suicide


---------08:46----------
there's something really interesting


---------08:48----------
there that like if you kind of think


---------08:49----------
about you know the mind of someone who


---------08:51----------
may be suicidal you may have thoughts


---------08:53----------
but if you're severely depressed


---------08:56----------
your low energy level and your like lack


---------08:59----------
of motivation


---------09:00----------
combined with the suicidal thoughts is


---------09:02----------
almost like a protective mechanism


---------09:04----------
that you may want to kill yourself but


---------09:06----------
you have such low energy or your


---------09:08----------
motivation is so low


---------09:09----------
that you never actually like get up off


---------09:11----------
your ass and and make an attempt


---------09:13----------
so there's a really interesting


---------09:15----------
phenomenon that's been observed when you


---------09:16----------
actually treat someone with depression


---------09:18----------
with


---------09:19----------
or treat adolescents with depression


---------09:20----------
with medication


---------09:22----------
is that there's actually a temporary


---------09:24----------
spike in


---------09:26----------
suicidal behavior which suggests that


---------09:28----------
and the best


---------09:29----------
kind of theory that i've heard is that


---------09:31----------
this the spike actually happens because


---------09:33----------
you're sort of dealing with that


---------09:34----------
motivation first


---------09:36----------
so people actually get a little bit more


---------09:37----------
energy but the suicidal thoughts take


---------09:39----------
longer to treat


---------09:40----------
and so if if you really have to be


---------09:42----------
careful if you're a prescriber and


---------09:44----------
you're prescribing antidepressants to


---------09:45----------
someone in adolescence to really watch


---------09:47----------
them carefully for like two weeks


---------09:48----------
and then it seems like the effect kind


---------09:49----------
of goes away in terms of like then it


---------09:51----------
really starts treating the suicidal


---------09:53----------
thoughts and depression as well


---------09:54----------
but it's a really interesting thing for


---------09:56----------
you guys to be aware of that if you're


---------09:57----------
starting antidepressant medication


---------09:59----------
so here's kind of like the first kind of


---------10:01----------
like psa um


---------10:03----------
is be a little bit careful because there


---------10:05----------
may be something weird going on in the


---------10:06----------
suicidal thoughts i don't know if they


---------10:08----------
become stronger


---------10:09----------
or you may actually feel like a little


---------10:11----------
bit more motivated to act on them which


---------10:12----------
is kind of weird


---------10:14----------
right so it seems like younger people


---------10:17----------
tend to be


---------10:18----------
committing suicide more often so it


---------10:20----------
seems to be getting slightly worse


---------10:23----------
and it seems to be men more than women


---------10:25----------
so when we look at something like the


---------10:27----------
gamer community we don't really have


---------10:30----------
a good idea about you know who


---------10:33----------
like what the suicide rate is


---------10:35----------
specifically in our community at least i


---------10:36----------
haven't seen


---------10:37----------
any convincing research in that we don't


---------10:40----------
really know but hopefully over time


---------10:42----------
we'll learn more about that and we'll


---------10:44----------
figure out how to intervene a little bit


---------10:46----------
better so now what i'd like to do is


---------10:48----------
actually screen share for a minute


---------10:50----------
and we have an awesome one of our


---------10:53----------
coaches


---------10:54----------
is actually a suicide researcher and so


---------10:57----------
he's done awesome work as a coach


---------10:58----------
and kind of does research on the side so


---------11:00----------
he put together an awesome presentation


---------11:03----------
to educate our coaches and what i'd love


---------11:05----------
to do is


---------11:06----------
um you know he goes by james


---------11:09----------
so um james has done an awesome job of


---------11:11----------
putting this together this presentation


---------11:13----------
and so what i'd love to do is share like


---------11:15----------
one or two slides from the presentation


---------11:16----------
with y'all


---------11:17----------
okay so let's kind of start with this


---------11:20----------
so suicide is the 10th leading cause of


---------11:22----------
death in the united states with about 50


---------11:24----------
000 people dying by suicide i think this


---------11:26----------
number has actually gone up a little bit


---------11:27----------
since the presentation was made


---------11:29----------
um this is the key thing so our pop you


---------11:32----------
know


---------11:32----------
when we talk about like who the audience


---------11:34----------
is of people who uh who


---------11:36----------
watch stream and who healthy gamer


---------11:38----------
reaches we tend to reach people who are


---------11:40----------
like


---------11:41----------
you know hopefully like 13 to 40 for the


---------11:44----------
most part but a lot of parents watch our


---------11:45----------
stream now too


---------11:46----------
so when we think about you know what is


---------11:48----------
the most likely thing that will kill you


---------11:50----------
i think it is probably accidents is


---------11:52----------
number one the leading cause of death


---------11:55----------
and number two is suicide and so


---------11:58----------
um if we kind of look at like


---------12:01----------
this is an important graphic so trends


---------12:03----------
in the leading cause of death


---------12:04----------
over time in the usa so this is usa


---------12:07----------
specific


---------12:08----------
what we kind of see is like i was saying


---------12:09----------
earlier like we're we're winning the war


---------12:12----------
against like stroke heart disease cancer


---------12:15----------
but suicide i don't know if this is


---------12:17----------
actually this isn't interesting


---------12:19----------
i'd have to double check this this


---------12:20----------
particular statistic whether this is a


---------12:22----------
33


---------12:23----------
increase because the causes of death of


---------12:25----------
other things are


---------12:27----------
getting better so the percentage


---------12:28----------
increase is higher but generally


---------12:29----------
speaking i think


---------12:30----------
suicide has been increasing over time


---------12:33----------
which i feel pretty confident to say


---------12:34----------
the next thing that we're going to kind


---------12:36----------
of talk about so that's sort of like who


---------12:37----------
commits suicide so


---------12:38----------
you know we need to be really careful


---------12:40----------
about that in this community


---------12:42----------
the next thing that i want to talk about


---------12:44----------
is why people commit suicide


---------12:46----------
so this is going to sound kind of weird


---------12:49----------
but there are many reasons why people


---------12:51----------
commit suicide that may not necessarily


---------12:53----------
have to do with psychopathology okay


---------12:56----------
so um there's a great paper by


---------12:59----------
a guy named malzberger so malzberger is


---------13:02----------
a


---------13:02----------
is like a great suicide researcher and


---------13:05----------
so if you actually sit down and you talk


---------13:07----------
to people who


---------13:08----------
are um have tried to commit suicide or


---------13:11----------
thinking about suicide and i've sort of


---------13:13----------
definitely noticed this as a clinician


---------13:15----------
what you're what i was really shocked to


---------13:17----------
discover is that


---------13:19----------
the reasons are not necessarily mental


---------13:21----------
illness so we sort of think about mental


---------13:23----------
illness as the number one cause of


---------13:25----------
suicide and i think that that's probably


---------13:26----------
reasonable


---------13:28----------
and yet i know it sounds kind of weird


---------13:30----------
but like


---------13:31----------
psychopathology isn't necessarily the


---------13:33----------
only cause of suicide


---------13:34----------
and what i mean by that is that if you


---------13:36----------
actually talk to people what you'll find


---------13:38----------
is there are all kinds of


---------13:40----------
reasons um and some of them have to do


---------13:42----------
with like


---------13:43----------
you know self-worth which is that like


---------13:45----------
an organic brain disease i'm not really


---------13:47----------
sure


---------13:48----------
sometimes suicide has to do with like


---------13:50----------
not having


---------13:51----------
a way out for lack of a better term


---------13:54----------
and so suicide sort of serves as an


---------13:57----------
escape


---------13:58----------
and so i think we have to be really


---------13:59----------
careful about sort of


---------14:01----------
assuming any suicidal behavior is the


---------14:04----------
has a root cause of mental illness


---------14:06----------
because if we misdiagnose that


---------14:09----------
if we assume that everything is mental


---------14:10----------
illness what i think we


---------14:12----------
end up doing is like we're gonna leave


---------14:15----------
out


---------14:16----------
and we're gonna lose sight of a lot of


---------14:18----------
important reasons why people kill


---------14:19----------
themselves


---------14:20----------
so as a clinician what i'd like to do is


---------14:22----------
kind of start with this idea okay so the


---------14:24----------
first thing to understand is that


---------14:26----------
suicidality


---------14:28----------
is not an illness it's actually a


---------14:31----------
symptom


---------14:32----------
okay and so what what do i mean by that


---------14:34----------
so if we think about like


---------14:36----------
fever for example like fever is not an


---------14:39----------
illness


---------14:40----------
it's actually a symptom that can have


---------14:42----------
all kinds of different root causes


---------14:44----------
so if i have a fever maybe i have a


---------14:46----------
lymphoma


---------14:47----------
maybe i have a cold maybe i have covid


---------14:51----------
maybe i have lupus there are many


---------14:54----------
different diseases that lead to fever


---------14:56----------
and so in that way if i have suicidal


---------14:58----------
thoughts


---------14:59----------
there are actually many different


---------15:01----------
reasons why i may feel suicidal


---------15:04----------
so for example one reason is


---------15:06----------
psychopathology


---------15:08----------
so what we mean by this is we know that


---------15:09----------
there are some kinds of mental illnesses


---------15:11----------
right so we know that there are things


---------15:13----------
like


---------15:14----------
depression or actually this is


---------15:17----------
incorrect major depressive disorder is


---------15:19----------
is better


---------15:21----------
right so there's like major depressive


---------15:23----------
disorder bipolar disorder


---------15:25----------
we also know that you have like things


---------15:27----------
like addictions


---------15:29----------
sometimes you'll have things like


---------15:31----------
schizophrenia right


---------15:32----------
and these are like arguably biological


---------15:36----------
organic malfunctions in your brain


---------15:40----------
that lead to a malfunction in your brain


---------15:43----------
that sort of allows you to create


---------15:46----------
suicidal thoughts and potentially act on


---------15:48----------
suicidal thoughts


---------15:50----------
but if you kind of uh another really


---------15:52----------
interesting thing and i don't know that


---------15:54----------
this mechanism is the same


---------15:56----------
so um so like this is what malzberger


---------16:00----------
cause


---------16:00----------
calls loss of the ideal self-state


---------16:04----------
or broken life dream


---------16:09----------
so some people will have like let's say


---------16:13----------
like


---------16:13----------
aspirations right so they say like i


---------16:15----------
want to be this or i want to be this


---------16:17----------
and something will happen in their life


---------16:20----------
where they feel like their


---------16:21----------
life has become broken and irreparable


---------16:25----------
and if you really talk to them so a lot


---------16:26----------
of people will assume


---------16:28----------
that this thing from a mechanism


---------16:31----------
standpoint


---------16:32----------
is the same as major depressive disorder


---------16:34----------
but as a clinician what i oftentimes


---------16:36----------
find is people who have major depressive


---------16:38----------
disorder will become depressed


---------16:40----------
even when nothing is wrong so especially


---------16:42----------
when i've worked with people who are


---------16:44----------
like uh


---------16:45----------
suicidal sometimes i don't actually like


---------16:48----------
do they qualify as depressed absolutely


---------16:50----------
but sometimes they don't really respond


---------16:52----------
to medications and what it really is is


---------16:54----------
like


---------16:55----------
their perception of life has become so


---------16:58----------
shattered


---------16:59----------
that they don't believe it is worth


---------17:00----------
living now the this further gets


---------17:02----------
complicated that sometimes


---------17:04----------
this can actually trigger a major


---------17:06----------
depressive episode


---------17:08----------
but it's not that the major depressive


---------17:10----------
episode is like shattering your


---------17:12----------
i mean it can actually go both ways but


---------17:15----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but in my


---------17:16----------
experience sometimes as someone like so


---------17:18----------
for example


---------17:19----------
um you know i was working with a


---------17:21----------
particular person


---------17:22----------
who was accused of um sexual


---------17:26----------
harassment and was essentially like


---------17:29----------
fired from their law firm or put on


---------17:31----------
suspension


---------17:32----------
and they were it was sort of a situation


---------17:35----------
where it was kind of like guilty until


---------17:36----------
proven innocent they were sort of


---------17:38----------
ostracized


---------17:39----------
it turned out that um you know they


---------17:41----------
didn't actually do anything


---------17:42----------
inappropriate


---------17:43----------
but their life was sort of shattered


---------17:45----------
like they lost their job like


---------17:47----------
they had lost the respect of their


---------17:48----------
colleagues and so like this person's


---------17:50----------
life had fallen apart i don't know that


---------17:52----------
this was actually the result


---------17:54----------
of an organic brain disease i don't know


---------17:57----------
that it was


---------17:58----------
the cause was like a neurochemical


---------18:00----------
imbalance


---------18:01----------
but it really feels to me more like a


---------18:02----------
broken life dream


---------18:05----------
there are other kinds of weird


---------18:07----------
psychoanalytic sort of stuff


---------18:09----------
but other other causes of suicidality


---------18:12----------
are going to be


---------18:13----------
sudden defense breakdown so what do we


---------18:15----------
mean by this


---------18:17----------
so sometimes we have something called


---------18:19----------
chronic suicidality


---------18:20----------
and what that means is like i have um


---------18:23----------
you know i think about killing myself


---------18:26----------
and even though i think about killing


---------18:28----------
myself there are a lot of things like a


---------18:29----------
lot of people so suicidal thoughts are


---------18:31----------
remarkably common i think something


---------18:32----------
between like 10 and 30 percent of the


---------18:34----------
population


---------18:35----------
has suicidal thoughts or has had


---------18:37----------
suicidal thoughts at some point


---------18:40----------
and so if we kind of think about it


---------18:41----------
suicidality is actually like a balance


---------18:44----------
between


---------18:45----------
pro-suicidal factors and


---------18:48----------
anti-suicidal factors and we'll get to


---------18:50----------
that in a second in terms of how we deal


---------18:52----------
with suicidality


---------18:53----------
but sometimes what can happen is that


---------18:55----------
like you know you've got this balance


---------18:56----------
between like reasons that you don't want


---------18:58----------
to live and reasons that you do want to


---------18:59----------
live


---------19:00----------
and sometimes that defense mechanism


---------19:03----------
one of the things that you kind of use


---------19:05----------
to hold the suicidality at bay


---------19:08----------
kind of falls apart so like a good


---------19:10----------
example of this that i'll sort of use is


---------19:12----------
like alcohol usage


---------19:14----------
so you know in your normal mind


---------19:17----------
you can kind of keep the suicidality at


---------19:19----------
bay


---------19:20----------
but in some situations if you like alter


---------19:23----------
you know your state of consciousness


---------19:25----------
through alcohol


---------19:26----------
or some other disinhibiting substance


---------19:28----------
the suicidality can kind of break


---------19:30----------
through


---------19:31----------
and then you can sort of result you know


---------19:33----------
can it can end in an attempt


---------19:35----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird it's


---------19:36----------
not necessarily like you know you can


---------19:37----------
say that addiction is like an organic


---------19:39----------
disease


---------19:40----------
but alcohol in a temporary sense this


---------19:42----------
isn't an addiction this is just like


---------19:43----------
i can be not addicted to alcohol use


---------19:46----------
some mind-altering substance


---------19:47----------
and then it causes something in my


---------19:49----------
psychology that


---------19:51----------
keeps the suicide at bay from like fall


---------19:54----------
it kind of breaks down my defense


---------19:56----------
mechanism and i end up acting


---------19:58----------
so and i know it sounds kind of weird


---------19:59----------
but like just you don't have to have


---------20:01----------
major depressive disorder to have


---------20:02----------
suicidal thoughts


---------20:03----------
so the next thing to kind of think about


---------20:05----------
in terms of why people commit suicide is


---------20:08----------
anger turned against the self so if we


---------20:11----------
think about why people commit suicide


---------20:13----------
some people


---------20:14----------
find their life to be like intolerable


---------20:16----------
right like


---------20:17----------
this life is not worth living anymore


---------20:19----------
and sometimes if you go back to freud's


---------20:22----------
earliest theories


---------20:23----------
on depression i believe it was freud


---------20:25----------
although i may be misquoting here


---------20:27----------
um who basically said that he he sort of


---------20:30----------
discovered that depression


---------20:32----------
is anger turned against the self so like


---------20:34----------
instead of being angry at the outside


---------20:36----------
world like if you look at the mind of a


---------20:38----------
depressed person they're actually like


---------20:39----------
angry towards themselves so if i get


---------20:42----------
fired from my job


---------20:43----------
instead of blaming my boss for being


---------20:45----------
incompetent or feeling threatened by my


---------20:48----------
competence


---------20:48----------
which may actually be the reason that i


---------20:50----------
got fired i what i'll end up doing is


---------20:52----------
blaming myself oh i'm so bad


---------20:54----------
i'm so dumb i can't do anything properly


---------20:57----------
like i deserve to be fired


---------20:59----------
and so sometimes in the case of um


---------21:02----------
suicidality what we actually see is


---------21:05----------
anger turned against the self with like


---------21:08----------
revengeful intent


---------21:10----------
so what this means is like sometimes we


---------21:12----------
have these ideas about ourselves that


---------21:13----------
are like


---------21:14----------
like i i am such a bad person


---------21:18----------
that like you almost want to like punish


---------21:20----------
yourself for being so bad


---------21:22----------
and this it's kind of really toxic but


---------21:24----------
if i really it's kind of sad but when i


---------21:26----------
work with some people


---------21:27----------
what i really find is that when people


---------21:29----------
have like this self-loathing and


---------21:31----------
self-hatred


---------21:32----------
they don't believe they deserve to get


---------21:34----------
better


---------21:35----------
they actually believe that they like


---------21:37----------
deserve punishment


---------21:39----------
and so sometimes suicidality is not


---------21:41----------
about like


---------21:42----------
oh woe is me i no longer have a life to


---------21:45----------
live sometimes it's not like a sudden


---------21:47----------
breakdown of a defense mechanism of like


---------21:49----------
a dynamic equilibrium


---------21:51----------
and sometimes what it is is like i


---------21:53----------
deserve to kill myself


---------21:54----------
because a pos like me doesn't deserve to


---------21:58----------
be alive


---------21:59----------
and so what we can kind of see is as you


---------22:01----------
talk as i've talked to people


---------22:03----------
you know i'll have someone like in the


---------22:05----------
mdd camp who for example is like


---------22:07----------
has a happy marriage and has a stable


---------22:10----------
job


---------22:11----------
and has like kids who love them and


---------22:14----------
despite


---------22:14----------
all of these positive factors they'll


---------22:17----------
still be suicidal


---------22:19----------
and so when i kind of see that like


---------22:21----------
that's when i really think about like


---------22:22----------
this seems to me like a malfunction this


---------22:24----------
is not supposed to be the way


---------22:26----------
that this person this person isn't


---------22:27----------
supposed to feel that way


---------22:29----------
right so if we think about a brain


---------22:31----------
malfunction


---------22:32----------
it's like your brain is not thinking the


---------22:34----------
way that it's supposed to be


---------22:35----------
but as you actually spend time with


---------22:37----------
people who are suicidal what you


---------22:38----------
actually find is that some people


---------22:40----------
like it sort of makes sense that they're


---------22:42----------
suicidal because their life really has


---------22:44----------
fallen apart


---------22:45----------
they really don't believe that there's


---------22:46----------
anything worth living for


---------22:48----------
and we may call that depression they may


---------22:50----------
get diagnosed with depression but i


---------22:52----------
don't know that this is like an


---------22:53----------
organic brain disease does it sort of a


---------22:56----------
chicken or egg situation or like the


---------22:58----------
brain and our psychology is complicated


---------23:01----------
and sometimes it's not that like life


---------23:03----------
isn't worth living


---------23:04----------
so this is sort of like life isn't


---------23:08----------
worth living okay


---------23:11----------
and then over here what we have is i


---------23:14----------
don't


---------23:15----------
deserve to live you guys see how like


---------23:19----------
these thoughts are different


---------23:21----------
and over here is like and over here what


---------23:24----------
we have is


---------23:26----------
i'm suicidal despite


---------23:30----------
life being great right and so these are


---------23:33----------
very different buckets


---------23:34----------
in terms of what goes on in the mind of


---------23:37----------
the person and then like


---------23:38----------
you know as we kind of go to other


---------23:40----------
options so like here's another kind of


---------23:42----------
like psychological manifestation


---------23:45----------
um but i'd kind of say that another one


---------23:48----------
is


---------23:48----------
intolerance


---------23:51----------
of humiliation shame


---------23:55----------
or envy and and so like this is kind of


---------23:58----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but like


---------24:00----------
this is sort of like a different bucket


---------24:01----------
if you think about the


---------24:02----------
emotion that's at play for these


---------24:04----------
different buckets like sometimes it's


---------24:06----------
like hopelessness


---------24:08----------
so if we look at the first column okay


---------24:10----------
so if we look at this column


---------24:12----------
okay this is transmitting so if you look


---------24:13----------
at this column this is hopelessness


---------24:16----------
this is going to be anger and this is


---------24:18----------
going to be shame


---------24:20----------
okay so these are going to be like a


---------24:22----------
little bit different


---------24:24----------
so the point here is that when we're


---------24:26----------
thinking about you know why


---------24:27----------
people want to kill themselves um


---------24:31----------
you know in what is the nature of their


---------24:33----------
suicidality what we sort of


---------24:34----------
arrive at is that they're actually like


---------24:37----------
a number of different reasons which are


---------24:38----------
not all the same


---------24:40----------
so this isn't just like one thing it's


---------24:42----------
not just mental illness that is causing


---------24:44----------
suicidality


---------24:45----------
and i think that it's the assumption


---------24:47----------
that like you know ssris will cure


---------24:49----------
suicidality


---------24:50----------
that despite the fact that our ssri


---------24:52----------
prescriptions have gone through the roof


---------24:54----------
over the last couple of decades


---------24:56----------
suicidal suicidality is still increasing


---------24:59----------
which sort of naturally


---------25:00----------
implies that um you know we're missing


---------25:04----------
something here


---------25:05----------
like as a profession and as a society


---------25:08----------
we're


---------25:08----------
missing something really important about


---------25:10----------
suicidality so if people are kind of


---------25:12----------
curious this is the the paper that i'm


---------25:14----------
pulling from which is


---------25:15----------
a sort of an an examination of a


---------25:18----------
particular narcissistic


---------25:19----------
person and different causes um and it's


---------25:22----------
by


---------25:23----------
uh elsa ronningstam igor weinberg and


---------25:26----------
um john maltzberger i think all these


---------25:29----------
maybe all three of these people are at


---------25:31----------
harvard that's number two


---------25:33----------
okay so we started off by talking about


---------25:34----------
you know who is vulnerable to suicide


---------25:37----------
the second thing is like why people kill


---------25:38----------
themselves and what we sort of discover


---------25:40----------
in terms of why people kill themselves


---------25:43----------
is that there's actually like a lot of


---------25:45----------
different reasons so sometimes it's


---------25:46----------
hopelessness sometimes it's anger


---------25:48----------
sometimes it's shame and humiliation and


---------25:51----------
some degree of envy


---------25:53----------
and i think each of these causes as we


---------25:56----------
sort of think about the differential


---------25:58----------
diagnosis of suicidality what we sort of


---------26:00----------
result in


---------26:00----------
is that different causes are going to


---------26:02----------
have different solutions so once again


---------26:04----------
if you're


---------26:05----------
feeling like killing yourself or you


---------26:07----------
have suicidal thoughts this is like


---------26:10----------
reason number two to go see a mental


---------26:12----------
health professional right like


---------26:14----------
understand that these things when you


---------26:16----------
work with someone can be addressed


---------26:18----------
so for the person who's hopeless you


---------26:21----------
know


---------26:21----------
we can sort of help them build a life


---------26:24----------
dream again


---------26:25----------
so a big part of what we try to do here


---------26:27----------
at healthygamer is like help people


---------26:28----------
construct a life


---------26:30----------
that is worth living our original goal


---------26:32----------
was like helping people with video game


---------26:34----------
addiction


---------26:34----------
and what we sort of found is the


---------26:36----------
antidote to video game addiction is


---------26:37----------
having a life that is worth living


---------26:39----------
in the real world and so as you build


---------26:43----------
that


---------26:43----------
life which can absolutely be done right


---------26:45----------
it takes time and it takes effort and


---------26:47----------
you may feel hopeless


---------26:49----------
but like with a little bit of help and


---------26:51----------
with a little bit of an intention you


---------26:52----------
will be amazed at what you're capable of


---------26:56----------
the biggest thing about people who are


---------26:57----------
hopeless is that they don't exert effort


---------27:00----------
right and so you can even beat yourself


---------27:01----------
up over that


---------27:03----------
so there can be some amount of


---------27:04----------
hopelessness there can be some amount of


---------27:06----------
anger and self-hatred i don't deserve to


---------27:08----------
live i don't deserve to be happy


---------27:10----------
and so that sort of has a different


---------27:11----------
solution as well in terms of like


---------27:13----------
learning how to gain compassion


---------27:15----------
right so sometimes we'll teach like


---------27:18----------
particular meditation techniques that


---------27:19----------
can help people like


---------27:21----------
learn how to love yourself and learn how


---------27:23----------
to forgive yourself


---------27:24----------
there's a lot of stuff about this and in


---------27:26----------
one of the dr k guides


---------27:27----------
um around you know anahat chakra


---------27:30----------
meditations and things like that


---------27:32----------
so like there are different antidotes to


---------27:34----------
that there's also things like shame and


---------27:37----------
envy which those tend to be some of the


---------27:40----------
hardest things to deal with like


---------27:42----------
they require a lot of self-reflection


---------27:43----------
because it's sort of like


---------27:45----------
you know there's some amount of you know


---------27:48----------
hopelessness is something that


---------27:50----------
we want to fix anger is something that


---------27:53----------
we want to replace


---------27:55----------
with compassion like we sort of want to


---------27:57----------
do that but when i deal with people who


---------27:59----------
are like really envious


---------28:00----------
and suicide at the suicidal because


---------28:03----------
someone else's life is like better than


---------28:05----------
theirs


---------28:06----------
that's really really hard to deal with


---------28:08----------
it requires a lot of self-reflection


---------28:09----------
because it's like people hold on to


---------28:11----------
their envy


---------28:12----------
so much more so now what we're going to


---------28:15----------
do is sort of talk a little bit about


---------28:17----------
um how people go about killing


---------28:19----------
themselves and understanding


---------28:21----------
sort of like a clinical approach to like


---------28:23----------
suicide risk assessment


---------28:24----------
and a couple of common myths that i want


---------28:27----------
you guys to be careful about


---------28:30----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------28:32----------
psychiatrists are notoriously bad


---------28:34----------
at predicting whether someone is going


---------28:37----------
to kill themselves or not


---------28:38----------
in fact overwhelming amounts of research


---------28:41----------
have shown i know this is kind of


---------28:42----------
shocking


---------28:43----------
that psychiatrists cannot see the future


---------28:46----------
and so we don't really know whether


---------28:48----------
someone is going to kill themselves or


---------28:49----------
not


---------28:50----------
and so the question sort of becomes well


---------28:52----------
like why is that


---------28:53----------
and this is where like research gets to


---------28:55----------
be really really interesting


---------28:57----------
we have this kind of idea that when


---------29:00----------
someone wants to kill themselves


---------29:02----------
what they do is put their affairs in


---------29:04----------
order okay


---------29:05----------
there are signs absolutely we're gonna


---------29:07----------
get to those


---------29:08----------
so like they put their affairs in order


---------29:10----------
because what the media sort of says


---------29:11----------
right like you like you settle all your


---------29:13----------
things you like


---------29:14----------
you know you make sure no one's in the


---------29:16----------
house you write all your like suicide


---------29:18----------
notes and things like that


---------29:20----------
but it turns out that so this there's


---------29:22----------
sort of this idea that like people kill


---------29:24----------
themselves like their suicidality kind


---------29:25----------
of starts out here and then gradually


---------29:27----------
over time it increases and increases


---------29:29----------
increases increases and when it gets to


---------29:31----------
up here this is when you kill yourself


---------29:33----------
so a lot of people feel reassured right


---------29:35----------
they kind of say like okay yeah i'm


---------29:37----------
suicidal but like


---------29:38----------
i'm over here and since i'm over here


---------29:41----------
it's okay i don't need to get help yet


---------29:43----------
because i'm not up here


---------29:44----------
and all know i need help when i start to


---------29:47----------
feel worse and things like that


---------29:49----------
so there's sort of this myth that like


---------29:50----------
suicidality builds up over time and


---------29:52----------
people like


---------29:53----------
make a calculated decision to kill


---------29:55----------
themselves whereas if you look at the


---------29:56----------
data


---------29:57----------
what you actually find is if we look at


---------30:00----------
the decision


---------30:01----------
to make the most recent suicide attempt


---------30:05----------
the most common is that like you know i


---------30:09----------
i don't know exactly


---------30:10----------
what the y-axis is here it may be


---------30:13----------
um number of people so if you look at


---------30:16----------
like let's say this is like


---------30:17----------
30 people who tried to kill themselves


---------30:20----------
what you find is that 12 out of the 30


---------30:23----------
people


---------30:23----------
decided to make the attempt within one


---------30:26----------
minute


---------30:27----------
of the attempt um you know the vast


---------30:30----------
majority of people


---------30:31----------
decided within half an hour or


---------30:34----------
within two hours to make the attempt so


---------30:37----------
what we actually discover


---------30:39----------
um is that like most


---------30:43----------
of the like attempts of suicide are


---------30:46----------
actually


---------30:46----------
drastically impulsive decisions


---------30:50----------
and what we actually see is out of this


---------30:52----------
sample


---------30:54----------
no one was planning suicide for more


---------30:56----------
than three days


---------30:59----------
right so like what this means is that if


---------31:01----------
you guys have been struggling with


---------31:02----------
suicide


---------31:03----------
for a long period of time and you think


---------31:06----------
to yourself


---------31:07----------
like oh like since i'm not planning it i


---------31:09----------
don't need to be worried


---------31:11----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but you


---------31:12----------
should absolutely be worried because


---------31:14----------
what the data actually tells us if you


---------31:15----------
take people who tried to commit suicide


---------31:18----------
who survived and you ask them this is


---------31:20----------
how the study was done


---------31:22----------
when did you make the decision to kill


---------31:23----------
yourself the vast majority was like


---------31:26----------
within 60 seconds


---------31:28----------
and so it this is a kind of another


---------31:30----------
thing to kind of look at so if you look


---------31:32----------
at suicidal ideation


---------31:33----------
over time okay and this is


---------31:37----------
people like checking their suicidality


---------31:39----------
like four to eight hours apart


---------31:41----------
what you basically see is that like the


---------31:42----------
suicidal score like


---------31:44----------
is all over the place right so like this


---------31:47----------
person will be


---------31:48----------
very suicidal this moment and will be


---------31:51----------
like


---------31:51----------
not very suicidal four hours later


---------31:55----------
so basically like the key takeaway here


---------31:57----------
is that the first


---------31:59----------
important myth to address is that like


---------32:03----------
if you're telling yourself that because


---------32:05----------
you're not planning to kill yourself


---------32:07----------
you are safe that's something you need


---------32:09----------
to be really careful about


---------32:11----------
so what you want to really do is go see


---------32:13----------
a clinician either way


---------32:15----------
like if you've been dealing with


---------32:16----------
suicidal thoughts for a long time


---------32:19----------
i know it sounds kind of scary but like


---------32:21----------
you just never know like


---------32:22----------
when we come to that sudden defense


---------32:24----------
breakdown you never know when the stars


---------32:27----------
will align and like something will crack


---------32:29----------
through and you will actually make an


---------32:31----------
attempt


---------32:32----------
so what i strongly encourage everyone to


---------32:35----------
do is just because you've been feeling


---------32:36----------
that way for a long time and nothing


---------32:38----------
nothing has happened yet is not a


---------32:41----------
sufficient reason


---------32:42----------
to not get help so even if you feel like


---------32:44----------
it hasn't


---------32:45----------
if you have it under control if you feel


---------32:48----------
like


---------32:49----------
you know it hasn't happened yet so


---------32:51----------
there's a famous saying from the stock


---------32:52----------
market you know like people in finance


---------32:54----------
will say that


---------32:55----------
the stock market past performance is not


---------32:57----------
an indicator of future gains


---------32:59----------
right and i think that's absolutely true


---------33:01----------
of suicidality as well


---------33:03----------
when we're thinking about performing


---------33:04----------
like a risk assessment


---------33:07----------
you know that's not really like that


---------33:09----------
reassuring because we just know as


---------33:11----------
clinicians that it's sort of like on a


---------33:13----------
given day like something may happen in


---------33:14----------
your mind we don't really know


---------33:16----------
and you can kind of result in an attempt


---------33:19----------
so what do we look at as clinicians


---------33:22----------
so we tend to look at means of access


---------33:24----------
and this is why means of access is like


---------33:26----------
the number one protective thing


---------33:29----------
so if we think about if we now


---------33:30----------
understand that suicidality


---------33:32----------
is impulsive and most people decide to


---------33:34----------
kill themselves within 60 seconds of


---------33:36----------
making the attempt


---------33:38----------
having a gun at home is part of the


---------33:40----------
reason why suicide is like so dang


---------33:42----------
so much more likely if there's easy


---------33:44----------
access to an attempt


---------33:46----------
if you have a gun at home if you if you


---------33:48----------
can like


---------33:50----------
make a decision and 60 seconds later you


---------33:52----------
can actually make the attempt if you


---------33:54----------
have the means to do that


---------33:56----------
that's incredibly dangerous so when i


---------33:58----------
think about like suicidal like


---------34:00----------
like probabilities what i really try to


---------34:02----------
protect against


---------34:04----------
because remember like what we've got is


---------34:05----------
like your mind


---------34:07----------
working against you and your mind


---------34:09----------
working for you so as a clinician what i


---------34:11----------
really try to do is


---------34:12----------
buy time for my patients


---------34:15----------
to like get their head above water and


---------34:18----------
reach out for help


---------34:20----------
and so if someone has to you know order


---------34:22----------
something from the internet


---------34:24----------
in that 24-hour period their suicidality


---------34:27----------
will fluctuate and they'll reach out to


---------34:29----------
me


---------34:29----------
and they'll say like hey i had like a


---------34:31----------
really scary like near miss


---------34:33----------
and then we'll kind of talk about it


---------34:34----------
we'll help them through it and then they


---------34:35----------
end up


---------34:36----------
generally speaking doing well okay


---------34:39----------
you know when it comes to a risk


---------34:40----------
assessment we think about things like


---------34:42----------
and this is for you guys to understand


---------34:44----------
too if you're thinking about a


---------34:45----------
particular


---------34:46----------
there's a big difference between it


---------34:47----------
would be okay


---------34:49----------
so let's talk about like the scale of


---------34:51----------
risk okay


---------34:52----------
so if i went to bed and i never woke up


---------34:56----------
i would be fine with that


---------34:57----------
that's something that we call passive


---------34:58----------
suicidality it's not that you actually


---------35:00----------
want to die it's just sort of like


---------35:02----------
you know if you unplug things like you


---------35:04----------
would be okay with it


---------35:06----------
then they're sort of like i wish i went


---------35:08----------
to bed and never woke up


---------35:10----------
so at that point it's sort of like a


---------35:11----------
desire but it's not really like an


---------35:13----------
intent


---------35:14----------
right you're not trying to not wake up


---------35:16----------
it's just like


---------35:17----------
we move from a passive suicidality to


---------35:19----------
like sort of a wish


---------35:21----------
and then the next phase is like i


---------35:22----------
actually don't want to wake up like i'm


---------35:24----------
going to try to not wake up


---------35:27----------
right so then we sort of cross over into


---------35:29----------
intent which is like scarier


---------35:31----------
and then like the scariest thing is like


---------35:33----------
plans and then means


---------35:35----------
so then like if you kind of think okay i


---------35:37----------
am going to


---------35:38----------
not wake up in this particular way right


---------35:41----------
so like once you start to think about a


---------35:43----------
plan


---------35:43----------
that increases your risk of a bad


---------35:45----------
outcome


---------35:46----------
and then once that plan becomes


---------35:48----------
available that's when things get really


---------35:50----------
scary


---------35:50----------
and it's usually towards those like


---------35:52----------
later stages that we sort of really


---------35:54----------
think about things like hospitalization


---------35:56----------
you know


---------35:56----------
just a another important reminder here


---------35:59----------
that like


---------36:00----------
you should not be using this risk


---------36:02----------
assessment to determine


---------36:04----------
whether you should go see a clinician or


---------36:06----------
not if you were


---------36:08----------
anywhere on this axis in any way you


---------36:12----------
should get a professional evaluation


---------36:14----------
because we know how to ask questions


---------36:17----------
that will sort of help us figure out


---------36:18----------
where you are


---------36:20----------
because i know hopefully you guys if you


---------36:21----------
guys have been watching the stream for a


---------36:22----------
while


---------36:23----------
a big part of this problem is that


---------36:25----------
people don't


---------36:26----------
know what's in their mind right the


---------36:28----------
whole point of this stream if you think


---------36:30----------
about like how to benefit


---------36:31----------
how do people benefit from coming on


---------36:33----------
stream watching stream


---------36:35----------
it's that we help you understand the


---------36:37----------
things that you are not aware of in your


---------36:39----------
mind


---------36:40----------
and this is why i cannot urge you more


---------36:42----------
strongly that if you are


---------36:43----------
anywhere on the spectrum or even not on


---------36:46----------
the spectrum


---------36:48----------
it's completely reasonable and i urge


---------36:50----------
each and every it doesn't


---------36:52----------
now that i think about it like just go


---------36:53----------
get evaluated like even if you don't


---------36:55----------
think you need to


---------36:57----------
right because you may be missing


---------36:58----------
something the other reason to go get


---------37:00----------
evaluator to reach out for treatment i


---------37:02----------
know this sounds like absolutely crazy


---------37:03----------
like it sounds absolutely crazy is that


---------37:05----------
you don't have to live


---------37:06----------
in this mindset so for people who are


---------37:09----------
chronically suicidal and think about


---------37:11----------
never waking up again


---------37:12----------
you don't have to live that way right so


---------37:15----------
like there


---------37:16----------
are trained professionals whose job


---------37:19----------
it is to help you through that stuff


---------37:22----------
and this is the really crazy thing right


---------37:24----------
is like our mind does this really stupid


---------37:26----------
thing where it's like


---------37:28----------
if i can't figure it out no one can


---------37:30----------
figure it out


---------37:31----------
it's like i've been dealing with this


---------37:33----------
for a long time i've read so many books


---------37:35----------
i've watched so many youtube videos


---------37:36----------
i haven't figured it out so like i don't


---------37:38----------
think anyone can help me i'm unhelpable


---------37:41----------
like they can help other people but i


---------37:43----------
have tried really hard to figure this


---------37:45----------
out and i haven't been able to so i


---------37:47----------
don't really think there's any point


---------37:49----------
in seeing a professional be careful


---------37:52----------
because if you have


---------37:53----------
that thought if you think there is no


---------37:55----------
point


---------37:57----------
that is actually you should do the exact


---------38:00----------
opposite


---------38:00----------
if you think there is no point to see a


---------38:02----------
professional you should actually go see


---------38:04----------
a professional


---------38:06----------
if you're on that axis you should


---------38:07----------
absolutely go see a professional


---------38:10----------
right and when it we'll get to this in a


---------38:12----------
second in terms of like what you can do


---------38:14----------
or i guess we can so so now like moving


---------38:16----------
on to like point number four is like


---------38:18----------
what do you do


---------38:19----------
in this situation right so the answer is


---------38:21----------
gonna be like sort of a broken record


---------38:23----------
here is like you go get help


---------38:25----------
so like in the same way that if like if


---------38:26----------
you've got a flat tire like maybe you


---------38:28----------
know how to change it to yourself but if


---------38:29----------
you're let's say your engine is busted


---------38:31----------
right like you go see a mechanic like


---------38:33----------
there are as as human beings we have a


---------38:36----------
society we have a community and we have


---------38:38----------
a diversification


---------38:39----------
of our labor pool like if you want to


---------38:41----------
eat


---------38:42----------
a burrito you go to a place where people


---------38:45----------
know how to make burritos or you make it


---------38:46----------
yourself


---------38:47----------
right if you wanna you know


---------38:50----------
get if you've got covid like you go see


---------38:52----------
a medical doctor because they're gonna


---------38:54----------
help you with covid


---------38:55----------
you go to the appropriate person for the


---------38:57----------
appropriate thing and if you're dealing


---------38:59----------
with feelings of hopelessness or


---------39:00----------
suicidal thoughts the appropriate place


---------39:02----------
to go because there's a profession of


---------39:04----------
people whose job it is


---------39:05----------
and who's been spending years of their


---------39:07----------
life to train and get good at helping


---------39:08----------
you


---------39:09----------
so you should go see them right and be


---------39:12----------
careful about all of the reasons


---------39:14----------
that your mind may populate and if your


---------39:16----------
mind populates these reasons


---------39:18----------
then you should really like notice that


---------39:21----------
and recognize that this could be


---------39:23----------
a process a part of like the negative


---------39:25----------
process


---------39:26----------
so if your mind is telling you there's


---------39:28----------
no point if there's your mind is telling


---------39:29----------
you that you don't deserve help


---------39:31----------
and that you deserve to feel this way


---------39:33----------
because you're such a pos


---------39:35----------
and you like you know like other people


---------39:38----------
deserve help but you don't deserve help


---------39:39----------
like that's like just recognize that and


---------39:41----------
then don't give


---------39:42----------
in to that so i know this sounds kind of


---------39:44----------
weird but i encourage all of you all to


---------39:46----------
really think about


---------39:47----------
what is it that dictates your life do


---------39:50----------
you want to live a life that's based on


---------39:51----------
like what your emotions tell you and


---------39:53----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but based


---------39:55----------
on what your thoughts tell you


---------39:57----------
because the mind is just a thinking


---------39:59----------
machine it just generates thoughts it


---------40:00----------
generates all kinds of random crap


---------40:02----------
like your mind will say like i want a


---------40:04----------
burrito or it'll say like i want to play


---------40:06----------
dota


---------40:06----------
or like i don't want to do this and do


---------40:09----------
you want to listen


---------40:10----------
to your mind so be careful right because


---------40:12----------
sometimes you want to listen to your


---------40:13----------
mind and sometimes you don't


---------40:15----------
but you don't want your mind and your


---------40:16----------
emotions to be in control of you


---------40:19----------
you want to be in control of them


---------40:23----------
so the last thing that i'm going to kind


---------40:24----------
of talk about is like you know


---------40:27----------
this sentiment that you can handle it is


---------40:29----------
not a sufficient reason


---------40:32----------
to this is not the last thing this is


---------40:33----------
the second last thing um


---------40:35----------
the sentiment that you can handle it is


---------40:37----------
not a sufficient reason


---------40:38----------
to not see a mental health professional


---------40:40----------
because it's just dangerous like


---------40:42----------
statistically it's very dangerous


---------40:44----------
the last thing that i'm going to talk a


---------40:46----------
little bit about is like how to help


---------40:47----------
someone


---------40:48----------
else who is dealing with suicidality


---------40:51----------
so this is really tricky because a lot


---------40:53----------
of times people in our community are


---------40:54----------
like


---------40:55----------
good people and you try to help other


---------40:57----------
people out which is awesome


---------40:58----------
right like we love that it's part of the


---------41:01----------
reason that we're here like our discord


---------41:03----------
has a lot of people that try to help


---------41:04----------
each other out our subreddit has like


---------41:06----------
people posting about their problems


---------41:08----------
and like other people post on the


---------41:09----------
subreddit to try to support them it's


---------41:10----------
like fantastic like


---------41:12----------
it's really great it's beautiful we have


---------41:14----------
coaches who will also like you know are


---------41:15----------
also kind of trained in our


---------41:17----------
methodologies or


---------41:18----------
specifically there to help you out and


---------41:20----------
and that seems to be going really well


---------41:22----------
um i had that i had the privilege of


---------41:24----------
dropping into a


---------41:25----------
coaching group this morning and and it


---------41:28----------
was fun to really see like


---------41:29----------
you know how their how people are


---------41:32----------
progressing


---------41:34----------
so the last thing is like you may have a


---------41:35----------
friend who is struggling with suicidal


---------41:38----------
thoughts so the first thing to


---------41:39----------
understand is that like


---------41:40----------
a lot of people feel like i don't know


---------41:42----------
how to help them or they won't let me


---------41:43----------
help them which is


---------41:44----------
sort of fair because it's i know it


---------41:46----------
sounds kind of weird but like it's your


---------41:48----------
job to be their friend not their doctor


---------41:50----------
so a lot of times i notice that people


---------41:52----------
get really kind of like frustrated or


---------41:54----------
they feel like really like stressed out


---------41:56----------
because they're trying to


---------41:58----------
fix this person's suicidality they're


---------42:00----------
trying to like because it's like so


---------42:01----------
scary and you want to fix it


---------42:03----------
but you're just not trained or capable


---------42:05----------
and so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------42:06----------
but like you shouldn't


---------42:07----------
stress about that right so like fixing


---------42:10----------
someone's suicidality


---------42:11----------
is not your job as a friend you're not


---------42:14----------
trained in it so you i mean i guess you


---------42:16----------
can kind of give it a shot but like


---------42:18----------
i wouldn't really recommend that really


---------42:20----------
your job


---------42:21----------
as a friend is to be their friend and


---------42:24----------
support them through it so this is where


---------42:26----------
it's like


---------42:26----------
encouraging them to actually get help


---------42:29----------
because this is huge


---------42:31----------
where a lot of times people won't want


---------42:33----------
to get help for any number of reasons


---------42:35----------
because they feel ashamed so like you


---------42:37----------
know you can kind of support them


---------42:38----------
through that sometimes it's like


---------42:39----------
practical like


---------42:41----------
you know their their mental is not


---------42:43----------
functioning properly so that like they


---------42:44----------
just don't have the wherewithal to like


---------42:46----------
sit down and like


---------42:48----------
call around and try to find an


---------42:49----------
appointment so you may be able to help


---------42:51----------
with that like it's kind of crazy but


---------42:53----------
you could ask them


---------42:54----------
hey would you like my help in making an


---------42:56----------
appointment like


---------42:57----------
because 60 minutes from now like you


---------42:59----------
could have two appointments


---------43:01----------
we can make you know one phone call


---------43:04----------
every six minutes and we can make 10


---------43:06----------
phone calls


---------43:06----------
and out of those 10 phone calls it's


---------43:08----------
there's a decent chance that


---------43:10----------
20 percent of the people like will have


---------43:12----------
availability


---------43:13----------
so it's going to be an uphill battle


---------43:15----------
because in the mind of the depressed


---------43:16----------
person in the mind of the hopeless


---------43:17----------
person they may muster up the courage


---------43:19----------
to make one phone call but when like you


---------43:21----------
know they don't get an appointment they


---------43:23----------
kind of give up


---------43:24----------
so as a friend you can help them get


---------43:26----------
into treatment you can encourage them to


---------43:28----------
get into treatment you can support them


---------43:29----------
to get into treatment


---------43:31----------
the second thing is don't underestimate


---------43:34----------
the power of being a friend


---------43:36----------
so while you may not be able to actually


---------43:38----------
treat their suicidality and nor should


---------43:40----------
you try


---------43:42----------
don't underestimate the value of you


---------43:44----------
caring about them


---------43:46----------
right because in their mind remember


---------43:47----------
that there's an equation between


---------43:49----------
pro-suicidal factors


---------43:50----------
and anti-suicidal factors but like


---------43:54----------
one of the things that you're doing


---------43:55----------
there just by being their friend and


---------43:57----------
even like i know it sounds kind of weird


---------43:58----------
but like


---------43:59----------
i'll even say this as a psychiatrist


---------44:01----------
like it's one of the most powerful


---------44:03----------
things that i've like learned how to say


---------44:06----------
like when i'm dealing with patients with


---------44:07----------
trauma you know they'll tell me about


---------44:09----------
all this terrible stuff


---------44:10----------
that happened to them and it's like


---------44:12----------
we're 10 years later


---------44:14----------
and i can't do anything about that and


---------44:17----------
just sharing


---------44:18----------
how much i wish i could like you know


---------44:21----------
because really the


---------44:22----------
cure for this person is for me to invent


---------44:23----------
a time machine go back in time and


---------44:25----------
protect


---------44:26----------
that from protect them from like that


---------44:28----------
ever happening


---------44:29----------
that's the cure and i wish i could do


---------44:31----------
that but i can't


---------44:33----------
and i'm actually completely powerless in


---------44:35----------
this situation to like


---------44:36----------
take that trauma away from them and


---------44:39----------
being able to share that with them


---------44:41----------
because like instead of like


---------44:42----------
you know you trying to help them you're


---------44:44----------
actually joining them in the


---------44:45----------
hopelessness


---------44:47----------
and then what happens once you join them


---------44:48----------
in the hopelessness is like


---------44:50----------
both the all are down there together


---------44:53----------
and you all are hopeless together so at


---------44:55----------
least you can't change time you can't


---------44:57----------
change the past


---------44:58----------
they can't change the past either but at


---------45:00----------
least both they all are down there


---------45:02----------
and like they're not shouldering that


---------45:05----------
powerlessness


---------45:06----------
on their own you're helping them carry


---------45:07----------
that powerlessness


---------45:09----------
too and so then once you kind of get


---------45:12----------
down there in there with them and you


---------45:14----------
say like hey i can't take this away from


---------45:15----------
you i wish i could


---------45:16----------
but i'd like to try to help you in some


---------45:18----------
way what can we do


---------45:21----------
what can we do and that's really the


---------45:24----------
most important question you can ask as a


---------45:26----------
friend


---------45:27----------
right and then like meet them where


---------45:28----------
they're at and try to like help them


---------45:30----------
like if they if it's sort of like can i


---------45:32----------
make phone calls for you can i help you


---------45:33----------
get into treatment like


---------45:35----------
what can i do you know what is it that


---------45:37----------
you would like to do that you're not


---------45:39----------
able to do


---------45:40----------
and sometimes it's like other kinds of


---------45:42----------
things right it's like hey let's play


---------45:43----------
like


---------45:44----------
let's make phone calls for 30 minutes


---------45:46----------
and then like we'll play like


---------45:48----------
one game of league and then like


---------45:51----------
depend after that like we'll take a


---------45:53----------
break and we'll make phone calls for


---------45:54----------
another 30 minutes


---------45:55----------
and then like we're gonna keep doing


---------45:57----------
that until you have


---------45:59----------
two appointments and then we'll


---------46:03----------
you know there's a lot that you can do


---------46:04----------
as a friend so remember that your dharma


---------46:06----------
as their friend is to be their friend


---------46:09----------
it's not to cure them


---------46:11----------
and so be careful about what you're


---------46:12----------
capable of and what you're signing up


---------46:14----------
for


---------46:15----------
oh so let's actually start with kind of


---------46:17----------
a quick summary so today we're talking a


---------46:18----------
little bit about suicidality


---------46:20----------
and how to understand it so we started


---------46:22----------
off by talking about


---------46:24----------
you know who suicide affects who has


---------46:28----------
suicidal thoughts


---------46:29----------
kind of how that works we sort of talked


---------46:32----------
a little bit about how


---------46:33----------
women may be more likely to attempt


---------46:35----------
suicide although men are more likely to


---------46:37----------
complete suicide successfully


---------46:39----------
about 80 percent of suicides are men


---------46:42----------
we also talked a little bit about why


---------46:44----------
that statistic may be different


---------46:46----------
um so some of it may have to do with the


---------46:48----------
means of suicidality like women are more


---------46:50----------
likely to try to overdose


---------46:51----------
which means that the the window for


---------46:53----------
medical intervention in the window to


---------46:55----------
save that person's life


---------46:56----------
is a lot greater than using something


---------46:58----------
like a gun which men are more likely to


---------47:00----------
use guns women are more likely to try


---------47:02----------
overdose 5 pills


---------47:04----------
so we talked a little bit about


---------47:06----------
statistics i suspect that there's more


---------47:08----------
to it than that


---------47:10----------
i think that there's something going on


---------47:12----------
in terms of like why men are so much


---------47:13----------
more likely to kill themselves


---------47:15----------
the second thing that we kind of talked


---------47:16----------
a little bit about is like you know why


---------47:18----------
do


---------47:18----------
people kill themselves and as we sort of


---------47:21----------
get into the


---------47:22----------
the mechanisms to recognize that


---------47:24----------
suicidality is a symptom


---------47:25----------
it's not a diagnosis and that


---------47:27----------
suicidality is


---------47:29----------
born out of all kinds of psychopathology


---------47:33----------
as well as potentially like


---------47:34----------
psychological


---------47:36----------
complexes that are not necessarily a


---------47:38----------
discrete medical illness


---------47:40----------
brain malfunction or neurochemistry


---------47:42----------
imbalance


---------47:43----------
so we talked a little bit about diseases


---------47:46----------
like major depressive disorder bipolar


---------47:48----------
disorder addiction


---------47:50----------
sometimes things like trauma but also


---------47:52----------
that when you actually sit down and talk


---------47:54----------
to people with suicidality what you


---------47:55----------
discover is that


---------47:56----------
sometimes they want to kill themselves


---------47:59----------
because they don't feel like life is


---------48:00----------
worth living


---------48:01----------
that their dreams have been shattered


---------48:03----------
and they don't really feel like they can


---------48:04----------
ever put things together again


---------48:06----------
sometimes people kill themselves because


---------48:08----------
they have an immense amount of


---------48:10----------
self-hatred and it's not that


---------48:11----------
life can't be put back together it's


---------48:13----------
that they don't deserve to live a life


---------48:15----------
that is like put together


---------48:17----------
sometimes it's born of things like envy


---------48:20----------
and humiliation and shame


---------48:22----------
and sometimes what can actually happen


---------48:24----------
is is we always sort of have this war


---------48:26----------
going on in our mind


---------48:28----------
between reasons to live and reasons to


---------48:30----------
not live


---------48:31----------
and sometimes we can have acute events


---------48:34----------
that will sort of shatter some of our


---------48:36----------
defense mechanisms that help keep us


---------48:38----------
alive


---------48:38----------
and sometimes i'll see this especially


---------48:40----------
in the case of disinhibition through


---------48:42----------
substances


---------48:43----------
so like you know if you think about


---------48:44----------
alcohol alcohol will make you more


---------48:46----------
likely to do things that you wouldn't do


---------48:48----------
if you were like level-headed


---------48:50----------
and suicidality includes that so like


---------48:52----------
the number of suicide attempts that i've


---------48:54----------
seen


---------48:54----------
under the influence of alcohol is like


---------48:56----------
staggering it's like through the roof


---------48:58----------
and then we sort of talked a little bit


---------48:59----------
about


---------49:00----------
you know how to think about suicidality


---------49:02----------
so we talked a little bit about risk


---------49:03----------
assessment


---------49:04----------
and the main takeaway here is that


---------49:06----------
regardless of how suicidal you've been


---------49:09----------
if you've had those kinds of thoughts or


---------49:11----------
you're currently having those kinds of


---------49:12----------
thoughts you should absolutely go get


---------49:14----------
help it's a no-brainer


---------49:15----------
and a big reason for that is one of the


---------49:17----------
most common myths behind suicide


---------49:19----------
suicide which is that people like really


---------49:20----------
plan it out right it's like weeks and


---------49:22----------
weeks of careful planning and i'm gonna


---------49:24----------
do this and


---------49:24----------
settle my affairs in order whereas if


---------49:26----------
you look at the research


---------49:28----------
at least in one study no one planned


---------49:30----------
more than three days


---------49:31----------
and like the vast majority like 50 or


---------49:34----------
more 60


---------49:34----------
70 80 percent of people made the


---------49:37----------
decision within two hours


---------49:39----------
and about 30 of the people made the


---------49:41----------
decision within 60 seconds so the reason


---------49:44----------
you should go get help is because


---------49:46----------
you never know when your mind is going


---------49:48----------
to change and the last thing that we


---------49:50----------
talked a little bit about is okay like


---------49:52----------
so what do we do about it right


---------49:53----------
if you're struggling with these thoughts


---------49:55----------
like the short answer is get help


---------49:56----------
recognize that there are all kinds of


---------49:58----------
thoughts in your head that will prevent


---------50:00----------
you from getting help


---------50:01----------
and if you're having those thoughts


---------50:02----------
that's not a reason to not get help in


---------50:04----------
fact it's the very opposite


---------50:06----------
so sometimes your mind may be telling


---------50:08----------
you things like no one will be able to


---------50:09----------
help because i haven't been able to fix


---------50:11----------
it myself


---------50:12----------
your mind may be telling you i don't


---------50:13----------
deserve help and if you have any of


---------50:15----------
those thoughts you should actually get


---------50:16----------
help


---------50:16----------
because you're having those thoughts and


---------50:19----------
the last thing is you know how do you


---------50:20----------
support someone else the short answer is


---------50:22----------
get them into treatment


---------50:24----------
and in terms of how you do that it's


---------50:25----------
supporting them sometimes through like a


---------50:27----------
very practical hey do you want me to


---------50:29----------
like google stuff for you


---------50:31----------
can we make phone calls together and


---------50:33----------
sometimes it's just being their friend


---------50:34----------
because it's your job to be their friend


---------50:36----------
it's not your job to be their doctor


---------50:38----------
and a lot of times people get really


---------50:40----------
bent out of shape and stressed out


---------50:41----------
because they try to


---------50:43----------
be their doctor when you just can't


---------50:44----------
you're not trained to do that nor should


---------50:46----------
you


---------50:47----------
i don't i don't play doctor i i don't


---------50:50----------
accept patients that are friends of mine


---------50:53----------
so like you know people who have working


---------50:54----------
relationships with people who are my


---------50:56----------
friends people who are my family like i


---------50:58----------
won't be their doctor


---------50:59----------
i will send them to someone else


---------51:02----------
so that's our quick talk about suicide i


---------51:05----------
hope it's been helpful


---------51:07----------
you know the goal of having this talk is


---------51:09----------
because as we looked at earlier


---------51:11----------
we are sort of losing the war against


---------51:13----------
mental illness we are losing the war


---------51:15----------
against suicide and despite


---------51:17----------
many advances in medicine despite you


---------51:20----------
know a lot of new pharmaceutical


---------51:21----------
medications and things like that


---------51:23----------
some of which i've really seen like


---------51:24----------
clinically do a fantastic job


---------51:27----------
um i really have seen some patients with


---------51:29----------
depression who've tried like


---------51:31----------
five or six medications and a new drug


---------51:33----------
comes comes on the market


---------51:34----------
it really does turn things around for


---------51:35----------
them so it's great that like we have all


---------51:37----------
these advances and at the same time


---------51:40----------
you know the suicide has like increased


---------51:43----------
as a cause of death by like 33


---------51:45----------
over the last like 20 years i believe


---------51:48----------
whereas like you know deaths due to


---------51:50----------
cancer and heart disease and stuff like


---------51:51----------
that have gone down by 20 to 40 percent


---------51:55----------
and so the the first you know we're


---------51:57----------
going to start by educating on


---------51:59----------
educating y'all right so we as a


---------52:00----------
community need to understand more about


---------52:02----------
suicide


---------52:03----------
we need to understand like what it looks


---------52:05----------
like what it feels like what to do


---------52:06----------
with it and i encourage all you all to


---------52:09----------
get some help because


---------52:10----------
the the you know the biggest the most


---------52:13----------
common thing that i hear from my


---------52:14----------
patients


---------52:15----------
who are reluctant to engage in mental


---------52:17----------
health is like i wish i had done this


---------52:19----------
sooner


---------52:20----------
because some of them will just i mean


---------52:21----------
you guys will hopefully realize this too


---------52:23----------
that you just don't have to live like


---------52:24----------
this it's like


---------52:26----------
you know like you can fix this like you


---------52:28----------
can feel


---------52:29----------
better on a day-to-day basis like the


---------52:31----------
sun can be a little bit brighter you can


---------52:33----------
be a little bit happier


---------52:34----------
you can just enjoy things more you can


---------52:37----------
actually live life with like more


---------52:39----------
motivation


---------52:40----------
and like food can taste better and all


---------52:44----------
you have to do is just


---------52:45----------
get a little bit of help because


---------52:46----------
someone's asking a question


---------52:48----------
what if you don't have money so


---------52:51----------
um it depends a little bit on where you


---------52:53----------
live but


---------52:55----------
uh you know most places actually have


---------52:58----------
most places meaning like even countries


---------52:59----------
like so the u.s basically has


---------53:01----------
free mental health clinics or community


---------53:04----------
mental health clinics


---------53:06----------
in most like cities actually so


---------53:09----------
i don't think people realize this but


---------53:10----------
like you can just do like community


---------53:12----------
mental health center


---------53:13----------
and you call the community mental health


---------53:15----------
center and you say hey i have no money


---------53:17----------
i'm depressed can you guys help me


---------53:19----------
you'll be surprised because there are


---------53:20----------
all kinds of programs out there right so


---------53:22----------
we also have programs like rise above


---------53:24----------
the disorder


---------53:25----------
um or rad which is like you know a


---------53:28----------
gaming non-profit that supports like


---------53:29----------
gamers and actually


---------53:31----------
pays for their treatment through like


---------53:32----------
scholarships and grants


---------53:34----------
so there are non-profit organizations


---------53:36----------
out there that'll help


---------53:37----------
there are community mental health


---------53:39----------
centers that are helped just call them


---------53:40----------
up and ask


---------53:43----------
so i wouldn't let that be a barrier


---------53:46----------
okay so what's a good way i can open up


---------53:49----------
to a clinic or therapist about this kind


---------53:51----------
of topic without making it seem like i


---------53:53----------
am in


---------53:53----------
immediate danger but it is still a very


---------53:55----------
serious ongoing issue


---------53:58----------
so it is their job so my job as a


---------54:01----------
clinician is to keep people out of the


---------54:02----------
hospital right like the hospital is like


---------54:04----------
a last resort


---------54:05----------
it's not a first resort and so i would


---------54:08----------
say


---------54:09----------
just share that with them just say like


---------54:12----------
hey


---------54:12----------
i'm not in any immediate danger but this


---------54:14----------
is a very serious issue and i'm afraid


---------54:17----------
that you're gonna think i'm in immediate


---------54:18----------
danger just tell them


---------54:21----------
they'll be like okay cool thank you for


---------54:23----------
sharing that that's like one of the most


---------54:25----------
reassuring things that i can hear as a


---------54:27----------
psychiatrist oh great this patient is


---------54:29----------
taking this


---------54:30----------
seriously good


---------54:33----------
that means i can rely on them i can


---------54:35----------
trust them they respect the enemy that


---------54:37----------
they're


---------54:38----------
facing uh someone's asking why do you


---------54:40----------
not want to be a doctor for people that


---------54:41----------
you know


---------54:42----------
so being a doctor is about being


---------54:45----------
objective


---------54:46----------
right so what i want to do is like not


---------54:48----------
let my emotions


---------54:49----------
get in the way of like my clinical


---------54:51----------
training and when personal


---------54:53----------
relationships arise emotions and other


---------54:57----------
kinds of boundary issues arise that like


---------54:59----------
make it hard for me to actually


---------55:01----------
function as a competent doctor so there


---------55:04----------
have been numerous studies


---------55:06----------
done that show that physicians who


---------55:09----------
treat family members are more likely to


---------55:11----------
miss diagnoses


---------55:13----------
than like arando from the street


---------55:16----------
ah so what if your friend doesn't want


---------55:18----------
you to get them help how do you convince


---------55:20----------
them otherwise


---------55:21----------
that's a great question you don't


---------55:23----------
convince them otherwise


---------55:25----------
so this is sort of where like what i


---------55:26----------
would encourage you to do is like


---------55:28----------
instead of trying to convince them to


---------55:30----------
get help


---------55:31----------
ask them why they don't want help


---------55:34----------
so anytime


---------55:38----------
so anytime you have a disagreement with


---------55:40----------
someone


---------55:42----------
i think we try too hard in this society


---------55:44----------
to like


---------55:45----------
convince instead of understand and i


---------55:48----------
want you guys to just pay attention to


---------55:50----------
any argument like i


---------55:51----------
really wish i could so i i anyway i wish


---------55:55----------
i could share something with you but i


---------55:56----------
can't but


---------55:57----------
so like i want you guys to just pay


---------55:58----------
attention to any argument and like think


---------56:00----------
about the arguments in your life


---------56:01----------
where you try to convince someone and


---------56:03----------
they try to convince you


---------56:05----------
what happens like


---------56:08----------
it doesn't work whereas it's kind of


---------56:11----------
interesting because if you try to


---------56:13----------
understand


---------56:13----------
them they will automatically


---------56:16----------
empathically like their


---------56:18----------
some circuit in their brain will flip


---------56:20----------
where they will try to understand you


---------56:23----------
you know and and so it's kind of


---------56:25----------
interesting because i wouldn't try to


---------56:26----------
convince them


---------56:28----------
but i would still like state your


---------56:30----------
perspective and you can say like hey i


---------56:32----------
see you suffering


---------56:33----------
it hurts me to see you suffering i care


---------56:35----------
about you i think this would help


---------56:38----------
but if you don't want to like you know i


---------56:40----------
can't make you


---------56:42----------
can you help me understand why you don't


---------56:44----------
want help


---------56:46----------
because there may be something there


---------56:47----------
that needs to be addressed right so


---------56:48----------
someone else is asking


---------56:50----------
what if i'm afraid of my parents not


---------56:52----------
knowing or my parents knowing


---------56:54----------
so like there may be something like that


---------56:55----------
where they're like you know they have


---------56:56----------
some fear like they're afraid


---------56:58----------
that they're gonna be hospitalized or


---------56:59----------
they're afraid they're gonna you know


---------57:01----------
get kicked off of like whatever team


---------57:03----------
they're on or they're afraid that


---------57:04----------
um you know their parents will find out


---------57:08----------
and so then you can kind of like help


---------57:09----------
them work through that right like you


---------57:11----------
can be like okay so like what


---------57:12----------
you know what are you afraid of your


---------57:13----------
parents knowing what are you afraid of


---------57:15----------
in terms of reaction or do you think


---------57:17----------
that they're not going to be supportive


---------57:18----------
you think they're going to call you weak


---------57:19----------
you think they're going to punish you


---------57:20----------
for it


---------57:22----------
and then like you know then the


---------57:23----------
conversation sort of becomes like we can


---------57:25----------
maybe talk about you know parents who


---------57:26----------
are against mental health treatment at


---------57:28----------
some point


---------57:29----------
the conversation then becomes like you


---------57:30----------
know what's more important to you


---------57:32----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but like


---------57:34----------
you know when i work with


---------57:36----------
kids who whose parents aren't supportive


---------57:38----------
of mental health treatment


---------57:40----------
it's actually like really amazing to see


---------57:41----------
what happens because the kid actually


---------57:43----------
like


---------57:43----------
we work to the point where like they can


---------57:45----------
be strong about it and it's sort of like


---------57:47----------
my parents may react poorly and i can't


---------57:50----------
control that but that's on them


---------57:52----------
and i'm not going to let the opinions of


---------57:54----------
my parents


---------57:55----------
dictate the life that i lead and that's


---------57:59----------
hard like it's it requires a lot of like


---------58:01----------
internal fortitude and support from the


---------58:03----------
outside


---------58:04----------
to get to that point where you can let


---------58:07----------
your parents know and sometimes we'll


---------58:08----------
even coach people


---------58:10----------
into how how to have a conversation with


---------58:12----------
your parents so when you tell your


---------58:13----------
parents hey by the way like


---------58:15----------
i want to see a therapist they'll be


---------58:17----------
like


---------58:18----------
you don't need that and then like once


---------58:21----------
again


---------58:22----------
don't try to convince them right so


---------58:23----------
you're you ask the question you ask them


---------58:26----------
like


---------58:27----------
what do you think i'm feeling and what


---------58:29----------
do you think i need


---------58:32----------
and they'll be like you know


---------58:35----------
and just listen and be like okay i see


---------58:38----------
so you think i'm feeling unmotivated


---------58:42----------
because


---------58:44----------
i got a b


---------58:47----------
how would how would like how would that


---------58:50----------
like how would you


---------58:51----------
so you think that i don't need therapy


---------58:53----------
because you think


---------58:54----------
this is just a temporary part of


---------58:57----------
adolescence


---------58:59----------
if i were to tell you that what i'm


---------59:00----------
feeling is very different from your what


---------59:02----------
you're describing


---------59:04----------
if i'm feeling something that's very


---------59:05----------
different from what you think i'm


---------59:06----------
feeling


---------59:07----------
would that change your mind about


---------59:09----------
whether seeing a therapist is


---------59:10----------
appropriate or not


---------59:12----------
it's kind of like a weird question right


---------59:14----------
because they're like


---------59:17----------
it's kind of a weird question it's like


---------59:18----------
a hard question to answer because if


---------59:20----------
they say


---------59:20----------
and then you may even get to therapy


---------59:22----------
doesn't do anything


---------59:24----------
and then you can ask them like what's


---------59:25----------
your like help me understand why you


---------59:27----------
think therapy doesn't do anything what


---------59:28----------
do you base that on


---------59:29----------
where does that come from


---------59:33----------
and just have a conversation with your


---------59:35----------
parents and then like even i i've had


---------59:37----------
like you know people working with super


---------59:39----------
religious parents who will be like


---------59:40----------
you know you just need to go to church


---------59:41----------
more like like you know


---------59:44----------
mental weakness can be solved through


---------59:46----------
through god


---------59:48----------
so you can say like okay so what's your


---------59:50----------
understanding about like why


---------59:51----------
people like you know why the profession


---------59:53----------
of psychiatry exists and then the answer


---------59:55----------
can be something like well


---------59:56----------
it's because people have gotten away


---------59:58----------
from god


---------59:59----------
and then you can be like okay so


---------60:03----------
do you think that like seeing a


---------60:04----------
therapist necessarily means that i've


---------60:07----------
moved away from god


---------60:09----------
or can i do both like what do you think


---------60:10----------
about me trying it


---------60:12----------
and like just being open-minded and


---------60:14----------
seeing what the deal is


---------60:16----------
and oddly enough when you approach i've


---------60:19----------
approached


---------60:20----------
very religious parents in that way and


---------60:22----------
found them to be


---------60:24----------
you know like quite receptive it's


---------60:27----------
bizarre


---------60:29----------
you know and even as a psychiatrist like


---------60:31----------
sometimes like they'll come into my


---------60:32----------
office right and they'll be like


---------60:34----------
prepared to do battle and so you just


---------60:37----------
listen to them


---------60:39----------
you can be like yeah like i completely


---------60:40----------
agree would it surprise you guys


---------60:42----------
that i spent seven years training to


---------60:43----------
become a monk before i became a


---------60:45----------
psychiatrist


---------60:46----------
i actually agree with you that a lot of


---------60:48----------
the reason that's that mental health is


---------60:50----------
getting worse in this country


---------60:51----------
is because we've lost some element of


---------60:54----------
spirituality and


---------60:57----------
i think that like god puts out like


---------61:00----------
gives us like


---------61:01----------
a lot of options right like and so we


---------61:03----------
should use


---------61:04----------
everything at our disposal


---------61:08----------
it's crazy like they'll be like and i'm


---------61:10----------
like do you guys think i'm evil


---------61:12----------
you just ask him and they're like no you


---------61:15----------
seem like a nice guy and i'm like okay


---------61:17----------
so like how do you guys feel about your


---------61:18----------
son coming and seeing me once a week for


---------61:21----------
an hour


---------61:22----------
and we're just like going to talk about


---------61:24----------
stuff they're like


---------61:27----------
okay i'm like you guys can come


---------61:30----------
once a month too and let's just check in


---------61:33----------
like when you guys drop him off if you


---------61:34----------
guys have any concerns


---------61:36----------
you can let me know and they're like


---------61:39----------
okay like it's really strange but i i


---------61:42----------
think just


---------61:42----------
you know if you have someone who's


---------61:44----------
resistant to being convinced


---------61:46----------
don't try to convince them try to


---------61:48----------
understand them


---------61:50----------
right and try to find some common ground


---------61:53----------
like because it's there like just


---------61:56----------
because they don't want to see a


---------61:57----------
therapist for some reason


---------61:59----------
does not mean that you know they they


---------62:01----------
may they may


---------62:02----------
want to avoid therapy for a reason but


---------62:04----------
they may want therapy for another reason


---------62:07----------
so it's about sitting with them in that


---------62:08----------
space this is why it's kind of


---------62:10----------
interesting


---------62:11----------
that you know one of the outcomes we're


---------62:13----------
now measuring from our coaching program


---------62:15----------
is like how good our coaches are at


---------62:18----------
getting people into therapy


---------62:20----------
because a lot of people a lot of times


---------62:21----------
for whatever reason you all feel more


---------62:22----------
comfortable working with a coach than a


---------62:24----------
therapist


---------62:25----------
therapist will work with you for a


---------62:26----------
little while like asriel is a good


---------62:27----------
example if you guys caught that


---------62:28----------
interview he like


---------62:29----------
was in coaching for a little while like


---------62:31----------
went to therapy for a while and then


---------62:32----------
came back to coaching and he seems to be


---------62:33----------
doing way better


---------62:35----------
the two are complementary yeah so what


---------62:37----------
if you're dealing with someone who's


---------62:38----------
psychotic so the other thing that i


---------62:40----------
for the sake of completing this i really


---------62:41----------
should have included is if you think


---------62:43----------
that someone is at like imminent risk to


---------62:46----------
themselves


---------62:48----------
it's absolutely appropriate to call


---------62:49----------
whatever emergency services


---------62:52----------
nine one one one one two like if you


---------62:53----------
think someone is like actually gonna


---------62:55----------
hurt themselves y'all should absolutely


---------62:56----------
just


---------62:57----------
call 9-1-1 or whatever the emergency


---------62:59----------
services


---------63:01----------
um and


---------63:04----------
and like you know because


---------63:07----------
like if someone someone asked a question


---------63:08----------
like what if someone is psychotic like


---------63:10----------
if someone is high on drugs or psychotic


---------63:11----------
and like


---------63:12----------
or something like that like you should


---------63:13----------
just call an ambulance


---------63:16----------
and get that person to an emergency room


---------63:18----------
because that's what


---------63:19----------
the doctors in the emergency room are


---------63:21----------
there for which is you know most of my


---------63:23----------
bread and butter when i work overnight


---------63:25----------
shifts in the ed


---------63:26----------
and it's really fantastic like i'm so


---------63:28----------
glad that you know someone picked up the


---------63:30----------
phone and like


---------63:30----------
made a phone call because they're going


---------63:33----------
to come i mean there's a decent chance


---------63:34----------
they're going to wind up in the


---------63:35----------
emergency room either way


---------63:37----------
and it's just going to be like you know


---------63:38----------
if their friend called


---------63:40----------
then we've got a good shot at saving


---------63:42----------
this person's life and


---------63:44----------
if no one calls then we have less of a


---------63:46----------
shot at saving this person's life


---------63:49----------
and i can also say that you know i would


---------63:51----------
say


---------63:52----------
90 percent of people that get


---------63:54----------
hospitalized


---------63:55----------
are grateful that they were hospitalized


---------63:57----------
when they leave in my experience


---------64:00----------
i wish it was 99 but honestly it's 90.


---------64:05----------
10 of people really dislike it yeah so


---------64:07----------
someone's saying i feel like i'm where


---------64:09----------
reckful was that they died i don't know


---------64:11----------
where to go


---------64:11----------
seriously dude i'd pick up a dude or


---------64:14----------
woman or


---------64:15----------
you know whatever you identify as i i'd


---------64:16----------
pick up the phone and i'd call 9-1-1


---------64:19----------
if you guys are where he was you'd pick


---------64:22----------
up the phone call


---------64:23----------
seriously that's like that's the only


---------64:25----------
answer if you're aware he was
