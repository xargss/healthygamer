---------00:05----------
face but they'll let the rest of the


---------00:06----------
world know


---------00:07----------

---------00:14----------
opposite

---------00:31----------

---------00:33----------

---------00:34----------
we just do yeah and what is that


---------00:38----------
circular thing in in that


---------00:42----------
it's the cat portal to the cat world i'm


---------00:44----------
just kidding it's a cat wheel


---------00:46----------
so it is a cat portal to a captain yeah


---------00:48----------
yeah pretty much wait


---------00:49----------
what does that mean it's a cat wheel oh


---------00:52----------
it's like


---------00:53----------
like like a hamster wheel for cats is


---------00:55----------
that that's the best but do they


---------00:57----------
actually run on it


---------00:58----------
yes yes you just train yeah you train


---------01:02----------
them to kind of like


---------01:03----------
get used to getting on it and one of my


---------01:06----------
cats who's a siamese cat he loves like


---------01:08----------
going on it randomly throughout the day


---------01:10----------
yeah it just goes out on his own just


---------01:12----------
goes on a run


---------01:13----------
interesting cool and um and and so what


---------01:16----------
do you go by


---------01:17----------
do you want to uh you could just call me


---------01:19----------
wendy it's okay


---------01:20----------
yeah welcome wendy i'm all over


---------01:24----------
you know sometimes people call me dr k


---------01:26----------
whatever you feel comfortable with


---------01:28----------
um and so is there something um that


---------01:31----------
that you wanted to talk about today or


---------01:33----------
or any way that maybe we can be of help


---------01:35----------
to you


---------01:36----------
uh so i've been wanting to kind of like


---------01:40----------
tackle the feeling of i guess i don't


---------01:43----------
know if i really i guess it is anxiety


---------01:45----------
and i guess i'm not entirely sure what


---------01:47----------
it might be but it's it's more like um


---------01:51----------
i guess i stream a lot uh and


---------01:54----------
i've gone weeks where like i stream


---------01:56----------
maybe like 12 hours every single day


---------01:59----------
and with like with little breaks


---------02:02----------
and i find that when i do like i know i


---------02:04----------
need breaks and


---------02:06----------
uh when i take them i end up feeling


---------02:08----------
like crap the whole day that i take a


---------02:10----------
day off


---------02:11----------
okay yeah so it's just i guess uh


---------02:15----------
i just want to talk about like why i


---------02:17----------
might feel like crap


---------02:19----------
every time i try to rest okay


---------02:22----------
um okay


---------02:25----------
so first of all i applaud your


---------02:29----------
instinct to not just call it anxiety


---------02:32----------
yeah i'm not entirely sure it might be


---------02:35----------
but like yeah


---------02:36----------
so i i think that that's um i'm really i


---------02:39----------
think that's a great way to start off


---------02:40----------
because a lot of times like you know


---------02:42----------
people will say oh i have anxiety


---------02:44----------
and it's unclear like what that means


---------02:47----------
right like what is what does that mean


---------02:51----------
and so i find that the more that we can


---------02:53----------
like use


---------02:54----------
a specific like the more that we use


---------02:57----------
like raw data to describe our


---------02:58----------
experiences the better off we're going


---------03:00----------
to be


---------03:01----------
like actually getting to the source of


---------03:02----------
it so let's dive right in i think that's


---------03:04----------
a fantastic thing to talk about


---------03:06----------
so tell me um help me understand


---------03:11----------
hold on let me think for a second do we


---------03:13----------
want to jump right in or do i want to


---------03:14----------
ask you about your background


---------03:18----------
okay let's jump right in and then i'll


---------03:19----------
ask you about your background a little


---------03:20----------
bit later okay


---------03:22----------
so tell me so first tell me help me


---------03:23----------
understand like what goes through your


---------03:25----------
head when you stream like 12 hours a day


---------03:27----------
for like six or seven days a week


---------03:30----------
i guess well generally it's because


---------03:34----------
whatever i'm doing my


---------03:35----------
is just really fun like whether it's


---------03:37----------
like the new game that i've really like


---------03:39----------
dove into


---------03:40----------
or like just spending time with


---------03:43----------
uh friends who are also playing the same


---------03:45----------
game i think we kind of just like


---------03:47----------
we give each other that momentum to kind


---------03:50----------
of keep like creating content and like


---------03:52----------
you know it's in general it's really fun


---------03:54----------
okay sometimes i just forget the time um


---------03:57----------
okay


---------03:59----------
and then sometimes i just i just feel


---------04:02----------
like


---------04:02----------
i don't stream long enough there's like


---------04:05----------
this


---------04:06----------
there's this part of me where my norm is


---------04:08----------
like to stream


---------04:09----------
six to eight hours and i consider that


---------04:11----------
on the shorter side of things


---------04:14----------
but i know like when i compare to my


---------04:15----------
peers a lot of them stream maybe like


---------04:19----------
four to six which is their normal but


---------04:21----------
then for me it's like


---------04:23----------
much higher in hours um and i feel like


---------04:26----------
if i don't


---------04:27----------
hit that number for myself i feel like


---------04:31----------
i'm slacking yeah okay


---------04:34----------
okay so tell me about that so like


---------04:37----------
you're streaming six


---------04:38----------
eight hours and then you kind of feel


---------04:40----------
like it's not enough


---------04:42----------
and that you're slacking can you um


---------04:45----------
help me understand a little bit about


---------04:46----------
like what's going on in your mind like


---------04:48----------
what does his thoughts look like or what


---------04:50----------
do those feelings look like


---------04:53----------
um i guess like


---------04:59----------
i don't i don't i i feel i guess


---------05:02----------
personally i feel


---------05:03----------
better or like i feel more fulfilled


---------05:06----------
when i've streamed longer


---------05:07----------
than if i stream like for like two three


---------05:09----------
hours i'll be like oh it's like i didn't


---------05:11----------
work at all


---------05:12----------
you know okay just yeah i just it just


---------05:14----------
feels like i didn't do anything


---------05:17----------
sure so like the length of it kind of


---------05:20----------
matters to me and um how do you know


---------05:24----------
when you've streamed enough


---------05:28----------
when i get tired i guess that's like


---------05:32----------
one of one of the biggest indicators i


---------05:35----------
just feel


---------05:36----------
physically tired okay yeah


---------05:39----------
so it looks like unless you're


---------05:42----------
physically tired


---------05:44----------
you haven't streamed enough


---------05:48----------
i guess yeah right it's kind of weird


---------05:51----------
so let me just let me lay something out


---------05:53----------
and see if this kind of


---------05:54----------
sits well with you or not so like six to


---------05:57----------
eight hours roll by


---------05:58----------
you've been streaming and you're like oh


---------06:00----------
like i know most streamers stream four


---------06:02----------
to six


---------06:03----------
i've streamed six to eight on paper that


---------06:06----------
seems like it should be decent but it


---------06:08----------
doesn't feel enough


---------06:10----------
and i haven't done a good job unless i'm


---------06:13----------
physically exhausted


---------06:17----------
i guess yeah it sounds bad but yeah


---------06:21----------
i guess that is what it is right yeah


---------06:24----------
okay so so let's just pause for a second


---------06:27----------
i know sometimes i'm going to use words


---------06:29----------
wendy that are um


---------06:30----------
purposely inflated right so like you use


---------06:34----------
the word


---------06:34----------
tired and i said physically exhausted


---------06:36----------
which is like i'm amplifying the word


---------06:38----------
that you're using


---------06:39----------
right but i'm sort of really noticing


---------06:41----------
that like you know it's i'm guessing


---------06:42----------
it's actually not


---------06:43----------
tired like i'm guessing that you have to


---------06:46----------
really


---------06:47----------
feel the physical tiredness and if you


---------06:49----------
think about like you know you could work


---------06:51----------
a full day like let's say an eight-hour


---------06:52----------
day and


---------06:53----------
you're still you don't feel like tired


---------06:55----------
tired even though you kind of are


---------06:56----------
tired right that's a sufficient day like


---------06:59----------
if you want to really feel that


---------07:01----------
ache in your bones kind of tired which


---------07:03----------
is like how your


---------07:04----------
how your body is sending signals to your


---------07:06----------
mind and saying like hey


---------07:08----------
we can't do any more and then your mind


---------07:10----------
is like


---------07:12----------
good job wendy yeah right


---------07:16----------
it's like that's satisfying i mean you


---------07:18----------
use the word fulfilling


---------07:20----------
and and and so that's you know it's


---------07:22----------
interesting so we'll get into that


---------07:24----------
um so the first thing that i kind of


---------07:26----------
want to point out to you is that it


---------07:27----------
seems that like


---------07:30----------
you set a bar for yourself and the way


---------07:32----------
to meet that bar is physical exhaustion


---------07:35----------
yes okay and so


---------07:38----------
um okay hold on let me let me just think


---------07:46----------
okay


---------07:50----------
okay


---------07:54----------
and now tell me about what happens when


---------07:55----------
you take a day off


---------07:58----------
um i guess like i'm just as much as a


---------08:02----------
consumer like any other


---------08:03----------
twitch viewer so i watch a lot of like


---------08:05----------
my friends um watch


---------08:07----------
watch a lot of just other streams i end


---------08:10----------
up feeling like


---------08:12----------
i think at the end of the day i just end


---------08:13----------
up feeling like i should have streamed


---------08:15----------
today


---------08:16----------
okay tell me about that um


---------08:20----------
i don't know i guess i just i just see


---------08:23----------
them and i'm just like


---------08:25----------
oh i i could have also been you know


---------08:28----------
streaming i could have also been like


---------08:30----------
doing this


---------08:31----------
but instead i'm just feeling like i'm


---------08:34----------
sitting here not doing a whole lot


---------08:36----------
which is just relaxing mostly or like


---------08:40----------
sleeping in or watching dramas or


---------08:44----------
something


---------08:44----------
yeah okay it doesn't feel entirely


---------08:46----------
productive


---------08:48----------
and i am aware that i do need to rest


---------08:50----------
and stuff


---------08:51----------
but i just i just feel like crap when


---------08:53----------
i'm not working


---------08:57----------
okay okay so i'm gonna


---------09:00----------
do this thing where you know once again


---------09:02----------
i'm gonna kind of send words back at you


---------09:05----------
and it's gonna sound a little bit


---------09:07----------
extreme okay okay


---------09:08----------
so so it feels like you know when you're


---------09:10----------
relaxing you're not doing anything


---------09:13----------
like you should have done this you could


---------09:15----------
have done this on paper like there's


---------09:17----------
some part of your mind that's like


---------09:20----------
you know i should rest from time to time


---------09:22----------
like i should do things for recreation


---------09:25----------
and then there's another part of you


---------09:26----------
that like it's a waste of time wendy


---------09:29----------
no recreation for you yeah recreation


---------09:32----------
and it's also like like if you think


---------09:33----------
about it you


---------09:34----------
feel like uncomfortable relaxing


---------09:39----------
yes um i mean i would even go as far as


---------09:42----------
to say it's stressful to relax


---------09:46----------
kind of i think like sometimes there are


---------09:49----------
times where i'm like


---------09:50----------
this is nice you know what i mean but


---------09:52----------
then at the end i just


---------09:54----------
i just remember like at the end of every


---------09:56----------
night i just feel like


---------09:58----------
i end up always debating on the day that


---------10:01----------
i rest


---------10:01----------
that i should just turn on my stream i


---------10:04----------
was just like


---------10:05----------
if i'm gonna be gaming i'll just i


---------10:08----------
should just turn on my stream you know


---------10:09----------
what i mean like


---------10:10----------
why am i not like why am i gaming yeah i


---------10:13----------
might as well


---------10:14----------
might as well be productive yeah yeah i


---------10:16----------
guess that's the thought that goes


---------10:17----------
through my mind


---------10:18----------
okay a lot


---------10:19----------
[Music]


---------10:22----------
questions anything that you want to


---------10:25----------
mention or anything that's popped into


---------10:26----------
your head


---------10:27----------
because i'm about to shift gears unless


---------10:29----------
that's why i ask sorry oh


---------10:32----------
no not at the moment so let me ask you


---------10:34----------
something


---------10:35----------
i'm getting the sense so i'm gonna toss


---------10:38----------
out two words that i think may be like


---------10:40----------
a way to describe what you go through


---------10:42----------
like the negative


---------10:44----------
stuff in your mind is not enough so six


---------10:47----------
to eight hours is not enough like


---------10:49----------
on a on day that you didn't stream


---------10:52----------
that's not enough right like it's it's


---------10:55----------
sort of like it feels unsatisfying to


---------10:57----------
you so you use the word fulfilling when


---------10:59----------
you're like kind of like


---------11:00----------
bone tired and and that's like that's


---------11:03----------
enough that's how you know it's enough


---------11:05----------
so so what i'm hearing you kind of say


---------11:07----------
is that you like kind of are in a


---------11:09----------
struggle with yourself


---------11:10----------
about like getting to enough and unless


---------11:14----------
you get to enough


---------11:15----------
you're kind of like it's not enough


---------11:19----------
yeah okay so let me ask you something


---------11:21----------
how long have you


---------11:23----------
felt that way um


---------11:34----------
a long time i don't know it's it's been


---------11:37----------
a long time like


---------11:38----------
yep yeah like years i would say yep


---------11:41----------
before you started streaming


---------11:47----------
i guess it was it started


---------11:50----------
maybe like a year or two after i started


---------11:52----------
streaming i've been streaming for almost


---------11:54----------
eight years


---------11:55----------
okay so it's been a long time so can you


---------11:58----------
tell me a little bit about


---------11:59----------
um kind of like what your what growing


---------12:01----------
up was like for you


---------12:04----------
uh growing up i mean


---------12:08----------
it was it was good i i did a lot of


---------12:11----------
music growing up


---------12:12----------
okay um it was like one of those


---------12:14----------
stereotypical situations where like


---------12:16----------
my chinese parents kind of like made me


---------12:18----------
go do piano lessons


---------12:20----------
and uh i ended up


---------12:24----------
being pretty okay at it so i ended up


---------12:26----------
pursuing it for my entire life


---------12:29----------
and uh yeah i went to like music


---------12:31----------
conservatory during the weekends after


---------12:33----------
like


---------12:34----------
school regular school so i had like two


---------12:36----------
schools basically


---------12:38----------
um and then and yeah i don't know i


---------12:41----------
don't know what else to say about it it


---------12:43----------
was just like a lot of


---------12:44----------
uh i mean it was nice


---------12:48----------
just cause i can't i'm not so you're


---------12:51----------
you're telling


---------12:52----------
me wendy that you went to


---------12:55----------
music conservatory after school and you


---------12:57----------
were


---------12:58----------
pretty okay at it


---------13:04----------
pretty pretty okay at it okay


---------13:09----------
who would you say is good at piano


---------13:13----------
would you say you're good at piano i


---------13:16----------
think i'm okay


---------13:17----------
yeah is okay different from good um


---------13:21----------
uh i mean i don't i would just consider


---------13:24----------
people who are good you know people who


---------13:26----------
are doing it professionally you know who


---------13:27----------
people who are like concert pianists


---------13:30----------
people who are performing


---------13:31----------
you know who do it as an occupation okay


---------13:36----------
yeah interesting okay so do you remember


---------13:38----------
like what so it sounds like you're


---------13:40----------
chinese yes and um what part of the


---------13:43----------
world did you grow up in if you don't


---------13:45----------
mind me asking


---------13:46----------
i'm born and raised in canada okay yeah


---------13:49----------
and um and so what was it like like


---------13:52----------
siblings i have one older sibling he's


---------13:55----------
my brother


---------13:56----------
yeah okay and can you tell me a little


---------13:59----------
bit about your parents


---------14:01----------
um they


---------14:04----------
moved here uh when i was born


---------14:08----------
because there was like the one child law


---------14:10----------
in china so


---------14:11----------
they had my brother they moved here um


---------14:14----------
and they worked a lot of just like odd


---------14:16----------
jobs because they weren't like super


---------14:17----------
educated um


---------14:19----------
they just graduated high school so they


---------14:21----------
worked a lot of like different odd jobs


---------14:24----------
and uh they used to


---------14:27----------
have like a convenience store and stuff


---------14:29----------
and then afterwards like you know just a


---------14:30----------
lot of different odd jobs like security


---------14:32----------
jobs and like


---------14:33----------
you know things and things like that um


---------14:38----------
yeah like they


---------14:41----------
and what was it like kind of what can


---------14:43----------
you tell me a little bit about like


---------14:45----------
what life at home was like


---------14:50----------
it was honestly like it was just


---------14:54----------
very normal feeling to me um i remember


---------14:59----------
actually my parents cared a lot more


---------15:00----------
about how i did in piano than i did in


---------15:02----------
regular school


---------15:03----------
which was really funny because i


---------15:06----------
remember


---------15:06----------
like i used to get like 80s which is not


---------15:09----------
that great you know compared to like


---------15:12----------
what other people might expect you know


---------15:14----------
you want like 90s and stuff but


---------15:16----------
they didn't really care whether i got


---------15:18----------
80s or 90s


---------15:19----------
they cared whether i practiced piano or


---------15:21----------
not


---------15:22----------
and what was it like how did it feel


---------15:27----------
when would they be satisfied with how


---------15:29----------
much you practiced


---------15:34----------
like do you remember any days where like


---------15:37----------
they were upset with you


---------15:38----------
or or maybe you didn't want to practice


---------15:41----------
and they were like they really wanted


---------15:42----------
you to practice


---------15:47----------
um sorry i don't know why i'm feeling


---------15:52----------
emotional anyways um pause


---------15:56----------
don't answer my question what are you


---------16:06----------
feeling


---------16:14----------
just add


---------16:23----------
i think like thinking about this topic


---------16:25----------
makes me feel like


---------16:27----------
just bad in general but i also feel like


---------16:30----------
i need to talk about it so


---------16:33----------
yeah so let's set a couple of boundaries


---------16:36----------
right so the first thing is that


---------16:39----------
should you talk about it at some point


---------16:41----------
probably


---------16:42----------
it doesn't have to be here it doesn't


---------16:44----------
have to be now it doesn't have to be


---------16:46----------
public


---------16:47----------
right so if at some point you get to a


---------16:49----------
point where you don't really feel


---------16:50----------
comfortable talking about it like we can


---------16:52----------
just pause


---------16:54----------
and watch cat videos together


---------16:58----------
and and at the same time i think it is


---------17:00----------
important and i think there's a reason


---------17:02----------
why we're talking about


---------17:03----------
it so when you when we start to talk


---------17:08----------
about it what about this makes you feel


---------17:10----------
bad


---------17:14----------
i think it's just


---------17:18----------
i never feel like it's enough


---------17:25----------
at least for myself


---------17:30----------
yeah yeah


---------17:34----------
and so you know just to kind of lay this


---------17:38----------
out when i ask you about practicing


---------17:40----------
piano and your your parents being


---------17:42----------
satisfied


---------17:45----------
i'm guessing that they sort of made you


---------17:47----------
feel like it wasn't enough


---------17:52----------
yeah i think i think it was always like


---------17:57----------
like you know you need to practice more


---------17:59----------
you need to practice more


---------18:01----------
and it was it was the same throughout


---------18:04----------
like


---------18:04----------
ever like my whole entire life i guess


---------18:07----------
it wasn't only my parents but like my


---------18:09----------
teachers my professors because i ended


---------18:11----------
up doing it in university too


---------18:13----------
because i have a degree in piano so it


---------18:16----------
was it was always like


---------18:17----------
are you not practicing like four to six


---------18:20----------
hours a day of piano you know it was


---------18:22----------
like it was always like that


---------18:25----------
did you feel like you had to practice


---------18:27----------
more than


---------18:28----------
other people who were more talented than


---------18:31----------
you were


---------18:33----------
um sometimes i think there's just like


---------18:37----------
there was like a bot like a average


---------18:39----------
amount that everybody should have been


---------18:41----------
practicing regardless


---------18:43----------
and then obviously you know there are


---------18:45----------
some peers who are better than me


---------18:47----------
and so you know you have to make up for


---------18:49----------
it with hard work


---------18:50----------
yep that's just natural right especially


---------18:53----------
with something like


---------18:54----------
piano where it's very it's very just


---------18:57----------
you know a lot of practice a lot of like


---------18:59----------
motor memory and like physical


---------19:01----------
like you know technique stuff like that


---------19:05----------
do you um so i'm gonna ask like


---------19:08----------
for specific memories now okay so like


---------19:11----------
do you remember particular times growing


---------19:13----------
up where


---------19:14----------
can you just tell us a story about like


---------19:17----------
you know


---------19:18----------
whether your parents were okay with you


---------19:19----------
getting 80s or wanting you to practice


---------19:22----------
like does stuff come to mind do you have


---------19:23----------
any like strong memories around


---------19:26----------
things there it doesn't have to be good


---------19:27----------
because it was like a really short


---------19:29----------
memory i guess yeah but it was pretty


---------19:32----------
it's uh


---------19:33----------
something that i can recall very clearly


---------19:37----------
um


---------19:38----------
there's uh the one day i came back home


---------19:40----------
from school during high school


---------19:42----------
and you know i take out that brown


---------19:44----------
envelope that has you know my grades in


---------19:46----------
it i take it out


---------19:47----------
and then i was like hey mom and dad like


---------19:50----------
oh i got a 90 in this or like i got an


---------19:52----------
85 and this


---------19:53----------
and they're like okay go practice piano


---------19:58----------
you know it was like they really didn't


---------19:59----------
care about my grades


---------20:01----------
because i guess they knew that i they


---------20:03----------
kind of knew like


---------20:05----------
what my grades generally were all the


---------20:07----------
time and they just didn't really care


---------20:09----------
about that


---------20:10----------
they just wanted me to practice piano


---------20:13----------
and did you care about your grades


---------20:17----------
i i did for the most part but i i


---------20:20----------
remember that


---------20:22----------
like i was just one of those students


---------20:24----------
where i felt like i didn't need to do


---------20:26----------
too much but just enough in school


---------20:29----------
to get like my 80s and then i would just


---------20:32----------
go practice piano but i also remember


---------20:35----------
there was like a point in my life where


---------20:36----------
i was just like


---------20:37----------
i don't want to practice anything


---------20:38----------
anymore so i just started gaming


---------20:40----------
that's that's when i started gaming


---------20:42----------
actually


---------20:44----------
yeah and do you remember how you felt


---------20:47----------
like tell me more about the feeling of i


---------20:49----------
don't want to practice anymore


---------20:53----------
it was just i don't i think i was just


---------20:55----------
going through like you know


---------20:57----------
the rebellious phase where the my


---------20:59----------
parents were like do this


---------21:01----------
no kind of thing um


---------21:04----------
i just got really sick and tired of


---------21:06----------
listening to them


---------21:08----------
so that i just i was just like i'm not


---------21:10----------
and i i remember distinctively telling


---------21:12----------
them like the more you tell me the


---------21:13----------
practice the more i'm not gonna practice


---------21:15----------
i said those exact words to them


---------21:17----------
and how did they respond they just got


---------21:20----------
mad i mean


---------21:21----------
they used to like you know they they


---------21:24----------
never did any like


---------21:25----------
like physical beating or whatever it was


---------21:27----------
all just a lot of yelling


---------21:28----------
you know just a lot of like why don't


---------21:30----------
you do this or like do this


---------21:32----------
you know go do this yeah


---------21:36----------
what was what was it like to be to hear


---------21:38----------
them yelling at you


---------21:42----------
i think after some point i just kind of


---------21:45----------
let it go in one ear and out the other


---------21:49----------
uh yeah i


---------21:54----------
i don't know when it's when it mattered


---------21:57----------
or when it stopped mattering i just


---------21:59----------
remembered


---------22:00----------
i learned to like just cope with it


---------22:03----------
because i was just like there's no point


---------22:04----------
in


---------22:05----------
talking back i just i'll just


---------22:08----------
let them you know yell and then


---------22:10----------
afterwards it's whatever


---------22:12----------
i'll just do what i want


---------22:17----------
can i think for a second yeah


---------22:21----------
there's a lot here wendy okay


---------22:26----------
much of it is very sad


---------22:30----------
um


---------22:36----------
were your parents proud of you


---------22:44----------
i think a lot of the times


---------22:49----------
there were like there they were but i


---------22:51----------
don't think i've ever heard them say it


---------22:53----------
until like recent years


---------22:59----------
yeah that's good took the next question


---------23:01----------
out of my mouth which was sort of


---------23:03----------
you know if they were proud how would


---------23:05----------
you have known


---------23:13----------
i guess it was just a okay this


---------23:17----------
i guess it's really arbitrary but i


---------23:18----------
guess it's just a feeling


---------23:20----------
it's just maybe sometimes like


---------23:23----------
oh i know the way they talk about me to


---------23:26----------
relatives


---------23:26----------
[Laughter]


---------23:31----------
yeah that's that's that's a really you


---------23:33----------
know obvious one


---------23:35----------
when they you know brag about you or


---------23:37----------
whatever you know that's something that


---------23:39----------
they


---------23:40----------
they could do or would do or to friends


---------23:42----------
or whatever yeah


---------23:45----------
so i'm about to make a couple of


---------23:46----------
stereotypical statements about east


---------23:48----------
asian and south asian culture


---------23:50----------
i know it applies also to like nigerian


---------23:52----------
culture


---------23:53----------
yeah can apply to all kinds of cultures


---------23:55----------
but you know i tend to hear this a lot


---------23:57----------
from people who are


---------23:59----------
asian um and it's sort of like


---------24:03----------
you know they'll never tell you they're


---------24:05----------
proud of you to your face but they'll


---------24:07----------
let the rest of the world know


---------24:09----------
yeah yeah and it's kind of weird because


---------24:11----------
like they not only do they not tell you


---------24:13----------
to your face they actually tell you the


---------24:15----------
opposite


---------24:17----------
yes right they're like you need to do


---------24:20----------
more


---------24:21----------
it's not enough you need to practice


---------24:23----------
more


---------24:24----------
and then as soon as they're done yelling


---------24:26----------
at you to practice more they're on the


---------24:27----------
phone with their brother


---------24:29----------
back in the home country talking about


---------24:30----------
how awesome you are


---------24:33----------
and then as soon as they get off the


---------24:34----------
phone they hear you're not practicing


---------24:36----------
and they come into your room they're


---------24:37----------
like [ __ ] you


---------24:38----------
practice it's kind of weird right


---------24:46----------
it's it's interesting because like when


---------24:48----------
i look back


---------24:49----------
on it now i know that they didn't


---------24:52----------
mean harm yeah and like


---------24:56----------
they very much love me and support


---------24:58----------
everything that i do right now


---------25:00----------
and i think my dad especially


---------25:04----------
has always understood


---------25:08----------
because um another i guess another


---------25:11----------
distinctive moment


---------25:13----------
in my life was uh after graduating


---------25:17----------
my bachelor's i i was expected


---------25:21----------
by like my professor and my parents to


---------25:24----------
go into my master's degree


---------25:26----------
for piano as well and i just remembered


---------25:28----------
telling them like


---------25:30----------
i can't i just can't do this


---------25:33----------
it's like i my love for piano


---------25:36----------
was there but i felt like the


---------25:38----------
competition and like just the amount of


---------25:41----------
work


---------25:41----------
that i had to put in every single day


---------25:43----------
was just too overbearing for me


---------25:46----------
so i told him i couldn't do my master's


---------25:47----------
degree anymore and


---------25:49----------
i remember my dad telling me that


---------25:52----------
he's like you don't have to i just want


---------25:56----------
you to be happy


---------26:01----------
yeah and that broke me because i guess


---------26:06----------
my entire life like i felt like there


---------26:08----------
was a lot of expectation


---------26:11----------
but like he told me it was okay if i


---------26:15----------
didn't do it


---------26:17----------
as long as i was happy so that was like


---------26:20----------
really


---------26:20----------
relieving to hear yeah why did you use


---------26:24----------
the word break


---------26:30----------
um i guess well half of it is like i


---------26:33----------
broke into tears telling them that but


---------26:35----------
um or


---------26:37----------
hearing that uh


---------26:42----------
i don't know it's just


---------26:46----------
it was against my expectation of what i


---------26:48----------
thought they would


---------26:49----------
like say i thought they would say


---------26:51----------
something completely different


---------26:53----------
and so but my dad end up saying


---------26:55----------
something like


---------26:56----------
completely out of my imagination yeah


---------27:00----------
so what do you think it broke


---------27:03----------
my expectations which were what


---------27:07----------
that they would say like no you should


---------27:10----------
do it


---------27:10----------
or like no you should continue to pursue


---------27:13----------
that degree


---------27:14----------
or like no you should still like listen


---------27:16----------
to us


---------27:19----------
yeah so i'm gonna


---------27:22----------
dive in there okay so we're gonna put


---------27:24----------
some words to it that may be painful to


---------27:27----------
say but like


---------27:28----------
so that was what you were expecting them


---------27:31----------
to say


---------27:32----------
yeah but what would what were what did


---------27:35----------
you expect them to


---------27:36----------
think about you like what would be their


---------27:39----------
idea of you


---------27:41----------
behind those words


---------27:46----------
um


---------27:49----------
i mean i was mostly afraid of what


---------27:53----------
of you know being a failure


---------27:56----------
and of sorts you know or like um


---------28:02----------
wasting or seemingly wasting like


---------28:06----------
time and money because they spent a lot


---------28:08----------
of that


---------28:09----------
on me and and like owning my skills


---------28:12----------
yep so for me to not go into it


---------28:16----------
later is


---------28:21----------
i feel like it's kind of like


---------28:27----------
oh just it just feels like i wasted it


---------28:30----------
in a way


---------28:31----------
yeah what i'm kind of hearing is


---------28:34----------
um you know that they


---------28:38----------
invested a lot in you and you kind of


---------28:40----------
washed out


---------28:42----------
and that you weren't good enough to cut


---------28:44----------
it


---------28:48----------
i can't say i wasn't good enough it was


---------28:51----------
just


---------28:52----------
i couldn't bring myself to put that


---------28:54----------
effort in there anymore


---------28:56----------
um yeah i think i think


---------29:00----------
i've always been able to rise up to many


---------29:04----------
occasions and like


---------29:05----------
you know like jump over a lot of hurdles


---------29:07----------
if i really wanted to


---------29:10----------
but i just i was so tired of it


---------29:13----------
yeah it was just like really really


---------29:17----------
really really stressful for me


---------29:23----------
i'm gonna just sit for a second okay


---------29:27----------
i'm gonna just like feel some emotions


---------29:29----------
because i felt a little bit broken too


---------29:34----------
um let me ask you something how often do


---------29:37----------
you talk to your parents


---------29:40----------
a lot actually um i would say like every


---------29:43----------
two three days


---------29:44----------
yeah do you talk to them on your day off


---------29:47----------
yes i what do you guys talk about


---------29:51----------
um it's not like we don't talk too much


---------29:55----------
it's mostly just like oh how are you


---------29:56----------
guys doing you know like


---------29:58----------
um you know how well my mom's


---------30:01----------
um health is not super great like she


---------30:04----------
has a lot of arthritis and it's like


---------30:06----------
always plaguing her so i ask about that


---------30:09----------
um ask about what my dad's up to


---------30:13----------
what they do like recreationally because


---------30:15----------
they're both retired


---------30:18----------
um and then i just yeah just mostly


---------30:21----------
about how they're doing


---------30:23----------
and sometimes like small little things


---------30:25----------
like if i need to help with


---------30:27----------
translations or like doctor visits and


---------30:29----------
stuff like that


---------30:30----------
yeah okay


---------30:35----------
so i have a suggestion for you uh-huh


---------30:38----------
the next time you take a day off and you


---------30:40----------
feel like you're not doing enough


---------30:44----------
i think you should talk to your dad


---------30:47----------
and tell him i'm taking a day off and i


---------30:50----------
feel like


---------30:50----------
i'm not doing enough


---------30:54----------
and tell him what your week has been


---------30:55----------
like


---------31:00----------
it's funny because my dad tells me to


---------31:03----------
rest


---------31:04----------
a lot like he's literally the person who


---------31:07----------
goes like


---------31:09----------
because he actually i i showed him my


---------31:11----------
stream link this year


---------31:12----------
and uh so he started watching my stream


---------31:15----------
a lot


---------31:16----------
he says like he watches my stream like


---------31:18----------
whenever he has a chance to


---------31:20----------
even even if it's like during dinner or


---------31:22----------
something he just turns it on the laptop


---------31:26----------
and there's uh i think it was a couple


---------31:29----------
weeks ago i did like a 24 hour stream


---------31:31----------
and i didn't tell him i was doing a


---------31:32----------
24-hour stream but then


---------31:34----------
he calls me later like a few days later


---------31:36----------
he's just like


---------31:37----------
you know you can't really catch up on


---------31:39----------
the amount of hours you're going to lose


---------31:40----------
in sleep you know and but he didn't you


---------31:42----------
didn't i didn't tell him anything about


---------31:44----------
a 24-hour stream he just knew from like


---------31:45----------
looking at a vaude or something


---------31:48----------
um so yeah it's funny because he tells


---------31:50----------
me to rest a lot he goes like no matter


---------31:52----------
how much money you're making like


---------31:54----------
make sure you sleep make sure you rest


---------31:55----------
make sure you exercise


---------31:57----------
you know and he doesn't tell me to work


---------32:01----------
hard


---------32:01----------
because he knows i do


---------32:06----------
how does it feel to not hear him say


---------32:08----------
that


---------32:10----------
for him to tell you to rest and take


---------32:12----------
care of yourself


---------32:16----------
i mean it's it's nice like i


---------32:19----------
i really appreciate my dad telling me to


---------32:22----------
rest


---------32:24----------
and like i i guess it does


---------32:27----------
come up in the back of my mind i i guess


---------32:29----------
he's like


---------32:31----------
a big factor in why i feel like i should


---------32:33----------
rest


---------32:35----------
good so i think um what we've got to do


---------32:38----------
what does it feel like to have him watch


---------32:41----------
your stream


---------32:43----------
while he's eating it's it's funny i just


---------32:47----------
i think it's i think i just think it's


---------32:48----------
like endearing it's nice


---------32:52----------
sounds like he's proud of you


---------32:56----------
yeah it's weird because i i told you in


---------32:59----------
the past few years


---------33:01----------
it's the first time like he's told me


---------33:03----------
that


---------33:04----------
he's proud of me or that he loves me and


---------33:06----------
stuff


---------33:08----------
yeah it was weird like hearing him in a


---------33:10----------
voice message say like


---------33:11----------
i love you and i was like what the heck


---------33:14----------
i was like where did this come from


---------33:16----------
you know but he started saying it in the


---------33:20----------
in recent years so you know i set it


---------33:22----------
back and like i realized


---------33:24----------
i don't say it to my dad either but i


---------33:26----------
guess that's just like an asian thing


---------33:27----------
you know like


---------33:28----------
you don't say these things to your


---------33:29----------
parents or your kids you know


---------33:33----------
yeah you say it to your cats yeah you


---------33:36----------
say it to your cats and your dogs


---------33:40----------
how did he learn how to do that i don't


---------33:43----------
know it's crazy just like one day


---------33:47----------
um he sent me a voice clip and he was


---------33:49----------
just like


---------33:50----------
he was saying some stuff and then at the


---------33:52----------
end of it he was like i love you in


---------33:53----------
english and i was like


---------33:55----------
what you know i was like oh i love you


---------33:58----------
too


---------33:58----------
dad you know it's like kind of awkward


---------34:00----------
but like nice but


---------34:02----------
it was just one of those moments where i


---------34:03----------
was like whoa where did you learn to do


---------34:05----------
that


---------34:06----------
you know yeah


---------34:10----------
sounds like you leveled up yeah


---------34:13----------
it's crazy my dad is super into like


---------34:17----------
learning tech stuff i feel like it


---------34:19----------
hasn't even been that long since i like


---------34:21----------
you know helped him with the computer


---------34:22----------
and laptop and now he's like watching


---------34:24----------
streams and stuff and i was like how


---------34:28----------
you're torrenting or like you're like


---------34:30----------
streaming


---------34:31----------
stuff and i was like what i was like


---------34:33----------
what are you doing dad


---------34:34----------
how do you learn this stuff yeah turns


---------34:37----------
out that you can't


---------34:38----------
teach an old boomer new tricks i know


---------34:47----------
so wendy you know i i'm happy to


---------34:52----------
you know if you want to continue


---------34:53----------
exploring and stuff like that i think we


---------34:55----------
can certainly do that i


---------34:56----------
i feel like um we've kind of


---------34:59----------
hit a pretty important point and if it's


---------35:01----------
okay with you i'll kind of


---------35:02----------
lay that out lay a couple things out and


---------35:05----------
we can talk further if you want to


---------35:09----------
so the first thing is i'll double down


---------35:10----------
on what i said earlier i'm not surprised


---------35:12----------
at all that your dad does tell you to


---------35:13----------
rest


---------35:14----------
um it's not i mean there's a reason why


---------35:16----------
i told you you know call him


---------35:19----------
on the days when you're beating yourself


---------35:21----------
up for not doing enough


---------35:23----------
and tell him how you feel


---------35:30----------
um and tell him that you know you feel


---------35:32----------
like


---------35:33----------
you're not doing enough or that you


---------35:35----------
should be working harder


---------35:37----------
and let him


---------35:41----------
let him so here's the thing so you come


---------35:43----------
onto the stream


---------35:44----------
and then you say to me i have trouble


---------35:47----------
taking a day off


---------35:48----------
i have trouble um you know


---------35:52----------
if i don't if i'm not bone tired i feel


---------35:54----------
like it's not enough


---------35:56----------
so you come to me and you make it sound


---------35:59----------
or


---------35:59----------
there's an assumption that that is


---------36:01----------
something that you need to fix


---------36:04----------
right you're coming to me and you're


---------36:05----------
like hey i want to change this about


---------36:06----------
myself like


---------36:08----------
here's the thing you're you can you fix


---------36:10----------
it absolutely


---------36:12----------
but you're not the one who needs to fix


---------36:15----------
it


---------36:15----------
it's your dad who can fix it so much


---------36:18----------
faster


---------36:19----------
what you can do in a hundred days he can


---------36:21----------
do in one


---------36:23----------
because i think you just because if he


---------36:25----------
tells you if he gives you permission


---------36:28----------
of sorts and he tells you like take it


---------36:31----------
you know take a day off i think it's


---------36:32----------
gonna like


---------36:34----------
be worth so much more


---------36:38----------
what do you think about that


---------36:43----------
yeah i can see that yeah


---------36:46----------
and so i think it's going to be like


---------36:47----------
challenging for you to


---------36:49----------
show him that side of you because


---------36:53----------
that's the side that you've tried to


---------36:56----------
keep from them right for like so long


---------37:01----------
and there are times that out of like


---------37:03----------
desperation or at the end of your rope


---------37:05----------
you're like i can't do my master's


---------37:07----------
degree


---------37:08----------
and it's so dangerous because like


---------37:09----------
that's when


---------37:11----------
all of the assumptions about your


---------37:13----------
parents will come


---------37:14----------
to a head and like all of the things


---------37:18----------
that you sort of piece


---------37:19----------
together like you know what they're


---------37:21----------
gonna say because


---------37:23----------
they've said it a thousand times before


---------37:26----------
but then they actually don't say it


---------37:30----------
and they kind of confound your


---------37:31----------
expectations and you recognize that your


---------37:33----------
parents really do


---------37:34----------
love you so now we get


---------37:37----------
uh does that make sense yeah yeah your


---------37:41----------
dad is going to teach you how to rest


---------37:44----------
because he taught you how to not rest


---------37:47----------
right your parents taught you that so


---------37:49----------
like this is where they have to teach


---------37:51----------
you the other thing


---------37:52----------
so i'm gonna say some things and this is


---------37:54----------
gonna paint your parents in sort of a


---------37:56----------
bad light i don't think it's


---------37:58----------
but i think it so i think we have to


---------38:00----------
understand that even the best parents


---------38:02----------
are gonna like


---------38:03----------
not be perfect and are going to do


---------38:05----------
things to their kids


---------38:06----------
that their kids then have to like


---------38:07----------
struggle with and grow like that's just


---------38:09----------
life you know my parents are both


---------38:12----------
wonderful


---------38:13----------
and they also did a number on me in


---------38:15----------
different ways that's just how it is


---------38:18----------
so here's what i how i understand kind


---------38:21----------
of what happened with you i mean i think


---------38:23----------
you know it's interesting because when


---------38:24----------
you grew up like it sounds like your


---------38:25----------
parents really emphasized piano


---------38:29----------
and as you joked i went to two schools


---------38:31----------
but i think there's a lot there about


---------38:33----------
you know like them really pushing you


---------38:34----------
and wanting you to be something


---------38:37----------
and sort of creating in your mind a


---------38:38----------
standard that you have to live up to


---------38:42----------
and then there was always this sort of


---------38:44----------
message of it's not enough are you


---------38:46----------
practicing you need to practice more


---------38:48----------
and you tried every which way to deal


---------38:51----------
with that


---------38:52----------
right you tried to practice more and i'm


---------38:55----------
not really hearing that they ever said


---------38:57----------
good job today


---------38:58----------
you practiced enough so even though


---------39:01----------
you kind of practice as much as you can


---------39:04----------
it's not enough and then like it hurts


---------39:08----------
to give


---------39:08----------
everything you've got and not get a


---------39:12----------
thumbs up from the people


---------39:14----------
that you're trying to make happy right


---------39:16----------
and then it hurts too when you


---------39:18----------
do do a good job and where there may


---------39:20----------
have been things that you're proud of


---------39:21----------
and like even if you can't win at piano


---------39:23----------
like at least you got a 90


---------39:26----------
and then you come and you show your


---------39:27----------
parents and like you're like hey


---------39:29----------
i did something and they're like


---------39:33----------
we don't care


---------39:36----------
right and so you're kind of like growing


---------39:38----------
up you're sort of like


---------39:39----------
there's no way for you to win this


---------39:41----------
battle there's no way for you to get


---------39:43----------
approval and so like this thing starts


---------39:46----------
to grow within you that like you're not


---------39:48----------
enough


---------39:50----------
and it's not enough and no matter what


---------39:52----------
you do it's not enough so you try to


---------39:54----------
make them happy it doesn't work you try


---------39:55----------
to show them things that you're proud of


---------39:56----------
it doesn't work


---------39:59----------
and so somewhere along the way you lose


---------40:01----------
your voice


---------40:04----------
right like you can't speak to them they


---------40:06----------
don't listen there's no point in


---------40:08----------
speaking there's just kind of putting


---------40:11----------
your head down


---------40:12----------
and like you know pounding away like


---------40:15----------
there's doesn't matter what you think or


---------40:17----------
what you feel or what you say


---------40:19----------
that's a really painful and difficult


---------40:21----------
place to be


---------40:23----------
and when kids lose their voice they stop


---------40:25----------
listening


---------40:26----------
because why do we stop listening to


---------40:29----------
people it's because


---------40:30----------
what we say doesn't matter you know it's


---------40:32----------
kind of weird so then you learned how to


---------40:34----------
in one ear and out the other because


---------40:36----------
what used to happen


---------40:37----------
in one ear changes something in here and


---------40:40----------
then you try something new


---------40:43----------
they tell you wendy you need to practice


---------40:45----------
more and then you'd get home from school


---------40:47----------
and you'd practice for six hours a day


---------40:49----------
and it wouldn't make a difference


---------40:53----------
and so like if you started being you


---------40:56----------
know


---------40:56----------
there's a coping mechanism ignoring what


---------40:58----------
they're saying it's because you can't


---------40:59----------
win that game so you're like


---------41:01----------
not gonna play it anymore and then you


---------41:04----------
get teenage rebellion and they don't


---------41:06----------
really understand what's going on and


---------41:07----------
they think you're being defiant and


---------41:08----------
stuff like that and all that kind of


---------41:10----------
good stuff


---------41:12----------
um you know there's not really you lose


---------41:15----------
a voice you don't they don't really show


---------41:16----------
pride in your work


---------41:17----------
you don't really show pride in your work


---------41:19----------
like it's mind-boggling you call


---------41:21----------
yourself pretty okay at piano you had to


---------41:23----------
piano conservatory i can guarantee you


---------41:25----------
you're in


---------41:26----------
you know in the general population


---------41:27----------
you're in like one in the


---------41:30----------
10 000 people in terms of piano skill


---------41:33----------
right like i'm almost 100 sure of that


---------41:35----------
statistic


---------41:37----------
are you a professional no but there are


---------41:40----------
thousands and tens of thousands of


---------41:42----------
amateurs out there


---------41:43----------
but like you don't know how to have


---------41:46----------
pride i i think this has changed


---------41:48----------
but in some ways especially when it


---------41:50----------
comes to piano you have difficulty


---------41:51----------
having pride in your work


---------41:54----------
right because you weren't taught like


---------41:55----------
your parents didn't show you how to have


---------41:57----------
pride in your work all they showed you


---------41:59----------
was


---------42:00----------
how your work isn't enough and so you


---------42:03----------
carry that with you


---------42:06----------
and so now what i'm hearing is that like


---------42:08----------
that's what


---------42:09----------
that was the formula for success that


---------42:11----------
your parents taught you


---------42:13----------
there's a lot of other stuff here like


---------42:15----------
the odd jobs that


---------42:16----------
that they worked the sacrifices they had


---------42:19----------
to make the investment that they made in


---------42:20----------
you


---------42:21----------
there's like a whole like thing there


---------42:25----------
yeah you know of expectation and not


---------42:29----------
being good enough and like


---------42:30----------
because they're it's a lot right like


---------42:32----------
they make they did a lot


---------42:35----------
and see living up to that expectation


---------42:38----------
every sacrifice they made every odd job


---------42:40----------
they worked every time that they ran


---------42:42----------
into trouble


---------42:43----------
and still paid for you to go to


---------42:45----------
conservatory


---------42:46----------
raises the bar of expectation and like


---------42:49----------
increases the weight on your shoulders


---------42:52----------
and that's weight that you carry with


---------42:54----------
you despite your successful streaming


---------42:56----------
even though your


---------42:57----------
dad kind of clearly loves you your


---------42:59----------
parents clearly love you


---------43:00----------
you know they clearly support you they


---------43:02----------
clearly are interested in you


---------43:04----------
and it's so strange because it's like


---------43:05----------
well doesn't that fix things and the


---------43:06----------
answer is no


---------43:09----------
because he loves you today but what you


---------43:11----------
really need to do is like


---------43:12----------
go into the past and recognize that at


---------43:14----------
each of those painful moments


---------43:17----------
he loved you then too


---------43:20----------
even though you didn't know it and then


---------43:23----------
we get to like the next big swath of


---------43:26----------
stuff that's challenging


---------43:30----------
and this is tough is that your parents


---------43:33----------
may have made mistakes


---------43:35----------
and i don't think that you were willing


---------43:38----------
to let them make mistakes i don't think


---------43:42----------
that


---------43:42----------
it's possible for you to criticize them


---------43:45----------
i don't think it's possible for you


---------43:47----------
to say to yourself i needed them to be


---------43:50----------
like proud of me when i was seven


---------43:53----------
and they weren't and like i needed to


---------43:55----------
hear


---------43:56----------
like it broke you when your dad told you


---------43:58----------
i loved you and like he needed to tell


---------44:00----------
you that


---------44:01----------
a long time ago right and we can


---------44:05----------
there this is where things get really


---------44:07----------
really like tricky


---------44:09----------
because we can


---------44:13----------
not in a this is tricky but like that's


---------44:15----------
just a truth


---------44:17----------
right it doesn't have to come with blame


---------44:19----------
but like it has to come with


---------44:20----------
accountability


---------44:22----------
like we can forgive him because he


---------44:23----------
didn't know how to do that back then and


---------44:25----------
like he didn't


---------44:26----------
they didn't know better and they learned


---------44:28----------
and we can appreciate them


---------44:29----------
but the damage back then was still done


---------44:34----------
and like you can't heal that hurt until


---------44:36----------
you


---------44:37----------
recognize that like that damage was done


---------44:40----------
so this is where things get really


---------44:41----------
really tricky because like you you're


---------44:43----------
gonna feel guilty for sort of blaming


---------44:45----------
him


---------44:46----------
because he did so much for you because


---------44:48----------
they sacrificed so much for you


---------44:50----------
but like you still have to do that


---------44:52----------
because then you can really forget like


---------44:54----------
you put everything in context but


---------44:55----------
you can't ignore your experience because


---------44:58----------
that's where the real healing happens


---------45:03----------
does that make sense yes


---------45:06----------
so i think kind of just to sort of wrap


---------45:09----------
things up


---------45:11----------
um i mean we can still talk more if you


---------45:12----------
want to in questions but like just to


---------45:14----------
kind of like


---------45:14----------
kind of finish up where we are right now


---------45:18----------
you know i think you carry this not


---------45:20----------
being good enough with you and you


---------45:22----------
like you slung that on your back like a


---------45:24----------
long time ago


---------45:26----------
and and if you kind of think about it


---------45:27----------
like you're clear i think you're


---------45:28----------
confident and you're probably proud of


---------45:30----------
what you do now like on a relatively


---------45:32----------
daily basis i wouldn't be surprised


---------45:33----------
so then that gets confusing because like


---------45:35----------
how can you be proud today


---------45:37----------
and still feel like you're not good


---------45:39----------
enough today


---------45:40----------
and the reason is because that not good


---------45:42----------
enough is not from today it's from a


---------45:46----------
decade ago


---------45:48----------
right so like when your dad started


---------45:50----------
telling you i love you like that damage


---------45:52----------
stops


---------45:53----------
and he's like proud of you and you like


---------45:54----------
know that that's why it's so [ __ ]


---------45:56----------
confusing about like


---------45:57----------
why like i'm confident myself my dad


---------45:59----------
loves me my parents are proud of me why


---------46:01----------
do i feel like i'm not good enough


---------46:03----------
shouldn't that balance itself out and


---------46:05----------
unfortunately that's just not how the


---------46:06----------
mind works


---------46:08----------
you have to go kind of back in time and


---------46:10----------
like like even


---------46:11----------
talk this is challenging but like even


---------46:13----------
talk to your parents about


---------46:15----------
you know like when i was growing up like


---------46:18----------
like


---------46:18----------
asking hard questions like were you


---------46:20----------
proud of me it's gonna be a question


---------46:22----------
that breaks him because like


---------46:24----------
he's gonna feel your pain it's gonna be


---------46:25----------
a lot of tears and stuff like that


---------46:27----------
but it's like it's like a question that


---------46:28----------
you need to ask and it's an answer that


---------46:30----------
you need to hear


---------46:32----------
yeah right it's just hard to


---------46:35----------
i gotta get


---------46:48----------
okay yeah


---------46:52----------
um anyway


---------46:55----------
yeah yeah i went into this day


---------46:58----------
i mean i went into this today and i was


---------47:00----------
like i don't want to cry i don't want to


---------47:02----------
cry but i know talking about this is


---------47:03----------
going to make me


---------47:04----------
like really emotional but yeah


---------47:08----------
yeah yeah


---------47:12----------
right and that's the thing wendy is like


---------47:15----------
you don't


---------47:15----------
the thing that makes me the most sad


---------47:17----------
about this is that you don't really have


---------47:19----------
to


---------47:20----------
hang on to that anymore right because


---------47:22----------
your dad does love you guys just need to


---------47:24----------
like


---------47:25----------
talk up you know talk about it and like


---------47:28----------
you need to hear those words


---------47:30----------
because like there's you know a 12 year


---------47:32----------
old little asian kid who's like going to


---------47:34----------
piano conservatory like she needs to


---------47:36----------
hear those words


---------47:40----------
right and like she deserves to hear


---------47:42----------
those words


---------47:44----------
because like you know like adult wendy


---------47:48----------
high level wendy endgame wendy like


---------47:50----------
she's a beast


---------47:52----------
but you know that other little girl like


---------47:56----------
needs to hear that


---------48:00----------
yeah i never i never thought about


---------48:05----------
the fact that it might be that


---------48:08----------
actually or the thought that it might be


---------48:14----------
from my piano days i guess i g because


---------48:16----------
it's so


---------48:18----------
it's like when i think about it it's


---------48:20----------
like it's


---------48:21----------
kind of like behind me in a sense


---------48:23----------
because i really haven't engaged in a


---------48:25----------
lot of that in a long time


---------48:27----------
i play it for fun now which is actually


---------48:29----------
nice because you know i just play


---------48:31----------
whatever i want whatever i want


---------48:33----------
however much i want and that's nice and


---------48:36----------
it's like so almost so far put behind me


---------48:39----------
that i never


---------48:39----------
think that that is what's affecting me


---------48:43----------
still


---------48:43----------
today


---------48:46----------
yeah and i think the real question there


---------48:48----------
is like on those days when you're


---------48:51----------
relaxing


---------48:54----------
how when was how old were you when you


---------48:57----------
felt that i'm not doing enough and i


---------48:59----------
should be doing


---------49:00----------
more does it smell look


---------49:04----------
and tastes like what you felt when you


---------49:06----------
were 7 or 10 or 15 or 16


---------49:14----------
i guess it's similar yeah


---------49:17----------
um i have


---------49:21----------
i don't know i think when i was younger


---------49:22----------
too there's just


---------49:25----------
it's different now because there's


---------49:27----------
nobody pushing me but myself


---------49:30----------
yep but when i was young


---------49:33----------
uh or younger there was you know my


---------49:35----------
professors and


---------49:36----------
and my parents but now it's like i know


---------49:40----------
that if i don't push myself nobody's


---------49:42----------
really gonna push me but i realized i


---------49:45----------
pushed myself a lot


---------49:48----------
yeah and and how deep so


---------49:51----------
how do you know when oh god i'm bleeding


---------49:54----------
oh god


---------49:56----------
how do you know when you've pushed


---------49:57----------
yourself enough


---------50:03----------
i don't i don't know


---------50:07----------
when i push myself enough or too much


---------50:12----------
i just i just remember waking up for the


---------50:15----------
past like


---------50:16----------
at least half a year or more where i'm


---------50:18----------
just like every day it's like


---------50:20----------
i wake up all right eat get ready stream


---------50:22----------
go


---------50:23----------
like that's literally like i i don't


---------50:25----------
think i really have a lot of like


---------50:28----------
just spare time to do whatever


---------50:31----------
i just i just know that i wake up and i


---------50:33----------
should work like that's me


---------50:36----------
yeah so there's also are you familiar


---------50:38----------
with um


---------50:40----------
chinese medicine or ayurveda


---------50:45----------
chinese medicine in like what sense like


---------50:47----------
are you familiar with like any of the


---------50:49----------
principles of chinese medicine tcm


---------50:52----------
oh no okay so i think the other


---------50:55----------
interesting thing is that you know


---------50:56----------
uh so ayurveda and chinese medicine i


---------50:58----------
remember this traditional indian


---------50:59----------
medicine


---------51:00----------
and there's a lot of cross-pollination


---------51:02----------
in terms of concepts like they kind of


---------51:04----------
end up coming up with different terms


---------51:06----------
but the ideas are


---------51:07----------
pretty similar another just kind of side


---------51:10----------
thing you can check out like some of our


---------51:11----------
youtube stuff on this but


---------51:13----------
um some of that work ethic that you talk


---------51:15----------
about you're very kapha


---------51:17----------
so like this is like an element like so


---------51:19----------
in in eastern systems of medicine what


---------51:21----------
they do is


---------51:22----------
they use elements to describe people's


---------51:24----------
like personality temperament


---------51:27----------
and things like that so gaffas are


---------51:29----------
people who have a lot of like earth


---------51:31----------
element and water elements so they tend


---------51:32----------
to be very very resilient


---------51:34----------
very very hard working have large


---------51:38----------
stamina pools


---------51:40----------
the tricky thing that they get into is


---------51:42----------
that because they have


---------51:44----------
such because they're so resilient


---------51:47----------
they tend to tolerate negative


---------51:49----------
situations far


---------51:50----------
longer than they otherwise would


---------51:54----------
right so like people who have like


---------51:56----------
smaller hp pools will like sit in


---------51:58----------
burning lava for a very small amount of


---------52:00----------
time


---------52:01----------
whereas like people with large hp pools


---------52:02----------
are like oh i'm taking a bunch of damage


---------52:04----------
every round but i've got like a thousand


---------52:06----------
hit points so it's like not that big of


---------52:07----------
a deal i'm just gonna hang out here


---------52:10----------
um and and so you know it's something


---------52:13----------
that people on our stream sometimes we


---------52:14----------
talk about but i think it's like kind of


---------52:16----------
interesting because


---------52:17----------
you know i would imagine that


---------52:18----------
follow-through and perseverance are not


---------52:20----------
problems for you


---------52:22----------
yes that's i think that's like


---------52:25----------
you know those you know those tests that


---------52:27----------
go like oh describe your personality in


---------52:29----------
like five words


---------52:30----------
i think like i think i've used


---------52:32----------
perseverance like a lot


---------52:34----------
yup yeah so that's classic kapha right


---------52:36----------
so a couple things wendy for you to


---------52:41----------
so sometimes it takes longer for me to


---------52:44----------
feel like i understand like where stuff


---------52:46----------
is coming from


---------52:46----------
from someone i think you were just so


---------52:49----------
authentic and open


---------52:50----------
that it like really came together quick


---------52:52----------
so i'm talking about a couple other


---------52:54----------
random things now if that's okay


---------52:55----------
okay yeah so the first thing is that


---------52:58----------
you've got to be careful


---------53:00----------
about a couple of things one is that


---------53:01----------
that feeling of not good enough so


---------53:03----------
in terms of when how how hard do you


---------53:07----------
push yourself


---------53:08----------
i would say that you probably push


---------53:10----------
yourself to the point of like


---------53:12----------
a decent amount of feeling not good


---------53:14----------
enough


---------53:16----------
yeah and i know it's kind of weird like


---------53:18----------
like you know you think the more you


---------53:20----------
push yourself


---------53:22----------
the more good about yourself you feel


---------53:24----------
but for you it's the other way around


---------53:26----------
and you know because like you know that


---------53:28----------
in in order to do a good job


---------53:31----------
you have to feel not good enough


---------53:39----------
what do you think about that


---------53:45----------
yeah i i guess so it's kind of weird


---------53:49----------
okay


---------53:50----------
yeah but like this is where like when


---------53:52----------
you decide to stop pushing yourself is


---------53:55----------
based on these weird internal feelings


---------53:56----------
like


---------53:57----------
like when is streaming enough it has


---------53:59----------
nothing to do with numbers and metrics


---------54:01----------
and this is how much i need to


---------54:02----------
it has to do with an internal feeling of


---------54:04----------
okay i'm [ __ ] exhausted


---------54:05----------
which means i probably did a decent job


---------54:07----------
today


---------54:09----------
like i need to keep pushing myself until


---------54:11----------
like i really get into a place where


---------54:13----------
like okay


---------54:14----------
i don't feel like i'm good enough i'm


---------54:15----------
really like pushing myself you're like


---------54:17----------
cracking the whip


---------54:18----------
and then you're like okay oh whoo


---------54:22----------
you know i'm finally like cracking the


---------54:24----------
whip really really hard


---------54:26----------
and flagellating myself so like as long


---------54:28----------
as i'm beating myself up this much like


---------54:30----------
i'm probably going to work good enough


---------54:32----------
and it'll end up okay


---------54:35----------
so i encourage you to just sort of play


---------54:36----------
around with that see if that's true or


---------54:38----------
not


---------54:39----------
a couple things to think about is


---------54:40----------
sometimes these dynamics can pop


---------54:42----------
up in like romantic relationships


---------54:46----------
so you know if you start to feel like


---------54:48----------
you're not good enough


---------54:49----------
in romantic relationships or things like


---------54:52----------
that like you have to be careful because


---------54:54----------
like you said you know you didn't


---------54:55----------
realize it you know went back to your


---------54:57----------
piano days because your piano ideas are


---------54:58----------
behind you you just carry them with you


---------55:01----------
absolutely um


---------55:04----------
and for kapha's too you have to be


---------55:06----------
careful because a lot of times


---------55:07----------
the relationship problems that kaphas


---------55:09----------
fall into is that they


---------55:10----------
end up in unhealthy relationships for


---------55:14----------
far too long


---------55:18----------
and and especially like there's a


---------55:19----------
particular vulnerability here where like


---------55:21----------
you could feel like you're not good


---------55:23----------
enough when actually


---------55:24----------
you're doing fine and the person you're


---------55:26----------
dating is probably should be better


---------55:29----------
but you're so used to like not being


---------55:32----------
good enough that


---------55:33----------
maybe some of that stuff can start to


---------55:35----------
like pop up again


---------55:38----------
i think that was very like apparent to


---------55:41----------
me in the past


---------55:43----------
yeah like in past relationships that i


---------55:46----------
had definitely


---------55:48----------
and i guess it doesn't help that like


---------55:50----------
every guy that i've dated cheated on me


---------55:52----------
so it doesn't help that not good enough


---------55:55----------
thing


---------55:56----------
but yeah it was very apparent like i


---------55:59----------
i was in a lot of relationships that i


---------56:01----------
stayed for too long


---------56:02----------
yep yeah so i mean


---------56:05----------
i'm happy to hear you say was and i


---------56:07----------
think this is kind of weird but like


---------56:09----------
every time your dad tells you he's proud


---------56:11----------
of you


---------56:12----------
that is gonna shrink and as you become


---------56:16----------
more confident in yourself like there


---------56:17----------
may be an echo of this but but you know


---------56:20----------
like every time that happens like


---------56:22----------
literally like talk to your dad on your


---------56:24----------
day off


---------56:25----------
and tell him you don't feel good enough


---------56:26----------
and he's going to tell you that you're


---------56:27----------
he's proud of you


---------56:29----------
you're wonderful he loves you you


---------56:31----------
deserve to rest he's going to say all


---------56:32----------
that stuff to you


---------56:34----------
and then like your next relationship is


---------56:36----------
going to be healthier


---------56:39----------
um yeah


---------56:43----------
questions thoughts um


---------56:51----------
not at the moment i just i'm just


---------56:53----------
thinking about how to have a


---------56:54----------
conversation with my dad


---------56:57----------
it's just uh it's gonna be it's gonna be


---------57:01----------
weird yeah but yeah i think it'll be


---------57:05----------
good


---------57:06----------
penny for your thoughts there like what


---------57:07----------
what are you thinking about how to have


---------57:09----------
a conversation with your dad


---------57:11----------
um like just like


---------57:14----------
i guess how to tell him


---------57:19----------
yeah because because i think like i like


---------57:23----------
part of me also like i don't want to


---------57:24----------
worry him but i realized like


---------57:26----------
i do have to tell him these things


---------57:31----------
so i'm gonna try to help you out there a


---------57:33----------
little bit


---------57:35----------
you don't want to worry him


---------57:38----------
he's already worried


---------57:41----------
yeah i guess yeah so this is what i want


---------57:44----------
you to reframe


---------57:45----------
you need to give him the opportunity of


---------57:49----------
comforting his worried daughter


---------57:53----------
you need to give him the oh sorry like


---------57:54----------
his you know the daughter he's worrying


---------57:56----------
about


---------57:56----------
you need to give him the opportunity to


---------57:58----------
like make it better


---------58:02----------
that's what you really owe him


---------58:07----------
yeah when he sees you


---------58:10----------
streaming for 24 hours and he's like you


---------58:12----------
should rest like he's worried about you


---------58:14----------
it's already happening


---------58:18----------
yeah it's true do you need help i mean


---------58:21----------
do you are you


---------58:22----------
confident that you can come up with like


---------58:24----------
language for like talking to him


---------58:31----------
i don't know it's gonna be a little


---------58:33----------
weird because i


---------58:35----------
i grew up speaking like cantonese to my


---------58:37----------
parents but then with my dad he's like


---------58:39----------
more fluent in english so i end up


---------58:40----------
speaking like this weird


---------58:41----------
like mixture of stuff with him but he


---------58:44----------
kind of understands like my moon runes


---------58:46----------
when i like mix both languages together


---------58:49----------
at random parts of the sentence


---------58:51----------
so i'm just wondering like in my mind


---------58:52----------
like how i'm gonna piece together


---------58:54----------
uh like if i'm gonna say it in like


---------58:57----------
cantonese or am i gonna say it in a


---------58:58----------
little bit of english or like


---------59:00----------
how it's gonna work out but yeah i think


---------59:03----------
it'll be okay yeah


---------59:06----------
yeah it sounds like he listens to you


---------59:09----------
now


---------59:10----------
yeah i mean i think like both my parents


---------59:14----------
you know listen to me but it's just i


---------59:16----------
think i've always


---------59:18----------
um bonded with my dad a little bit more


---------59:22----------
i mean i love both of them a lot and i


---------59:24----------
think in recent years i've


---------59:25----------
come to talk to my mom a lot more um


---------59:29----------
it's because my mom did a lot more of


---------59:31----------
the yelling and my dad did less of


---------59:33----------
it uh yeah he was he was always more


---------59:36----------
like chill and quiet


---------59:40----------
so i i guess i always like i also played


---------59:42----------
a lot more games with my dad growing up


---------59:44----------
too i didn't ever play any games with my


---------59:46----------
mom


---------59:47----------
what kind of games oh we played like i


---------59:50----------
don't know like


---------59:51----------
tetris and like chess and you know board


---------59:54----------
games and stuff together


---------59:55----------
and we would watch tv shows together


---------59:57----------
like kids tv shows like arthur and


---------60:00----------
magic school bus and stuff together you


---------60:02----------
know like my dad loved pingu


---------60:04----------
you know it's just like it's just one of


---------60:06----------
those he oh


---------60:07----------
piku is like this this uh penguin it's a


---------60:10----------
stop-motion


---------60:11----------
penguin animation that was like really


---------60:14----------
popular


---------60:15----------
in mild in my childhood yeah it's


---------60:19----------
interesting you know


---------60:20----------
i think dads have special relationships


---------60:22----------
with their daughters i'm sure they have


---------60:23----------
special relationships with their sons


---------60:25----------
too but


---------60:26----------
i have two daughters and and so i you


---------60:29----------
know it's different i'm different with


---------60:30----------
them


---------60:31----------
than my wife is right um


---------60:37----------
yeah i'm kind of at a loss as to what to


---------60:39----------
talk about now


---------60:42----------
um yeah


---------60:46----------
for me it was just mostly trying to find


---------60:49----------
out like


---------60:51----------
i guess why i felt so bad when i took my


---------60:54----------
days off


---------60:55----------
yeah yeah um


---------60:58----------
i i guess the other thing is i guess it


---------61:01----------
might be related it's just constantly


---------61:03----------
chasing for more or that


---------61:06----------
but that might just relate to you know


---------61:08----------
not feeling like it's not enough


---------61:11----------
so they kind of come hand in hand i


---------61:12----------
think


---------61:14----------
yeah and that yeah and that might be in


---------61:16----------
terms of like numbers too you know like


---------61:18----------
for streaming or like anything


---------61:21----------
yeah so i i think that that is actually


---------61:24----------
a little bit more complicated so i think


---------61:26----------
certainly they're related


---------61:27----------
but i think a lot of that has to do with


---------61:30----------
just being a streamer in general


---------61:32----------
yeah um and just you know there's like


---------61:36----------
this


---------61:36----------
there's a effect of platforms


---------61:40----------
on our psychology um and


---------61:44----------
and some of that of like always needing


---------61:46----------
to grow in sort of the sentiment of like


---------61:48----------
if i'm not growing i'm dying you know


---------61:52----------
and you can't take a break because like


---------61:54----------
you know it's like steady content and


---------61:56----------
and like this is like it's not so i do


---------61:59----------
wonder about


---------62:00----------
god i should really think about this now


---------62:03----------
i wonder if we should do a study about


---------62:04----------
this but like there's so many


---------62:07----------
streamers that we've talked to that were


---------62:09----------
like you know had


---------62:10----------
parents that were like fundamentally


---------62:13----------
unsatisfied


---------62:14----------
or like weren't able to display pride or


---------62:17----------
satisfaction


---------62:18----------
with their kids yeah and


---------62:22----------
and just i i it never crossed my mind


---------62:24----------
until now that like


---------62:25----------
i wonder if that's actually part of what


---------62:27----------
makes you guys successful


---------62:30----------
because you guys do you know like


---------62:33----------
like that feeling of not being good


---------62:35----------
enough like pushes you to you


---------62:41----------
it'd be an interesting sort of like


---------62:42----------
personality analysis like study but


---------62:45----------
um i think some of that stuff is just


---------62:47----------
you know it's just how what social media


---------62:49----------
and stuff like that does to us


---------62:51----------
so it's like i mean if you want to


---------62:55----------
you know hear me be professor andy i can


---------62:56----------
like talk more about


---------62:58----------
you know like go into a quick


---------62:59----------
explanation of how that works but my


---------63:01----------
experience is basically that


---------63:03----------
we have like personal psychological


---------63:05----------
stuff that then


---------63:06----------
meets the influence of the internet


---------63:10----------
and that the influence like we've always


---------63:13----------
had the psychological stuff but now we


---------63:15----------
have the internet


---------63:16----------
which sort of like amplifies or even


---------63:18----------
like preys


---------63:19----------
on some of our vulnerabilities that like


---------63:21----------
everyone has always had


---------63:23----------
and then we end up with something that


---------63:25----------
we haven't ended up with before


---------63:28----------
which is like the psychological stuff


---------63:30----------
like you know everyone's had i mean


---------63:31----------
asian parents have existed since the


---------63:33----------
dawn of time


---------63:36----------
and then you take asian parents and then


---------63:37----------
you throw in twitch and then


---------63:39----------
you're actually rare wendy because i you


---------63:41----------
know i don't i don't know how many


---------63:44----------
usually it's like through therapy and a


---------63:46----------
lot of effort on the kids parts to like


---------63:48----------
get their parents to tell them


---------63:50----------
i love you like they have to be taught


---------63:52----------
like i don't know like your dad


---------63:53----------
yeah i don't know my i don't know but my


---------63:56----------
parents


---------63:56----------
evolved yeah like pokemon


---------64:00----------
but like they literally but i i don't


---------64:03----------
know i guess my parents are


---------64:04----------
like or my yeah my dad is like


---------64:07----------
especially woke


---------64:08----------
it's really weird because like he tells


---------64:10----------
me all these things that he thinks about


---------64:12----------
and then he he kind of like realized and


---------64:15----------
then he'll tell me these things


---------64:16----------
sometimes and i'll be like


---------64:18----------
it's weird hearing it from him because


---------64:21----------
yeah because it's just like this is very


---------64:23----------
against like


---------64:25----------
traditional asian culture you know and


---------64:27----------
so i always call my parents like


---------64:29----------
hippies because like they're so much


---------64:31----------
more like relaxed or more like


---------64:33----------
understanding than a lot of parents that


---------64:35----------
i've seen


---------64:36----------
or like have heard about and so


---------64:40----------
every time i just think about my dad


---------64:41----------
it's like what the heck is going on you


---------64:43----------
know


---------64:44----------
yeah it's really good to see too and


---------64:46----------
it's really nice


---------64:48----------
so yeah yeah i i think um


---------64:51----------
you know there is a there is a asian dad


---------64:54----------
pokemon


---------64:55----------
who starts out as security guard form


---------64:57----------
and then goes into convenience store


---------64:59----------
owner form


---------65:00----------
and then winds up his woke asian dad in


---------65:02----------
touch with his face


---------65:04----------
asian dad which is which is the which is


---------65:07----------
the charizard


---------65:12----------
vocation dad uses i love you oh god


---------65:16----------
wendy begins to cry


---------65:20----------
very effective yeah it's very effective


---------65:22----------
oh god


---------65:24----------
yeah oh that's really funny


---------65:34----------
[Music]


---------65:38----------
yeah i it's it's weird because i feel


---------65:41----------
like there's i guess there's two types


---------65:42----------
of people right like there's the people


---------65:44----------
who


---------65:46----------
they tell themselves like oh they're not


---------65:48----------
good enough and then they don't do


---------65:50----------
anything


---------65:50----------
because it's like crippling and then


---------65:52----------
there's just i guess there's


---------65:54----------
people like me who if i say like i'm not


---------65:56----------
good enough well


---------65:57----------
i should do more like i need to do


---------66:00----------
instead of like just not do anything


---------66:03----------
that's a really cool observation


---------66:05----------
what do you think separates those two


---------66:07----------
people why why do you think one is


---------66:11----------
i


---------66:14----------
i don't know like why someone becomes


---------66:16----------
one or the other


---------66:18----------
um and i and i found like i talk to some


---------66:21----------
of my friends


---------66:22----------
you know some of them are very much like


---------66:24----------
i feel like crap


---------66:25----------
now i'm not gonna do anything and then


---------66:27----------
for me it's like i really wish i could


---------66:31----------
give them some of my energy and be like


---------66:34----------
i think you'll feel better if you do


---------66:35----------
something


---------66:36----------
rather than not doing anything at all


---------66:38----------
and


---------66:41----------
yeah i don't know what makes us do one


---------66:44----------
or the other


---------66:44----------
i don't know if you have any insight on


---------66:47----------
that i've never thought about it like


---------66:48----------
that but i i love


---------66:49----------
where you're going with this i wonder if


---------66:51----------
it's the presence


---------66:53----------
of someone that you want to do it for


---------66:58----------
like a motivation yeah like like you


---------67:00----------
want to make your parents proud


---------67:02----------
which no matter how hard you try never


---------67:05----------
happens


---------67:07----------
which i know sounds bleak yeah and and


---------67:09----------
then because i i have talked to some


---------67:11----------
people who


---------67:12----------
you know don't feel good enough but i i


---------67:13----------
don't think they ever


---------67:15----------
i mean their parents were really more


---------67:20----------
um tend to be more toxic so it's like


---------67:23----------
like you know their parents would tell


---------67:25----------
them you're not good enough like


---------67:28----------
to their face and it's sort of like like


---------67:30----------
at least in your case


---------67:32----------
it's almost like some people have a


---------67:33----------
parent like a parent that sort of like


---------67:36----------
you know holds up a standard that they


---------67:38----------
push their kid to meet


---------67:39----------
and it's so impossible that you never


---------67:41----------
meet it but they still


---------67:43----------
hold you to that standard and push you


---------67:45----------
towards it


---------67:46----------
whereas some parents just tell their


---------67:48----------
kids that they're not good enough and


---------67:49----------
they don't expect


---------67:50----------
maybe it's the expectation of a parent


---------67:52----------
that's different


---------67:54----------
like like expectations yeah like they


---------67:58----------
expect you to do it


---------67:59----------
and you can be disappointing to them


---------68:01----------
absolutely but at least they expect it


---------68:02----------
of you


---------68:03----------
and some parents just you know think


---------68:05----------
their kid isn't good enough and don't


---------68:07----------
expect anything out of them


---------68:09----------
and and then that's actually why they


---------68:11----------
don't do anything because


---------68:13----------
once you don't believe you're capable of


---------68:15----------
anything then


---------68:16----------
there's no point trying whereas like


---------68:19----------
there's still this idea that you have


---------68:21----------
that like


---------68:21----------
if you work hard enough you'll get there


---------68:23----------
one day


---------68:26----------
but some people believe that they're


---------68:27----------
just not capable so you know when they


---------68:29----------
talk about motivation like so i see this


---------68:31----------
a lot where a lot of motivation


---------68:33----------
or problems with motivation they say i


---------68:34----------
lack motivation is really hopelessness


---------68:38----------
underneath because if you're never gonna


---------68:40----------
succeed


---------68:41----------
there's no point in trying and so you


---------68:43----------
have to tackle that


---------68:44----------
you know lack of expectation of


---------68:46----------
capability of yourself


---------68:49----------
maybe that's it i don't know it's a


---------68:52----------
great observation on your part though


---------68:54----------
sounds yeah sounds like that might be it


---------68:57----------
too


---------69:00----------
[Music]


---------69:01----------
it's yeah


---------69:05----------
very eye-opening yeah i don't really


---------69:08----------
i don't really talk about this stuff


---------69:10----------
much


---------69:11----------
um no one does yeah


---------69:15----------
it's a lot of like diving into why


---------69:18----------
why and why yep oh yeah and you don't


---------69:21----------
always know why


---------69:22----------
yeah yeah so i think that's where


---------69:26----------
um you know a big part of like


---------69:29----------
my journey was just asking myself why


---------69:32----------
why and why


---------69:32----------
and and this is where i spent some time


---------69:35----------
sort of training to become a monk


---------69:37----------
and and they that's what we do


---------69:41----------
like when you train like you know you


---------69:42----------
meditate and then like like you


---------69:44----------
ask yourself like why do i have a desire


---------69:47----------
for this thing


---------69:49----------
why do i have a desire for this thing at


---------69:51----------
this moment why am i feeling bad today


---------69:53----------
like so


---------69:53----------
it's sort of like an internal


---------69:56----------
exploration


---------69:58----------
you know you're mapping out the inner


---------70:00----------
world instead of like mapping


---------70:02----------
out the outer world


---------70:06----------
which it sounds like your dad is pretty


---------70:08----------
good at


---------70:12----------
a few months ago he told me he's like


---------70:15----------
he's like ah when you get older you stop


---------70:18----------
caring about a lot of stuff


---------70:19----------
and i was like oh he's just like yo


---------70:22----------
you'll understand when you get here


---------70:24----------
and i mean he's just i don't like he's


---------70:26----------
old like he's older


---------70:27----------
he's not like a grandpa yet i guess but


---------70:30----------
i mean he's like 65


---------70:31----------
so you know like 66 retirement age um


---------70:34----------
but he's like you really stop caring


---------70:36----------
about a lot of stuff


---------70:38----------
when you get to my age she's like all


---------70:40----------
those things that you're feeling right


---------70:41----------
now


---------70:42----------
like you probably won't feel a lot of it


---------70:44----------
in 40 years or 30 years and


---------70:47----------
and my woke asian dad yeah yeah


---------70:51----------
[Laughter]


---------70:55----------
yeah i i'm really loving location


---------71:00----------
yeah it sounds like your dad is is


---------71:02----------
developing detachment or vairagya


---------71:04----------
in sanskrit which is like distance


---------71:07----------
between


---------71:07----------
feelings and things in the world and


---------71:10----------
like how


---------71:11----------
you know how much it pisses you off


---------71:15----------
so one of the one of the other qualities


---------71:18----------
of


---------71:18----------
the final form of the asian bat the


---------71:20----------
final four


---------71:22----------
yeah i think i'm still very angry at


---------71:25----------
random things


---------71:26----------
definitely not detached at all yeah yeah


---------71:29----------
so you


---------71:30----------
so as your dad said dad uses skill


---------71:33----------
wise words and and you know he says


---------71:37----------
he'll get there one day


---------71:39----------
yeah oh it's so funny


---------71:45----------
yeah wendy like i said i you know


---------71:47----------
usually this takes longer but


---------71:49----------
i think you've really opened up and


---------71:53----------
seemed simple today or clear to me yeah


---------71:56----------
i


---------71:57----------
i don't i'm not uh


---------72:01----------
like i'm super okay with talking about


---------72:04----------
feelings


---------72:05----------
it's just i don't like always talk about


---------72:07----------
them but i mean like i i'm


---------72:08----------
really open about talking about feelings


---------72:10----------
so it's like if anybody asks me anything


---------72:12----------
you know it's like i'll


---------72:14----------
just say it as it is yeah


---------72:17----------
i think it's it's great i think it's you


---------72:19----------
know that's a lot of people


---------72:20----------
tend to you know be open


---------72:24----------
to answering but we all feel


---------72:27----------
uncomfortable about


---------72:28----------
volunteering yeah


---------72:32----------
right because it's like it's kind of


---------72:33----------
weird because like people are open books


---------72:35----------
but like you've gotta crack the cover


---------72:39----------
you know they're willing to be open and


---------72:40----------
transparent but someone has to express


---------72:42----------
interest


---------72:43----------
and and i think part of the tricky thing


---------72:45----------
is that nowadays like it's


---------72:46----------
you know it's polite to not inquire


---------72:50----------
and then when we don't ask like if we


---------72:52----------
see someone crying we don't like


---------72:54----------
go over to them and ask like what's


---------72:56----------
wrong


---------72:58----------
you know because we like want to respect


---------72:59----------
their privacy but then they feel


---------73:01----------
isolated it's kind of like a we get


---------73:02----------
stuck between like a rock


---------73:04----------
and a hard place i guess i


---------73:07----------
i really want or i i i'm actually


---------73:11----------
usually the person that inquires


---------73:12----------
like if i see any


---------73:16----------
signs of someone being sad i'll like


---------73:19----------
i'll


---------73:19----------
message them be like are you okay that's


---------73:22----------
really wonderful


---------73:23----------
if they need an ear or like yeah stuff


---------73:25----------
like that


---------73:26----------
i think that makes the world a better


---------73:28----------
place


---------73:30----------
yeah i definitely you know wish


---------73:32----------
everybody can be kind


---------73:33----------
to one another


---------73:38----------
yeah how's your brother doing


---------73:43----------
oh ah i guess he's good


---------73:46----------
i mean we don't really talk much and i


---------73:48----------
wish we talked more


---------73:49----------
but he's he's good he's in china


---------73:53----------
and uh he does like teaching and stuff


---------73:55----------
uh english teaching


---------73:57----------
um but i haven't seen him in years


---------74:00----------
so what's that like


---------74:04----------
um


---------74:07----------
i mean it sucks


---------74:11----------
uh the thing is like my brother and i


---------74:14----------
have a huge age gap


---------74:15----------
and it's only my brother and i like my


---------74:18----------
parents only have two kids


---------74:20----------
um like he's 10 years older than me


---------74:21----------
exactly 10 years


---------74:24----------
so growing up it was like of a pretty


---------74:27----------
crazy dynamic because it was like


---------74:28----------
i was four he was 14 you know um


---------74:31----------
i was 10 he was 20. you know he was


---------74:33----------
already like practically gone by the


---------74:34----------
time i was in my teenage years


---------74:36----------
because he had to go to college and then


---------74:38----------
go to like he did some like


---------74:40----------
training like student teacher training


---------74:42----------
in like china and stuff and


---------74:44----------
he always really liked teaching there um


---------74:47----------
so he did a lot of traveling i didn't


---------74:48----------
see him for a long time i remember like


---------74:50----------
him coming back after a trip and he was


---------74:52----------
like whoa you grew a lot


---------74:55----------
you know and i was like yep i did so


---------74:58----------
does he have uh you said your


---------74:59----------
your parents your parents don't have


---------75:01----------
grandparents so i'm assuming he doesn't


---------75:03----------
have


---------75:03----------
children and neither do i yes


---------75:06----------
neither of us have children yeah and and


---------75:09----------
so he's been in


---------75:10----------
china what sounds like years so he's


---------75:11----------
like settled there


---------75:13----------
yes yeah he's definitely settled there


---------75:16----------
um


---------75:16----------
he wanted to visit in recent years but


---------75:18----------
then covet and


---------75:19----------
whatnot so yeah he didn't end up coming


---------75:22----------
back


---------75:23----------
and then i never really go there either


---------75:25----------
so we just haven't seen each other in a


---------75:27----------
while


---------75:28----------
besides like happy birthday


---------75:31----------
merry christmas and happy new years you


---------75:33----------
know like through text messages we don't


---------75:35----------
really talk too much yeah


---------75:38----------
maybe someone else to reach out to on


---------75:39----------
your off days


---------75:41----------
yeah yeah


---------75:44----------
the time zone difference is a little


---------75:46----------
weird but


---------75:47----------
maybe you can trick yourself into


---------75:48----------
thinking you're being productive by


---------75:50----------
reaching out to your brother yeah


---------75:54----------
somebody i could definitely reach out to


---------75:59----------
so wendy um sometimes on stream we teach


---------76:01----------
meditation


---------76:02----------
are you interested in learning that yeah


---------76:07----------
i'm down let me think


---------76:19----------
have you had any experience with


---------76:20----------
meditation


---------76:22----------
uh i've followed your stream a little


---------76:24----------
bit here and there


---------76:25----------
but that's that's that's about it


---------76:28----------
yeah i think i've done a breathing one


---------76:33----------
before a long time ago in like


---------76:35----------
choir i don't know my choir instructor


---------76:38----------
was like


---------76:38----------
breathe in for this many counts and


---------76:40----------
breathe out for this many counts


---------76:42----------
okay close your eyes and stuff yeah


---------76:53----------
i'm trying to think about whether we


---------76:54----------
should do


---------76:56----------
a meditation around sound or a


---------77:00----------
meditation around


---------77:01----------
breath


---------77:05----------
or we can do both because you are


---------77:08----------
musically oriented


---------77:14----------
um


---------77:24----------
okay i've got one for you okay


---------77:28----------
so i'm going to give you um


---------77:33----------
i'm going to give you kind of an uh task


---------77:36----------
of sorts


---------77:37----------
oh hold on let me think about this


---------77:41----------
how we can do this


---------77:48----------
give me just a second okay


---------77:58----------
okay this is going to sound kind of


---------78:00----------
weird okay so what i want you to do


---------78:02----------
is um i'm going to put forth a


---------78:06----------
hypothesis


---------78:07----------
and i want you to test it okay okay


---------78:10----------
so the hypothesis is that the letter


---------78:13----------
u is at the end of any sound that you


---------78:17----------
can make


---------78:19----------
okay okay so if we think about like like


---------78:22----------
what what sound does the letter b make


---------78:27----------
b or b sorry yeah right


---------78:30----------
so so ba right so there's something


---------78:35----------
yeah i was like what does b uh b okay so


---------78:38----------
so but then what i want you to also do


---------78:40----------
is is listen to the sound


---------78:42----------
b and see if you can find an


---------78:45----------
uh at the end of that so close your eyes


---------78:49----------
and you can try saying it b


---------78:53----------
b and and just really pay attention to


---------78:57----------
the end of it


---------79:00----------
b okay


---------79:04----------
pay attention to the e sound so after


---------79:07----------
the e


---------79:08----------
there's another sound even when you say


---------79:11----------
b


---------79:13----------
b


---------79:21----------
i don't get it it's because it like


---------79:24----------
that's okay


---------79:25----------
it's just it's it's a poorly explained


---------79:28----------
technique um okay let me let me let's


---------79:31----------
try something else


---------79:39----------
let me think let me think let me think


---------79:50----------
okay i've got another technique for us


---------79:53----------
to try okay


---------79:54----------
okay so um this is gonna be sort of like


---------79:57----------
a rotating


---------79:59----------
uh it's gonna be like a rotating


---------80:02----------
awareness technique so what i want you


---------80:04----------
to do


---------80:05----------
is we're going to take deep breaths and


---------80:06----------
what i want you to do is


---------80:08----------
kind of imagine that the breath is going


---------80:11----------
in through your nose


---------80:13----------
up to the top of your head and as you


---------80:15----------
inhale goes all the way down


---------80:17----------
the back of your spine and as you exhale


---------80:20----------
so as you hit the


---------80:21----------
you know the tailbone as you exhale


---------80:24----------
the breath kind of comes via the pubis


---------80:27----------
and then


---------80:28----------
over the navel through the chest and


---------80:30----------
then out the nose


---------80:32----------
okay so as we inhale we're going to


---------80:34----------
rotate our attention


---------80:36----------
i'm giving you hard techniques i don't


---------80:38----------
know why i should probably be getting


---------80:39----------
introductory stuff but


---------80:41----------
you know you're such a hard worker and


---------80:43----------
talented and all that good stuff


---------80:45----------
so breathe in and then kind of follow it


---------80:47----------
up and then around the back of your


---------80:49----------
spine


---------80:51----------
and as you finish your breath you should


---------80:53----------
be at your tailbone and as you exhale


---------80:57----------
over the pubis through the navel


---------81:00----------
through the heart through the base of


---------81:02----------
the throat


---------81:05----------
and then oh actually i guess this is a


---------81:07----------
little bit complicated


---------81:08----------
also back up here and then out the nose


---------81:12----------
okay okay and so along the back what you


---------81:15----------
want to do is


---------81:16----------
you know start here go to the top of


---------81:18----------
your head


---------81:19----------
sort of the the you know the base of


---------81:22----------
your throat so like the part of your


---------81:24----------
spine that is opposite your throat


---------81:26----------
the part of your spine that is behind


---------81:28----------
your heart the part of your spine that


---------81:30----------
is


---------81:31----------
opposite your navel your tailbone


---------81:34----------
and then up the front does that make


---------81:36----------
sense yes okay so


---------81:39----------
sit up straight close your eyes


---------81:43----------
and i'll i'll run you through the


---------81:45----------
breaths


---------81:46----------
at the beginning so i'm gonna do three


---------81:48----------
rounds while i'll walk you through them


---------81:50----------
and then you can you're gonna do five


---------81:52----------
more on your own okay


---------81:53----------
okay so go ahead and exhale to begin


---------81:55----------
with


---------81:58----------
and then through your nose breathe in


---------82:00----------
slowly slowly slowly it goes up to the


---------82:02----------
top of


---------82:03----------
your head along the back of your throat


---------82:08----------
down past your heart down past your


---------82:10----------
navel


---------82:11----------
and into your tailbone and as you exhale


---------82:16----------
across the pubis over the navel


---------82:19----------
through the heart base of your throat


---------82:23----------
up to your eyebrows and then out your


---------82:25----------
nose


---------82:29----------
and now we're gonna go again okay eyes


---------82:31----------
closed


---------82:33----------
breathe in up to the crown of your head


---------82:37----------
back of your throat behind your heart


---------82:41----------
behind your navel bottom of the tailbone


---------82:45----------
and then exhale


---------82:48----------
pubis navel front of your heart


---------82:53----------
base of your throat up to your eyebrows


---------82:56----------
and out and now continue at your own


---------83:00----------
pace


---------83:01----------
and just as you breathe in let your


---------83:03----------
attention rotate


---------83:04----------
in that circuit we're going to do we're


---------83:07----------
going to practice for about 60 seconds


---------83:18----------
okay


---------83:46----------
c


---------84:28----------
for


---------84:42----------
what


---------84:44----------
no i just i don't have a good time of 60


---------84:47----------
seconds i was like did i


---------84:49----------
breathe too long or did i breathe too


---------84:51----------
short


---------84:52----------
you did fine i i should have been a


---------84:54----------
little bit more clear i think


---------84:55----------
something about maybe my teaching styles


---------84:57----------
off today no


---------84:58----------
no no no it's fine what was what was


---------85:01----------
that practice like


---------85:04----------
relaxing it was like


---------85:07----------
yeah it was very relaxing and it was


---------85:11----------
funny because i was trying to


---------85:14----------
follow my air through my body and it


---------85:17----------
and then when i went back up to like


---------85:19----------
here and then down through my nose it


---------85:21----------
like kind of tickled


---------85:22----------
a little bit because i was it's just


---------85:24----------
yeah


---------85:25----------
good so kind of feeling the air


---------85:28----------
fantastic right so the goal of


---------85:31----------
meditation is to bring your attention to


---------85:33----------
the present


---------85:35----------
um and then sort of just as if you're


---------85:38----------
sitting with an experience that's


---------85:39----------
perfectly fine


---------85:40----------
let me ask you i know this could be hard


---------85:42----------
to understand having done it so little


---------85:44----------
but did you feel like sometimes your


---------85:47----------
breath or attention would stall at a


---------85:50----------
particular place in your body


---------85:54----------
yes because i i don't know for some


---------85:55----------
reason i was like having a mental


---------85:57----------
or i was like trying to follow and i was


---------85:59----------
like wait did i go to that part


---------86:01----------
go back so i was like trying to like


---------86:04----------
yeah when you were telling me where to


---------86:07----------
like


---------86:08----------
uh where my air travels it was like


---------86:10----------
really smooth but when i did it on my


---------86:11----------
own it was not as smooth yeah and do you


---------86:13----------
know if there was a particular place


---------86:15----------
that you would stumble around


---------86:17----------
um yeah i guess just like the


---------86:20----------
end of my breathing so around like the


---------86:22----------
spine area


---------86:24----------
like of the back the the bottom of your


---------86:26----------
spine yeah the bottom


---------86:28----------
okay and then was there uh was the


---------86:32----------
exhalation pretty smooth or would that


---------86:34----------
also


---------86:34----------
kind of like where you like you know


---------86:38----------
imagine you're driving a manual and it


---------86:39----------
kind of like


---------86:41----------
doesn't start quite right so did you


---------86:43----------
like stall at the bottom


---------86:45----------
on your way out or was it pretty smooth


---------86:46----------
on the way out


---------86:48----------
uh i think it stalled because i was


---------86:52----------
like like again i was thinking about


---------86:54----------
which part it was traveling through


---------86:56----------
um but generally it's like pretty smooth


---------86:58----------
yeah


---------86:59----------
okay generally but it seems like you get


---------87:00----------
kind of stuck around the bottom


---------87:02----------
yeah yeah okay


---------87:07----------
okay yeah keep doing it um


---------87:11----------
not now but just in general okay so so i


---------87:14----------
i think


---------87:14----------
you know you can try this technique out


---------87:16----------
i would say do it for three to five


---------87:18----------
minutes a day


---------87:19----------
ideally every day but i think you can


---------87:21----------
start with like


---------87:22----------
three days a week


---------87:27----------
you know i think eventually what you


---------87:29----------
want to do so the science on meditation


---------87:31----------
suggests that if you can practice


---------87:33----------
20 minutes a day for three days a week


---------87:37----------
that's the minimum required to really


---------87:39----------
like literally rewire your brain


---------87:43----------
so like stress indicators and things


---------87:45----------
like that will improve


---------87:47----------
um but if you know if you can do 20


---------87:49----------
minutes a day five days a week that's


---------87:50----------
totally fine


---------87:51----------
you don't have to do this practice for


---------87:53----------
20 minutes


---------87:55----------
so you you can do this for three to five


---------87:56----------
you know check out our other youtube


---------87:57----------
videos or


---------87:58----------
you know reach out to me at some point


---------88:00----------
if you have more questions about


---------88:01----------
meditation or things like that


---------88:03----------
um yeah and then oh


---------88:06----------
sorry do you have a recommendation on


---------88:08----------
when you should do them or


---------88:10----------
like is it like when you wake up like


---------88:12----------
before you sleep so meditation is the


---------88:14----------
is the most fruitful at dawn and dusk


---------88:19----------
oh okay so i don't know if you're up at


---------88:22----------
dawn


---------88:23----------
but if you're in canada i'm definitely


---------88:26----------
up


---------88:26----------
yeah because you're up late or up early


---------88:29----------
yeah off late


---------88:30----------
okay i haven't slept yet uh-huh so i i


---------88:33----------
would say you know when dawn rolls


---------88:34----------
around


---------88:35----------
then um you know you'll


---------88:38----------
that's when it's the most fruitful the


---------88:40----------
other thing that's a little bit tricky i


---------88:41----------
don't know if you noticed but


---------88:43----------
one of your nostrils is going to be more


---------88:44----------
closed than the other


---------88:48----------
can you tell which one


---------88:52----------
ah this one's more open this one's my


---------88:54----------
right


---------88:56----------
the moment of dawn or dusk both of them


---------89:00----------
will open up


---------89:01----------
and it's [ __ ] weird i know so


---------89:04----------
if you can do that practice during the


---------89:06----------
period of time


---------89:07----------
where they're both open then it'll be


---------89:09----------
the most fruitful


---------89:12----------
sorcery yes


---------89:16----------
okay okay i'll try it i'll try it yeah


---------89:19----------
just try it


---------89:20----------
yeah you'll be it's one of the weirdest


---------89:22----------
[ __ ] things in the universe okay


---------89:25----------
i don't even quite understand it but


---------89:27----------
there's something about being in rhythm


---------89:29----------
with the universe


---------89:31----------
i don't know how any of that [ __ ] works


---------89:32----------
it's just weird it used to be my alarm


---------89:35----------
clock


---------89:35----------
it's like oh okay but anyway


---------89:39----------
um any other questions cool um


---------89:44----------
no i think i'm good so one last thing


---------89:47----------
wendy you know it may be worthwhile for


---------89:49----------
you to see a therapist i don't know if


---------89:51----------
you ever have


---------89:52----------
but if you wanna like if you find that


---------89:54----------
this is really a problem like not a bad


---------89:56----------
idea to work with someone


---------89:57----------
you can also work with i'm not really


---------89:59----------
seeing a huge need for


---------90:01----------
um you know therapy i'm not hearing


---------90:04----------
anything that i think is clinically


---------90:05----------
concerning


---------90:06----------
you know i don't diagnose people over


---------90:07----------
the internet so you know that being said


---------90:09----------
but


---------90:10----------
um you know you can certainly work on


---------90:12----------
the stuff if you feel like you do want


---------90:14----------
