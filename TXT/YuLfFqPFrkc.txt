---------00:00----------
just generally speaking like if someone


---------00:02----------
wants to look for a therapist like how


---------00:04----------
should they go about that


---------00:05----------
it's a great question so i'm gonna


---------00:08----------
reserve my answers for


---------00:10----------
primarily the u.s um because systems are


---------00:13----------
a little bit different


---------00:14----------
in in in other parts of the world


---------00:19----------
so the first question in the united


---------00:21----------
states is do you have insurance or do


---------00:22----------
you not have insurance


---------00:24----------
so if you do have insurance


---------00:28----------
all right so that's a big dividing line


---------00:31----------
but the first thing that you can do is


---------00:32----------
if you have any kind of doctor like if


---------00:34----------
you have a general practitioner or


---------00:36----------
primary care physician


---------00:37----------
you can ask them for like


---------00:40----------
mental health support or evaluation or


---------00:43----------
referral


---------00:44----------
so you can say hey i'm concerned i may


---------00:46----------
be depressed and i was wondering like


---------00:48----------
if you had any recommendations for like


---------00:50----------
how i could get evaluated or if i could


---------00:52----------
see someone


---------00:53----------
so start with your doctor because it's


---------00:55----------
their job to like connect you to


---------00:57----------
appropriate


---------00:58----------
care second thing is


---------01:01----------
um so


---------01:04----------
if you have insurance you can actually


---------01:06----------
contact your insurance company and say


---------01:08----------
hey i'm interested in finding a mental


---------01:10----------
health provider


---------01:11----------
can i have a list of people in my area


---------01:13----------
who


---------01:15----------
provide therapy and then your insurance


---------01:17----------
company will give you like literally a


---------01:19----------
list


---------01:20----------
nowadays like insurance companies have


---------01:22----------
largely moved online so you may just be


---------01:24----------
able to search like in


---------01:26----------
you log into your like online insurance


---------01:28----------
account and then you


---------01:29----------
can search and so you can find find


---------01:31----------
providers who take your insurance


---------01:33----------
if you find a provider who takes your


---------01:35----------
insurance the insurance will cover most


---------01:37----------
of it


---------01:37----------
and then you may have to pay anywhere


---------01:39----------
between like a 15


---------01:41----------
and 50 copay depending on you know the


---------01:44----------
the particular


---------01:45----------
provider um and then your insurance


---------01:48----------
company will pay


---------01:50----------
them anywhere between 100 and 300


---------01:53----------
per visit and then you'll pay like 15 to


---------01:55----------
50.


---------01:57----------
so those are the two simplest ways a


---------01:58----------
couple of things that are really good


---------02:00----------
now is that you can search um their


---------02:04----------
websites like psychology today is a good


---------02:06----------
example


---------02:07----------
uh zen care is another one that's like


---------02:09----------
in a few united uh


---------02:10----------
u.s cities um that you can search for


---------02:14----------
therapists


---------02:15----------
like in your area and then you can see


---------02:17----------
their profiles you can see what they


---------02:18----------
specialize in


---------02:19----------
you can oftentimes also search based on


---------02:21----------
like whether they take insurance or they


---------02:23----------
don't take insurance


---------02:24----------
um so you can kind of find a provider


---------02:26----------
that way


---------02:28----------
if you don't have insurance a couple of


---------02:30----------
things that you can do is you can


---------02:31----------
like just put in your location like in


---------02:33----------
google


---------02:34----------
and type in community mental health


---------02:36----------
center so community mental health


---------02:39----------
centers


---------02:40----------
provide services for people who


---------02:41----------
otherwise can't afford them they get


---------02:43----------
like federal or state funding


---------02:45----------
to provide a necessary service and they


---------02:47----------
can actually get compensated


---------02:49----------
for seeing you despite you not having


---------02:52----------
insurance


---------02:53----------
um so they can oftentimes provide a lot


---------02:55----------
of free care


---------02:57----------
the other thing that community mental


---------02:58----------
health centers can do is help you get


---------03:00----------
insurance


---------03:01----------
so they can even walk you through the


---------03:02----------
process of getting like


---------03:04----------
some kind of insurance that may not cost


---------03:06----------
you anything


---------03:07----------
um so you can get like state medicaid or


---------03:10----------
things like that so


---------03:14----------
and the last thing that you can do is


---------03:16----------
even if you don't have insurance you can


---------03:18----------
just


---------03:18----------
ask providers uh if they have any like


---------03:21----------
free care slots available


---------03:23----------
so i about 50 to 70 of the people that i


---------03:26----------
see in my practice i don't charge money


---------03:28----------
for


---------03:28----------
historically um and so you know i think


---------03:32----------
a lot of providers


---------03:34----------
thankfully are you know that we're in it


---------03:35----------
to help people so


---------03:37----------
we um are you know okay sometimes taking


---------03:41----------
people who can't pay if we feel like we


---------03:43----------
can really help them and


---------03:45----------
things like that so i i don't think you


---------03:47----------
know most providers don't have that


---------03:48----------
percentage but most providers will have


---------03:51----------
you know a few slots open for people at


---------03:53----------
reduced fees or no fees


---------03:56----------
um so that's that's what i would say the


---------03:59----------
the next thing is that i would i would


---------04:01----------
recommend that people don't just see one


---------04:03----------
person


---------04:04----------
so if you do have the resources or


---------04:06----------
availability


---------04:07----------
you actually schedule like three


---------04:09----------
appointments with three different people


---------04:10----------
like


---------04:11----------
two weeks apart and then what you do is


---------04:15----------
like you try


---------04:16----------
like if the first person you don't like


---------04:19----------
you like see the second person


---------04:21----------
and if you don't like the second person


---------04:23----------
then you see the third person


---------04:24----------
then you kind of pick your favorite but


---------04:26----------
if you like the first person that felt


---------04:27----------
like a good fit and you feel like you


---------04:29----------
can talk to them you can cancel the


---------04:30----------
other appointments


---------04:32----------
but i think a lot of times people will


---------04:33----------
judge therapy as a whole


---------04:35----------
based on an individual provider and case


---------04:39----------
in point you know you can't really judge


---------04:41----------
haircuts based on a particular haircut


---------04:43----------
like it takes a while to find like a


---------04:45----------
good place


---------04:46----------
where you like getting your hair cut um


---------04:48----------
you know it can take a while to find


---------04:50----------
your favorite restaurant


---------04:51----------
and so you can't judge all sushi based


---------04:53----------
on one sushi restaurant there are


---------04:54----------
different kinds of sushi restaurants


---------04:56----------
so therapy is the same way does that


---------04:59----------
answer your question


---------05:00----------
yeah kind of building off on that how do


---------05:02----------
you know if a therapist is like good for


---------05:05----------
you


---------05:05----------
like is there stuff you can look out for


---------05:08----------
yeah so i think the biggest thing is


---------05:09----------
like does the person


---------05:10----------
do you feel like the person understands


---------05:12----------
you and do you guys have like a good


---------05:14----------
talking relationship do you feel like


---------05:16----------
you could come back and talk to this


---------05:17----------
person for like


---------05:19----------
the next couple of months like once a


---------05:21----------
week


---------05:22----------
or do you feel like they you know if if


---------05:24----------
it felt yeah that's that's really the


---------05:25----------
biggest thing


---------05:27----------
it's not about their background it's not


---------05:28----------
about their degree it's not about where


---------05:30----------
they trained it's like can i actually


---------05:31----------
sit with this person in a room


---------05:34----------
for one hour a week for like somewhere


---------05:36----------
between three to six months


---------05:38----------
and if the answer is yes then go for it


---------05:41----------
like why three to six months


---------05:45----------
um well that's kind of the minimum but


---------05:48----------
like the the idea is that you


---------05:49----------
you should have a sense that you can


---------05:51----------
come back and see this person


---------05:53----------
over and over again does that make sense


---------05:57----------
oh okay yeah i was just wondering if


---------05:59----------
there was like any


---------06:01----------
like statistics you're pulling from or


---------06:03----------
if it's more just


---------06:05----------
a long-term relationship that you can


---------06:07----------
build sort of yeah


---------06:08----------
it's more about that okay cool um


---------06:12----------
is there like certain kinds of therapy


---------06:14----------
that you should look out for or


---------06:17----------
like it does it depend on the problem


---------06:20----------
uh so


---------06:23----------
i think you should should try a couple


---------06:26----------
of things


---------06:27----------
so some kinds of therapy are very very


---------06:29----------
different


---------06:30----------
um so a good like kind of like


---------06:35----------
division is there's a branch of therapy


---------06:37----------
that's called


---------06:38----------
like based on something called cognitive


---------06:40----------
behavioral therapy


---------06:42----------
which is a therapy that's sort of like


---------06:44----------
very kind of like rigorous and


---------06:46----------
and kind of like it's almost more like


---------06:48----------
engineering or scientific


---------06:50----------
so they try to help you understand the


---------06:52----------
relationship between your thoughts


---------06:54----------
your emotions and your behaviors so


---------06:57----------
cognitive behavioral therapists will


---------06:58----------
give you


---------06:59----------
like exercises and like lots of kind of


---------07:01----------
stuff to think about


---------07:02----------
and do cognitive behavioral therapy is


---------07:05----------
like


---------07:05----------
it's more active um


---------07:08----------
and it's not just like sort of talking


---------07:10----------
about your feelings


---------07:11----------
the other big branch of psychotherapy is


---------07:14----------
like psychodynamic psychotherapy which


---------07:17----------
is like talking about your feelings


---------07:19----------
so it's a little bit more free form


---------07:23----------
it can sometimes take a little bit


---------07:24----------
longer to like get to the good stuff


---------07:28----------
but like i think the question is like do


---------07:29----------
you want something that's more


---------07:31----------
structured


---------07:31----------
are you someone that like approaches


---------07:33----------
therapy and says in 16 weeks i want my


---------07:36----------
social anxiety to be like


---------07:39----------
better to the point where i can go out


---------07:42----------
and i can actually engage with people


---------07:43----------
without


---------07:44----------
being like anxious all the time or


---------07:47----------
are you someone that wants to understand


---------07:50----------
like the roots


---------07:51----------
of your problem and like are willing to


---------07:53----------
invest more time


---------07:55----------
so it's kind of like are you like root


---------07:57----------
focused or result focused


---------08:00----------
and those are the two big divisions at


---------08:01----------
least you know how i'm


---------08:03----------
setting them aside right now in therapy


---------08:05----------
is like cbt's


---------08:07----------
is like very results-focused very sort


---------08:09----------
of like western in its approach it's


---------08:11----------
like let's go for


---------08:12----------
outcomes let's go for like improvement


---------08:14----------
in particular things


---------08:16----------
psychodynamic therapy is like let's help


---------08:17----------
you understand yourself


---------08:19----------
and let's help you understand like your


---------08:21----------
patterns and things like that


---------08:24----------
those are the big divisions i mean there


---------08:26----------
are lots of other kinds but


---------08:28----------
all right awesome uh so when


---------08:31----------
people generally go to a therapist if


---------08:34----------
they feel like something is wrong


---------08:35----------
so i i guess let me even back up before


---------08:38----------
that so it's like


---------08:40----------
a sign that you have cancer is like a


---------08:41----------
lump or if you have the flu you have a


---------08:43----------
cough is there stuff that you can look


---------08:44----------
out for that would kind of


---------08:47----------
say you should go to a therapist


---------08:50----------
yeah so that's a great question so let's


---------08:54----------
start by remembering that going to a


---------08:56----------
therapist is not


---------08:57----------
about treating something it's about


---------09:00----------
getting something checked out


---------09:02----------
right so if you have a lump it doesn't


---------09:04----------
mean you have cancer it just means that


---------09:06----------
you should get someone who knows


---------09:08----------
to take a look at it so that they can


---------09:10----------
tell you whether it's cancer or not


---------09:12----------
cancer


---------09:14----------
so i would say therapy is the same way


---------09:16----------
so if you don't


---------09:17----------
know like if you're feeling sad or down


---------09:19----------
every day or you're having trouble


---------09:21----------
getting stuck


---------09:22----------
like feeling stuck in life and you don't


---------09:24----------
know is it just because i'm lazy or


---------09:26----------
could i have


---------09:27----------
like clinical depression


---------09:30----------
that's when you should go see someone


---------09:32----------
because it's not your job to know it's


---------09:34----------
their job


---------09:35----------
to tell you and figure it out and help


---------09:37----------
you out


---------09:38----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------09:40----------
i think generally speaking people should


---------09:41----------
have a very low


---------09:43----------
threshold to go and see a therapist for


---------09:45----------
an evaluation or psychiatrist


---------09:47----------
in fact i think it's like i honestly


---------09:49----------
think that everyone in our community


---------09:51----------
could benefit from a mental health


---------09:52----------
evaluation


---------09:53----------
it's almost like an annual physical just


---------09:55----------
go check get checked out


---------09:58----------
now so that i think sort of answers your


---------10:02----------
question


---------10:02----------
the second part is like when do you know


---------10:04----------
if you really need to talk to someone


---------10:06----------
and i'd say that like if you're


---------10:08----------
suffering or struggling


---------10:10----------
or you feel like you're not able to do


---------10:13----------
what you should be doing


---------10:14----------
then i think that's another reason to


---------10:16----------
get an evaluation


---------10:18----------
so in psychiatry what we look at is


---------10:20----------
impairment of function


---------10:22----------
so how do i decide if someone is


---------10:24----------
depressed or sad


---------10:26----------
like as a psychiatrist what i look at is


---------10:28----------
is there sadness


---------10:29----------
interfering with their ability to


---------10:30----------
function are they not able to work are


---------10:33----------
they not able to


---------10:34----------
do school or like is school


---------10:36----------
significantly impacted


---------10:37----------
is work significantly impacted are they


---------10:39----------
not able to maintain relationships


---------10:42----------
and so function is impacted then you


---------10:44----------
should definitely go see someone


---------10:48----------
okay cool um so like if someone


---------10:52----------
this gets kind of confusing just because


---------10:54----------
it's like you can feel depressed without


---------10:56----------
being


---------10:57----------
like having the clinical depression


---------10:59----------
right but if you


---------11:00----------
think or if you have an inkling that you


---------11:02----------
have like depression you should probably


---------11:04----------
go get checked out right


---------11:07----------
right you should just go get a value


---------11:08----------
rating it's just like a lump that needs


---------11:11----------
to be looked at by a doctor


---------11:14----------
going along with that if someone is


---------11:16----------
resistant to


---------11:17----------
going to therapy do you think that's a


---------11:20----------
sign or how


---------11:21----------
would how would you interpret that


---------11:24----------
i think that's a question about why


---------11:26----------
they're resistant to


---------11:28----------
going for therapy right so like what


---------11:30----------
makes you hesitant


---------11:33----------
to go that's worth exploring


---------11:37----------
so there can be all kinds of answers is


---------11:39----------
it because you don't think there's


---------11:41----------
anything wrong with you


---------11:42----------
is it because you don't think it's gonna


---------11:43----------
help like you're hopeless


---------11:46----------
is it because


---------11:50----------
you don't think it's gonna work is it


---------11:52----------
because of the label


---------11:55----------
is it because you don't want to get


---------11:57----------
prescribed medication or you don't want


---------11:58----------
to be like


---------12:00----------
you know dependent on something for the


---------12:02----------
rest of your life


---------12:03----------
it can also be because you want to do it


---------12:05----------
on your own


---------12:06----------
right so some people are like yeah i


---------12:08----------
want to conquer this problem on my own


---------12:10----------
i don't want anyone's help i want to do


---------12:11----------
it my way and i want to do it by myself


---------12:15----------
so there can be all kinds of reasons so


---------12:18----------
i think you should look at those


---------12:20----------
is there anything do you think a person


---------12:22----------
could do in terms of like


---------12:23----------
labels or judgments because if someone's


---------12:27----------
if someone feels there's a stigma to


---------12:28----------
going to therapy like


---------12:30----------
but they they i don't know how else to


---------12:32----------
explain but they may benefit from it


---------12:34----------
like how could they overcome that


---------12:39----------
so if you're talking about overcoming


---------12:41----------
stigma i think like the biggest


---------12:44----------
source of overcoming that is experience


---------12:47----------
right so like you should be a critical


---------12:49----------
thinker


---------12:50----------
about your own beliefs and ask yourself


---------12:53----------
why do i have these perceptions of


---------12:55----------
therapy or psychiatry


---------12:57----------
and then you should try it it's kind of


---------12:59----------
like yeah like i so


---------13:01----------
you know it's kind of like people i mean


---------13:03----------
i know most people eat sushi now but


---------13:05----------
like


---------13:05----------
you know when i was growing up like not


---------13:07----------
not many people eastern east texas like


---------13:09----------
ate sushi


---------13:10----------
they thought the thought of eating raw


---------13:11----------
fish was disgusting


---------13:14----------
because it's like you know you go to the


---------13:15----------
grocery store and you see like the fish


---------13:17----------
counter


---------13:18----------
and like you like i'm not gonna eat that


---------13:20----------
raw like you gotta cook that


---------13:22----------
and and so like you know how do you get


---------13:25----------
someone to try sushi like you have to


---------13:26----------
get them to try it once


---------13:28----------
and then like if they try sushi then


---------13:30----------
like most people eat sushi after they


---------13:32----------
try it


---------13:33----------
and they're like oh this is actually


---------13:34----------
pretty good and so i think the biggest


---------13:37----------
thing to overcome stigma is to


---------13:38----------
understand like why do you feel that way


---------13:41----------
and what's the harm in like actually


---------13:43----------
trying it


---------13:44----------
before you make a judgment


---------13:47----------
and that's really what overcome stigma


---------13:49----------
is actual experience


---------13:52----------
another thing people are saying about


---------13:53----------
hesitant to therapy is money i was


---------13:55----------
wondering if you


---------13:57----------
like had any resources or ways around


---------13:59----------
that


---------14:00----------
yeah so so this is why i think like


---------14:03----------
organizations like rise above the


---------14:05----------
disorder are fantastic


---------14:07----------
so rad is actually committed to


---------14:09----------
delivering


---------14:10----------
mental health services to our community


---------14:13----------
in spite of people's like inability to


---------14:14----------
pay so they get they're a non-profit


---------14:16----------
they get funded actually by the industry


---------14:18----------
i think riot games gave them like a


---------14:20----------
gigantic pile of money


---------14:22----------
um and so you know there are


---------14:24----------
organizations out there that are


---------14:25----------
committed to helping you


---------14:26----------
so you can check out rad the other thing


---------14:30----------
is that if you're a student


---------14:32----------
oftentimes you have a student mental


---------14:34----------
health clinic or like you have you know


---------14:36----------
university health services


---------14:38----------
um if you're like a high school student


---------14:40----------
if you have like a school counselor like


---------14:42----------
so your school will actually provide


---------14:43----------
stuff for you


---------14:45----------
um and and like i said earlier like


---------14:47----------
community mental health centers will


---------14:49----------
usually provide free services to people


---------14:52----------
and then the last thing you can do is as


---------14:55----------
you know send


---------14:56----------
emails to people and basically kind of


---------14:58----------
bag it can be a little bit humiliating


---------15:00----------
but you can say hey i'd really like to


---------15:01----------
work with you if you find a profile that


---------15:03----------
you like


---------15:04----------
i'd really like to work with you i don't


---------15:05----------
think i can afford your rates


---------15:07----------
is there any option and sometimes people


---------15:10----------
will say yeah


---------15:14----------
even on the therapy websites you'll see


---------15:16----------
that like


---------15:17----------
they have an option for sliding scale so


---------15:19----------
some therapists will even like check a


---------15:21----------
box that says yeah i do a sliding scale


---------15:24----------
i mean sliding scale means that they'll


---------15:26----------
charge you like something along the


---------15:28----------
lines of what you can afford


---------15:31----------
and another interesting thing was you


---------15:33----------
said that like kind of the diy


---------15:36----------
um i kind of want to get more thoughts


---------15:39----------
more of your thoughts


---------15:40----------
about that like people who want to kind


---------15:44----------
of diy mental health


---------15:46----------
yeah so i think that that's reasonable


---------15:51----------
but you should still probably get


---------15:53----------
evaluated


---------15:55----------
so i don't think that mental health is


---------15:58----------
all


---------15:59----------
mental illness that requires treatment


---------16:02----------
so there you know there are lots of


---------16:04----------
stories and people


---------16:06----------
you know myself included that


---------16:09----------
changed a lot of their mental health


---------16:12----------
through practices that were not


---------16:13----------
treatment and so i think that that's


---------16:17----------
okay


---------16:17----------
but like i think that if you're the real


---------16:19----------
question there about diy


---------16:21----------
is like can you afford to take the time


---------16:26----------
to figure things out and what are the


---------16:28----------
consequences if you fail


---------16:30----------
so when i really think about mental


---------16:31----------
health services and when not to do it


---------16:33----------
diy it really depends on time


---------16:35----------
so if i have like a sophomore in like


---------16:38----------
let's say college


---------16:40----------
and like they're struggling with


---------16:41----------
depression i would try to get them in


---------16:43----------
treatment


---------16:44----------
fast because if they [ __ ] around for a


---------16:46----------
year and their depression causes them to


---------16:48----------
like fail a few classes


---------16:50----------
that can alter their trajectory for the


---------16:52----------
rest of their life


---------16:54----------
um it can affect chances to get into


---------16:56----------
grad school it can get affect


---------16:58----------
you know job prospects and things like


---------17:00----------
that so depending on the consequences


---------17:03----------
i i do think that sort of like so i


---------17:04----------
think it's worthwhile to get evaluated


---------17:07----------
and see if you actually have like a


---------17:08----------
clinical thing and then let the


---------17:10----------
psychiatrist or therapist weigh in about


---------17:12----------
like you know


---------17:15----------
whether treatment is necessary or not so


---------17:18----------
i have


---------17:18----------
a lot of people who come to me and they


---------17:20----------
say like i don't want medications and


---------17:22----------
i'll say okay i think they'll help you


---------17:23----------
but if you don't want it what i'll do is


---------17:25----------
come up with a plan for them and i'll be


---------17:27----------
like okay like let's set some targets


---------17:29----------
so i'm going to teach you how to


---------17:30----------
meditate we're going to talk once a week


---------17:32----------
we're going to track these particular


---------17:34----------
things and if by a certain time


---------17:38----------
you don't see a certain kind of


---------17:40----------
improvement


---------17:41----------
then i'd like to talk to you about


---------17:43----------
medications again


---------17:46----------
and so the diy route i'd sort of think


---------17:48----------
about it like that like think about it


---------17:50----------
like


---------17:51----------
you know what's your target and when are


---------17:53----------
you expecting results by


---------17:56----------
and if you don't see those then you


---------17:58----------
should really think about getting help


---------18:01----------
and then the other thing about diy is


---------18:03----------
i'd go ahead and get evaluated and make


---------18:04----------
sure that it's safe for you to like not


---------18:07----------
you know to avoid treatment for some


---------18:09----------
amount of time or delay treatment


---------18:11----------
another thing people are saying in terms


---------18:13----------
of


---------18:15----------
uh resistance to going to therapy is


---------18:18----------
they just feel like hopeless um it's not


---------18:21----------
like they're suicidal but they just


---------18:22----------
don't


---------18:23----------
they just feel like everything is a


---------18:24----------
waste of time there's like no point


---------18:25----------
living


---------18:26----------
how like how would you even begin to if


---------18:28----------
you're that person


---------18:29----------
help themselves or if you know them like


---------18:32----------
help them


---------18:36----------
um so that's kind of hard


---------18:39----------
right because what i actually do with


---------18:42----------
those people


---------18:42----------
is not something that i can advise on


---------18:45----------
stream


---------18:46----------
so what i actually do with those people


---------18:48----------
is like


---------18:50----------
you talk to them about why things are


---------18:52----------
hopeless and like you don't try to


---------18:53----------
convince them otherwise


---------18:55----------
you actually like try to see their


---------18:57----------
hopelessness for what it is


---------18:59----------
and meet them where they're at and then


---------19:02----------
together


---------19:03----------
you try to work with them to see if


---------19:05----------
there's like any road


---------19:08----------
forward


---------19:10----------
which i know is like so so that's that's


---------19:12----------
like so people think that what we do on


---------19:14----------
stream is therapy and like what i


---------19:15----------
actually do in therapy is like quite


---------19:16----------
different


---------19:18----------
and and so so you know it's it's


---------19:19----------
actually meeting people where they're at


---------19:21----------
which is like okay if you feel like your


---------19:22----------
life is hopeless like tell me about that


---------19:24----------
let's talk about why your life is


---------19:26----------
hopeless and then


---------19:28----------
you you don't disagree with anything


---------19:30----------
that they say and then you see like


---------19:31----------
after they've laid out why things are


---------19:32----------
hopeless


---------19:33----------
is there anything left that's worth


---------19:35----------
exploring


---------19:36----------
and that's usually what works but i


---------19:39----------
think that that's a very difficult


---------19:41----------
process to do on your own


---------19:43----------
because generally speaking if you had


---------19:46----------
like most people who were hopeless


---------19:48----------
weren't born that way their hopelessness


---------19:50----------
comes


---------19:51----------
from having hope trying something and


---------19:54----------
getting shot down


---------19:55----------
and then trying something else and


---------19:57----------
getting shut down again


---------19:59----------
trying the third thing the fourth thing


---------20:00----------
the fifth thing the sixth thing the


---------20:01----------
seventh thing and getting shot down


---------20:04----------
seven eight nine ten times 11 times 12


---------20:06----------
times


---------20:07----------
and so it's really hard to ask someone


---------20:10----------
on their own who's been shot down


---------20:12----------
so many times to try to find hope


---------20:18----------
and and so like all you know is failure


---------20:21----------
then like


---------20:22----------
it's hard for you to by yourself kind of


---------20:24----------
come out of that


---------20:25----------
so i guess what i would tell those


---------20:27----------
people is understand that like that's


---------20:29----------
your experience


---------20:31----------
but other people may be able to help you


---------20:35----------
with that


---------20:35----------
because at the end of the day like the


---------20:37----------
problem for people who are hopeless is


---------20:39----------
that


---------20:39----------
they've been living their lives on their


---------20:42----------
own


---------20:43----------
and like it can really help to have you


---------20:45----------
know you like you're playing a


---------20:46----------
multiplayer game single


---------20:48----------
player like it's kind of like you can


---------20:50----------
get an npc henchman


---------20:52----------
that can supplement your weaknesses and


---------20:55----------
you would be amazed at what you can


---------20:56----------
accomplish


---------20:58----------
right it's like if you're playing like a


---------20:59----------
fighter or rogue and you have like a


---------21:01----------
dedicated healer just like


---------21:03----------
sitting there like casting buffs on you


---------21:06----------
like you can do a lot better at life


---------21:09----------
and so it's not wrong for the rogue to


---------21:11----------
think that they like


---------21:12----------
they're gonna fail because they just


---------21:13----------
keep on wiping like you can go into a


---------21:15----------
raid boss


---------21:16----------
as a single person and wipe over and


---------21:18----------
over and over and over and over again


---------21:20----------
and then you can logically conclude


---------21:21----------
there's no way like this boss is ob the


---------21:23----------
game is broke


---------21:24----------
but like get a healer and then try


---------21:28----------
what's interesting about that analogy is


---------21:30----------
someone just said use people but it's


---------21:32----------
like it's a mutually beneficial thing


---------21:33----------
right sure


---------21:39----------
i mean generally speaking they get


---------21:41----------
compensated right so you're not using


---------21:43----------
there's an exchange but sometimes they


---------21:46----------
don't get compensated and that's okay


---------21:47----------
too


---------21:51----------
right as long as like both both as long


---------21:53----------
as both parties are aware of what's


---------21:54----------
going on so like when i do see like a


---------21:56----------
free care patient like


---------21:57----------
i know they're not paying me they know


---------21:58----------
they're not paying me that's cool


---------22:01----------
go for it bro no problem with that as


---------22:04----------
long as both sides are aware


---------22:05----------
i think using people sounds like


---------22:07----------
manipulative


---------22:09----------
because i think there's like there's a


---------22:10----------
lack of transparency


---------22:12----------
but i think if you know if someone how


---------22:15----------
can i say this like if you're if you've


---------22:16----------
got a flat tire on the side of the road


---------22:19----------
and someone like pulls over and they try


---------22:21----------
to help you with your flat tire


---------22:23----------
there's no confusion that this is a


---------22:25----------
one-way relationship that's not gonna be


---------22:27----------
compensated which is fine


---------22:28----------
you could say that you're using them to


---------22:30----------
help you with your flat tire


---------22:32----------
but as long as you're transparent from


---------22:34----------
the beginning i think that's fine people


---------22:35----------
it's okay to like


---------22:36----------
have a one-way relationship that's not


---------22:38----------
even


---------22:41----------
using people implies that it's


---------22:43----------
manipulative or you're like


---------22:45----------
have an ulterior motive so that's


---------22:47----------
happened to me too


---------22:49----------
where people will tell me yeah no like i


---------22:51----------
can i can pay you


---------22:52----------
and then they won't pay me that's


---------22:54----------
different i'd be like just


---------22:56----------
tell me you can't pay me and i would


---------22:57----------
have been fine with it but it sucks to


---------23:00----------
tell me that you can pay me and then


---------23:01----------
like you don't pay me


---------23:07----------
i don't know if that was too far no that


---------23:10----------
i think that explains it


---------23:11----------
um switching gears a little bit i was


---------23:14----------
wondering if there's any limitations to


---------23:16----------
therapy


---------23:17----------
or like i'll start there yeah


---------23:20----------
yeah so i'd say the biggest limitation


---------23:22----------
to therapy is therapy is not going to


---------23:23----------
fix you


---------23:26----------
so like therapy is like you know like


---------23:29----------
the healer and rogue analogy


---------23:32----------
like the healer's there to heal you but


---------23:33----------
like you still have to do the dps


---------23:36----------
the healer's not going to down the raid


---------23:37----------
boss for you he was just going to heal


---------23:39----------
you


---------23:39----------
he's still got to do the work so a lot


---------23:42----------
of people


---------23:43----------
come to therapy thinking that if i show


---------23:45----------
up here


---------23:46----------
for one hour a week for the next six


---------23:48----------
months my problems will be solved


---------23:50----------
not how it works the patients that have


---------23:54----------
benefited the most


---------23:55----------
from my therapy are the ones that do the


---------23:59----------
work


---------23:59----------
between our sessions and for for that


---------24:02----------
it's like i'm telling you guys


---------24:03----------
it's night and day so


---------24:07----------
you know the biggest limitation of


---------24:08----------
therapy is it's not like another medical


---------24:10----------
treatment where like you go


---------24:12----------
to let's say you know if you like have


---------24:15----------
appendicitis you go into the hospital


---------24:18----------
they like literally remove your appendix


---------24:20----------
and then you leave the next day and the


---------24:22----------
problem is fixed you're done


---------24:25----------
that's how western medicine works it's


---------24:27----------
like my arteries are clogged


---------24:28----------
you don't have to worry about exercise


---------24:30----------
just come into the hospital


---------24:32----------
we'll take a vein from your leg we'll


---------24:34----------
graft it onto your heart


---------24:36----------
and you'll be good so western medicine


---------24:40----------
is very much


---------24:41----------
and this is the relationship that we


---------24:42----------
have with our providers is like all


---------24:44----------
about


---------24:45----------
i'm going to show up my doctor is going


---------24:46----------
to fix things for me and then i'm going


---------24:48----------
to leave


---------24:49----------
it's kind of like a mechanic for the


---------24:50----------
body but therapy is not like that


---------24:53----------
so if you're showing up expecting to be


---------24:54----------
fixed by your therapist


---------24:58----------
you're not going to get much help


---------25:01----------
you got to do your part that's the


---------25:03----------
biggest limitation of therapy


---------25:08----------
and then so i guess you can't already


---------25:11----------
answer the question but more


---------25:12----------
specifically are there any other common


---------25:14----------
problems with therapy


---------25:15----------
like that people face and it's a little


---------25:19----------
bit of a caveat but


---------25:20----------
like your thoughts first are there


---------25:24----------
yeah i mean so


---------25:27----------
i mean i think there are a lot of


---------25:28----------
problems with therapy as a field


---------25:31----------
but i don't know if that's like about


---------25:33----------
people like people


---------25:34----------
common problems that they're that people


---------25:37----------
let me think about that


---------25:38----------
yeah so one thought that i would have is


---------25:40----------
that if you're doing therapy for a while


---------25:42----------
and it doesn't feel like it's working or


---------25:44----------
helping


---------25:45----------
then consider finding a different


---------25:47----------
therapist


---------25:49----------
and the other problem i guess


---------25:52----------
with therapy is kind of contrary to that


---------25:54----------
is that sometimes it can be hard to see


---------25:56----------
change


---------25:58----------
so they're like change over therapy


---------26:00----------
happens slowly and you don't really


---------26:01----------
notice it


---------26:03----------
so it's kind of like you wake up and you


---------26:04----------
look at yourself in the mirror every


---------26:05----------
morning and you look the same as you did


---------26:07----------
the day before


---------26:08----------
but then you look at a picture of


---------26:09----------
yourself five years ago and you look


---------26:11----------
like a completely different person


---------26:13----------
so therapy is the same way where


---------26:17----------
you know you can like it can feel like a


---------26:19----------
problem it can feel like you're not


---------26:20----------
making any progress


---------26:21----------
even though you are


---------26:24----------
which can be part of the problem but


---------26:27----------
yeah so i'd say that's another just


---------26:29----------
a caution about therapy more so than a


---------26:30----------
limitation that you may not be able to


---------26:33----------
see the progress but it could be


---------26:36----------
happening


---------26:38----------
actually okay so like


---------26:41----------
are there signs when you should end


---------26:43----------
therapy then


---------26:47----------
yeah when you're feeling better or


---------26:50----------
you're ready to move on


---------26:53----------
easy yeah i know it sounds weird but


---------26:56----------
like


---------26:57----------
trust yourselves guys like how do you


---------26:58----------
know when it's like


---------27:01----------
when you when you're done playing a


---------27:02----------
video game


---------27:04----------
like how do you know right like so i


---------27:06----------
know a lot of people feel like they're


---------27:07----------
never done we can make lots of jokes but


---------27:09----------
like how do you know when you're like


---------27:10----------
done for


---------27:11----------
like how do you know when you're ready


---------27:12----------
to play a new game like how do you know


---------27:14----------
that you just know


---------27:15----------
like ah this shit's boring now let me


---------27:17----------
try something else so with therapy like


---------27:20----------
you'll know


---------27:21----------
and your therapists will know too right


---------27:24----------
because they're going to be tracking


---------27:24----------
things for you and it's kind of like


---------27:27----------
so i have this conversation with people


---------27:28----------
where sometimes they come in with


---------27:29----------
depression we work on the depression for


---------27:31----------
a while


---------27:32----------
then one day they come in and then we're


---------27:33----------
like okay so like


---------27:35----------
you know things are pretty good and then


---------27:37----------
it's like okay so now we're sort of done


---------27:39----------
with depression


---------27:41----------
is there something else you want to work


---------27:43----------
on so like that phase of therapy is over


---------27:46----------
and then like there could be like


---------27:48----------
another phase


---------27:49----------
which is actually for me more like


---------27:51----------
coaching so i usually have like i'm a


---------27:53----------
psychiatrist first and then i like move


---------27:55----------
into coaching


---------27:55----------
which is what i really like doing it's


---------27:58----------
just not treating something that's


---------27:59----------
broken it's like helping people


---------28:00----------
like find meaning and purpose in life


---------28:04----------
but anyway sorry for going off


---------28:07----------
off topic there oh um should you change


---------28:10----------
therapists based off of tackling


---------28:12----------
different issues that's probably


---------28:16----------
something you should talk about with


---------28:17----------
your therapist


---------28:18----------
so some therapists specialize in


---------28:20----------
different kinds of things


---------28:22----------
and i think it's reasonable to find a


---------28:24----------
different therapist for a different kind


---------28:25----------
of issue


---------28:26----------
and at the same time i would just talk


---------28:28----------
to them about it


---------28:30----------
and see what they say be like hey i'd


---------28:32----------
like to work on this is this something


---------28:33----------
that you think we can work on together


---------28:35----------
or would you you know should i try to


---------28:38----------
find a different kind of therapist


---------28:41----------
so like a lot of it comes down to just


---------28:43----------
like being


---------28:45----------
honest and talk about things you want to


---------28:46----------
talk about with the therapist right


---------28:48----------
because it's kind of weird because i


---------28:50----------
would


---------28:50----------
see how people would want to hold back


---------28:52----------
on saying stuff like that


---------28:55----------
yeah so that's a great point absolutely


---------28:58----------
so i think the thing that you all need


---------28:59----------
to remember about your therapist


---------29:01----------
is that you can tell them pretty much


---------29:02----------
anything and it's actually like the cool


---------29:05----------
thing about it is it's like the one


---------29:06----------
space where you get to say things that


---------29:08----------
you normally don't say


---------29:11----------
and and i don't mean like racial slurs


---------29:13----------
but like what i mean is you can go


---------29:15----------
into your therapist's office for the


---------29:16----------
first time


---------29:19----------
sit down and say hey i really don't want


---------29:22----------
to be here


---------29:24----------
you could that's gonna be the first


---------29:26----------
words out of your mouth i don't think


---------29:27----------
this is gonna work


---------29:28----------
i think this is a waste of my time i


---------29:31----------
want to be able to do it myself


---------29:35----------
i think what you guys do is a crock of


---------29:38----------
[ __ ] and i don't want to be here


---------29:43----------
and that would be the best thing you can


---------29:44----------
say to your therapist your therapist


---------29:46----------
will be


---------29:46----------
overjoyed


---------29:51----------
you can say hey i don't think this is


---------29:52----------
working i'm bored


---------29:55----------
i've been doing this for a few months


---------29:56----------
and i don't feel like i'm making any


---------29:57----------
progress


---------30:00----------
all good stuff completely fine to say


---------30:06----------
oh what should you do on your first


---------30:08----------
session


---------30:10----------
what should you do in your first session


---------30:13----------
yeah you should walk into your


---------30:14----------
therapist's office and ask them that


---------30:17----------
that's right a lot a lot of these


---------30:20----------
questions seem like


---------30:21----------
questions you should ask your therapist


---------30:23----------
like


---------30:24----------
should religion be used in therapy


---------30:27----------
i mean it can't it can be


---------30:30----------
so i tend to have a pretty spiritual


---------30:32----------
approach to the kind of therapy that i


---------30:34----------
do


---------30:35----------
so much so that one of my supervisors


---------30:38----------
basically once so one of my therapy


---------30:39----------
supervisors once fired me


---------30:41----------
sort of and she was like i don't know


---------30:43----------
what this guy is doing


---------30:45----------
but it's not therapy he's talking about


---------30:47----------
a lot of [ __ ] that i don't understand


---------30:48----------
and it's not therapy


---------30:51----------
so i mean i think you can have religion


---------30:53----------
and spirituality can


---------30:54----------
definitely have a place in therapy um


---------30:58----------
but that's sort of dependent on the


---------30:59----------
person and dependent on the therapist


---------31:02----------
i tend to bake a lot of it in because


---------31:04----------
but then i also ask people for


---------31:06----------
permission


---------31:07----------
so i'll be like you know i sort of have


---------31:08----------
a spiritual background like is it okay


---------31:10----------
if i like


---------31:11----------
include that in the way that i talk to


---------31:14----------
you


---------31:15----------
generally speaking though most people


---------31:16----------
come to me because they're looking for


---------31:17----------
that


---------31:18----------
and this is why we have websites and


---------31:19----------
profiles so that people can pick what


---------31:22----------
they're looking for


---------31:27----------
um i i don't know how to like put this


---------31:30----------
in a question but can you


---------31:31----------
address the i need dr k kind of type


---------31:34----------
requests


---------31:35----------
that people are like you are the only


---------31:37----------
one who will


---------31:39----------
like help yeah so


---------31:42----------
i'm gonna ask permission for to play a


---------31:45----------
clip for you


---------31:46----------
guys from someone


---------31:49----------
so there was so so you know so i do


---------31:52----------
coaching


---------31:54----------
and we also have coaching groups right


---------31:56----------
so you guys can sign up and


---------31:57----------
depending on the role of the dice you


---------32:00----------
can get paired with different people


---------32:02----------
so i run a group and the group ended


---------32:05----------
recently


---------32:07----------
and so we were just kind of offering


---------32:10----------
feedback about the end of the group


---------32:12----------
and i couldn't have said it better


---------32:14----------
myself but one person was like i came to


---------32:16----------
this group because i thought dr k


---------32:18----------
was the only one that could help me like


---------32:19----------
i was convinced that he was the only one


---------32:22----------
and he understood me so well


---------32:23----------
and he's he's the only one that could


---------32:26----------
help me


---------32:27----------
after 16 weeks of working with dr k i


---------32:29----------
realized that


---------32:32----------
i never needed him and that like really


---------32:35----------
what i needed


---------32:36----------
like the only person i needed was myself


---------32:40----------
and that's the truth and that's like the


---------32:43----------
best feedback that i could get


---------32:45----------
is everyone has this perception that


---------32:47----------
what you guys need is me but like that's


---------32:49----------
you all don't


---------32:49----------
need me you know it's kind of like just


---------32:53----------
because you watch a cooking show and


---------32:55----------
there's like an amazing


---------32:56----------
you know like like those amazing


---------32:58----------
five-star chef or whatever who's like


---------33:00----------
making this food like sure that food


---------33:01----------
that dude makes delicious food but


---------33:03----------
there's like delicious food all over the


---------33:04----------
place


---------33:06----------
i know that a lot of people feel like


---------33:07----------
i'm the only one for them and believe me


---------33:10----------
it's flattering but i think you guys


---------33:11----------
don't know me as well as i do


---------33:14----------
and i think you'd be surprised at what


---------33:15----------
you're capable of is if you put your


---------33:17----------
mind to it and work with


---------33:19----------
just anything like really any therapist


---------33:22----------
it's about what you guys put in not


---------33:24----------
about what we put in


---------33:25----------
the last thing that i want to say i'm


---------33:27----------
going to read something to you guys


---------33:30----------
okay so there's a post on our subreddit


---------33:32----------
right now


---------33:34----------
that says today's chat with zach and his


---------33:35----------
father dave is probably the most


---------33:37----------
incredible thing healthy gamer has ever


---------33:39----------
done


---------33:41----------
so i want you guys to think about this


---------33:42----------
for a second


---------33:46----------
what makes that incredible


---------33:49----------
because it's not me right so like i'm


---------33:51----------
the constant and healthy gamer but what


---------33:53----------
makes that so impactful is like zack and


---------33:54----------
day


---------33:56----------
like sure i'm the common element but if


---------33:58----------
you really think about it like why are


---------33:59----------
like the reason that some things are


---------34:03----------
impactful and other things are not


---------34:04----------
impactful if it was me then everything


---------34:05----------
we


---------34:06----------
would do would be like equally impactful


---------34:08----------
but it's not


---------34:09----------
it's the person who comes on that makes


---------34:12----------
things


---------34:13----------
impactful or not that's where the money


---------34:16----------
is


---------34:17----------
that's where the value is the real value


---------34:19----------
comes from you


---------34:21----------
you just think it comes from me because


---------34:22----------
you always see my face


---------34:25----------
but if you really think about it the


---------34:27----------
bulk of healing


---------34:29----------
doesn't come from me


---------34:32----------
it comes from the people who come on


---------34:34----------
stream it comes from you


---------34:37----------
and so for those of you who think that


---------34:39----------
you you need dr k like i don't doubt


---------34:41----------
that i could help you


---------34:43----------
but i i really am like not that special


---------34:47----------
the thing is what i i mean i fail too


---------34:50----------
and what what causes me to fail or


---------34:52----------
succeed


---------34:53----------
depends on the person sitting across


---------34:54----------
from me because i can't fix


---------34:56----------
them they have to fix themselves i'm


---------34:58----------
just going to help


---------35:00----------
and so the real thing that you need for


---------35:02----------
your success is not me


---------35:04----------
is you if you show up and you give it


---------35:07----------
your best effort with a therapist i


---------35:09----------
think you're gonna do a good job


---------35:11----------
and that's what we hear from people


---------35:14----------
right like


---------35:14----------
even zach on on wednesday's stream was


---------35:17----------
like yeah i started seeing a therapist


---------35:18----------
and i've i've gotten a little bit better


---------35:20----------
turns out he's probably gotten a lot


---------35:22----------
better


---------35:24----------
but like he didn't need me like i don't


---------35:27----------
think any of y'all


---------35:28----------
need me specifically


---------35:32----------
i know it sounds weird but the real


---------35:35----------
money is on


---------35:36----------
on you it's like there's no i mean that


---------35:38----------
doesn't it's just how it is


---------35:41----------
so like kind of going along with that it


---------35:43----------
feels like people think there's almost a


---------35:45----------
skill gap within therapy


---------35:47----------
but it's more about the person


---------35:50----------
undergoing therapy


---------35:51----------
right there's a skill gap i mean there


---------35:54----------
can be a skill gap in therapy though


---------35:56----------
right so it's


---------35:57----------
let's be fair so just like any


---------35:59----------
profession


---------36:00----------
they're good therapists and they're


---------36:01----------
shitty therapists


---------36:03----------
i think the money though is that like


---------36:05----------
even if you guys get a


---------36:07----------
like let's think about healers right


---------36:09----------
like there's an amazing healer in


---------36:12----------
an mmo and then there are shitty healers


---------36:14----------
in mmos


---------36:15----------
but most healers do a like a pretty good


---------36:17----------
job


---------36:18----------
they do like good enough and that's what


---------36:21----------
i think therapy is


---------36:22----------
like most therapists are good enough and


---------36:24----------
that's really all you guys need because


---------36:26----------
this is where like you have to think


---------36:28----------
about how [ __ ] up are you


---------36:30----------
we have a disagreement about how much


---------36:32----------
you all suck at life


---------36:34----------
i actually have a lot of faith that most


---------36:35----------
of y'all are pretty decent awesome human


---------36:37----------
beings


---------36:38----------
who are smart and capable and all you


---------36:40----------
need is a little bit of help


---------36:41----------
so i think you guys could have an


---------36:43----------
average or above average therapist and


---------36:44----------
you'd get a lot out of it because i have


---------36:46----------
faith in our community


---------36:49----------
and if you sucked then maybe you would


---------36:51----------
need a great therapist maybe


---------36:53----------
but i think you guys are actually like


---------36:54----------
pretty good and so you just need like


---------36:56----------
you need like a basic healer


---------36:57----------
you don't need like a platinum healer


---------36:59----------
you just need like a silver healer


---------37:02----------
and you all do good just give them a


---------37:03----------
shot


---------37:05----------
like a healer off of craigslist


---------37:08----------
absolutely


---------37:11----------
right because you might be not that


---------37:12----------
actually no don't do that don't


---------37:14----------
don't call craigslist to look for a


---------37:15----------
therapist yeah but like like seriously


---------37:17----------
y'all can carry that [ __ ]


---------37:19----------
you don't need a therapist to carry


---------37:20----------
anything


---------37:34----------
seriously
