---------00:02----------
when i teach people meditation what i


---------00:04----------
try to start with is the idea that each


---------00:06----------
person is


---------00:07----------
individual each person is unique and in


---------00:10----------
my experience the most successful


---------00:12----------
meditation practices


---------00:13----------
are sort of tailored to the actual


---------00:15----------
person who's doing the meditating


---------00:21----------
we'll go through how meditation is a


---------00:23----------
practice evolved


---------00:25----------
where it started how it branched off and


---------00:27----------
even where mindfulness was born because


---------00:30----------
mindfulness


---------00:30----------
isn't actually all of what meditation


---------00:32----------
has to offer


---------00:33----------
in fact it's a tiny tiny fraction of the


---------00:36----------
tradition of meditation


---------00:38----------
we sort of explore these core questions


---------00:40----------
like what is the nature of a human being


---------00:43----------
what makes up a person and as we


---------00:45----------
discover who we are


---------00:46----------
we find ourselves unshackled from a lot


---------00:49----------
of the things that hold us back


---------00:51----------
these thoughts like i am a failure or


---------00:53----------
i'm unlovable or that person is better


---------00:56----------
than me


---------00:56----------
all stem from not understanding what we


---------00:59----------
really are


---------01:01----------
and we'll explore different kinds of


---------01:03----------
meditation inquisitive practices versus


---------01:06----------
focusing practices


---------01:08----------
open awareness meditation where you


---------01:10----------
observe your thoughts


---------01:12----------
versus chanting a mantra and how each of


---------01:14----------
these practices


---------01:15----------
gives you different benefits and is


---------01:17----------
suited for different kinds of people


---------01:20----------
and so our approach in this module is to


---------01:22----------
give you the best of what all of these


---------01:24----------
traditions have to offer


---------01:25----------
to give you lots of different meditation


---------01:27----------
techniques that are targeted towards


---------01:29----------
particular realizations or overcoming


---------01:31----------
different kinds of problems


---------01:33----------
so i really hope that this module will


---------01:35----------
be helpful for you and i hope that it'll


---------01:37----------
also be fun


---------01:41----------
