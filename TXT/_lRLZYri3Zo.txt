---------00:07----------
and hateful towards everything in the


---------00:08----------
universe


---------00:10----------
hello hello hey man how you doing today


---------00:13----------
i'm doing great how are you


---------00:15----------
uh it's an early morning but i'm doing


---------00:17----------
well so


---------00:19----------
perfect that's great i just i think our


---------00:21----------
sound levels and stuff


---------00:22----------
are good um yeah so and and what do you


---------00:26----------
go by


---------00:27----------
uh you can call me george george okay so


---------00:30----------
welcome george


---------00:32----------
i'm all up it's nice to meet you nice to


---------00:34----------
meet you


---------00:35----------
that's a cool wall you have there yeah


---------00:38----------
that's my whiteboard wall this is like


---------00:41----------
my office so


---------00:42----------
yeah that's is your so your entire wall


---------00:45----------
and your ceiling or whiteboards


---------00:47----------
uh so we didn't go as far as the ceiling


---------00:50----------
but


---------00:50----------
i thought that would be like a funny way


---------00:53----------
of of having


---------00:54----------
uh the interior so but


---------00:57----------
i didn't go that crazy it's interesting


---------01:00----------
i i gotta upgrade my


---------01:01----------
my game can i show you what i have yeah


---------01:04----------
yeah


---------01:04----------
please do


---------01:09----------
oh you're lugging that thing around


---------01:11----------
unfortunate


---------01:13----------
i just have the old-fashioned one oh


---------01:16----------
nice


---------01:16----------
you have such better handwriting this is


---------01:18----------
what i'm working on it's our


---------01:19----------
understanding of depression


---------01:22----------
oh this is very interesting nice


---------01:30----------
i like how you break that down i'm i run


---------01:32----------
into a problem with my whiteboard


---------01:34----------
because if i want to work on more than


---------01:36----------
one thing at a time i have to erase the


---------01:37----------
old thing


---------01:39----------
but um i i think maybe i should take a


---------01:41----------
page from your book and just coat the


---------01:43----------
walls with whiteboard because then i can


---------01:44----------
cover it with all my things i really


---------01:46----------
love that idea


---------01:47----------
it's not it's not that expensive so it's


---------01:50----------
convenient it's convenient


---------01:51----------
yeah cool man um and so george is there


---------01:54----------
something in particular you want to talk


---------01:56----------
about today


---------01:58----------
um honestly not really i think uh


---------02:03----------
dissecting me a little bit and maybe


---------02:05----------
like talking about my life would be


---------02:07----------
interesting


---------02:08----------
um there's a lot that's happened


---------02:11----------
over like the course of my exploration i


---------02:13----------
started


---------02:14----------
um in canada london ontario when i was


---------02:17----------
like 19


---------02:18----------
and then i'm 30 now and i'm in


---------02:20----------
california and


---------02:22----------
it's been a pretty long journey a lot of


---------02:23----------
stuff has happened


---------02:25----------
um and uh i think that


---------02:28----------
journey is interesting for a lot of


---------02:31----------
people and so


---------02:32----------
i don't really tell it much so yeah so


---------02:34----------
that sounds


---------02:35----------
fantastic is there something that you're


---------02:37----------
so tell me about your journey


---------02:39----------
yeah uh sure um so i was like 19 years


---------02:43----------
old


---------02:44----------
twitch didn't exist um it was the start


---------02:48----------
of


---------02:49----------
streaming in general there were


---------02:51----------
platforms like live stream


---------02:53----------
and x stream and so i was just like a


---------02:56----------
kid that wanted to show how good he was


---------02:58----------
at playing a certain champion in league


---------02:59----------
of legends


---------03:02----------
so i started that and i started


---------03:05----------
streaming to like five viewers


---------03:06----------
and um that uh


---------03:10----------
somehow evolved from like living in my


---------03:13----------
mom's basement


---------03:14----------
and uh uh to


---------03:19----------
to going to school and doing it um


---------03:22----------
and then i dropped out of school to like


---------03:25----------
pursue


---------03:26----------
uh gaming full-time actually was


---------03:28----------
streaming


---------03:30----------
and then i built a community for people


---------03:32----------
to connect


---------03:33----------
people use websites a lot more back then


---------03:35----------
um


---------03:37----------
and uh we had like the clg website and


---------03:40----------
it was actually a community and i love


---------03:42----------
bringing people together


---------03:44----------
and how did you come up with clg


---------03:48----------
um so


---------03:51----------
when i played this game called warcraft


---------03:53----------
3 i understand it now as


---------03:55----------
game theory but um


---------03:59----------
it's it's making assumptions on what


---------04:01----------
your enemy is going to do


---------04:02----------
over and over and over and over in which


---------04:05----------
if you


---------04:05----------
didn't make an assumption um you would


---------04:08----------
win some of the time


---------04:10----------
right you just kind of like throw out


---------04:12----------
the same


---------04:13----------
or like a simple move um


---------04:16----------
the the other the opponent like


---------04:17----------
overthinks themselves that's how i like


---------04:19----------
i thought of it when i was like 13 or


---------04:21----------
something and what


---------04:23----------
what does clg stand for uh counter logic


---------04:26----------
gaming


---------04:27----------
so the counter logic there is um sort of


---------04:30----------
not falling into the normal assumptions


---------04:33----------
of game theory


---------04:34----------
yes well


---------04:37----------
it is game theory but you know like at


---------04:40----------
the time when i was 13 like


---------04:42----------
that's what i was that's what i was


---------04:44----------
thinking in my head okay


---------04:46----------
yeah that's awesome man and what did you


---------04:47----------
play in war three


---------04:49----------
uh i played human human was my


---------04:52----------
my race yeah water elements also soapy


---------04:55----------
did you go archery


---------04:56----------
first yeah i did all the time actually


---------04:59----------
i also did blood mage too oh that's


---------05:02----------
styling man


---------05:04----------
yeah i was the i was like the styler um


---------05:07----------
i looked up to all the players that did


---------05:09----------
wacky things and thought outside the box


---------05:11----------
so that was that was my


---------05:13----------
do you remember this guy akm yes


---------05:16----------
i actually talked to akm he comes on


---------05:19----------
i've come on his stream every now and


---------05:20----------
then he still like hangs around the


---------05:22----------
twitch community


---------05:23----------
oh interesting yeah so you're back you


---------05:26----------
know the workout three days


---------05:27----------
yeah man this is boomer talk about the


---------05:29----------
old days yeah back when it was real


---------05:31----------
gaming


---------05:32----------
yeah my hero's grumpy grumpy is like my


---------05:35----------
gaming idol


---------05:35----------
yeah interesting okay he's an amazing


---------05:37----------
human being


---------05:38----------
and um and so so he's


---------05:42----------
so it sounds like you started playing


---------05:43----------
games when you were pretty young


---------05:45----------
yeah i mean i started playing games when


---------05:47----------
i was like two years old i remember like


---------05:49----------
playing dance


---------05:50----------
berenstein bears on like uh the computer


---------05:53----------
and then my dad got me a diablo before


---------05:57----------
it was released


---------05:58----------
somehow and i played that and um


---------06:01----------
yeah i just got the bad hookups he had


---------06:04----------
the he had the hookups


---------06:05----------
yeah and um what what what was growing


---------06:09----------
up like for you in ontario


---------06:12----------
um ontario is a fairly lar uh well sorry


---------06:15----------
ontario's


---------06:18----------
i don't think of it too much different


---------06:20----------
uh than la


---------06:21----------
i think the culture of people in canada


---------06:25----------
are arguably


---------06:29----------
a lot more accepting


---------06:33----------
but it was


---------06:36----------
it was pretty normal like for here in la


---------06:38----------
i don't really notice too much of a


---------06:40----------
difference


---------06:40----------
sure um there's some cultural


---------06:42----------
differences but


---------06:44----------
and can you tell me a little bit about


---------06:45----------
what home life was like for you


---------06:48----------
um so home life and thank you for uh


---------06:52----------
thank you for leading this it's hard to


---------06:54----------
talk about yourself and talk about your


---------06:55----------
journey so


---------06:56----------
oh i appreciate you doing it i noticed


---------06:58----------
you started at 19 and


---------07:00----------
i tend to get i just wanted a little bit


---------07:01----------
yeah that story no that's great that's


---------07:03----------
great


---------07:04----------
um so uh what was the last question


---------07:08----------
yeah just tell me what growing up was


---------07:09----------
like for you um oh yeah so


---------07:12----------
growing up i lived with my grandparents


---------07:14----------
and my parents


---------07:16----------
um and


---------07:19----------
my mom was hurt in an accident so her


---------07:23----------
back was out and so


---------07:24----------
you know that's why we kind of like live


---------07:26----------
together


---------07:28----------
and i had a lot of values from my


---------07:32----------
grandparents


---------07:33----------
kind of like you know when you have like


---------07:34----------
one set of parents


---------07:36----------
i had like my grandparents and then i


---------07:38----------
also had my parents too


---------07:40----------
yep thank you sorry so you're saying


---------07:42----------
that you're it sounds like your


---------07:43----------
grandmother had a


---------07:44----------
injury or you're a mom i'm sorry uh my


---------07:46----------
mom had it okay


---------07:47----------
yeah so she had a back injury she had a


---------07:49----------
back injury so yeah


---------07:51----------
um i lived with my grandparents and they


---------07:53----------
were they were like


---------07:54----------
my full-time parents and you know my mom


---------07:56----------
wasn't able to be my full-time parent


---------07:58----------
and my dad was


---------08:00----------
doing whatever he was doing what was he


---------08:02----------
doing


---------08:03----------
uh my dad was always like tinkering with


---------08:05----------
things and like finding things to do


---------08:08----------
he i don't think he really had like a


---------08:10----------
job that he was consistent with


---------08:13----------
um he just always


---------08:16----------
in canada there was this huge thing when


---------08:19----------
people were


---------08:21----------
stealing uh satellite from the us


---------08:24----------
i'm not sure with like when satellite tv


---------08:28----------
was a big thing and so he was like on


---------08:29----------
the forefront of like


---------08:30----------
tinkering with that and like he was kind


---------08:33----------
of like a


---------08:33----------
engineer type person you know okay he's


---------08:36----------
like it wasn't like


---------08:37----------
about the business part of it it was


---------08:39----------
about like oh this thing is cool this


---------08:41----------
concept is cool how like


---------08:43----------
radios connect how like satellites


---------08:45----------
connect and so


---------08:47----------
yeah that's interesting and so do you


---------08:48----------
mind if i ask george


---------08:50----------
i mean how did your how did your family


---------08:51----------
support itself


---------08:54----------
um my mom's a teacher um so she would


---------08:56----------
work and


---------08:57----------
she would work yeah okay my grandparents


---------08:59----------
were fairly well off


---------09:02----------
they came as immigrants and they had


---------09:05----------
nothing


---------09:06----------
my grandfather was actually like a


---------09:09----------
war general in greece um


---------09:12----------
he fought against turkey at some point i


---------09:14----------
can't remember the whole history but


---------09:17----------
he he didn't talk he didn't like talking


---------09:18----------
about it he he just liked


---------09:20----------
being the nice jolly grandfather


---------09:22----------
interesting


---------09:23----------
which my parents didn't really get i got


---------09:26----------
so


---------09:27----------
i love that what can you tell me a


---------09:30----------
little bit more about him


---------09:32----------
um yeah i mean he was he was a guy


---------09:36----------
that everybody when they talked about


---------09:39----------
him in the past


---------09:40----------
he was like this big scary controlling


---------09:43----------
dude that


---------09:44----------
was really really hard on his kids and


---------09:47----------
um


---------09:48----------
now i think like he


---------09:53----------
when i knew him uh and when i was


---------09:56----------
like always growing up with him he was


---------09:59----------
kind of like this


---------10:00----------
jolly guy that like puts you in the


---------10:02----------
right place if you were going too far


---------10:04----------
off but it wasn't like


---------10:06----------
in the same lens of like how they


---------10:09----------
he did it to my parents like he would be


---------10:11----------
like george


---------10:12----------
um i'm gonna drive you down like if i


---------10:15----------
was


---------10:15----------
missing school or skipping school he'd


---------10:18----------
he'd basically drive me down to


---------10:20----------
places where uh in the city where it was


---------10:23----------
drug ridden full and


---------10:24----------
full of crime filled with crime like


---------10:26----------
just like this is what real life is


---------10:29----------
if you don't succeed in life this is


---------10:30----------
where you can fall like the depths of it


---------10:33----------
and so like it's important to to know


---------10:35----------
these things and he wasn't trying to


---------10:37----------
like shock me or scare me


---------10:39----------
is more like this is reality and


---------10:42----------
don't fall in a trap like thinking this


---------10:44----------
is all a game interesting so what i'm


---------10:46----------
hearing


---------10:47----------
it's quite a powerful image actually


---------10:50----------
yeah


---------10:50----------
yeah um and what i'm hearing is that


---------10:54----------
you know it sounds like he used to be


---------10:55----------
controlling but instead what he did with


---------10:57----------
you was sort of


---------10:59----------
tried to inform you and then also sort


---------11:02----------
of respect your ability to like make a


---------11:04----------
decision so he kind of says like


---------11:06----------
here are your options but it's


---------11:07----------
ultimately your choice


---------11:09----------
and maybe with your parents he sort of


---------11:11----------
didn't do that as much he was like this


---------11:12----------
is what you're gonna do


---------11:14----------
exactly yeah it sounds like you respect


---------11:17----------
him a lot because of it


---------11:18----------
oh yeah my grandfather uh was very


---------11:22----------
very like he was a good human being


---------11:25----------
and he was very uh i would say he was


---------11:28----------
like very punctual with his behavior i


---------11:30----------
don't know how to describe it he was


---------11:31----------
very consistent


---------11:33----------
um same with my grandma my grandma is


---------11:35----------
just like an incredible human being like


---------11:37----------
strongest woman i've ever met in my life


---------11:40----------
um


---------11:41----------
but you know that's probably because


---------11:43----------
their lives were very very hard so they


---------11:45----------
had to be


---------11:46----------
what what made her so strong what do you


---------11:48----------
mean by that um


---------11:50----------
she still like garden for like three


---------11:53----------
hours on end


---------11:54----------
she's like in her 80s um her sisters


---------11:57----------
like


---------11:58----------
10 mountain goats by themselves in the


---------12:00----------
middle of nowhere


---------12:01----------
on on like up large steep mountains


---------12:05----------
um in greece yeah


---------12:08----------
she would beat me up and like wrestle me


---------12:11----------
like


---------12:12----------
for a significant period of my life and


---------12:14----------
she was jacked


---------12:15----------
she was legitimately strong um


---------12:19----------
and like her punctuality was crazy um


---------12:22----------
she never missed uh ever since she came


---------12:25----------
to canada


---------12:26----------
she never missed one day working for 40


---------12:28----------
years


---------12:32----------
but it was it was like the spirit of it


---------12:34----------
that she had which was really


---------12:35----------
interesting


---------12:38----------
it wasn't punctuality for punctuality's


---------12:40----------
sake it was the spirit of


---------12:42----------
being strong uh


---------12:46----------
uh for others that's that's what it was


---------12:50----------
about


---------12:52----------
sounds like you love and respect your


---------12:53----------
grandparents a lot oh yeah


---------12:55----------
they're they're they're they're like my


---------12:57----------
idols yeah


---------12:59----------
you know this may sound funny to have


---------13:01----------
them well this may sound kind of weird


---------13:03----------
george but i'm i'm almost hearing like


---------13:05----------
this is maybe unfair but i'm almost


---------13:07----------
hearing like a little bit of a


---------13:10----------
i don't know you just speak so highly of


---------13:13----------
your grandparents and i don't quite hear


---------13:15----------
that when you talk about your parents


---------13:18----------
well yeah um my father uh


---------13:22----------
my father divorced my mom when i was


---------13:24----------
like


---------13:25----------
13. um and so my mom was a single mother


---------13:29----------
and she was very very busy with like


---------13:31----------
work


---------13:32----------
and school and and she's kind of like a


---------13:35----------
kind woman


---------13:36----------
so she um


---------13:40----------
didn't ask my father for child support


---------13:43----------
she was basically like hey let's try to


---------13:46----------
keep this civil


---------13:47----------
like you go do your own thing i'm gonna


---------13:50----------
live my own life


---------13:51----------
and i'm gonna try my best to like raise


---------13:53----------
the kids


---------13:54----------
um and so


---------13:57----------
i think mom and dad weren't there as


---------14:00----------
much


---------14:00----------
as grandfather and grandmother and and


---------14:03----------
especially in a value sense and a


---------14:05----------
thought sense


---------14:06----------
i think when you're not in the motion of


---------14:07----------
things and you're not doing things so


---------14:10----------
much


---------14:10----------
you have time to reflect on what values


---------14:14----------
you want to carry across


---------14:15----------
who you want to be um and so


---------14:20----------
i i think my grandparents were


---------14:23----------
like very cognizant of like who they


---------14:25----------
wanted to be and who they wanted me to


---------14:27----------
be


---------14:28----------
and who they what values they wanted to


---------14:30----------
instill in me


---------14:31----------
and what i'm hearing from you is maybe


---------14:33----------
your parents weren't like that


---------14:35----------
no well i think my mom was just like


---------14:37----------
trying to get me


---------14:39----------
to get past like not failing right she


---------14:42----------
was she was keeping me above


---------14:44----------
water uh and she she fought to keep me


---------14:47----------
above water


---------14:48----------
um why were you below water in the first


---------14:51----------
place


---------14:52----------
um i think this is this is a good


---------14:56----------
question


---------14:57----------
um so i was always


---------15:00----------
addicted to games uh i love


---------15:03----------
the challenge and the nature of games


---------15:05----------
like school wasn't challenging for me


---------15:07----------
um schools i would yeah schools for


---------15:10----------
actual noobs um


---------15:13----------
i i would go into like you know warcraft


---------15:15----------
three i was like top of the


---------15:17----------
top of the us east ladder and you know i


---------15:20----------
had like a lot of people i respected


---------15:21----------
there and


---------15:22----------
i had a huge level of respect for my


---------15:25----------
opponents


---------15:26----------
that's why my name is hotshot gg it's


---------15:28----------
not because of my initials it's because


---------15:29----------
i had like a huge respect for my


---------15:31----------
opponents and so


---------15:32----------
deconstructing why i lost was like


---------15:36----------
really important to me


---------15:37----------
um and deconstructing how i could


---------15:40----------
improve


---------15:40----------
is really important to me so you you


---------15:43----------
call that an addiction


---------15:45----------
i i called it an addiction because i


---------15:49----------
didn't want to do anything else


---------15:51----------
all i wanted to do was get lost in those


---------15:53----------
worlds


---------15:54----------
and um


---------15:58----------
and i couldn't force myself to do


---------16:01----------
anything else


---------16:02----------
it just wasn't of my interest and maybe


---------16:04----------
it isn't an addiction maybe it's just a


---------16:06----------
passion um


---------16:10----------
i think when we go into that period of


---------16:12----------
time


---------16:14----------
a lot of people would have called it an


---------16:16----------
addiction


---------16:17----------
and they would have claimed it wasn't a


---------16:19----------
good addiction


---------16:20----------
um as i talk of it now i don't think of


---------16:24----------
it in addiction any way shape or form


---------16:26----------
even if i play a jillion hours a day um


---------16:30----------
but that's like that's the sentiment


---------16:32----------
towards gaming


---------16:33----------
right it's it's changed over the past uh


---------16:36----------
couple of years uh or not a couple of


---------16:38----------
years past 10 years


---------16:40----------
so much so george help me understand


---------16:44----------
what was it about


---------16:45----------
the game that was so attractive to you


---------16:48----------
and


---------16:48----------
what was it about real life that was so


---------16:53----------
unattractive yeah so


---------16:57----------
i wouldn't say real life was


---------16:58----------
unattractive i would say school was


---------17:01----------
unattractive


---------17:02----------
a lecturer talking to you um and just


---------17:05----------
telling you to like write notes


---------17:07----------
and like in in my opinion the problems


---------17:10----------
weren't that difficult they weren't


---------17:12----------
i wasn't constantly evolving and


---------17:14----------
engaging it was more like i was


---------17:16----------
following a process uh


---------17:18----------
that that someone was like hey abc


---------17:22----------
and then i go to i come to school and be


---------17:23----------
like a b c it was a very


---------17:26----------
boring uninteractive


---------17:29----------
and um


---------17:32----------
it was more like follow the steps yep


---------17:35----------
rather than


---------17:37----------
um rather than uh


---------17:41----------
here's a sophisticated challenge that we


---------17:44----------
let you explore yourself


---------17:45----------
in and we let you challenge at your pace


---------17:48----------
at your level


---------17:49----------
um you know there's some people that are


---------17:52----------
stuck in gold their whole life


---------17:53----------
right and some people that finally climb


---------17:55----------
to platinum and there's people that


---------17:58----------
reach the top echelon and inspire like


---------18:01----------
millions across the world right and so


---------18:05----------
the freedom of gaming is that you really


---------18:08----------
you're just put in that leaderboard


---------18:10----------
system you put into that matchmaking


---------18:12----------
system and where you can get like


---------18:13----------
instant feedback instant results um


---------18:16----------
[Music]


---------18:18----------
which is a problem itself but yeah


---------18:21----------
yeah and and so you say that your mom


---------18:23----------
struggled to keep you above


---------18:25----------
water what do you mean by that uh just


---------18:28----------
like


---------18:28----------
getting through school my teachers


---------18:30----------
really really


---------18:32----------
loved me in one sense which was like i


---------18:34----------
was a nice kid


---------18:35----------
um i was very intelligent


---------18:40----------
but i didn't go to school i missed like


---------18:43----------
381 days of school in my


---------18:45----------
in my high school years um and


---------18:49----------
i stayed home a lot uh and i barely


---------18:53----------
passed all right well sorry i passed


---------18:55----------
with like 70s


---------18:57----------
uh like high 70s


---------19:00----------
um how did you stay home so much from


---------19:02----------
school


---------19:04----------
uh i actually faked sick which


---------19:08----------
if there's karma in the world uh it


---------19:11----------
turned into like


---------19:13----------
real sick somehow um but


---------19:16----------
uh what i would do is like my i would


---------19:19----------
say my like stomach hurts i can't go


---------19:21----------
to school and like my mom bought it a


---------19:23----------
lot um


---------19:25----------
and um


---------19:30----------
george i don't know how we're ever going


---------19:31----------
to get to 19


---------19:33----------
yeah no i know i mean we can speed it up


---------19:36----------
no no i i think my point is that i i


---------19:39----------
didn't mean to say that we should speed


---------19:40----------
it up


---------19:41----------
what i what i meant to say is that i


---------19:42----------
think there's a lot of


---------19:44----------
important stuff here and if you're if


---------19:47----------
you're okay with it


---------19:48----------
maybe we'll kind of focus on what you're


---------19:50----------
sharing yeah


---------19:52----------
so i i think like to be candid with you


---------19:54----------
right


---------19:55----------
i'm very like


---------19:59----------
i have thick skin i've had thick skin


---------20:01----------
because of my time in clg and doing what


---------20:04----------
i


---------20:04----------
doing what i did um and i also have the


---------20:08----------
i think a strong ability to


---------20:11----------
not be defensive and really to just look


---------20:14----------
look


---------20:15----------
to help others and so talking about my


---------20:18----------
life and being very open with


---------20:20----------
things is about helping others right and


---------20:22----------
so


---------20:23----------
that's why i'm like dissect me because i


---------20:25----------
think there's a lot of


---------20:26----------
things that i can talk about to help


---------20:30----------
be relatable to a lot of young people


---------20:33----------
and also maybe like give them some life


---------20:35----------
lessons about


---------20:36----------
uh what i've learned and and hopefully


---------20:39----------
give them some guidance in that in that


---------20:40----------
regard


---------20:46----------
okay i said something provocative no oh


---------20:49----------
yeah oh yeah sorry go ahead


---------20:55----------
i just feel pretty think about whether i


---------20:56----------
want to say this or not say it


---------20:58----------
promise i promise you can say it unless


---------21:00----------
unless you think it's gonna


---------21:02----------
affect others negatively


---------21:07----------
so why does someone fake sick


---------21:16----------
i have no idea other than to just like


---------21:20----------
escape responsibility


---------21:21----------
uh sure so so i think escaping


---------21:24----------
responsibility


---------21:25----------
is true i would say overall avoidance


---------21:29----------
i think it's an avoidance strategy what


---------21:31----------
if i told you that your altruism


---------21:33----------
could also be an avoidance strategy that


---------21:36----------
your thickness


---------21:38----------
yeah is just a it's it's a healthier


---------21:41----------
manifestation


---------21:42----------
of whatever caused you to fake sick


---------21:45----------
it's still a form of avoidance that by


---------21:48----------
devoting yourself to others


---------21:50----------
you can avoid


---------21:54----------
looking at yourself i would say that's


---------21:57----------
only half true


---------21:58----------
i think the process of me looking at


---------22:00----------
myself has has been happening


---------22:02----------
and i've had a lot of great human beings


---------22:04----------
in my life that have helped me get there


---------22:06----------
and i went through a lot of bad stuff to


---------22:08----------
get out of that um


---------22:10----------
and i think my altruism is


---------22:13----------
twofold it's like i'm in a pro i'm in


---------22:16----------
the process of evolving


---------22:18----------
um so i would


---------22:21----------
i would agree and disagree i think maybe


---------22:24----------
my ideals


---------22:26----------
are too idealistic and it's not like in


---------22:28----------
this realm of


---------22:29----------
of i'm being like fully real with myself


---------22:33----------
but i think it's in the right place


---------22:37----------
i might get a little too excited and


---------22:39----------
jump jump the gun


---------22:40----------
a little bit but um i know where i'm


---------22:44----------
going


---------22:44----------
and i'm very like i feel it as well as


---------22:47----------
think it


---------22:48----------
i can get behind that okay cool yeah


---------22:51----------
so uh is it okay if we talk a little bit


---------22:54----------
more about feeling sick


---------22:56----------
sure and then you said something about


---------22:58----------
karma what do you mean by that


---------23:00----------
you said that so yeah yeah so i um


---------23:03----------
yeah it was like a stomach thing and


---------23:05----------
like i was like yeah i have the stomach


---------23:06----------
thing


---------23:07----------
and i went to the doctors and they


---------23:09----------
actually like were like hey


---------23:11----------
your kid might have ibs i think it was


---------23:13----------
irritable syndrome


---------23:14----------
yeah um and then like


---------23:18----------
potentially acid reflux and that's


---------23:20----------
what's causing these issues and now i


---------23:22----------
have acid reflux


---------23:23----------
and uh it's actually caused some issues


---------23:26----------
um which is


---------23:29----------
you know it's almost like pinocchio you


---------23:32----------
know


---------23:33----------
yeah so how does that work


---------23:36----------
uh i don't know i i i think that uh it


---------23:40----------
could just be coincidence


---------23:41----------
but uh i think it's a funny uh it's a


---------23:44----------
funny uh


---------23:45----------
thing to think about i don't think we'll


---------23:46----------
ever know or figure out what


---------23:49----------
why or how that happens but


---------23:52----------
um coincidence let's call it let's chalk


---------23:55----------
it up as that


---------23:57----------
i don't think so man really yeah


---------24:01----------
what's your understanding of what ibs is


---------24:04----------
uh ibs uh


---------24:08----------
is so i i haven't thought about this


---------24:12----------
since i was a kid


---------24:13----------
right but i thought it was


---------24:16----------
um something to related to like a


---------24:18----------
physical part of your stomach


---------24:20----------
not responding correctly


---------24:24----------
that's like uh somewhat incorrect


---------24:27----------
so so so yeah so so the first thing is


---------24:31----------
ibs is irritable bowel syndrome


---------24:34----------
and ibs is one of this new wave of


---------24:37----------
physical diseases


---------24:39----------
that are probably psychosomatic oh


---------24:42----------
interesting right so that's part of the


---------24:44----------
reason when when they can't find


---------24:46----------
something in particular wrong with you


---------24:49----------
like there isn't a cause


---------24:51----------
for your distress but there is a problem


---------24:53----------
with your function so they're also


---------24:55----------
called functional diseases


---------24:57----------
so like like let me just put it this way


---------24:59----------
like so if you think about a functional


---------25:01----------
disease so a functional disease is like


---------25:02----------
it's a disease of function but like


---------25:05----------
not a disease of cause so if i have a


---------25:08----------
gunshot wound


---------25:09----------
there is a clear cause as to why my


---------25:12----------
function is impaired


---------25:14----------
there are some diseases where you have


---------25:15----------
the functional impairment like something


---------25:18----------
isn't working right but it doesn't


---------25:19----------
necessarily have a causative agent got


---------25:22----------
it


---------25:22----------
okay it makes sense and and so i i know


---------25:25----------
you kind of


---------25:26----------
laugh about karma and coincidence but i


---------25:28----------
i don't think it's really coincidence at


---------25:30----------
all that


---------25:31----------
you were probably going through and we


---------25:34----------
can sort of see touches of this right so


---------25:36----------
like


---------25:37----------
sure so you were probably going through


---------25:39----------
a fair amount of psychological distress


---------25:42----------
around the age of 13.


---------25:45----------
uh yeah i think


---------25:48----------
maybe i i developed like some coping


---------25:52----------
mess


---------25:53----------
coping mechanisms of rationalism and


---------25:56----------
just being like


---------25:57----------
hey it's not logical to feel pain hey


---------26:01----------
like my dad's an idiot like don't feel


---------26:04----------
sad about that


---------26:05----------
you know like all that stuff yeah so so


---------26:08----------
this is


---------26:08----------
like this is a neat thing right so the


---------26:10----------
whole principle of the body


---------26:12----------
when you bury emotion do you know how it


---------26:14----------
comes out


---------26:16----------
it forces itself out i'm not sure how


---------26:19----------
yeah it forces itself out through the


---------26:21----------
body


---------26:22----------
yeah oh interesting


---------26:26----------
right so it's got to come out the


---------26:27----------
otherwise but i mean


---------26:29----------
there i'm sure that there could have


---------26:30----------
been a lot of common commonality in


---------26:32----------
terms of like different things that


---------26:34----------
could have been wrong for me


---------26:35----------
right and i just find it curious that it


---------26:39----------
was my stomach


---------26:40----------
right like it could you could apply this


---------26:42----------
to so many different parts of my body


---------26:44----------
um but the thing i was like trying to


---------26:45----------
use to fake became


---------26:47----------
the the specific point you know


---------26:51----------
yeah so there are physiologic reasons


---------26:52----------
for that


---------26:54----------
really yeah so that's crazy first


---------26:56----------
question is do you know


---------26:57----------
what the most common treatment for


---------27:00----------
medication treatment


---------27:02----------
for depression is do you happen to know


---------27:05----------
that


---------27:06----------
what do we use to treat depression do


---------27:08----------
you know


---------27:09----------
uh i don't know actually so like


---------27:12----------
antidepressants the most common one is


---------27:14----------
something called


---------27:16----------
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor


---------27:18----------
or an ssri


---------27:20----------
okay which essentially increases the


---------27:23----------
level of serotonin activity in the brain


---------27:26----------
so interesting side note which is do you


---------27:29----------
know


---------27:30----------
where serotonin is the most plentiful in


---------27:33----------
your body


---------27:35----------
no idea it's in the brain can you guess


---------27:38----------
where the second most


---------27:39----------
plentiful place for serotonin in the


---------27:40----------
body is


---------27:43----------
i'm getting this is the stomach


---------27:45----------
absolutely and you would be correct


---------27:48----------
okay so there there's actually a lot of


---------27:51----------
growing


---------27:51----------
evidence that mental health


---------27:54----------
and your gi system are intrinsically


---------27:57----------
connected


---------27:58----------
in fact there's an entire burgeoning


---------28:00----------
field of science called gut brain


---------28:02----------
health and this is the wildest


---------28:05----------
experiment that i tell people about


---------28:07----------
because it's my favorite example


---------28:08----------
they took a group of depressed mice okay


---------28:12----------
and you can tell a mouse is depressed in


---------28:14----------
one of two ways one is you put it


---------28:16----------
into like a novel environment and mice


---------28:19----------
tend to be like curious creatures and so


---------28:21----------
if it's a healthy mouse


---------28:22----------
it'll like get curious and explore


---------28:24----------
things if it's a depressed mouse it'll


---------28:26----------
just sit there and not do much


---------28:29----------
that's the more humane version the


---------28:30----------
second way you assess depression in the


---------28:32----------
mouse


---------28:32----------
is by putting it in a chamber with water


---------28:35----------
where there's nothing


---------28:36----------
there's nothing to there's nothing for


---------28:39----------
it to like stand on


---------28:40----------
and then a healthy mouse will struggle


---------28:43----------
to


---------28:44----------
swim until it gets tired and kind of


---------28:47----------
starts to drown which is sort of


---------28:48----------
inhumane


---------28:49----------
whereas the depressed mouths will give


---------28:50----------
up very easily


---------28:52----------
got it they don't actually let them


---------28:53----------
drown they you know pull them out but


---------28:55----------
they see how long they they try um


---------28:59----------
so they took a depressed mouse and then


---------29:01----------
they took its poop


---------29:02----------
and they transplanted its poop to a


---------29:04----------
healthy mouse


---------29:05----------
and what they found is that the


---------29:07----------
transplanted poop


---------29:08----------
led to depression interesting


---------29:12----------
i would buy that it's weird yeah


---------29:18----------
and and so we also know that like


---------29:19----------
physiologically like when you're


---------29:21----------
feeling stress or depression so one of


---------29:25----------
the


---------29:26----------
one of the nine diagnostic criteria for


---------29:29----------
depression is changes in


---------29:31----------
appetite or weight gain


---------29:34----------
got it so nine things that sort of we


---------29:37----------
look for in depression so the stomach


---------29:39----------
and the brain are actually


---------29:41----------
very closely linked yeah and i


---------29:44----------
i don't think it's much of a i don't


---------29:46----------
think it's karma per se


---------29:48----------
but we know that for example like


---------29:50----------
children who are distressed will


---------29:52----------
experience stomach aches and that


---------29:53----------
oftentimes


---------29:54----------
stomach aches are sore when we say


---------29:56----------
psychological in origin it doesn't mean


---------29:58----------
that there isn't something going on in


---------30:00----------
the stomach


---------30:01----------
there is something going on in the


---------30:02----------
stomach it's just that our brain and


---------30:04----------
it's


---------30:05----------
wild but our brain and our bodies are


---------30:07----------
actually connected


---------30:08----------
and our psychology and physiology are


---------30:11----------
actually connected


---------30:12----------
and ibs is a very good example


---------30:16----------
of one of these conditions where a lot


---------30:18----------
of people will have treatment


---------30:20----------
and then it won't really work because


---------30:22----------
it's unclear exactly what's wrong


---------30:24----------
and then they'll come to me and then


---------30:26----------
i'll treat them for a little while or


---------30:28----------
ibs will go away


---------30:31----------
i i i think it's interesting because


---------30:34----------
the the part i think is fascinating


---------30:38----------
is when i when i saw it before the


---------30:41----------
the brain and the body being linked and


---------30:43----------
being able to


---------30:44----------
cause harm to each other made sense


---------30:47----------
right


---------30:47----------
but it's the specific quality of it


---------30:50----------
being linked to the


---------30:51----------
the stomach or the mouth like i've read


---------30:53----------
some stuff about like


---------30:55----------
potentially like healthy uh


---------30:58----------
you know gums and gum function and just


---------31:01----------
like


---------31:02----------
you know mouth bacteria lead to like


---------31:04----------
something related to the brain right


---------31:06----------
yep and so i thought it was like more


---------31:08----------
uniform


---------31:09----------
like if you start having like a lot of


---------31:12----------
stress


---------31:13----------
and anxiety and all these things that


---------31:15----------
you start to take a


---------31:17----------
full toll on your body but i i it must


---------31:20----------
be more specific than that right


---------31:23----------
yeah so you're saying that your global


---------31:25----------
body function is affected equally


---------31:27----------
yes yeah so it turns out that that's not


---------31:30----------
necessarily the case and that there is


---------31:31----------
specificity


---------31:33----------
um you said something else there that i


---------31:36----------
wanted to


---------31:36----------
mention for a second but i lost track of


---------31:39----------
it anyway


---------31:40----------
let's find out um oh yeah you said that


---------31:42----------
one is able to hurt the other


---------31:44----------
yes so that's not how i think about it


---------31:47----------
i think about i don't think they hurt


---------31:49----------
each other i think they're on the same


---------31:52----------
team


---------31:53----------
and what they're doing is transferring


---------31:55----------
some amount of damage from one to the


---------31:57----------
other


---------31:58----------
okay fair enough i agree that um


---------32:02----------
so let's kind of go back to this so


---------32:05----------
can you tell me a little bit about how


---------32:07----------
you felt about your dad divorcing your


---------32:09----------
mom


---------32:11----------
um yeah so i rationalized it


---------32:14----------
when i was 13 that


---------32:17----------
my dad's just not a great person he's


---------32:20----------
not a great


---------32:21----------
father and he did something bad to my


---------32:25----------
mother


---------32:26----------
and like i need to


---------32:29----------
like and he wasn't really like he he


---------32:32----------
wasn't like that


---------32:33----------
emotionally connected to me i guess


---------32:35----------
maybe when i was a kid i had like that


---------32:37----------
image of the app


---------32:38----------
like him giving me diablo and like


---------32:40----------
playing some games with me when i was


---------32:42----------
very young but at a certain point he


---------32:44----------
just stopped being there


---------32:47----------
and i think if he was there more or i


---------32:49----------
didn't have my grandfather


---------32:51----------
i would have been i would have been like


---------32:52----------
i think more stricken by that


---------32:55----------
um but i just rationalized as like hey


---------32:58----------
not a good dude


---------32:59----------
my mom's a good person my grandparents


---------33:01----------
are good people i have my family


---------33:03----------
so he can go do his own thing


---------33:09----------
why do you use the word rationalize uh


---------33:13----------
because it helped me uh


---------33:17----------
make sense of everything


---------33:22----------
like think about it i play warcraft


---------33:24----------
three


---------33:25----------
how i win is not through emotion it's


---------33:28----------
through pure logic


---------33:30----------
right it's like a and so


---------33:33----------
i bring the game components into my real


---------33:37----------
life


---------33:38----------
that's what got me to where i am now um


---------33:43----------
is is figuring out how to pull that


---------33:45----------
those those learnings and the way my


---------33:47----------
brain works pattern recognition blah


---------33:48----------
blah


---------33:49----------
into but i brought it into the i brought


---------33:53----------
it into the real world maybe too much


---------33:55----------
why do you say you brought it into the


---------33:57----------
real world too much uh


---------34:01----------
that's this is later stuff this is like


---------34:02----------
when you realize


---------34:04----------
like how things are linked in your


---------34:06----------
childhood and how you grow up to


---------34:08----------
to like form who you are and stuff


---------34:12----------
isn't that what we're talking about uh i


---------34:15----------
mean if you


---------34:18----------
uh


---------34:20----------
you kind of okay i i guess i guess i i


---------34:23----------
thought


---------34:23----------
we were going through like a more


---------34:25----------
positive sure chronologically yeah


---------34:27----------
yeah let me just george let me ask you


---------34:29----------
questions if you want to connect


---------34:30----------
are you in a relationship right now yeah


---------34:34----------
how's that going uh very well


---------34:39----------
um okay yeah sorry i tend to jump out


---------34:43----------
around a little bit


---------34:44----------
um so i'm gonna go back to this idea of


---------34:46----------
rationalization for a second


---------34:48----------
sure so if you're rationalizing that


---------34:51----------
implies


---------34:52----------
to me like just your the way that you


---------34:53----------
talk about it implies to me that there


---------34:55----------
are other things within you


---------34:59----------
okay right so if you say


---------35:02----------
like if you say i rationalized it to


---------35:04----------
myself dot dot dot


---------35:06----------
which implies that you're taking and you


---------35:08----------
used a really good analogy with the


---------35:10----------
gaming right so like


---------35:11----------
you have emotions and you have rational


---------35:12----------
thought and what we're going to do is


---------35:14----------
push our emotions to the side and we're


---------35:16----------
going to focus on the rational


---------35:17----------
and then you even did a great great job


---------35:19----------
then you said i took the strategy and


---------35:21----------
then i applied it to my real life


---------35:22----------
which implies that there were other


---------35:24----------
things that you thought or felt which


---------35:26----------
had


---------35:26----------
been pushed to the side in favor of


---------35:28----------
rationality


---------35:30----------
yeah so i can actually really remember


---------35:32----------
that time period


---------35:34----------
because like i love it for a lot of


---------35:36----------
reasons


---------35:37----------
but um and also like it was hard for a


---------35:40----------
lot of reasons


---------35:42----------
um i


---------35:45----------
wasn't that strongly connected


---------35:48----------
with my dad like i it didn't


---------35:52----------
it didn't hurt i think other things in


---------35:55----------
my life


---------35:56----------
like seeing my parents cry or seeing my


---------35:58----------
mom cry


---------35:59----------
see my grandmother cry like going


---------36:02----------
through hardships with my family


---------36:04----------
that stuff hurt right and i like i


---------36:06----------
sucked it up to be


---------36:08----------
strong because that's like kind of like


---------36:10----------
the status quo for the


---------36:12----------
men in the family but as far as my


---------36:16----------
connection to my dad


---------36:19----------
it's never really hurt it never really


---------36:21----------
hurt


---------36:22----------
um maybe that's weird but i can like


---------36:25----------
firmly remember that


---------36:27----------
yeah okay i i think i i can get behind


---------36:29----------
that because you seem very confident


---------36:31----------
that


---------36:32----------
your dad is sort of sounding like just


---------36:34----------
another dude he's just another dude


---------36:37----------
he's he's just another dude i mean he


---------36:39----------
wasn't around much right as i


---------36:41----------
explained earlier um


---------36:44----------
he brought me diablo which is my


---------36:45----------
favorite memory right


---------36:47----------
uh but other than that it's kind of like


---------36:49----------
blank


---------36:50----------
yeah right do you remember feeling a


---------36:54----------
particular way not so much about him


---------36:55----------
just being another dude but the fact


---------36:58----------
that you


---------36:59----------
grew up with just another dude for a dad


---------37:02----------
instead of a real dad


---------37:04----------
um my grandfather was like my real dad


---------37:07----------
for for me


---------37:08----------
and so like if i didn't have my


---------37:10----------
grandfather i'd probably be


---------37:12----------
more of a mess but he was he was there


---------37:14----------
for me all the time


---------37:16----------
okay so i lived with him a lot yeah


---------37:20----------
i mean i i think you yeah you talk about


---------37:23----------
him


---------37:24----------
with a lot of respect and love and it


---------37:26----------
sounds like he really was there for you


---------37:28----------
and did all the things that a dad


---------37:30----------
should do like you know teach


---------37:33----------
you take the time to like teach you


---------37:36----------
things and show you things


---------37:38----------
and also like respect you enough to kind


---------37:40----------
of make your own decisions have the


---------37:41----------
faith in you that you're going to make


---------37:43----------
the right ones


---------37:44----------
um it sounds like he was an awesome


---------37:46----------
person also we're just an awesome person


---------37:48----------
yep and you're talking you you use the


---------37:51----------
past tense when you talk about your


---------37:53----------
grandfather in the present tense when


---------37:54----------
you talk about your grandmother


---------37:56----------
yeah my grandfather passed away uh


---------38:00----------
while i was in the us um he


---------38:04----------
this is where we're jumping a little bit


---------38:06----------
but i'm fine because i think you want to


---------38:08----------
do that


---------38:09----------
um i was


---------38:12----------
illegally in the u.s um


---------38:15----------
because the visa situations were hard at


---------38:17----------
the start of the esports


---------38:20----------
like my visa was one of the first


---------38:22----------
esports visas ever


---------38:24----------
and i was operating clg and what


---------38:28----------
happened was if i went back to the u.s


---------38:32----------
i couldn't continue clg and i couldn't


---------38:34----------
continue just gaming in general and he


---------38:36----------
passed away while we were


---------38:38----------
while i was in u.s and he was in canada


---------38:41----------
and he told me


---------38:43----------
to like i was like hey i want to come


---------38:45----------
back


---------38:46----------
he said don't come back like stay


---------38:49----------
in the u.s like i love you


---------38:52----------
you don't have to do this like grandma


---------38:55----------
knows


---------38:56----------
like just stay there um i'm gonna be


---------38:59----------
fine


---------39:00----------
and obviously he wasn't fine but uh


---------39:03----------
that was super hard for me


---------39:07----------
yeah was that like not going back


---------39:12----------
um


---------39:15----------
i knew what he was trying to say


---------39:19----------
um i knew he was like be strong george


---------39:23----------
like i i know what mission i put you on


---------39:27----------
right i know who i wanted you to be like


---------39:31----------
keep doing it like i'm proud of you


---------39:33----------
that's what he


---------39:34----------
that's what he was saying and like i


---------39:37----------
think


---------39:38----------
he was also trying to save me some like


---------39:40----------
emotional damage too


---------39:42----------
of well maybe like emotional relief with


---------39:46----------
everybody


---------39:46----------
i i like i get really sad when my


---------39:48----------
grandma gets sad and so like being there


---------39:50----------
with everybody


---------39:51----------
probably would have uh uh


---------39:54----------
probably would have been a huge burden


---------39:58----------
while trying to like manage clg


---------40:00----------
run clg and play on the team like i was


---------40:03----------
just


---------40:03----------
so overwhelmed with so many things at


---------40:05----------
that time


---------40:10----------
sounds like he was looking out for you


---------40:12----------
yeah he was


---------40:13----------
always even towards the end


---------40:17----------
put you first mm-hmm


---------40:22----------
sounds


---------40:26----------
i can also see how altruism isn't just a


---------40:28----------
defense mechanism for you because i


---------40:30----------
think you learned


---------40:34----------
i'm very sure i learned it yeah


---------40:38----------
sounds like you miss him a lot of course


---------40:42----------
we all do yeah


---------40:49----------
what are you feeling right now


---------40:53----------
i'm sad um very sad like i


---------40:58----------
kind of feel like i want to cry but


---------41:01----------
i'm stopping myself because


---------41:07----------
one i don't want to cry on stream


---------41:11----------
and two


---------41:15----------
that's actually probably the right thing


---------41:17----------
to do


---------41:18----------
based on what i want to do um


---------41:23----------
i have a really


---------41:27----------
and and i have a really uh this is


---------41:30----------
sorry my thoughts are getting confused


---------41:32----------
my feelings right now um


---------41:36----------
i think a lot of the problems that


---------41:38----------
people


---------41:40----------
have are they're not able they're not


---------41:42----------
able to connect with emotions


---------41:44----------
like people aren't resonating with their


---------41:46----------
true self and their truths


---------41:47----------
their true feelings and so


---------41:50----------
part of


---------41:53----------
me accepting to come here is to


---------41:57----------
really really


---------42:00----------
show that i'm like a human being and


---------42:03----------
that we're all human beings


---------42:05----------
right and i think


---------42:08----------
we forget that very often um


---------42:13----------
and i'm sure that you're aware of that


---------42:16----------
that paradigm just being very true in


---------42:20----------
this space


---------42:23----------
it seems to me like the emotions are


---------42:25----------
even more powerful as you say that


---------42:28----------
yes of course why


---------42:31----------
i mean


---------42:36----------
you have to really like hone in on some


---------42:38----------
of the stuff that's happened


---------42:40----------
um and some of the people that have come


---------42:41----------
on here right


---------42:43----------
i have a lot of respect for you um


---------42:46----------
[Music]


---------42:48----------
because you're able to


---------42:51----------
get people to a place where they're


---------42:53----------
honest to help others


---------42:56----------
that's that's what i see you as um


---------43:02----------
and so um


---------43:07----------
you know for reckful for a lot of


---------43:10----------
different people


---------43:12----------
and influencers streamers whatever you


---------43:15----------
want to call them


---------43:17----------
um it's really hard even people


---------43:22----------
that play sports um to commit to like


---------43:27----------
a journey to be in front of


---------43:30----------
media and others it's


---------43:33----------
very hard there's a huge cost associated


---------43:36----------
to it


---------43:37----------
that we all just shove under


---------43:41----------
what's that cost it's our like humanity


---------43:48----------
really is you feel like you've


---------43:50----------
sacrificed that


---------43:52----------
oh for sure i sacrificed that a lot


---------43:55----------
um and i see it doesn't matter what part


---------43:59----------
of success that you go to


---------44:04----------
it's prevalent everywhere it's like a


---------44:07----------
disease like


---------44:08----------
everywhere it doesn't matter if it's


---------44:12----------
if if you're you know


---------44:15----------
at the bottom of a company if you're at


---------44:17----------
the top of a company


---------44:19----------
it doesn't matter if you're just like


---------44:21----------
someone that


---------44:22----------
you know is just playing games that uh


---------44:26----------
and and and are part of these


---------44:30----------
communities like it's everywhere


---------44:32----------
um so yeah


---------44:37----------
we're losing our humanity we're losing


---------44:39----------
our humanity


---------44:45----------
can i think for a second sure


---------44:52----------
i'm gonna lighten the mood a touch


---------44:54----------
because you've told me that you don't


---------44:57----------
want to cry so


---------45:00----------
i think that that was a defense


---------45:03----------
mechanism


---------45:04----------
not wanting to cry if i want my father


---------45:07----------
to say that


---------45:08----------
i came here on a mission in which is to


---------45:12----------
talk about things to help


---------45:13----------
the people and if you think honestly


---------45:16----------
think


---------45:17----------
that i can help other people by talking


---------45:19----------
about this


---------45:20----------
those things that i'm okay talking about


---------45:22----------
them why do you need to help other


---------45:24----------
people


---------45:27----------
because it's important to me that people


---------45:30----------
don't suffer the same way i did and


---------45:32----------
that's important to me


---------45:35----------
[ __ ] where'd i begin dude uh


---------45:38----------
i didn't know i had feelings i've


---------45:41----------
rationalized that i had feelings


---------45:44----------
up until like a year and a half ago


---------45:48----------
and then the start of even recognizing


---------45:50----------
that i had feelings


---------45:53----------
was like i didn't know what the [ __ ] was


---------45:55----------
going on


---------45:57----------
that's basically what it was what


---------45:59----------
happened a year and a half ago


---------46:02----------
uh


---------46:08----------
um god damn okay i


---------46:11----------
i i would say that the biggest thing and


---------46:14----------
i i hate to talk about this


---------46:17----------
this is where we get a little


---------46:22----------
i went to my first rave


---------46:26----------
uh


---------46:30----------
i don't like talking about this because


---------46:32----------
i think you know where it goes


---------46:34----------
and i think it's a very uh


---------46:41----------
maybe maybe no okay okay fine i'll just


---------46:43----------
talk about it


---------46:45----------
i took a drug


---------46:49----------
and i used to s okay no i should talk


---------46:53----------
about this


---------46:54----------
[ __ ] um


---------46:57----------
i took a drug and then in the moment


---------47:01----------
i started feeling and then i recognized


---------47:05----------
how other people would feel and i


---------47:08----------
recognized


---------47:11----------
what that felt like um


---------47:19----------
and then i've tried to like


---------47:23----------
understand how i felt and what the


---------47:26----------
differences of like how i was feeling at


---------47:27----------
the time versus how i normally am


---------47:31----------
try to understand how i can get there


---------47:33----------
like mentally


---------47:35----------
spiritually like physically without the


---------47:37----------
need of that


---------47:39----------
um but that was like the catalyst


---------47:42----------
to like really push me in that way and


---------47:45----------
what did you realize about


---------47:47----------
how other people felt


---------47:50----------
um


---------47:56----------
that they were suffering a lot of people


---------47:59----------
were suffering


---------48:01----------
and a lot of people were able to have


---------48:04----------
fun and enjoy the company of each other


---------48:06----------
um just like everything that has to do


---------48:09----------
with emotions


---------48:10----------
like to be able to like really feel what


---------48:13----------
it's like to be that other person


---------48:15----------
um i'm not like


---------48:19----------
you know i don't fully understand it to


---------48:21----------
this day right like i'm still learning


---------48:24----------
um but yeah i get it


---------48:31----------
did you feel somehow responsible for


---------48:33----------
their suffering


---------48:37----------
no i don't i think


---------48:40----------
i don't feel responsible for


---------48:46----------
for like the suffering of those around


---------48:48----------
me


---------48:49----------
um i think there is a level of


---------48:53----------
responsibility i have to like the gaming


---------48:55----------
community


---------48:56----------
because i was like a leader in it i was


---------48:59----------
a part of it


---------49:01----------
and um but like if you ask me like am i


---------49:04----------
responsible for everybody that suffers


---------49:06----------
around me i'd say no


---------49:09----------
do you feel responsible for anyone who


---------49:11----------
suffers around you


---------49:17----------
um no i think i i think i'm


---------49:22----------
i think i'm there to help people that


---------49:24----------
are trying to listen


---------49:26----------
i i like you can't help someone that


---------49:28----------
doesn't want to help themselves


---------49:30----------
right so i think bearing that


---------49:31----------
responsibility


---------49:33----------
is a little too much um


---------49:36----------
do you help yourself yeah


---------49:40----------
i do i do help myself a lot okay um


---------49:44----------
but yeah this is this is like very


---------49:47----------
complex and it's just like you know it's


---------49:48----------
a lot


---------49:49----------
um but what's feel free to ask questions


---------49:56----------
um


---------49:58----------
so the way my brain works is like i


---------50:00----------
think of


---------50:01----------
50 things at once and how they're all


---------50:03----------
interconnected


---------50:05----------
um and so there's like


---------50:08----------
it's really hard for me to speak out


---------50:10----------
loud i usually think first and then


---------50:11----------
speak


---------50:12----------
but when thoughts get very complicated


---------50:14----------
in my head


---------50:15----------
it really screws up my communication


---------50:18----------
so do you feel like you're not


---------50:20----------
communicating well right now


---------50:22----------
um i have no idea


---------50:27----------
i would say my communication is like


---------50:28----------
generally not that great


---------50:30----------
uh but yeah


---------50:33----------
i don't know


---------50:37----------
can i think for a second sure go ahead


---------50:41----------
[Music]


---------50:50----------
so i'm a little confused


---------50:55----------
sure um and i i don't think it's because


---------50:58----------
you're communicating poorly i think it's


---------51:00----------
just


---------51:02----------
i understood where we were and i sort of


---------51:05----------
understand where we are now


---------51:07----------
i don't really understand how we got


---------51:08----------
from a to b because something changed


---------51:10----------
very rapidly we were talking about your


---------51:12----------
grandfather


---------51:13----------
understandable that you have emotions


---------51:15----------
there


---------51:17----------
and then we started talking about like


---------51:19----------
the hurt of the world and that seemed to


---------51:21----------
evoke even more emotion


---------51:23----------
yes and and i got the sense that


---------51:28----------
i almost feel like i imagine you know


---------51:30----------
they're


---------51:31----------
i'm from texas and in texas you know


---------51:34----------
they're


---------51:34----------
like oil fields and so you'd have a


---------51:36----------
farmer that would be digging a ditch


---------51:38----------
and they'd they'd hit something and then


---------51:40----------
oil would start spurting out of the


---------51:41----------
ground and it's sort of like wait where


---------51:42----------
did that come from


---------51:43----------
clearly something there clearly


---------51:45----------
something important


---------51:47----------
not what i expected i was looking for a


---------51:50----------
potato


---------51:51----------
and i found one yeah yeah and so so


---------51:54----------
i'm kind of trying to understand a


---------51:56----------
little bit i'm just kind of i'm sharing


---------51:58----------
with you what i'm processing right now


---------51:59----------
which is sort of like where to go from


---------52:01----------
here and what's useful


---------52:03----------
and um because i understood where we


---------52:05----------
were


---------52:07----------
i was sort of like i mean i wouldn't


---------52:08----------
quite say leading but like i


---------52:10----------
kind of had a couple of hypotheses i'll


---------52:12----------
all


---------52:13----------
maybe help you uh and just speak out


---------52:16----------
loud um


---------52:19----------
okay fundamentally like


---------52:22----------
i feel obligated


---------52:27----------
to try to make the world a better place


---------52:31----------
and because i see the human cost


---------52:35----------
of everything that we're doing uh within


---------52:38----------
our country


---------52:39----------
uh within with our within my friend


---------52:42----------
groups


---------52:43----------
just around the world i consume just


---------52:46----------
like a huge


---------52:47----------
amount of information right of so many


---------52:50----------
different fields


---------52:51----------
right uh and i i hit the surface level


---------52:53----------
of all them


---------52:54----------
but i see them connect right and and


---------52:58----------
and i also ask so many different people


---------53:02----------
like the question why and i asked it so


---------53:05----------
many different


---------53:06----------
ways to try to understand uh


---------53:11----------
understand what's going on in the world


---------53:15----------
and


---------53:19----------
i i'm stopping asking why


---------53:23----------
and i finally am like building a


---------53:25----------
conclusion


---------53:28----------
and from that conclusion


---------53:30----------
[Music]


---------53:33----------
i've found some sort of motivation to


---------53:36----------
reach deeper into myself


---------53:38----------
to be a different kind of person um


---------53:43----------
and try to help other people


---------53:46----------
and i'm going through great lengths of


---------53:48----------
like really challenging myself


---------53:51----------
like i have all the money i could


---------53:53----------
possibly


---------53:54----------
want like i have a house i have good


---------53:57----------
friends


---------53:58----------
i have very limited i have


---------54:02----------
very low responsibility right now like


---------54:08----------
but


---------54:10----------
i think i found a purpose in life that i


---------54:12----------
really care about


---------54:14----------
um and i'm just chasing that purpose


---------54:17----------
right now


---------54:20----------
what do you feel when you say that


---------54:25----------
um


---------54:30----------
feels good


---------54:33----------
you know it seems like like you're on


---------54:35----------
the verge of tears but i get the sense


---------54:37----------
of a powerful sort of like


---------54:39----------
resolve you know i i'm getting the


---------54:43----------
valence of emotion as being positive and


---------54:45----------
sometimes what i'm i'm sort of getting


---------54:47----------
is that you're not


---------54:49----------
it just has a physiologic effect right


---------54:52----------
this is what we were talking about


---------54:53----------
for a while is that it just has an


---------54:55----------
effect on your body when you


---------54:57----------
think certain thoughts and you feel that


---------54:59----------
purpose and your body just has to


---------55:01----------
like you see how some of the weight of


---------55:04----------
what's on


---------55:05----------
in your mental space has to be carried


---------55:07----------
by your body


---------55:09----------
yes and your body's just carrying it as


---------55:11----------
best as it can which is sort of like


---------55:12----------
physical emotional expression


---------55:14----------
yeah what was the conclusion you came to


---------55:20----------
um the conclusion is that


---------55:24----------
everybody is suffering more and more


---------55:27----------
we're on a train of


---------55:31----------
like critical malfunction


---------55:35----------
and it's getting worse no one's


---------55:37----------
recognizing


---------55:38----------
the problem um the problem


---------55:42----------
there being like we are disconnected


---------55:44----------
from our emotions


---------55:45----------
we are losing our humanity and


---------55:49----------
we're losing the ability to help each


---------55:51----------
other


---------55:52----------
uh for this needless pursuit of wanting


---------55:55----------
more and more and more


---------55:57----------
and also i think they're underlying to


---------56:01----------
all that


---------56:02----------
is we use a lot of rationale


---------56:06----------
and ideas to stop ourselves from


---------56:10----------
admitting the truth


---------56:11----------
or even searching for the truth um what


---------56:16----------
i see


---------56:17----------
is it doesn't matter how high you climb


---------56:20----------
billionaires millionaires i've talked to


---------56:23----------
them


---------56:25----------
everybody is building this layer of


---------56:27----------
rationale


---------56:29----------
on why they do things and


---------56:35----------
no one's searching to see if that's like


---------56:38----------
the truth right if if their version of


---------56:42----------
reality is even


---------56:43----------
like congruent with with what's


---------56:45----------
happening in the world with other


---------56:46----------
people's experiences with other people's


---------56:48----------
emotions


---------56:49----------
um i think there's some people that are


---------56:53----------
doing it but


---------56:55----------
yeah you know i i think the challenge


---------56:58----------
when i listen to you


---------56:59----------
is that sure you know earlier i kind of


---------57:01----------
mentioned


---------57:02----------
i don't know if your altruism is like a


---------57:06----------
manifestation of avoidance as well and


---------57:08----------
you kind of said i agree and disagree


---------57:10----------
so once again i don't i don't think this


---------57:12----------
is mutually exclusive but i don't know


---------57:14----------
if what you just said


---------57:16----------
is you know a quite like a tarma for the


---------57:19----------
for life or if it's the mother lode of


---------57:22----------
all projective identification


---------57:24----------
yeah i don't


---------57:28----------
i would have to be


---------57:32----------
i can't i can't know like right like i


---------57:37----------
because just the way that you're


---------57:38----------
describing things you sound like you're


---------57:40----------
talking about yourself


---------57:42----------
yes i know i know i know but uh


---------57:46----------
that's how i help uh


---------57:53----------
uh linking it to myself


---------58:01----------
is just a way of


---------58:06----------
helping me articulate it


---------58:12----------
if i like think in my head i think about


---------58:16----------
all the recent conversations


---------58:19----------
of other people where we just dig under


---------58:22----------
the surface a little bit


---------58:24----------
and just like really connect with each


---------58:26----------
other


---------58:29----------
and i just see all of them


---------58:36----------
having a lot of similarity in pain


---------58:39----------
and experiences


---------58:44----------
what about your own pain


---------58:50----------
what do you do what do you mean what do


---------58:51----------
you do with your pain


---------58:53----------
uh i share it with other people um


---------58:57----------
i ask them to walk me through like how


---------59:01----------
i'm feeling


---------59:03----------
uh i try to talk talk with them to


---------59:08----------
are you in pain george


---------59:12----------
no i mean like generally speaking


---------59:17----------
i would say like my general state is a


---------59:19----------
little bit stressed


---------59:21----------
um you seem to be in intense pain to me


---------59:26----------
really yeah when you talk about these


---------59:30----------
things


---------59:33----------
okay sorry this is like i think our


---------59:35----------
communication


---------59:36----------
is falling apart a little bit um


---------59:41----------
this is where i think i become a bad


---------59:43----------
communicator


---------59:44----------
uh and oh god brian would be so


---------59:50----------
i have a roommate named brian and he's


---------59:52----------
probably like one of the


---------59:53----------
greatest people i've ever met in my life


---------59:56----------
um


---------59:58----------
and


---------60:01----------
he's helped me become


---------60:07----------
a better person and he like through


---------60:10----------
a lot of communication that we have with


---------60:13----------
each other


---------60:14----------
i will i will say things that don't line


---------60:17----------
up with


---------60:19----------
who i am very frequently and what i


---------60:21----------
think


---------60:22----------
and i communicate like the wrong


---------60:24----------
sentiment and


---------60:26----------
very frequently he would say like george


---------60:28----------
i've known you for like


---------60:30----------
a year i know that's not what you're


---------60:32----------
saying uh


---------60:34----------
and then he would like correct my


---------60:41----------
i'm just i'm having a really hard time


---------60:43----------
communicating right now i i don't know


---------60:44----------
how to do i think you're doing


---------60:46----------
a great job communicating oh thank you


---------60:49----------
so that makes me feel better i have a


---------60:51----------
couple of counterpoints so when i say i


---------60:53----------
think


---------60:53----------
i see a lot of pain right now that's not


---------60:57----------
me misinterpreting it's my attempt at


---------61:01----------
clarifying to make sure that we're on


---------61:03----------
the same page


---------61:04----------
because communicate communication


---------61:06----------
problems are inevitable


---------61:07----------
right so when you talk about the


---------61:09----------
suffering of the world and how we're


---------61:11----------
losing humanity


---------61:12----------
i almost see in you a manifestation


---------61:16----------
of that pain when you talk about it you


---------61:19----------
talk


---------61:19----------
so deeply and with such conviction


---------61:23----------
that it hurts you to see this happening


---------61:26----------
all around you


---------61:28----------
correct okay i'm on the same page there


---------61:30----------
i


---------61:31----------
i was misinterpreting like


---------61:35----------
the pain as being like always


---------61:38----------
pain like george you're like always in


---------61:40----------
the state of pain


---------61:41----------
okay yeah i don't know why i thought


---------61:43----------
there or like where i got there


---------61:44----------
i i i couldn't make the connection i


---------61:47----------
mean you hurt


---------61:48----------
man like when you talk about it like i


---------61:51----------
see hurt


---------61:52----------
in you of course yeah of course


---------61:56----------
i see others suffering and i think about


---------62:00----------
how much i was suffering and


---------62:05----------
i just want i did


---------62:08----------
i want to help people like i i don't


---------62:09----------
know tell me about your suffering


---------62:12----------
um oh like this is maybe why


---------62:16----------
chronological order would have helped


---------62:23----------
okay


---------62:30----------
i went through a period


---------62:34----------
where


---------62:41----------
i went down what i would call a dark


---------62:44----------
path


---------62:46----------
um and


---------62:50----------
i was acting with the sense of just like


---------62:57----------
this is how everybody does it this is


---------63:00----------
how


---------63:01----------
people should do it um


---------63:04----------
[Music]


---------63:06----------
and this is just the way things are


---------63:10----------
and when operating in


---------63:14----------
esports


---------63:18----------
a lot of the early days were very


---------63:24----------
rough like cheating


---------63:27----------
lying manipulating those


---------63:30----------
qualities are still ever present and


---------63:33----------
maybe even worse in esports now


---------63:36----------
and those values conflicted


---------63:40----------
with the ideals of


---------63:44----------
the people that i love and


---------63:47----------
have cared for or have have cared for me


---------63:52----------
my entire life and when i got into


---------63:55----------
esports and i got into business


---------64:01----------
i suffered so much pain by following


---------64:04----------
those ideals


---------64:07----------
that i shoved them all away


---------64:11----------
and i just started operating like


---------64:13----------
everybody else


---------64:17----------
so here's what i'm hearing


---------64:20----------
the way you behaved in esports would


---------64:23----------
have


---------64:23----------
would be something that your grandfather


---------64:25----------
was ashamed of


---------64:36----------
no i don't think he would


---------64:39----------
be ashamed of it um


---------64:41----------
[Music]


---------64:45----------
he would be sad


---------64:49----------
right because i think he's someone that


---------64:51----------
fought for a better world for us to live


---------64:54----------
in right


---------64:57----------
but you know someone that has lived in


---------64:59----------
war


---------65:00----------
knows the importance of


---------65:04----------
not going back there right and


---------65:09----------
for me


---------65:12----------
what's happening all around and this is


---------65:14----------
what i feel


---------65:22----------
is we're almost like at war with each


---------65:24----------
other


---------65:25----------
uh


---------65:29----------
and the humanity and being nice to each


---------65:31----------
other


---------65:33----------
and being a thoughtful person and trying


---------65:35----------
to help each other is


---------65:39----------
isn't what's happening like


---------65:42----------
it's it's like we're always at war


---------65:45----------
um and so i don't think he would be


---------65:50----------
ashamed of me


---------65:52----------
i think he would just be sad that like


---------65:54----------
the world is


---------65:55----------
in in my view like not changing we're


---------65:58----------
not


---------65:59----------
trying to build a better future i think


---------66:01----------
that's


---------66:02----------
the part of him that would be sad


---------66:06----------
how do you feel about being a


---------66:07----------
participant of that war


---------66:09----------
because it sounds like that's what you


---------66:11----------
did


---------66:12----------
yeah uh


---------66:19----------
i


---------66:23----------
feel responsible


---------66:26----------
but i don't put


---------66:30----------
the weight of it all on me


---------66:33----------
i i recognize


---------66:36----------
that i'm inherently a good person or i


---------66:38----------
try to be a good person


---------66:40----------
but man it's [ __ ] hard it's really


---------66:44----------
[ __ ] hard


---------66:46----------
i can't tell you like if you're trying


---------66:49----------
to be a good person


---------66:50----------
and everybody else is


---------66:53----------
really trying to look after themselves


---------66:55----------
and be selfish


---------66:57----------
and they start hurting you they start


---------67:01----------
backstabbing you they start breaking


---------67:03----------
your trust


---------67:04----------
you have two choices you either get the


---------67:07----------
[ __ ] out


---------67:08----------
or you survive that's it


---------67:12----------
and to survive you start to fall into


---------67:16----------
the system


---------67:19----------
that's just how it is


---------67:24----------
so you know george i'm hearing something


---------67:27----------
kind of interesting


---------67:28----------
which is that like sure underneath all


---------67:30----------
of your statements


---------67:31----------
i think guilt would fit well


---------67:35----------
but i've i've asked you i've asked you


---------67:38----------
several times kind of nudging around


---------67:40----------
guilt yeah but you seem to block it


---------67:44----------
you don't seem to agree when i sort of


---------67:47----------
toss out guilt


---------67:50----------
like so for example i think yeah yeah so


---------67:55----------
i i feel like i'm guilty for jumping on


---------67:58----------
the train


---------68:00----------
right but i'm not gonna beat myself


---------68:03----------
up over uh


---------68:08----------
it entirely because


---------68:11----------
i don't know how else to say it


---------68:14----------
there were so many [ __ ] people


---------68:18----------
that were trying to push me on that


---------68:20----------
[ __ ] train


---------68:22----------
and i i feel like an amount of guilt


---------68:26----------
right but


---------68:32----------
this is where i think it's a huge [ __ ]


---------68:34----------
it's it's a huge


---------68:35----------
problem so


---------68:38----------
you know what i mean like uh george so


---------68:41----------
yeah so i i can't tell


---------68:44----------
if you're really far forward or really


---------68:46----------
stuck


---------68:48----------
can i share with you my dilemma yes


---------68:51----------
please i i


---------68:52----------
can't tell if you're halfway to


---------68:53----------
enlightenment or


---------68:55----------
on stage zero so let me explain to you


---------68:59----------
so when we talk about


---------69:00----------
guilt what do you respond with


---------69:03----------
you say yeah i feel some guilt


---------69:07----------
but a lot of people were trying to push


---------69:09----------
me


---------69:10----------
it was the environment i was in it


---------69:12----------
wasn't my fault


---------69:16----------
that's what you say does that make sense


---------69:19----------
yes so what do we call that when someone


---------69:22----------
says


---------69:24----------
i did something bad but it wasn't my


---------69:26----------
fault what's what do we say that that


---------69:27----------
person is doing absolving response of


---------69:30----------
responsibility through what


---------69:34----------
through deflection through


---------69:36----------
rationalization


---------69:37----------
through justification right got it okay


---------69:39----------
it was the world


---------69:40----------
it was the world we lived in it's what


---------69:43----------
everyone did


---------69:44----------
either i could fail or i could play the


---------69:46----------
game it's rationalizing


---------69:50----------
okay it's what you do


---------69:53----------
yeah right that's your archmage with


---------69:56----------
your water elemental every game you know


---------69:58----------
your archmage


---------69:59----------
get your water elemental it's the


---------70:00----------
strategy that you use


---------70:02----------
and you have okay


---------70:07----------
i think and maybe this is like helpful


---------70:10----------
as


---------70:10----------
a connector i've thought about this a


---------70:13----------
lot


---------70:14----------
right and so i can tell you've thought


---------70:16----------
about it a lot


---------70:29----------
okay so i


---------70:33----------
i didn't do like okay so


---------70:37----------
if you're talking about esports as an


---------70:39----------
industry okay


---------70:42----------
i think it's clg


---------70:45----------
i tried my best to


---------70:48----------
be a good person that and i don't think


---------70:50----------
i did a whole lot of


---------70:51----------
wrong okay so like i think i did


---------70:59----------
i i think i think i tried to do


---------71:06----------
the best i could


---------71:10----------
and


---------71:15----------
i


---------71:15----------
[Music]


---------71:20----------
i think i always challenged myself


---------71:26----------
to try to be a good person in all this


---------71:35----------
and then something


---------71:39----------
bad happened


---------71:44----------
and then i jumped out of the way i


---------71:48----------
jumped like i got away from esports


---------71:50----------
entirely


---------71:52----------
and i think when i when i talk about my


---------71:54----------
inter when if you were to talk to me


---------71:56----------
about my interpersonal relationships


---------71:59----------
and how business manifested in them and


---------72:02----------
the pain that caused


---------72:04----------
i would feel infinite guilt


---------72:07----------
i would feel so much guilt and i do feel


---------72:11----------
so much guilt


---------72:14----------
but


---------72:19----------
when it comes to esports


---------72:22----------
i don't feel as guilty i don't know how


---------72:25----------
to just i don't know how else to


---------72:26----------
describe it yeah


---------72:27----------
yeah so george we've got a couple of


---------72:29----------
options okay


---------72:31----------
sure so first of all um


---------72:35----------
i just want to commend you for bringing


---------72:38----------
a hundred percent


---------72:40----------
today thanks i i can see that you're


---------72:43----------
bringing everything you've got


---------72:44----------
and and we're getting the synthesis


---------72:47----------
essence and results of all of your


---------72:52----------
reflection all of your exploration all


---------72:55----------
of your investigation


---------72:56----------
and i think i'm i'm grateful that you're


---------72:59----------
sharing all of this with us


---------73:01----------
thank you a couple of thoughts that i


---------73:03----------
have is like we have to pick a direction


---------73:06----------
okay so one is you know i find myself


---------73:09----------
being curious about


---------73:10----------
you're kind of talking in in in vague


---------73:13----------
terms like you said something happened


---------73:14----------
and then i jumped out of the way


---------73:16----------
so that seems emotionally charged to me


---------73:18----------
i don't know if we're steering clear of


---------73:20----------
that because of drama and things like


---------73:21----------
that you don't want to disclose that


---------73:23----------
or if you're just trying to sketch in


---------73:24----------
broad strokes and i should ask more


---------73:27----------
yeah this is hard i'll just i'll just


---------73:28----------
like be outright


---------73:30----------
um


---------73:34----------
around 2015.


---------73:39----------
[Music]


---------73:44----------
um


---------73:49----------
something how uh [ __ ] i'm okay


---------73:53----------
george yeah


---------73:56----------
i was giving you two options and we


---------73:59----------
don't have to talk about that if you


---------74:01----------
don't want to


---------74:02----------
i was experienced it's it's i i i want


---------74:05----------
to talk about it because i


---------74:07----------
i haven't really got another like real


---------74:09----------
serious opinion on this


---------74:11----------
it's just kind of like it just goes


---------74:14----------
under the bridge


---------74:15----------
and i think that this is like something


---------74:17----------
that has i carry with me today


---------74:20----------
something i'm really passionate about


---------74:22----------
and it kind of hurts me to see


---------74:26----------
um


---------74:29----------
which is when narratives can get


---------74:33----------
out of control truth doesn't matter


---------74:37----------
anymore


---------74:39----------
it's about the messaging


---------74:43----------
it's about what you can convince people


---------74:48----------
and the winner writes history in a sense


---------74:55----------
and for me there was a time in esports


---------74:59----------
and in the part the part of this is like


---------75:01----------
i forgiven these people


---------75:03----------
for doing this to me and causing me like


---------75:06----------
a lot of pain i spent like a year and a


---------75:08----------
half in isolation


---------75:10----------
like pretty much just by myself in an


---------75:13----------
apartment


---------75:14----------
in the dark because of how much pain i


---------75:17----------
went through


---------75:22----------
and i've like forgiven these people


---------75:27----------
if they ask for your forgiveness


---------75:31----------
no


---------75:36----------
long story short


---------75:40----------
maybe long story short it's not i'm


---------75:42----------
really sensitive about this


---------75:43----------
uh okay there was a point


---------75:47----------
in history clg history where


---------75:52----------
someone on clg had a lot of credibility


---------75:57----------
in a false narrative


---------76:00----------
about their character


---------76:04----------
and what ended up happening is that


---------76:08----------
person did


---------76:13----------
they betrayed many people within clg


---------76:17----------
they utterly betrayed me


---------76:22----------
they use their social leverage


---------76:27----------
to change the conversation and narrative


---------76:32----------
when i was trying


---------76:36----------
to do the right thing


---------76:41----------
and what happened was


---------76:45----------
millions of people started


---------76:48----------
to say things about me


---------76:52----------
believe things about me believe things


---------76:55----------
about


---------76:58----------
everything that happened everything that


---------77:00----------
was happening that was completely


---------77:02----------
untrue and i tried to stop it


---------77:07----------
i tried to tell


---------77:10----------
the reality of the situation i had


---------77:13----------
people that were like


---------77:15----------
george i've got your back like let's


---------77:17----------
tell the truth together


---------77:19----------
just jump out of the way


---------77:26----------
and it affected my relationships


---------77:30----------
it reflected it affected clg


---------77:34----------
and it ultimately affected me


---------77:39----------
so bad that i can't begin to describe


---------77:43----------
how much i hurt


---------77:49----------
and you know they just


---------77:52----------
got away with it and


---------77:55----------
there's nothing i could do about it


---------77:59----------
there's really nothing good


---------78:21----------
it's so hard so hard when you try to be


---------78:27----------
a good person


---------78:31----------
there's so many people doing bad things


---------78:35----------
and you just have to let it go


---------78:52----------
uh


---------78:56----------
the reasons people give you is so [ __ ]


---------78:58----------
up


---------78:59----------
that person had more social capital than


---------79:01----------
you


---------79:05----------
that person's more well-liked than you


---------79:10----------
that person's more tactical than you


---------79:25----------
no one cares about being a good person


---------79:29----------
no one cares about helping each other


---------79:33----------
they're all out there just to [ __ ]


---------79:35----------
big buddy


---------79:42----------
and get things for themselves


---------79:45----------
it is so obviously apparent


---------79:49----------
and we just walk through accepting it


---------80:01----------
so [ __ ] dude


---------80:06----------
it's really really [ __ ] up


---------80:12----------
and it's not just in esports it's like


---------80:16----------
everywhere


---------80:26----------
george yeah go ahead


---------80:30----------
the part of me that was like struggling


---------80:32----------
is


---------80:35----------
i feel this with myself right


---------80:39----------
and i extrapolate that


---------80:43----------
right and i see it


---------80:49----------
happening in like different aspects of


---------80:51----------
life right it's not just esports


---------80:56----------
the function of


---------80:59----------
trying to subvert people's feelings


---------81:03----------
their emotions how we treat them


---------81:08----------
for money


---------81:11----------
it's [ __ ] up dude i don't know how


---------81:13----------
else to say it


---------81:15----------
[Music]


---------81:20----------
i'm gonna just collect my thoughts


---------81:22----------
because i i think george you just shared


---------81:24----------
so much yeah i know i wanna


---------81:27----------
i i appreciate it it was powerful man


---------81:29----------
i'm just trying to think about


---------81:33----------
how to meet you where you're at sure


---------81:37----------
i can pull myself back um you don't need


---------81:40----------
to do that


---------81:41----------
i prefer that i rise to your level as


---------81:43----------
opposed to you pull back


---------81:45----------
fair enough


---------81:54----------
all right so i'm gonna just start you


---------81:56----------
need a minute


---------81:57----------
no i'm good okay i'm gonna start talking


---------82:01----------
sure chances are i'm i'm gonna be wrong


---------82:05----------
okay i hope this will help you but i


---------82:08----------
don't know if you're gonna like to hear


---------82:10----------
it


---------82:10----------
okay so


---------82:14----------
george sometimes when people try to go


---------82:16----------
out and fix the world


---------82:18----------
it doesn't come from the world it comes


---------82:21----------
from them


---------82:22----------
and in fact i would argue that most


---------82:24----------
people who try to go out and fix the


---------82:26----------
world


---------82:27----------
it's rooted in them


---------82:31----------
can you repeat that again yeah so most


---------82:33----------
people who go out there


---------82:35----------
fix the world yeah it's not doesn't


---------82:38----------
actually come from the world it comes


---------82:39----------
from them so like this is just


---------82:43----------
you know really simple like if you think


---------82:44----------
about


---------82:46----------
um you know why do people


---------82:49----------
adopt particular causes it's because the


---------82:52----------
cause is near and dear to their heart


---------82:56----------
right i don't hear you trying to save


---------82:58----------
the rainforests


---------82:59----------
maybe you are but like there's something


---------83:02----------
about


---------83:03----------
the suffering of the world in the loss


---------83:05----------
of our humanity that hits home with you


---------83:09----------
so overall like some time ago i said i


---------83:12----------
can't tell if this is the mother lode of


---------83:14----------
projection


---------83:15----------
and i'm going to go ahead and lean into


---------83:16----------
that a little bit


---------83:18----------
okay because i i think that the first


---------83:19----------
thing that you've got to do george


---------83:21----------
is not fix the world it's to heal


---------83:23----------
yourself


---------83:25----------
because you are really really hurt man


---------83:28----------
and i've tried to like ask you in a


---------83:31----------
couple of ways and i think that you have


---------83:32----------
been on a journey of a lot of genuine


---------83:35----------
growth


---------83:36----------
but i think that you you're getting


---------83:38----------
tripped up with this beautiful thing


---------83:39----------
that you just said


---------83:41----------
you feel pain and then you extrapolate


---------83:44----------
it out to other people's pain


---------83:46----------
and so i think the reason that you half


---------83:48----------
agree and half disagree and we're like


---------83:50----------
we're uh a hundred percent together


---------83:53----------
fifty percent of the time


---------83:54----------
in this conversation that's just been


---------83:56----------
the way that i felt it's like we're


---------83:58----------
a hundred percent aligned except like


---------84:00----------
suddenly like something


---------84:01----------
we're like you're like no sort of i sort


---------84:04----------
of agree with you but like here's this


---------84:05----------
other piece


---------84:06----------
and i think what you're doing just this


---------84:07----------
whole thing is like you start with a


---------84:10----------
feeling you start with a personal


---------84:11----------
experience and then you extrapolate it


---------84:14----------
and by that extrapolation you move away


---------84:17----------
from yourself and towards the outside


---------84:18----------
world


---------84:19----------
towards rationality towards all these


---------84:21----------
other things making the world a better


---------84:23----------
place which has this emotional root


---------84:25----------
but fundamentally at the end of the day


---------84:27----------
you're moving away from yourself


---------84:34----------
in order to fix the world's problems


---------84:36----------
which i think is a noble thing in bro


---------84:38----------
i'm behind you


---------84:39----------
i appreciate it i think we're actually


---------84:40----------
fighting the same battle


---------84:42----------
we're on the same team i'm grateful you


---------84:44----------
came here all that stuff is true


---------84:48----------
and i think it's like not you're leaving


---------84:52----------
something about yourself incomplete


---------84:54----------
and you've made a lot of progress


---------84:56----------
because you can sort of own some of the


---------84:57----------
you've like discovered your feelings


---------84:59----------
you've discovered connection


---------85:00----------
you know it sounds like you've really


---------85:01----------
worked on yourself you went through a


---------85:03----------
dark


---------85:04----------
you know trial of your life


---------85:07----------
and i i don't think any of that is false


---------85:08----------
or anything i don't think this is really


---------85:10----------
the mother lode of projection i don't


---------85:11----------
think this is all like baked in [ __ ]


---------85:13----------
what it feels to me is more than


---------85:14----------
anything else incomplete


---------85:17----------
and i think it could be that yeah yeah


---------85:20----------
and so i think like let's just start


---------85:21----------
with this idea of guilt so like


---------85:23----------
why are you so respon why are you so


---------85:28----------
so you know the the biggest


---------85:31----------
advocates against


---------85:36----------
you know drunk driving can sometimes be


---------85:39----------
the people themselves who drove drunk


---------85:44----------
right and they say that like yeah yeah


---------85:46----------
of course


---------85:48----------
and so there's a part of me that that


---------85:49----------
still thinks that like you know i ask


---------85:51----------
you like a couple times do you feel


---------85:52----------
responsible for other


---------85:54----------
people's suffering like i asked you like


---------85:55----------
early on because i was sniffing


---------85:57----------
what i'm sniffing from you more than


---------85:59----------
anything else is a profound sense of


---------86:01----------
guilt


---------86:02----------
and it's some of these things like when


---------86:03----------
i ask you would your grandfather be


---------86:04----------
ashamed of you


---------86:05----------
i think that you try to be a good person


---------86:09----------
which in turn makes it so much more


---------86:11----------
devastating


---------86:13----------
when you find yourself giving in to


---------86:15----------
temptation


---------86:17----------
for sure i would expect self-loathing


---------86:20----------
from you


---------86:22----------
self-loathing like hate the person i


---------86:26----------
am yeah absolutely


---------86:29----------
because you try to be a good person and


---------86:33----------
you weren't for a time


---------86:38----------
yes and i


---------86:42----------
experienced amount of self-loathing


---------86:45----------
already


---------86:46----------
yeah and so


---------86:50----------
i'm less about experiencing more


---------86:53----------
self-loathing


---------86:55----------
and more about growing


---------86:59----------
understanding myself understanding


---------87:02----------
people


---------87:03----------
yep yeah i i'm with you so i i just


---------87:06----------
think that based on your statements and


---------87:07----------
i don't think that like i said i don't


---------87:09----------
think there's all like


---------87:09----------
you know you're not like you don't have


---------87:10----------
any super narcissistic defense


---------87:12----------
mechanisms or anything like that


---------87:15----------
okay but um i'm trolling


---------87:19----------
but yeah i know i know so uh but


---------87:22----------
at the same time i do feel like


---------87:24----------
something about this feels incomplete to


---------87:26----------
me


---------87:26----------
so it's clear to me that you've really


---------87:28----------
explored yourself i think the way that


---------87:30----------
you know you answer these questions


---------87:31----------
about your grandfathers you're like


---------87:32----------
he wouldn't be ashamed he would be sad


---------87:34----------
and if you were more in the


---------87:36----------
self-loathing camp


---------87:37----------
then you would you would see shame for


---------87:39----------
him as opposed to sadness


---------87:41----------
does that make sense as you come to


---------87:43----------
process and accept some of your mistakes


---------87:45----------
and recognize that it's not entirely


---------87:47----------
your fault


---------87:48----------
you've forgiven yourself some i think


---------87:50----------
you sort of like move into sadness and


---------87:52----------
away from shame and self-blame


---------87:54----------
fine but something about all of this


---------87:58----------
stuff


---------87:58----------
and you even said it a little bit in the


---------88:00----------
middle is that you've looked around at


---------88:02----------
the outside world and you've


---------88:03----------
investigated


---------88:04----------
and then you realize you need to grow in


---------88:06----------
as a person and then like kind of make


---------88:08----------
the world sort of a better place but


---------88:10----------
what i see from you overwhelmingly is


---------88:13----------
still a lot of stuff


---------88:14----------
coming from you i don't think you're


---------88:17----------
done with yourself yet and i don't think


---------88:19----------
you're ready to fix the outside world


---------88:22----------
i think what you've got to do is focus


---------88:24----------
on fixing yourself


---------88:25----------
more you're just getting started or


---------88:27----------
you're halfway there


---------88:29----------
yeah i think that that you know


---------88:33----------
that i can agree with um


---------88:35----------
[Music]


---------88:36----------
i guess i'm having the hard a hard time


---------88:39----------
understanding


---------88:41----------
like what the pathway is to that or even


---------88:44----------
like


---------88:44----------
acknowledging i need like a step to


---------88:47----------
acknowledge


---------88:48----------
because because this is your


---------88:50----------
interpretation


---------88:51----------
of talking to me for x amount of time


---------88:53----------
right there's so much history and


---------88:55----------
experience and stuff


---------88:56----------
that if you knew me you'd be able to


---------88:59----------
make like oh okay i get it


---------89:01----------
right and so we're jumping a huge amount


---------89:04----------
of


---------89:07----------
we're building a huge amount of


---------89:09----------
assumptions here right


---------89:11----------
and so i'm trying to follow your your


---------89:14----------
path


---------89:14----------
but i don't know


---------89:17----------
i don't know this next leap you're


---------89:19----------
trying to make me


---------89:20----------
yeah i can't see it fine totally fair so


---------89:24----------
that's i'm not done so maybe i can i can


---------89:27----------
elusive okay sorry first question is


---------89:28----------
have you seen a therapist


---------89:31----------
yes do you see one now yes


---------89:35----------
is that helpful yes


---------89:39----------
great so i think that's fantastic


---------89:42----------
and i think you should continue doing


---------89:44----------
that okay


---------89:46----------
my point so so that's one thing the


---------89:48----------
second thing is that i think that


---------89:49----------
if if you're looking for a next step to


---------89:52----------
focus


---------89:53----------
more on yourself i think it's


---------89:54----------
beautifully you illustrated a


---------89:56----------
beautifully i feel this guilt because


---------89:57----------
you're not


---------89:58----------
you're not blind to yourself or anything


---------89:59----------
like that you actually understand your


---------90:00----------
inner parts


---------90:01----------
somewhat i think you just do this thing


---------90:03----------
where you like


---------90:05----------
you you quickly extrapolate and you move


---------90:07----------
outside of yourself and into the rest of


---------90:09----------
the world


---------90:10----------
into conversations with other people


---------90:12----------
into gaining information


---------90:14----------
and instead i think what you need to do


---------90:16----------
is kind of like what you


---------90:17----------
did just now is sort of like sit with


---------90:20----------
some of these


---------90:21----------
like thoughts and feelings and really


---------90:23----------
like think about that for a second


---------90:25----------
because what i found from you is is what


---------90:28----------
i saw what you showed us


---------90:29----------
is a wound that is still open and raw


---------90:33----------
yes that that wound


---------90:37----------
right is probably the only wound


---------90:42----------
that i have and i recognize that wound i


---------90:44----------
know it's there


---------90:45----------
i feel it every day right i


---------90:48----------
[Music]


---------90:50----------
you're like whoa what's going on yeah


---------90:52----------
yeah you're damn right you feel it every


---------90:54----------
day yeah


---------90:55----------
and i and the the problem


---------90:58----------
with the wound right


---------91:01----------
is that


---------91:05----------
i


---------91:08----------
part of that like closing that wound for


---------91:12----------
me


---------91:14----------
right is


---------91:16----------
[Music]


---------91:19----------
not going out and going back


---------91:22----------
into time to like try to


---------91:27----------
you know val like try to like seek


---------91:30----------
justice for it


---------91:32----------
right the uh george george george


---------91:35----------
buddy here's what i think okay filled


---------91:38----------
with assumptions


---------91:40----------
house of cards feel free to knock what


---------91:42----------
i'm about to say just


---------91:43----------
knock it over with a hammer do it you're


---------91:45----------
trying to fix that wound by fixing the


---------91:47----------
entire [ __ ] world


---------91:50----------
because it's a wound that you live with


---------91:52----------
every single day


---------91:54----------
and it hurts buddy and you see


---------91:57----------
something of the suffering out there


---------92:00----------
but i don't understand why you would go


---------92:02----------
about fixing the world


---------92:03----------
if you live with a gaping open wound on


---------92:06----------
a daily basis that hurts you on a daily


---------92:10----------
basis


---------92:12----------
oh uh i mean okay so


---------92:19----------
there is and maybe this is just like a


---------92:22----------
learned behavior


---------92:24----------
but i can still function


---------92:28----------
while hurting of course you can


---------92:32----------
right and i can still function up


---------92:35----------
so george why is it important why is it


---------92:38----------
important to


---------92:40----------
to to fix this wound this is exactly why


---------92:43----------
you haven't fixed it


---------92:45----------
because you can function in spite of it


---------92:48----------
but just because you can function in


---------92:50----------
spite of it just because you can keep


---------92:52----------
going doesn't mean that you don't owe it


---------92:55----------
to yourself


---------92:56----------
and and don't deserve a life where this


---------92:59----------
gaping wound


---------93:00----------
is like bleeding all the time okay it's


---------93:03----------
not about


---------93:03----------
function it's about getting better


---------93:06----------
though right it's either okay do you


---------93:08----------
want me to like just


---------93:09----------
fully on focus like resolve myself talk


---------93:12----------
to therapists only about this wound


---------93:15----------
and not do anything else in my life no


---------93:17----------
where are you getting that black and


---------93:19----------
whiteness


---------93:20----------
um have i said to you that you should


---------93:23----------
stop everything that you're doing in


---------93:24----------
your life and focus only on this


---------93:25----------
well well i do focus on the wound that's


---------93:28----------
what i i don't understand


---------93:30----------
like if i'm focusing on the wound and


---------93:34----------
i'm passionate about helping others


---------93:38----------
and also we i haven't even mentioned it


---------93:40----------
i want to build a game at some point


---------93:42----------
right cool um awesome but uh


---------93:46----------
that like i could i don't i guess i


---------93:49----------
don't understand


---------93:50----------
what you're what the action point of


---------93:52----------
this is i'm with you


---------93:53----------
and i'll get to it in a second so the


---------93:55----------
first thing is is that just the


---------93:57----------
acknowledgement that like you have this


---------93:59----------
wound


---------94:00----------
right that you carry with you on a


---------94:01----------
day-to-day basis and i acknowledge that


---------94:04----------
yep and what i'm saying i'm not saying


---------94:06----------
that you can't try to help other people


---------94:07----------
but what i'm saying is that


---------94:09----------
you shared with us your noble quest


---------94:12----------
which is like a noble one which is like


---------94:14----------
to you know help people who suffer in


---------94:16----------
the world


---------94:17----------
but i think that that comes ultimately


---------94:19----------
from you


---------94:20----------
right like it it's like and i think that


---------94:22----------
you should focus on


---------94:24----------
helping yourself which i know you do


---------94:26----------
because we've asked you right so this


---------94:28----------
once again i'm not saying you're not


---------94:29----------
doing it i think you're doing it like


---------94:30----------
halfway you're seeing a therapist and


---------94:32----------
that's like


---------94:32----------
the bread and butter right answer i


---------94:35----------
think practically


---------94:37----------
what that means is i i have a direction


---------94:40----------
for exploration for you


---------94:41----------
okay i've gotten answers yeah so you say


---------94:43----------
closing that wound means seeking justice


---------94:51----------
what did you say i thought you said


---------94:53----------
something like that


---------94:54----------
uh or okay


---------94:58----------
i think like justice is a part of it i


---------95:01----------
also think like just learning to like


---------95:04----------
love


---------95:05----------
other people and forgive other people


---------95:06----------
like that's


---------95:08----------
part of it too right um do you hate


---------95:14----------
no did you used to hate


---------95:20----------
no there's your [ __ ] problem


---------95:28----------
hey why would i want to hate someone


---------95:32----------
because they hurt you bro because they


---------95:35----------
stabbed you in the back


---------95:37----------
and if you're telling me that you've


---------95:38----------
never experienced hate


---------95:40----------
after all of these things that's the


---------95:42----------
emotion you're missing


---------95:54----------
i


---------95:59----------
missing hate


---------96:06----------
the way i i think about that


---------96:09----------
is why would i want


---------96:13----------
to breed more hate you're not


---------96:16----------
reading more yeah okay so so you respond


---------96:20----------
to it logically right so that's the


---------96:21----------
first thing


---------96:22----------
i'm not telling you to breed hate


---------96:25----------
but the problem is you can't let go of


---------96:27----------
something unless you realize you're


---------96:29----------
holding on to it


---------96:38----------
i'm not telling you to go out and be


---------96:40----------
mean to people what i'm telling you is


---------96:41----------
there's nothing about the outside world


---------96:44----------
i don't think it's good to act dominate


---------96:48----------
but i think it's good to recognize that


---------96:50----------
it's there


---------96:52----------
and to learn to let go but what i'm


---------96:54----------
hearing is that you've forgiven people


---------96:58----------
which because you're trying to be a good


---------97:00----------
person and in doing so you take a small


---------97:02----------
corner of yourself and you shove it to


---------97:04----------
the side


---------97:05----------
this is what i'm telling you man you're


---------97:06----------
like you're like a 50 there


---------97:08----------
but there's this whole other 50 and it


---------97:11----------
boggles my mind i don't know i don't


---------97:13----------
know what the [ __ ] happened with clg


---------97:15----------
but it sounds traumatic and terrible


---------97:18----------
and generally speaking when things like


---------97:21----------
that happen to people we experience a


---------97:23----------
whole range of emotions


---------97:25----------
pain suffering guilt hatred and


---------97:29----------
anger are in there bro


---------97:32----------
yeah i i definitely think i was angry


---------97:36----------
but i don't i try not


---------97:40----------
to hate people uh


---------97:43----------
yes i i i would say like if i were to


---------97:46----------
really speak


---------97:48----------
like how i'm feeling right now yeah i


---------97:50----------
feel


---------97:52----------
very misunderstood yep


---------97:56----------
and i don't know why that is


---------98:00----------
yeah so they're a couple great i'm so


---------98:03----------
happy you shared that


---------98:04----------
so here are the reasons that i think you


---------98:06----------
feel misunderstood


---------98:08----------
i think i'm tossing something out to you


---------98:11----------
which does not


---------98:12----------
fit that's why you feel misunderstood


---------98:16----------
right what i'm saying and your


---------98:18----------
understanding of things are clashing


---------98:23----------
of course you feel misunderstood i think


---------98:26----------
it's a completely normal way to feel


---------98:30----------
so here's the next step okay


---------98:34----------
i'm glad i mean i think it's normal and


---------98:36----------
i don't mean to invalidate you but what


---------98:37----------
i'm saying is that


---------98:38----------
that i think that there's a blind spot


---------98:41----------
in your vision


---------98:45----------
i would not like say that there isn't


---------98:48----------
right so then let me ask you something


---------98:50----------
when you point out a blind spot sure


---------98:53----------
when you point out a blind spot in


---------98:55----------
someone's vision


---------98:56----------
how would they feel um


---------98:59----------
[Music]


---------99:01----------
first they would get defensive usually


---------99:04----------
okay uh


---------99:08----------
and then they would have a hard time


---------99:10----------
comprehending it


---------99:12----------
misunderstood misunderstood


---------99:16----------
and then they would try to get to the


---------99:19----------
point that they understand it by


---------99:20----------
asking more questions or


---------99:23----------
they would try to explain themselves


---------99:25----------
further so that


---------99:27----------
they remove the blind spot i'm sorry it


---------99:29----------
reinforced the blind spot right


---------99:31----------
either you're going to try to understand


---------99:32----------
my perspective or you're going to


---------99:34----------
convince me of your perspective


---------99:36----------
either one fear okay you're going to try


---------99:39----------
it's just an issue of whether i'm


---------99:41----------
getting on your page or you're getting


---------99:42----------
on my page


---------99:44----------
got it but i think i think my goal


---------99:48----------
in this conversation is to not


---------99:51----------
is to a certain degree walk with where


---------99:52----------
you've gone


---------99:54----------
but i would like to help you too we have


---------99:56----------
the same quest we're on the same quest


---------99:58----------
okay and so what i'm trying to do for


---------100:01----------
you george in this


---------100:02----------
hour and a half which as you mentioned


---------100:04----------
is full of assumptions how much can i


---------100:05----------
really know how many details can i get


---------100:07----------
you're working with a therapist and all


---------100:08----------
that kind of good stuff is to point out


---------100:10----------
to you the possibility that like maybe


---------100:12----------
there's hatred


---------100:13----------
some buried somewhere deeply deeply in


---------100:15----------
your heart


---------100:17----------
and to consider for a moment that you're


---------100:18----------
someone who from a very young age


---------100:21----------
learned how to bury things underneath


---------100:24----------
rationalization


---------100:25----------
and have things sort of manifest in like


---------100:28----------
related but not directly


---------100:30----------
related ways


---------100:34----------
because like what did they do to you man


---------100:35----------
and how is that fair


---------100:39----------
it blows my mind that you're not angry


---------100:42----------
and hateful towards everything in the


---------100:43----------
universe and i get that you've done


---------100:46----------
some amount of work on that it's not


---------100:48----------
like those people are


---------100:49----------
bad people either right it's not


---------100:52----------
it's not like that you know it's not as


---------100:55----------
black and white as


---------100:56----------
they're terrible people oh


---------101:00----------
i completely believe that that is true


---------101:04----------
and usually when our feelings are very


---------101:07----------
active they don't think that


---------101:12----------
could you repeat that one more time yeah


---------101:14----------
so like i agree that like no one is all


---------101:16----------
bad and no one is all good


---------101:18----------
but that's a rational thought that's not


---------101:20----------
how feelings operate


---------101:22----------
like when feelings are active everything


---------101:24----------
is like


---------101:25----------
man that guy is just there's no


---------101:26----------
redeeming quality


---------101:28----------
for this karen uh


---------101:31----------
okay i see what i'm doing now i i see i


---------101:34----------
see what i'm doing


---------101:35----------
i i i'm


---------101:38----------
basically justifying


---------101:41----------
their behavior because i don't want to


---------101:44----------
confront the issue


---------101:46----------
that's a good way to put it that's right


---------101:48----------
because


---------101:49----------
because because if you confront it then


---------101:51----------
what happens


---------101:52----------
unless if you make them if you have an


---------101:55----------
understanding buddha-like perspective


---------101:57----------
towards all people in the human being in


---------101:59----------
the world and they hurt you what does


---------102:01----------
that allow you to do


---------102:06----------
uh sorry sorry i was just thinking about


---------102:08----------
that but it allows me to heal


---------102:10----------
i assume no no it allows you to not get


---------102:13----------
yeah sorry sorry


---------102:14----------
so like like if i'm like


---------102:18----------
so so if i sort of am like a tranquil


---------102:21----------
peaceful bunta


---------102:22----------
okay and i can see the duality of all


---------102:25----------
people and i can be


---------102:26----------
ever forgiving when someone hurts me


---------102:29----------
what does that let me do


---------102:33----------
someone hurts me what is that like it's


---------102:36----------
like kind of a weird question


---------102:37----------
but basically what it lets me do is not


---------102:39----------
get hurt


---------102:43----------
uh i see right because like


---------102:46----------
oh like they stabbed me and they stabbed


---------102:48----------
me in the back but like that's just the


---------102:50----------
nature


---------102:51----------
it's just the nature of the beast it's


---------102:52----------
not me it's just the nature of the beast


---------102:55----------
therefore like


---------102:56----------
there's nothing like fundamentally like


---------102:58----------
wrong with me


---------102:59----------
it can't be that there's any


---------103:01----------
fundamentally wrong with me because it's


---------103:02----------
just the nature of all things


---------103:04----------
i am just like a leaf in the the


---------103:08----------
river of time yeah yeah i i get the


---------103:10----------
analogy you're trying to make


---------103:11----------
right and um and like this is the really


---------103:15----------
wild thing which is that like i


---------103:16----------
i wonder if that's the same exact thing


---------103:19----------
that you did with your dad


---------103:24----------
which is that he's just a guy who's like


---------103:26----------
that therefore i don't have to be hurt


---------103:28----------
that he doesn't give a [ __ ] about me


---------103:30----------
because that's just what he is yeah and


---------103:33----------
it could be


---------103:34----------
like honestly it could be the thing is


---------103:36----------
i've been operating this


---------103:37----------
way my whole life at that in that


---------103:39----------
context


---------103:41----------
that


---------103:44----------
how the hell would ever i


---------103:48----------
ever be able to like see that blind spot


---------103:50----------
and how would people be


---------103:52----------
able to like really see it even if they


---------103:54----------
were to really get to know me


---------103:56----------
right like they wouldn't be able to


---------103:59----------
so i see that


---------104:03----------
blind spot a little bit now um


---------104:08----------
i don't okay i think you


---------104:11----------
see the logical


---------104:15----------
you're like detecting a black hole i'm


---------104:18----------
feeling it too i'm feeling okay


---------104:20----------
okay okay just a little bit a little bit


---------104:22----------
okay but my thinking is obviously


---------104:24----------
stronger than my feeling right like it's


---------104:25----------
agreed um next level thinker


---------104:30----------
yeah uh


---------104:34----------
okay that's impressive if you're feeling


---------104:36----------
it because you did a 180 pretty quick


---------104:39----------
yeah it's hard


---------104:43----------
what are you feeling


---------104:48----------
uh well i'm feeling confused i'm good


---------104:51----------
overwhelmingly um that's a good that's


---------104:55----------
actually


---------104:55----------
the best thing to feel i'm feeling a


---------104:58----------
little bit of anxiety


---------104:59----------
okay uh um


---------105:10----------
there's a little bit of sense of a


---------105:11----------
relief okay that


---------105:14----------
that i'm kind of like understanding it


---------105:16----------
um


---------105:16----------
[Music]


---------105:22----------
that that's where it stops right now i


---------105:24----------
need to think about this more and to be


---------105:25----------
able to fill it more


---------105:26----------
fantastic so so i think i think maybe


---------105:28----------
this is a good place to sort


---------105:30----------
of wrap up george because sure my goal


---------105:32----------
is to make people feel overwhelmingly


---------105:34----------
confused a little bit anxious and a


---------105:35----------
little bit relieved at the same time


---------105:37----------
when we know we've hit that that point


---------105:39----------
that's when we know we're


---------105:40----------
kind of at a good stop so let me explain


---------105:43----------
to you why confusion i think is very


---------105:44----------
good


---------105:45----------
so we live our life based on static


---------105:48----------
assumptions


---------105:49----------
about the way that we operate and those


---------105:51----------
assumptions tend to be


---------105:52----------
sometimes incorrect and tend to shoot us


---------105:55----------
in the foot and hold us back


---------105:57----------
oh yeah that's the process of


---------106:00----------
unchanging that staticness isn't to move


---------106:04----------
because


---------106:05----------
prior to like you had knowledge right


---------106:07----------
you had a conception of how the world


---------106:09----------
works


---------106:10----------
and then we want to bring you to like a


---------106:12----------
theory of better knowledge


---------106:14----------
but you don't move straight from


---------106:15----------
knowledge to knowledge you move from


---------106:16----------
knowledge through confusion to new


---------106:18----------
knowledge


---------106:21----------
yes there's confusion in the middle


---------106:23----------
there there's like hey wait a second


---------106:25----------
i thought that this build order was


---------106:27----------
excellent why did i lose


---------106:29----------
yeah so i think it's great that you feel


---------106:30----------
confused and that's a sign


---------106:32----------
when people are no longer rigid with


---------106:34----------
their thought structures


---------106:35----------
is when they grow yes of course i think


---------106:39----------
a big problem with the world is that we


---------106:40----------
try to avoid confusion


---------106:44----------
when in fact confusion for sure


---------106:47----------
i'm totally on that page so very


---------106:49----------
practically i think there are a couple


---------106:51----------
things that you could try to float by


---------106:52----------
your therapist and i think


---------106:54----------
in general you just need to do one thing


---------106:56----------
to start out i'm going to give you a


---------106:57----------
very very


---------106:58----------
simple exercise to do i'm going to try


---------107:01----------
to teach it to you now


---------107:02----------
in some way i have to figure that out


---------107:04----------
it's going to be something like


---------107:05----------
meditation


---------107:06----------
but literally george your first step


---------107:09----------
is just to acknowledge the full range of


---------107:11----------
emotions that you experience on a


---------107:13----------
day-to-day basis


---------107:18----------
yeah and because my guess is so it's


---------107:22----------
like very


---------107:23----------
normal for human beings to experience a


---------107:25----------
range of emotions


---------107:26----------
including hatred i'm not saying you


---------107:29----------
should cultivate hatred i'm not saying


---------107:30----------
you should feed hatred i'm not saying


---------107:32----------
you should


---------107:33----------
act on nature so don't take it that way


---------107:35----------
but what i'm just saying is that


---------107:36----------
unless you're like really really


---------107:38----------
different like chances are your brain


---------107:40----------
has evolved the way that everyone else's


---------107:42----------
brain has and generally speaking you


---------107:45----------
should have the capacity to feel hate


---------107:49----------
and unless you are enlightened buddha


---------107:51----------
you should probably be feeling some


---------107:52----------
amount of hatred somewhere


---------107:54----------
and if you go throughout your day and


---------107:56----------
you don't feel hatred


---------107:57----------
then that's kind of weird


---------108:02----------
so then you have to figure out okay like


---------108:04----------
why am i like


---------108:05----------
it's like color blindness for a


---------108:07----------
particular wavelength right


---------108:09----------
why is hatred absent in my mind


---------108:15----------
and then see if you can find it or just


---------108:18----------
start there


---------108:19----------
but just start with the observation of


---------108:21----------
what's the full range of emotions that


---------108:22----------
you're feeling


---------108:23----------
and i'm not saying that you should feel


---------108:24----------
them all equally so be careful about


---------108:26----------
like you know it's not equal


---------108:28----------
but can you find like hatred within


---------108:31----------
yourself


---------108:33----------
because like any normal human being


---------108:36----------
should


---------108:37----------
have hatred somewhere in there given


---------108:38----------
everything that you've described


---------108:45----------
hmm do you feel like hatred is


---------108:49----------
something that a lot of people hide yes


---------108:52----------
or no i think the one


---------108:55----------
very common emotion that people hide yes


---------108:59----------
so i think the people who show hatred


---------109:01----------
don't recognize that what they're


---------109:03----------
feeling is hatred and i think the people


---------109:06----------
that


---------109:06----------
feel hatred don't show it


---------109:19----------
okay my my my feelings line up with


---------109:23----------
you're getting somewhere with me now


---------109:30----------
but i'm still feel misunderstood


---------109:34----------
because i i know where you're coming


---------109:36----------
from no i i think i think the reason you


---------109:38----------
feel misunderstood is because you are


---------109:40----------
misunderstood


---------109:42----------
because i'm making assumptions and you


---------109:44----------
haven't given me the whole story and i'm


---------109:46----------
jumping into conclusions


---------109:48----------
yeah okay cool so i i i actually think


---------109:51----------
it's


---------109:52----------
very helpful and i think


---------109:55----------
that perspective is putting me in a


---------109:58----------
place where i'm


---------109:59----------
feeling more and thinking less which is


---------110:01----------
good


---------110:02----------
i sure so and i think i think


---------110:04----------
unfortunately


---------110:06----------
george that's just the nature of the


---------110:07----------
beast yeah


---------110:10----------
unless the more wrong i'm willing to be


---------110:13----------
and the more i'm willing to jump to


---------110:14----------
conclusions the more we can get done in


---------110:17----------
an hour and a half even though it's


---------110:18----------
wrong yeah


---------110:19----------
i'd rather i'd rather risk being wrong


---------110:22----------
to try to find something right


---------110:24----------
rather than move as methodically as


---------110:26----------
really we should


---------110:27----------
but that's what therapy is that's what


---------110:29----------
your therapist is for


---------110:30----------
so you shouldn't be misunderstood by


---------110:32----------
your therapist you should take this


---------110:33----------
hypothesis


---------110:34----------
because i'm not giving you a conclusion


---------110:36----------
let's be clear yeah what i'm giving some


---------110:38----------
time to explore


---------110:39----------
exactly the most i can offer you is a


---------110:41----------
hypothesis and i'm okay to


---------110:43----------
jump to formulate a hypothesis because


---------110:45----------
then the real answer is not


---------110:47----------
in constructing the perfect hypothesis


---------110:49----------
it's far more efficient to construct a


---------110:51----------
ass hypothesis once you get an inkling


---------110:52----------
of something and then test it


---------111:03----------
got it okay this is all this all makes


---------111:06----------
sense i guess


---------111:07----------
in in all of this one of the things that


---------111:09----------
i find interesting


---------111:11----------
and and i i don't know why but you don't


---------111:14----------
seem to


---------111:14----------
resonate with the idea or at least you


---------111:17----------
don't


---------111:18----------
feel i guess as much passion towards the


---------111:21----------
idea


---------111:24----------
that um


---------111:26----------
[Music]


---------111:30----------
almost not relatable in the sense of


---------111:32----------
like i'm


---------111:33----------
trying to relate with you sometimes


---------111:36----------
and you're almost being too much of


---------111:41----------
a doctor and not enough


---------111:45----------
as a person


---------111:48----------
yeah can you say more about that yeah


---------111:52----------
so i


---------111:56----------
tried i think


---------112:00----------
to open up to


---------112:04----------
relate to you in a way that like we


---------112:08----------
could find


---------112:09----------
some common ground um


---------112:12----------
and relate to experiences and i think we


---------112:14----------
had like a step at the start


---------112:19----------
but somewhere along the lines i was


---------112:21----------
trying to relate to you as a person


---------112:24----------
and you were speaking to me too much of


---------112:27----------
as a patient um and that


---------112:31----------
just feels weird um


---------112:38----------
it just


---------112:42----------
yeah i don't know how to i don't know


---------112:44----------
how else to say it


---------112:45----------
well thanks for sharing that with me i'm


---------112:48----------
not surprised you feel that way


---------112:56----------
can i think about that for a second yeah


---------113:03----------
i'm noticing a potential irony which is


---------113:05----------
that


---------113:06----------
i found myself saying things to i found


---------113:09----------
myself thinking things


---------113:11----------
to my thinking things that i would say


---------113:15----------
to my actual patients


---------113:17----------
that i withheld from our conversation


---------113:21----------
because i understood the scope of our


---------113:22----------
conversation to be somewhat different


---------113:24----------
from what i do with my patients


---------113:28----------
so that could explain it okay um


---------113:32----------
but at the end of the day i wonder do


---------113:34----------
you feel judged by me


---------113:38----------
maybe a little bit i i think what i


---------113:42----------
love about you is when you get into


---------113:45----------
these moments


---------113:47----------
where um you're not just


---------113:50----------
dr k right you're


---------113:55----------
you're a guy that gets


---------113:58----------
this space in the industry and


---------114:02----------
like you're very relatable um and


---------114:05----------
through that relatability i think


---------114:08----------
you really like connect with people on a


---------114:11----------
deeper level


---------114:12----------
um but i missed that a little bit


---------114:17----------
um this is a little bit or missed it a


---------114:19----------
lot


---------114:21----------
a little bit uh i appreciate


---------114:24----------
like the um


---------114:29----------
i appreciate like that you're trying to


---------114:30----------
help me i really do


---------114:32----------
like i i i'm just like i'm speaking out


---------114:35----------
loud right now


---------114:36----------
i appreciate something i don't normally


---------114:38----------
normally don't do i think it's great man


---------114:41----------
i'm really glad you're sharing this um


---------114:50----------
i'm gonna ask you a question sure i want


---------114:53----------
you to


---------114:53----------
really really think about it before you


---------114:56----------
answer


---------114:57----------
okay watch your first answer and then


---------115:00----------
really think about it


---------115:01----------
should i apologize no


---------115:06----------
you did you really think about it oh


---------115:10----------
sorry you said watch my first answer


---------115:12----------
okay


---------115:13----------
should you apologize should you


---------115:16----------
apologize


---------115:17----------
no


---------115:28----------
no because i set you up


---------115:32----------
for this


---------115:37----------
like


---------115:40----------
i literally said dissect me


---------115:46----------
so


---------115:52----------
okay watch what happens next okay you


---------115:55----------
ready


---------115:56----------
yup i'm sorry


---------116:00----------
why for judging you oh


---------116:05----------
for not listening for not relating


---------116:12----------
for treating you like a patient


---------116:15----------
thanks i'm sorry for not meeting you


---------116:18----------
for being superior for being analytical


---------116:23----------
for not walking the journey with you


---------116:27----------
i think that's


---------116:30----------
i think that's what is special about


---------116:33----------
what you do


---------116:34----------
um when you can do that


---------116:39----------
i think that's powerful


---------116:43----------
but yeah thank you for that apology


---------116:47----------
i think i i


---------116:50----------
either way i wouldn't have hard feelings


---------116:54----------
but that means a lot to me


---------117:00----------
okay all right george i'm sorry


---------117:03----------
okay so first of all


---------117:06----------
i just couldn't hold myself because you


---------117:08----------
said i wouldn't have hard feelings and


---------117:10----------
it's like buddy


---------117:11----------
when i i know i know you see you see


---------117:15----------
i'm sorry no no it's it's like you see


---------117:18----------
it though


---------117:18----------

---------117:20----------
absurdity of it yeah yeah i know i


---------117:24----------
didn't need to apologize how did you


---------117:25----------
feel when i did


---------117:27----------
it was nice why it was like


---------117:31----------
we connected as human beings but like


---------117:35----------
i needed to right yeah


---------117:40----------
yeah absolutely it's crazy


---------117:43----------
yeah it's it's crazy but


---------117:46----------
you this is


---------117:53----------
when you said no you don't need to you


---------117:56----------
became a buddha


---------117:57----------
an artificial buddha and you protected


---------117:59----------
yourself from the pain


---------118:02----------
yeah because i did you were wrong man


---------118:07----------
and then you wouldn't have hated me


---------118:09----------
either way


---------118:12----------
which is what i'm saying the [ __ ]


---------118:13----------
problem is and if if the


---------118:15----------
if the apology creates if an unnecessary


---------118:19----------
apology


---------118:20----------
creates that kind of emotional response


---------118:22----------
maybe the apology is necessary


---------118:26----------
maybe those people should have asked for


---------118:28----------
your forgiveness


---------118:31----------
maybe when other people wronged you you


---------118:33----------
should hold them responsible for it


---------118:38----------
okay you're [ __ ] right dude oh my god


---------118:41----------
i see it now


---------118:42----------
ah that's so painful and i do it and


---------118:45----------
i've seen it every now and then


---------118:47----------
right i do it i rationalize it i


---------118:50----------
i accept it i just you know like


---------118:53----------
roll with the punches bro like but i


---------118:57----------
don't take care of myself


---------118:58----------
yep and then that is going


---------119:02----------
to cause a massive problem later because


---------119:06----------
i'm going to just have that blind spot


---------119:10----------
and i i haven't even begin to feel or


---------119:14----------
think


---------119:14----------
about what that evolves into but i'm


---------119:17----------
sure it's not good


---------119:20----------
yeah so i'll say one last thing george


---------119:24----------
and i think you're pretty


---------119:25----------
your practice hand at this sure have


---------119:28----------
faith in yourself i think you can do it


---------119:29----------
man


---------119:31----------
thanks i think you've been working


---------119:33----------
really really hard to grow as a person


---------119:37----------
and that work is not in vain


---------119:40----------
and and it may feel like this is an


---------119:42----------
unclimbable mountain because you haven't


---------119:45----------
chosen to climb it yet but


---------119:48----------
don't confuse yourself you're good at


---------119:50----------
climbing mountains


---------119:52----------
this one is actually no different yeah


---------119:56----------
i'm confident i can climb mountains


---------119:59----------
um so but it does


---------120:04----------
help and it does mean a lot that you or


---------120:07----------
anyone for that matter


---------120:08----------
you know pushes you up that mountain


---------120:11----------
right


---------120:13----------
with support you know yeah sure cheers


---------120:15----------
you on


---------120:16----------
that's that's what we're here for man


---------120:17----------
and and that's what you're doing for


---------120:19----------
other people too


---------120:22----------
yeah maybe not perfectly


---------120:25----------
but i'm trying to dust yeah


---------120:28----------
which is all that you can do and no one


---------120:30----------
else can do it perfect either


---------120:32----------
right so george what i really respect


---------120:34----------
about you is that you give what you can


---------120:37----------
and it's not your fault that you you


---------120:39----------
didn't see the blind spot that's the


---------120:40----------
whole [ __ ]


---------120:41----------
that's what's a blind spot and now maybe


---------120:44----------
maybe it's there maybe is it isn't let's


---------120:46----------
be clear right so maybe the hypothesis


---------120:48----------
seems more likely now but it doesn't


---------120:50----------
necessarily


---------120:51----------
so test it i trust you i trust your


---------120:53----------
intellect i trust your reason


---------120:56----------
okay sweet okay i work through it with


---------120:58----------
your therapist


---------120:59----------
so generally speaking i teach meditation


---------121:01----------
but i think i i hope this makes sense


---------121:03----------
i think the i'm sorry exercise counts in


---------121:06----------
my mind


---------121:08----------
does that make sense yeah


---------121:12----------
okay i mean i've watched a lot of


---------121:14----------
different like


---------121:15----------
segments of yours so you don't need to


---------121:17----------
go through that process


---------121:18----------
yeah so i think i think you we actually


---------121:20----------
did it then that


---------121:22----------
i think is literally equivalent to


---------121:23----------
meditation because you saw what happened


---------121:26----------
in yourself you were looking inside


---------121:27----------
yourself you were paying attention it


---------121:29----------
wasn't an intellectual exercise


---------121:31----------
you noticed it and then you understood


---------121:34----------
afterwards


---------121:37----------
but overall george i i mean i think


---------121:39----------
you're just this has been amazing man i


---------121:40----------
think you're an amazing guy and i


---------121:42----------
i really i think you can do this


---------121:46----------
you can do this man and you deserve you


---------121:49----------
deserve to do it


---------121:50----------
for yourself rest of the world you'll


---------121:53----------
fix them later


---------121:55----------
that'll happen yeah you're right


---------121:59----------
cool good luck man i appreciate this


---------122:01----------
conversation thank you dude


---------122:03----------
yeah take care um take care bye bye
