---------00:00----------

---------00:05----------
all any questions concerns about today


---------00:06----------
like any thoughts I'm good I'm good yeah


---------00:14----------
no like I've I got no concerns man okay


---------00:18----------
so can you can first of all thanks for


---------00:21----------
coming on again I yeah I was really


---------00:25----------
excited to actually talk to Hank it I


---------00:27----------
think the last time we spoke really


---------00:29----------
helped me in a lot of ways actually it


---------00:32----------
may be see things differently and I feel


---------00:34----------
like it helped other people see a side


---------00:37----------
of me I don't quite normally show that


---------00:39----------
makes sense yeah so can you help me


---------00:41----------
understand what you what you saw


---------00:43----------
differently after our last session yeah


---------00:47----------
I definitely took into consideration


---------00:50----------
what you said about the thinking black


---------00:51----------
and white so I've been trying to work on


---------00:53----------
that and not like look at those things


---------00:55----------
just like set in stone like I used to


---------00:57----------
look at them so I'm trying to have more


---------00:58----------
of an open mind with that good and I've


---------01:00----------
actually been taken like steps sometimes


---------01:04----------
mom do you know just feeling overwhelmed


---------01:04----------
or whatever I'm just like alright I'm


---------01:06----------
just gonna think in the moment just like


---------01:08----------
chill whatever and I've been thinking


---------01:10----------
like a lot about different things I


---------01:14----------
guess it's it's hard to explain it's


---------01:16----------
like my like true calling for like who I


---------01:18----------
want to be is kind of like surfacing if


---------01:20----------
that makes sense


---------01:21----------
yeah that sounds awesome can you tell us


---------01:23----------
about that yeah I said I I I definitely


---------01:27----------
think like I like I'm like really in


---------01:30----------
it's like health stuff right and I've


---------01:32----------
been thinking maybe I could like


---------01:34----------
transition into like doing that somewhat


---------01:37----------
and maybe monetizing it somehow I don't


---------01:39----------
know how but like sure no no just like


---------01:41----------
doing something different and like


---------01:42----------
having other hobbies that aren't just


---------01:44----------
like you know waking up and you know


---------01:46----------
wish streaming or whatever I've done for


---------01:48----------
the last like 10 years you know you have


---------01:50----------
living a little differently doing some


---------01:52----------
new things maybe being some new normal


---------01:54----------
people that aren't involved in twitch


---------01:55----------
and like finding out maybe flying some


---------01:58----------
successful healthy relationships outside


---------02:01----------
of this industry if that makes sense


---------02:02----------
yeah okay so so it sounds like you're


---------02:05----------
considering things that you kind of


---------02:07----------
hadn't considered as seriously before


---------02:09----------
yes definitely and I've always kind of


---------02:12----------
considered these things I just


---------02:13----------
never really was like acting on them and


---------02:16----------
now I think that I will do that because


---------02:18----------
yes yeah and and so Mitchell what do you


---------02:22----------
think so you felt do you feel happy um


---------02:30----------
that's that's a that's a hard question


---------02:34----------
answer uh happy in which I mean I don't


---------02:37----------
feel happy like I would do when I was 18


---------02:39----------
I gave him no Fox about anything you


---------02:41----------
know I don't feel that way anymore but I


---------02:43----------
definitely feel as though I want to keep


---------02:47----------
going to see where I can get in this


---------02:49----------
game that we call life right like if I


---------02:51----------
could get myself to a place of a peace


---------02:54----------
of mind or whatever it is the people who


---------02:56----------
are searching for yeah yeah so I I think


---------02:59----------
the answer is no which i think is a good


---------03:01----------
answer and it's very appropriate yeah


---------03:03----------
yeah I wouldn't say that I'm blissfully


---------03:05----------
happy now


---------03:05----------
yeah and and so you know it's


---------03:09----------
interesting I I don't really have a good


---------03:11----------
recollection of a lot of what we talked


---------03:13----------
about there were a couple of things that


---------03:14----------
really kind of stuck in my mind


---------03:16----------
help me understand you know what do you


---------03:20----------
think so you've been so twitch and the


---------03:24----------
internet have sort of described you as


---------03:26----------
like super super depressed and and kind


---------03:30----------
of feeling it's it's super hard to


---------03:33----------
explain I guess how the internet views


---------03:34----------
me and how like reality is you know what


---------03:36----------
I mean yeah okay sure where would you


---------03:40----------
like to begin with the so so how do you


---------03:42----------
think you're viewed by the Internet um I


---------03:46----------
think the internet views me off of just


---------03:50----------
like past experiences I've had and like


---------03:52----------
past things have happened because I've


---------03:53----------
been very open with my community and the


---------03:56----------
whole internet my entire career right


---------03:58----------
like I've shared every relationship I've


---------04:00----------
had every girlfriend all that's in


---------04:02----------
public you know what I mean so there's


---------04:03----------
like there's been this like fine line of


---------04:05----------
like


---------04:07----------
weird atmosphere about my relationships


---------04:11----------
right cuz when everything's public it's


---------04:12----------
very hard to have like normal lives yeah


---------04:15----------
yeah so I feel like people view me


---------04:18----------
almost like always for my worst moments


---------04:21----------
and it's like people don't


---------04:22----------
it's like strange like it feels like as


---------04:25----------
a public person you know if you ever


---------04:27----------
have like a bad moment that's gonna be


---------04:28----------
remembered 10 times more than any good


---------04:30----------
moment that you have you know yeah so I


---------04:33----------
truly think that people have this bad


---------04:35----------
taste in mouth from one like like I've


---------04:37----------
been through some [ __ ] and I lost my


---------04:38----------
mind or whatever like years ago and I


---------04:40----------
think people don't let that [ __ ] go you


---------04:42----------
know and they just kind of hang on to


---------04:44----------
that and it makes me also like not be


---------04:49----------
able to let it go as easy as I could


---------04:50----------
because it just reminded a lot you know


---------04:53----------
sure sure but yeah I say the Internet


---------04:55----------
definitely views me as like depressed or


---------04:56----------
like maybe manic you know definitely


---------04:58----------
very messy I'm not consistent very


---------05:05----------
uncoordinated those guys okay and and


---------05:07----------
tell me about who I mean who who do you


---------05:10----------
feel you are I feel as though I honestly


---------05:16----------
have trouble pinpointing who I am cuz


---------05:20----------
I'm always kind of flip-flopping like


---------05:22----------
what I'm doing you know like I'm very


---------05:26----------
inconsistent I'm very like impulsive and


---------05:28----------
I just kind of like be like all I do


---------05:29----------
this for and I go hard for it for a


---------05:31----------
while and then I stop and then so Who I


---------05:33----------
am it's kind of almost based off of who


---------05:35----------
I'm around and like what I'm working


---------05:38----------
toward yeah yeah yeah so I I think that


---------05:42----------
that's so that's not that's not really


---------05:46----------
the real you right so like like and and


---------05:50----------
I think what you're noticing is that


---------05:51----------
like until we understand who we are like


---------05:55----------
it's almost like Nate you know nature


---------05:58----------
abhors a vacuum and so if you don't know


---------06:01----------
who you are you're gonna fill yourself


---------06:03----------
up with the things around you


---------06:06----------
mm-hmm and the people around you and the


---------06:08----------
goals like you become the goal because


---------06:10----------
like you you don't know who you kind of


---------06:12----------
are on the inside yeah for sure and I


---------06:14----------
think with twitch I I get so carried


---------06:16----------
away man with like the goal right


---------06:19----------
I get so carried away to the point where


---------06:21----------
I just put everything about my


---------06:22----------
well-being on hold and everything I do


---------06:24----------
is for the sake of entertainment and I'm


---------06:25----------
not even living for myself I've done it


---------06:27----------
for years you know yeah I'm not saying


---------06:29----------
I'm doing that right now cuz I'm kind of


---------06:30----------
like half and half right now but I've


---------06:32----------
had moments of my life where I'm just


---------06:33----------
like [ __ ] it I'm all-in with this you


---------06:35----------
know like this is everything I have it's


---------06:37----------
all you know like it's just easy getting


---------06:40----------
to the that thought process we're like


---------06:41----------
Oh like I'm you know a mid-20s dumbass


---------06:44----------
who dropped out of college like how else


---------06:45----------
am I gonna make this kind of money


---------06:47----------
unless I go all-in with this or how else


---------06:48----------
am I gonna find the success again in my


---------06:50----------
life I probably won't write so it's it


---------06:53----------
feels is like I almost feel justified


---------06:55----------
and just like going all in it that makes


---------06:58----------
sense I think you're very justified in


---------06:59----------
it so I'd like to dig into that for you


---------07:02----------
because I think that that's not healthy


---------07:04----------
but I think it makes perfect sense


---------07:06----------
because I think you know you you have to


---------07:08----------
go all in to compensate for everything


---------07:11----------
else right so your only chance of


---------07:12----------
success is if you go all-in and then I


---------07:17----------
think I think when you go all-in you


---------07:19----------
also become more of Mitch Jones and less


---------07:21----------
of David and I have a very hard time


---------07:27----------
distinguishing the two of those people


---------07:30----------
right like yeah so tell me about Mitch


---------07:34----------
Jones and tell me about David how are


---------07:35----------
they different


---------07:37----------
well I'm a very sensitive person I mean


---------07:40----------
who like deep down to my core I'm I'm


---------07:43----------
very empathetic and sensitive and people


---------07:45----------
don't really know that or see that


---------07:47----------
because I just wash it off yep I I


---------07:49----------
really I have always been that way


---------07:51----------
cuz uh I don't know why I'm just I've


---------07:54----------
always been that way


---------07:54----------
just like super sensitive and super like


---------07:56----------
I can like almost like I'm like so


---------07:58----------
socially in tune with things that like I


---------08:00----------
it's so weird like mm-hmm


---------08:02----------
it's just very strange I had this like


---------08:04----------
social gift almost but I'm very bad at


---------08:07----------
everything else like I'm it's really


---------08:09----------
weird it's aw it's so so I'm just so


---------08:12----------
weird I'm weird I'm really weird yeah


---------08:14----------
yeah I I think when you say you're weird


---------08:17----------
I think that's a function of you not


---------08:18----------
really understanding who you are it


---------08:21----------
could be it could be I just know that


---------08:22----------
I'm bad at almost everything except


---------08:24----------
understanding emotions like I have this


---------08:26----------
like way of understanding people I'm


---------08:28----------
just like getting them without even like


---------08:29----------
knowing they don't have to tell me [ __ ]


---------08:31----------
I just know you know


---------08:32----------
and it's like it's really weird how but


---------08:36----------
yeah I don't show that I don't show that


---------08:37----------
ever like I don't show my sensitive side


---------08:39----------
or I try not to I have before right like


---------08:41----------
there's been times in the past where


---------08:42----------
I've gotten very emotional in stream and


---------08:44----------
I like it's always ends poorly you know


---------08:47----------
people were just like you know like it's


---------08:49----------
very weird you know you either get like


---------08:50----------
a reaction of like oh man or like you


---------08:52----------
just get a reaction of like [ __ ] you


---------08:54----------
they just keep you know this add fuel to


---------08:55----------
fire whatever okay yeah showing emotion


---------08:58----------
on twitch is almost always bad from what


---------09:00----------
I've noticed what do you why do why do


---------09:02----------
we wall off things [ __ ] am i calling


---------09:05----------
you mixer David by the way I mean


---------09:07----------
whatever you want to call me I've gone


---------09:08----------
by Mitch my whole life but what everyone


---------09:10----------
call me is fine


---------09:10----------
yeah so um why don't we wall things off


---------09:13----------
Mitch um of total - who - like Twitter


---------09:20----------
to everyone or like well in general why


---------09:22----------
do why do we put up cuz it it just it's


---------09:24----------
just easier like I don't think that


---------09:26----------
David would be a good streamer you know


---------09:32----------
he says yeah like I would be way too


---------09:35----------
emotional I would I would always look at


---------09:37----------
things like in this weird I would I'd


---------09:40----------
probably just sit there and talk about


---------09:41----------
key to all day you know what I mean like


---------09:42----------
I would literally just like be like oh


---------09:43----------
I'm working on this I'm working on that


---------09:45----------
like no one gives a [ __ ] like they want


---------09:46----------
to see content they want to see this


---------09:48----------
like thing this character this person


---------09:50----------
whatever like they just want that's what


---------09:52----------
that's what twitch is it's an


---------09:53----------
entertainment platform you know what I


---------09:54----------
mean I'd say 99% of the streamers on


---------09:57----------
this website are personified in some way


---------09:59----------
you know absolutely yeah so it's like to


---------10:03----------
just like to distinguish that from


---------10:06----------
reality is like annoying and it's also


---------10:09----------
very frustrating when I get judged


---------10:10----------
indefinitely on Reddit and everywhere


---------10:13----------
else based off of like almost like a


---------10:16----------
character's yeah it's like I'm doing it


---------10:19----------
for entertainment but it's like people


---------10:20----------
assume that that's just how I am so like


---------10:22----------
I'll meet people in real life and


---------10:23----------
they're like oh you're not actually an


---------10:25----------
[ __ ] and I'm like what like what is


---------10:27----------
that supposed to mean you don't I mean


---------10:28----------
like yeah what does that mean like I


---------10:30----------
don't understand


---------10:31----------
oh yeah like I haven't seen a lot


---------10:33----------
actually and I'm just it's just


---------10:34----------
confusing so yeah what's confusing about


---------10:37----------
that that people misjudged me because


---------10:43----------
even though in stream I don't even think


---------10:44----------
I come off as that much of a dingus I


---------10:46----------
just think I


---------10:46----------
have like a very bad like reputation I


---------10:53----------
guess okay


---------10:54----------
all right not even bad just like


---------10:55----------
controversial like whatever you want to


---------10:57----------
say like something this is like a


---------10:58----------
negative spin on things


---------11:00----------
yeah so what happens sometimes so can I


---------11:03----------
just kind of share with you what I'm


---------11:04----------
hearing try to tie this all things so


---------11:07----------
like I think you know this kind of goes


---------11:09----------
back to first of all your your thinking


---------11:11----------
a little bit more about like fitness


---------11:13----------
because it is such a big part of you or


---------11:15----------
health it's it's part of the real you


---------11:17----------
but it's not a part of the persona that


---------11:18----------
you show the rest of the world oh if it


---------11:20----------
was me I would love to be a monk dude I


---------11:22----------
would love to just like meditate find my


---------11:24----------
true peace of mind and just like somehow


---------11:26----------
just live the simplest life everyone


---------11:28----------
like a farm like I swear I would love


---------11:30----------
that maybe maybe I get bored of it but


---------11:32----------
for now that sounds like really good why


---------11:34----------
do you why do you think that why don't


---------11:38----------
why do you think that you can't live a


---------11:40----------
simple life in the circumstances that


---------11:42----------
you're in now because there's how how


---------11:46----------
would I do that I live like in a


---------11:47----------
streamer house I live in a cesspool of


---------11:50----------
like circles of different I mean maybe I


---------11:57----------
just don't see how I what do you think


---------11:59----------
one does they have very peaceful eyes


---------12:03----------
right what makes them peaceful


---------12:06----------
I don't know I think it's they did they


---------12:09----------
don't do like they don't partaking like


---------12:11----------
stressful things that would like stress


---------12:13----------
them out and their mind and body or


---------12:14----------
whatever right so you know that's kind


---------12:18----------
of interesting I mean I think in a sense


---------12:19----------
that's absolutely correct


---------12:21----------
so monks generally practice in isolation


---------12:23----------
to protect themselves of the influences


---------12:26----------
from the influences of the outside world


---------12:29----------
that sounds great and I also think that


---------12:32----------
most of the work that monks do has


---------12:35----------
nothing to do with the outside world


---------12:36----------
it's about the internal world yes


---------12:39----------
they're inside of their mind and body


---------12:41----------
right absolutely so I think that while


---------12:44----------
it's hard to become a monk in the


---------12:47----------
outside world I absolutely think that


---------12:49----------
you can be a monk in the outside world


---------12:51----------
so I'm going to share with you one of


---------12:54----------
the you know the goals that one of my


---------12:56----------
teachers taught me which is to be in the


---------12:58----------
world but not of it hmm what does that


---------13:01----------
mean to you


---------13:05----------
it means you are just existing in this


---------13:12----------
world this world is not your existence


---------13:14----------
something like that right absolutely


---------13:16----------
what do you think about that I think


---------13:18----------
that's a very true statement and I think


---------13:20----------
period people get carried away in their


---------13:22----------
own egos and ideologies all the time


---------13:24----------
when in reality they should just look at


---------13:25----------
it like you know like exactly the way


---------13:28----------
you're saying like I feel like when you


---------13:31----------
look at things I don't know I don't know


---------13:36----------
I don't really want to get too deep I


---------13:38----------
don't know I think you are so I'm saying


---------13:40----------
right I do understand what you're saying


---------13:42----------
what's your reluctance to get too deep


---------13:43----------
into it I don't know I'm just I'm not


---------13:45----------
very good at articulating words that


---------13:47----------
sound correct so I just rather not say


---------13:49----------
big words or get into like I don't like


---------13:50----------
ideals of like inner mind and all this


---------13:54----------
stuff you know yeah so what's wrong with


---------13:56----------
what's wrong with you


---------13:58----------
if you're not good at something what's


---------14:00----------
wrong with doing it


---------14:04----------
well I'd say I'm not the sharpest tool


---------14:07----------
in the shed right so when I do it on


---------14:10----------
streem and I just get backlash for it so


---------14:12----------
I just would rather not


---------14:13----------
so make sense yeah so but do you think


---------14:16----------
you're getting backlash now I'm not even


---------14:19----------
reading chat but I just would rather not


---------14:21----------
go into like deep like I just know I've


---------14:24----------
done this before we're like I'll say


---------14:26----------
something like five heads stuff or like


---------14:28----------
things that I believe are true and it's


---------14:30----------
like no one will ever take me serious so


---------14:33----------
there's almost no point me talking about


---------14:34----------
those things yeah can I think for a


---------14:39----------
second sure


---------14:50----------
so Mitch I think you don't let yourself


---------14:52----------
be you that could be I don't think you


---------14:56----------
let yourself be you at all because I


---------14:59----------
think you're afraid that if people see


---------15:01----------
you they're not gonna like it mm-hmm


---------15:05----------
and somewhere along the way you started


---------15:07----------
to need people's approval oh that's a


---------15:10----------
hundred percent when I had people's


---------15:11----------
approval and made me like this god mode


---------15:13----------
streamer like I remember like back in


---------15:15----------
like a 2015-16 like I had the most


---------15:18----------
loving crazy loyal community and like


---------15:21----------
every whoa


---------15:22----------
everyone if anything ever was bad said


---------15:24----------
about me it was immediately downloaded


---------15:26----------
every but like you know like I had a


---------15:27----------
crazy cool fan base and that [ __ ] like


---------15:30----------
maybe like fired ups like given like the


---------15:32----------
good content you know like and then one


---------15:34----------
day that kind of all changed and it's


---------15:36----------
like flipped on its head and like I got


---------15:38----------
a shitload of hate and I didn't know how


---------15:40----------
to deal with that so I just like got


---------15:42----------
super depressed and I had this like it's


---------15:46----------
just like changed everything


---------15:47----------
but the approval was like a dick ting


---------15:48----------
man like I'm not gonna lie like when


---------15:50----------
you're getting like go go go go no no


---------15:54----------
I'm saying what are you getting that


---------15:55----------
like positive reinforcement for


---------15:56----------
everything you do it makes doing your


---------15:59----------
job so easy you know yeah so I I think I


---------16:03----------
think getting all that positive


---------16:05----------
reinforcement in a weird way was one of


---------16:07----------
the worst things that happened to you Oh


---------16:08----------
hundred percent yeah I was literally the


---------16:11----------
most spoiled streamer for so long like I


---------16:13----------
could ditch for like months and come


---------16:15----------
back and still maintain like eight


---------16:17----------
thousand viewers and like this was like


---------16:19----------
five years ago you know what I mean and


---------16:20----------
it was nuts like I could literally go on


---------16:22----------
hiatuses and just come back and there


---------16:23----------
was just no one back then that like was


---------16:27----------
as good as like entertaining or whatever


---------16:29----------
at the time I mean people were way more


---------16:31----------
entertainment in me now but I think back


---------16:33----------
then I had a good nishan like it's like


---------16:35----------
whatever I was doing I was doing I was


---------16:37----------
doing right you know what I mean yeah


---------16:38----------
and it was so nice to have that positive


---------16:41----------
reinforcement for so long so I think


---------16:43----------
it's nice to have positive it's nice for


---------16:45----------
anyone to have positive reinforcement


---------16:46----------
but I think that you it wasn't just


---------16:49----------
positive reinforcement for you I think


---------16:52----------
it was oxygen and water in life blood


---------16:56----------
what the the reinforcement was that yeah


---------16:58----------
Thursday Oh 100%


---------17:00----------
yeah no I fed off that so hard yeah and


---------17:03----------
so then the question is why were you


---------17:04----------
hungry


---------17:05----------
where are you needed to feed off of that


---------17:07----------
I don't know it's almost like I build my


---------17:10----------
identity around it at that point right


---------17:12----------
like oh absolutely so I think your your


---------17:15----------
identity started to build around that


---------17:17----------
that's when Mitch Jones was born oh yeah


---------17:21----------
yeah and then you started to become an


---------17:23----------
icon and I think the more that you


---------17:25----------
became an icon and the more that you


---------17:26----------
became the stage presence the more you


---------17:29----------
lost to yourself because you've shared


---------17:32----------
with us that you you don't want to show


---------17:35----------
people parts of David because they're


---------17:37----------
they're looking for Mitch Jones and if


---------17:39----------
you show up as David you're gonna get


---------17:41----------
negative reinforcement and somewhere


---------17:43----------
along the way you became dependent upon


---------17:46----------
both the positive reinforcement and the


---------17:49----------
negative reinforcement and you sort of


---------17:50----------
your life became tied to twitches like


---------17:53----------
impression of you you're worth became


---------17:56----------
tied to twitch his impression of you


---------17:57----------
mm-hmm and even though the positive


---------18:00----------
reinforcement sounds good I think both


---------18:02----------
of these are dangerous situations


---------18:04----------
because who you are becomes determined


---------18:08----------
by how you view your viewed that's so


---------18:13----------
that's exactly how I feel man it's like


---------18:15----------
I just wish you could have that moment


---------18:18----------
in the Sun like forever no that's bad


---------18:21----------
that's so great that those moments are


---------18:24----------
so good though man no that's not I was


---------18:26----------
writing this high for like years


---------18:28----------
Mitch that is not where I'm trying to


---------18:31----------
lead you okay so I know and this has to


---------18:34----------
be understood like why why do I think


---------18:35----------
that that's bad because it's not there's


---------18:39----------
no realistic longevity with that and


---------18:41----------
plus it's building its building yourself


---------18:43----------
up on a false narrative anyways right


---------18:45----------
exactly yeah no I understand all of this


---------18:48----------
it was a [ __ ] damn good time though


---------18:50----------
man


---------18:51----------
yeah I'm sure so I'm sure you'll get


---------18:53----------
there again too good no sex with a good


---------18:55----------
time boys good yeah that's good and I


---------19:00----------
and this is really important so I want


---------19:02----------
you to like really think about this


---------19:03----------
Mitch where I I think that and this is


---------19:05----------
true for everyone who's watching too


---------19:08----------
you know I think that


---------19:09----------
we sometimes want just the highs from


---------19:12----------
life but that's not how life works peace


---------19:15----------
from life does it like so you think when


---------19:19----------
you envision just having like your


---------19:20----------
moment in the Sun Shine forever right


---------19:23----------
that's not actually how a monk lives a


---------19:25----------
monk doesn't live with a moment of


---------19:27----------
sunshine forever they attained their


---------19:29----------
peace but how do they do it through


---------19:32----------
honestly being alright with boredom and


---------19:35----------
being already with mediocrity and all


---------19:36----------
those things like just being alright


---------19:38----------
with whatever is is and they're okay


---------19:40----------
with the exactly so if you crave your


---------19:43----------
moment in the Sun that's the problem


---------19:46----------
it's the crazy you of me though I swear


---------19:49----------
there's like the one there's a decided


---------19:50----------
me that doesn't crave that and I can


---------19:52----------
just throw it all away and I've done it


---------19:53----------
before and then there's a side of me


---------19:54----------
that always comes back so it's like I'm


---------19:57----------
like almost internally like struggling


---------19:59----------
yep like so I desire so now we have to


---------20:03----------
think about where was that second Mitch


---------20:05----------
born the second Mitch Mitch Jones let's


---------20:11----------
say right okay so think about this Lorne


---------20:16----------
who needs who needs like so like I I


---------20:20----------
mean I kind of have I'm trying to lead


---------20:22----------
you to this because I have a hypothesis


---------20:24----------
about this so here's let me just be more


---------20:27----------
transparent instead of like you know


---------20:29----------
kind of lawyer your my way to it so you


---------20:32----------
know I I think that the something


---------20:34----------
generally speaking people crave moments


---------20:37----------
in the Sun when there's something about


---------20:40----------
themselves or their life that is just


---------20:42----------
like really really hard to accept or


---------20:44----------
deal with so you need twitch to like


---------20:47----------
make you feel good because there's


---------20:48----------
something within you that doesn't make


---------20:50----------
you want to feel that doesn't make you


---------20:51----------
feel good and while David overall feels


---------20:54----------
good like I think you like to connect


---------20:57----------
with him but there's something about


---------20:58----------
David that you want to run away from by


---------21:00----------
becoming Mitch Jones


---------21:03----------
and if you want true peace the the way


---------21:08----------
to get rid of the longing for permanent


---------21:11----------
sunshine like you crave the highs of the


---------21:14----------
good years of twitch once again the way


---------21:16----------
to get rid of that craving is to be


---------21:18----------
satisfied with who you are yeah no I


---------21:22----------
agree I agree with that and I've done


---------21:25----------
work to do that but doing that at the


---------21:27----------
same time as twitch seems almost


---------21:29----------
impossible I think that that's really


---------21:31----------
hard like imagine trying to like be this


---------21:35----------
thing and then having to like it's like


---------21:38----------
turn it off and all and always it's just


---------21:40----------
like exhaust yeah it's it sounds really


---------21:42----------
hard I don't know if it's actually


---------21:43----------
possible but so I think that's why I've


---------21:46----------
always taken long breaks from twitch and


---------21:48----------
I'm just like okay I gotta find out who


---------21:49----------
I am again and I find myself again and I


---------21:51----------
lose myself again and I find myself


---------21:53----------
again it's like a cycle so when we think


---------21:56----------
about David's life what is it that that


---------21:59----------
bothers you the most about David's life


---------22:04----------
100% not being able to connect to anyone


---------22:07----------
anyone that's the most thing like I


---------22:09----------
can't connect with any people I don't


---------22:11----------
trust anyone am I like there's just no


---------22:14----------
way I can like make meaningful


---------22:16----------
relationships because I truly think that


---------22:19----------
the only reason people come into my life


---------22:20----------
anyway is for Mitch Jones not for David


---------22:23----------
so make sense yep so so forth it's super


---------22:27----------
hard for me to make meaningful


---------22:29----------
relationships like super hard right and


---------22:31----------
that sucks and I feel like it's been


---------22:33----------
almost every girl I've dated almost


---------22:35----------
every person I've interacted with like


---------22:37----------
it's just it's it's a really sad lonely


---------22:39----------
existence when you know that you're just


---------22:41----------
a piece of meat you know like you're not


---------22:43----------
anybody else but a piece of meat you


---------22:46----------
weren't always lonely you're right I had


---------22:49----------
real friends and a bunch of cool people


---------22:51----------
that I grew up with until those things


---------22:52----------
faded and then you know I kind of had to


---------22:55----------
dive into this world that is like almost


---------22:57----------
like Hollywood 2.0 yeah so I think I


---------23:01----------
think what you've got to manage and I'm


---------23:04----------
still sort of beating around the bush


---------23:07----------
you know so so you kind of mentioned to


---------23:10----------
me before that there there's someone


---------23:12----------
there there have been people in your


---------23:14----------
life or one person in particular


---------23:16----------
whose really like known you and accepted


---------23:18----------
you yes yes there's been a few like I


---------23:23----------
still have like one really close friend


---------23:25----------
back home but we don't keep in touch


---------23:26----------
that much but he definitely understands


---------23:28----------
me and like has connected to me on that


---------23:30----------
level as well but it's like that and my


---------23:32----------
mom how old you were how old were you


---------23:35----------
when Mitch Jones was born uh I'd say


---------23:39----------
twenty-one okay how old were you when


---------23:42----------
your mom got sick hmm like 18 19 yeah it


---------23:50----------
depends on what you like I was always


---------23:52----------
kind of like a laughing click like Mitch


---------23:55----------
Jones isn't like a completely


---------23:56----------
personified made-up thing like it's like


---------23:58----------
that's hat then I can get into that


---------24:00----------
place like just being myself you know


---------24:02----------
but it's like we need to force yourself


---------24:03----------
to that place then it's almost like what


---------24:05----------
is this you know like this makes perfect


---------24:08----------
sense so I think that it is a piece of


---------24:10----------
my personality it's just like I'm


---------24:11----------
sitting you have today we're sit out


---------24:14----------
David was a clown yeah 100% I was it's


---------24:18----------
always been a crowd I think that's a


---------24:19----------
part of who you are I think that's a


---------24:21----------
part of your authentic self


---------24:22----------
yeah for sure and my general hypothesis


---------24:26----------
Mitch just so I'll kind of lay it out is


---------24:28----------
I think that you know I I think a lot of


---------24:31----------
this comes down to your mom I think a


---------24:34----------
lot of it does as well and I there's


---------24:36----------
nothing I can do about that though you


---------24:37----------
know that's that's already done I guess


---------24:40----------
I can maybe like what kind of thinking


---------24:42----------
is that I I don't know I don't know what


---------24:46----------
I can do yeah so I can't change what


---------24:50----------
happened you know you can't change what


---------24:52----------
happened but yeah a lot of it does come


---------24:56----------
down to that how so cuz I just truly


---------25:00----------
think like she was like the rock in my


---------25:02----------
life that just kept everything okay and


---------25:04----------
then I've lost that and I had to like


---------25:06----------
and I tried to like what are you doing


---------25:08----------
mink I'm just randomly shifting tabs cuz


---------25:11----------
HD I'm just being ADHD I don't think so


---------25:15----------
you haven't been doing that very much


---------25:17----------
III don't know yeah I just really


---------25:19----------
fidgeting I don't know why absolutely I


---------25:21----------
completely agree what changed in the


---------25:24----------
last 60 seconds


---------25:26----------
I don't know I guess we started talking


---------25:30----------
about something that's bothering me


---------25:31----------
absolutely right so what does your mind


---------25:33----------
do when we talk about something that


---------25:35----------
bothers you it wanders and you're right


---------25:37----------
it's wandering it's like trying to avoid


---------25:39----------
that doesn't like it yeah absolutely and


---------25:42----------
what's the what's the perfect way to


---------25:44----------
avoid it


---------25:46----------
fidgeting around and so I think Mitch


---------25:50----------
Jones is the ultimate fidget oh so you


---------25:54----------
think if I become Mitch I don't have to


---------25:58----------
none of these things surface and I can


---------25:59----------
just what I can just carry on yeah I


---------26:02----------
think that yeah I mean truth yes


---------26:04----------
definitely coz like when I'm streaming I


---------26:06----------
don't think about this [ __ ] I'm just


---------26:07----------
like in the mode I'm in the mode you


---------26:09----------
know absolutely right and you want a


---------26:11----------
zone so here's the thing about giving it


---------26:13----------
your all


---------26:14----------
when you become Mitch Jones you give it


---------26:16----------
your all right it requires a hundred


---------26:19----------
percent of you yeah and you can't give


---------26:22----------
it a oh your all without forgetting


---------26:25----------
about things you can't hold on to your


---------26:28----------
mom even 1% you can't be Mitch Jones if


---------26:30----------
you're thinking about her like you know


---------26:31----------
that you get the this sort of and I've


---------26:35----------
no doubt that like the clown within you


---------26:38----------
is like a genuine part of who you are


---------26:39----------
and I think that that even Mitch Jones


---------26:42----------
is like actually like a really authentic


---------26:43----------
there's like there's an authentic


---------26:45----------
there's a really pure piece of you in


---------26:47----------
there there's the guy that like got into


---------26:50----------
your mom's car without wearing any


---------26:52----------
clothing like that's like that was you


---------26:53----------
that was the real you


---------26:55----------
right yeah that's really who you are and


---------26:58----------
you show that part to the Internet and


---------27:00----------
that's why they love you because you're


---------27:03----------
not putting on an act I think you're


---------27:05----------
just giving them a slice yeah yeah no


---------27:08----------
that's true I think I got popular in the


---------27:10----------
first place just cuz I was a dumbass it


---------27:12----------
was like a good Meijin Wow you know yeah


---------27:14----------
I wasn't like anything I wasn't I don't


---------27:17----------
know like I wasn't really trying it just


---------27:19----------
kind of happened


---------27:21----------
and then what's it happened I started


---------27:22----------
trying because like it got more


---------27:24----------
competitive and stuff like that yeah


---------27:27----------
yeah so I mean I think all that stuff is


---------27:29----------
cool I think you know you've had a like


---------27:31----------
a rollercoaster of a streaming career Oh


---------27:34----------
100% I've had some crazy highs and some


---------27:37----------
crazy lows like it's


---------27:39----------
so really weird and I'm if it's okay


---------27:42----------
with you Mitch I'm gonna come back to


---------27:44----------
your mom yeah no problem because I think


---------27:47----------
you've got to be like I don't think


---------27:49----------
you'll ever be a whether you're a monk


---------27:50----------
living in a farm or you're here I don't


---------27:53----------
think you're gonna find peace until you


---------27:54----------
like sort of like process that and deal


---------27:57----------
with that and you kind of look at your


---------28:00----------
life and you say there's nothing I can


---------28:01----------
do about it but I in a sense that's true


---------28:04----------
like you can't cure her of what she has


---------28:06----------
but I think that there's a lot of work


---------28:09----------
there to be done and how how do you


---------28:14----------
suggest that I heal that pain I think we


---------28:17----------
start by facing it right we start by not


---------28:19----------
fidgeting we start by not opening tabs


---------28:20----------
and sitting with it and understanding


---------28:22----------
what it is I think I've been facing it


---------28:25----------
for so long though like I mean every


---------28:28----------
once in a while I'll just like face it


---------28:30----------
like it's had just happens no matter


---------28:32----------
what like yeah yeah and what happens


---------28:35----------
when you face it I get super emotional


---------28:39----------
and then I could and then I just try to


---------28:43----------
get back to normal and then I carry on


---------28:47----------
yeah so I think the mistake you're


---------28:49----------
making is in trying to get back to


---------28:51----------
normal so I shouldn't know I mean I


---------28:56----------
think that's that's what monks do right


---------28:58----------
so the monks don't try to get anywhere


---------29:00----------
they just let it all happen yeah right


---------29:04----------
to accept what is I I think what you're


---------29:08----------
missing is actually grief


---------29:12----------
so I think the


---------29:14----------
of grief is like if I had to put like


---------29:16----------
you know I had to use a word to describe


---------29:19----------
what you need to do it's grieving


---------29:22----------
because grieving is how we you know you


---------29:26----------
can't like you can't change anything in


---------29:28----------
grief does that make sense and it's


---------29:30----------
still really really important to do like


---------29:35----------
there are bad things that happen and we


---------29:36----------
can't bring people back from the dead


---------29:39----------
and I don't know if you I don't know if


---------29:43----------
you realize this but like I think in


---------29:45----------
your mind like they're like your mom is


---------29:47----------
like not really like she's gone yeah


---------29:52----------
she's definitely she's not gone


---------29:55----------
per se it's just like she's not the


---------29:58----------
person that she was or it's very


---------30:02----------
difficult to watch someone deteriorate


---------30:04----------
you know it's just yeah it's almost the


---------30:07----------
worst thing ever when you like see


---------30:08----------
someone's personality like be stripped


---------30:10----------
from them and their speech be stripped


---------30:12----------
their movement be stripped it's it's


---------30:14----------
it's honestly the most heartbreaking


---------30:16----------
thing I've ever had to see in my life


---------30:18----------
and like when I witness when I did every


---------30:21----------
time I fly home I truly just have a hard


---------30:27----------
time functioning because of how like


---------30:29----------
distraught and like upset and sad I feel


---------30:31----------
and I hate those feelings I hate them I


---------30:33----------
hate them so much they make me


---------30:35----------
unfunctional and then if I come on like


---------30:37----------
let's say I want to stream that day I'll


---------30:40----------
come on Twitch and everyone knows and


---------30:41----------
they can see the weakness in me they


---------30:42----------
they see it you know and like twitches


---------30:45----------
they're very uh good at seeing weakness


---------30:49----------
for it and like I get I get picked I


---------30:52----------
could I get torn apart and quite frankly


---------30:54----------
I'm I'm like terrified of like crying or


---------30:57----------
like those type of like deep emotions on


---------30:59----------
stream I I get very much so [ __ ] on for


---------31:02----------
you know like I've done it on stream


---------31:03----------
before and like I've it's just people


---------31:06----------
call me victim Jones or say I'm a [ __ ]


---------31:08----------
or whatever it's like [ __ ] so I'm gonna


---------31:10----------
do something that if this feels


---------31:11----------
insensitive or mean to you please let me


---------31:14----------
know but you keep on moving back to


---------31:16----------
twitch in a way that your mom so I'm


---------31:19----------
gonna keep you there so like you see


---------31:20----------
that like I'm done so so I think I


---------31:23----------
shouldn't think about to whichever no no


---------31:25----------
you can think no no


---------31:26----------
can think about whatever you want to so


---------31:28----------
it's gonna be my job to keep us on track


---------31:30----------
and I'm asking for your permission to do


---------31:32----------
so oh I I give you permission okay


---------31:35----------
whatever you want so that you let your


---------31:36----------
mind do what it wants to that's actually


---------31:38----------
okay so like that that's the reason


---------31:39----------
you're tossing to me is it's always bad


---------31:42----------
that I keep going back to the that's


---------31:43----------
like maybe my healing no yes and it's


---------31:46----------
okay right because that's that's just


---------31:48----------
that that's exactly what I'm saying so


---------31:50----------
like you see how your mind is fidgeting


---------31:51----------
so as you start opening tabs and then we


---------31:54----------
kind of go back because like in a weird


---------31:55----------
way your mind is comfortable with


---------31:57----------
talking about the pain of twitch that's


---------32:00----------
a roller coaster that your mind is


---------32:02----------
actually completely fine with even


---------32:03----------
though it's painful you can talk about


---------32:05----------
that you can access that what's really


---------32:07----------
hard for you to sit with is your mom and


---------32:09----------
by the way I think the reason that you


---------32:11----------
know you kind of say but I've dealt with


---------32:12----------
it before I faced it before and you know


---------32:15----------
I'm like it's like I'm not healed yet


---------32:18----------
and I think absolutely that's true and I


---------32:21----------
don't think that you've not faced it


---------32:22----------
properly I think like if we really think


---------32:24----------
about this I think you've done a good


---------32:25----------
job of facing it but I think your


---------32:28----------
situation is actually like really really


---------32:30----------
heartbreaking because it's going on


---------32:34----------
right so like when I'm when my dad


---------32:36----------
passed away eight years ago he was gone


---------32:39----------
like all at once and then I could grieve


---------32:43----------
him and move on with my life


---------32:45----------
in a bizarre way compared to your


---------32:49----------
situation I'm lucky because what I'm


---------32:53----------
hearing from you is like every time you


---------32:54----------
see her like another part of her like


---------32:57----------
kind of withers away and she's still


---------32:59----------
your mom and you still love her and you


---------33:01----------
can see the parts that are there but


---------33:03----------
like there's you can't it's not like


---------33:05----------
it's not talking about grieving once


---------33:08----------
it's like grieving like a like again and


---------33:11----------
again and again like every single time


---------33:15----------
and so I don't hold you like I don't


---------33:17----------
blame you at all for not being able to


---------33:19----------
move past it because this is [ __ ]


---------33:22----------
like it's hard man it's like watching


---------33:23----------
someone I mean she had brain cancer


---------33:25----------
right yeah yeah I mean so I've seen this


---------33:30----------
with people who have like cancer yeah


---------33:35----------
it's like it's just has so much man like


---------33:38----------
two strokes two brain surgeries just


---------33:42----------
like I spent my okay I'm having trouble


---------33:49----------
keeping it cool that's fine this is why


---------33:52----------
I just hate talking about this I hate it


---------33:54----------
these feelings are so painful man yeah


---------33:59----------
and I'm just feels so [ __ ] unfair


---------34:02----------
that I just don't understand yeah


---------34:06----------
because it is unfair dude and and there


---------34:11----------
isn't there isn't and there isn't


---------34:14----------
understanding yeah and I get really sad


---------34:19----------
like I see I see all these like people


---------34:22----------
that I live with and everyone they're


---------34:24----------
like such like loving parents and like


---------34:26----------
families and I just feel so [ __ ]


---------34:28----------
lonely man like I feel so [ __ ] lost


---------34:30----------
like I don't even all I have is like


---------34:34----------
this is why like put all my chips and


---------34:36----------
like all I have is this thing I've built


---------34:38----------
cuz I don't have anything to go back to


---------34:40----------
you know like I just my mom is not the


---------34:42----------
same she never will be my brother is at


---------34:45----------
this point in like some assisted living


---------34:47----------
because I don't even know why the hell


---------34:49----------
he's there but he is and he's not doing


---------34:52----------
well and then my dad is just focused on


---------34:53----------
his work and I I don't know I just feel


---------34:57----------
like I'm super alone I don't have the


---------34:58----------
traditional like sense of love and


---------35:00----------
family and any of that [ __ ] is it just


---------35:02----------
doesn't feel like so I feel lone in this


---------35:06----------
world feel very alone and I don't trust


---------35:08----------
anyone and it sucks yeah so Mitch let me


---------35:11----------
let me explain something to you okay so


---------35:13----------
I say this with love you feel alone in


---------35:15----------
this world because you are alone in this


---------35:17----------
world I don't want to be alone man I


---------35:20----------
don't want you to be alone either


---------35:22----------
but I I think it starts with like


---------35:25----------
understanding where you are right and I


---------35:28----------
and I think that unfortunately you have


---------35:30----------
been dealt one of the shittiest hands


---------35:32----------
that life has to offer and and that's


---------35:36----------
like I don't know how else like I'm not


---------35:37----------
trying to like I feel like there's a


---------35:39----------
part of me that thinks that I'm beating


---------35:40----------
up on you but I mean that's just the


---------35:43----------
truth right because you had one person


---------35:46----------
in your life and and she's like


---------35:48----------
withering away and you're watching it


---------35:50----------
happen in front of you what you're


---------35:52----------
dealing with is not like depression I


---------35:54----------
mean sure there may be depression there


---------35:55----------
but I I think like this is what we call


---------35:58----------
like complex trauma right so in


---------36:01----------
psychiatry like you know I'm not


---------36:03----------
supposed to diagnose things over the


---------36:04----------
internet but like there's this like


---------36:05----------
corner merging like there's a difference


---------36:07----------
between one event like so simple trauma


---------36:11----------
is like if you get you know like let's


---------36:13----------
say you get sexually assaulted or


---------36:15----------
something like that like that's pretty


---------36:16----------
bad but then complex trauma is when you


---------36:19----------
have like a loved one who like


---------36:22----------
continually abuses you like over the


---------36:24----------
course of years and it's a completely


---------36:26----------
different animal it's not just


---------36:28----------
straight-up PTSD it's like deeper and


---------36:31----------
what I see in you is someone who hasn't


---------36:34----------
been like life hasn't like you know


---------36:36----------
sucker-punched you once it's just like


---------36:38----------
you take a beating every time you kind


---------36:40----------
of think about your life and your loved


---------36:41----------
ones and stuff like that and then


---------36:43----------
there's this other weird thing that's


---------36:45----------
happened is like in order to protect


---------36:47----------
yourself from that


---------36:48----------
Mitch Jones rises from the ashes right


---------36:53----------
which allows you to access just that


---------36:56----------
part of you which is like beautiful and


---------36:58----------
funny and clowny and amazing and it's


---------37:00----------
like it's your moment in the sunshine


---------37:02----------
but that sunshine is born out of like


---------37:05----------
you stuffing other [ __ ] into the shadows


---------37:08----------
like Mitch Jones is in the spotlight in


---------37:12----------
an order for Mitch Jones to be in the


---------37:14----------
spotlight he's got a push David out of


---------37:15----------
it and then David is along [ __ ] the


---------37:20----------
absolutely that's what you've been doing


---------37:24----------
right yeah because you don't like being


---------37:27----------
David because it's hard to be David and


---------37:29----------
I get that man I really do in a sense I


---------37:32----------
actually don't I have no idea because


---------37:33----------
you know I mean I've lost a parent


---------37:36----------
but you know I still have people in my


---------37:38----------
life who love me and I'm really really


---------37:40----------
grateful for that and I think in your


---------37:42----------
case like the tricky thing about Mitch


---------37:44----------
Jones is then no opening tabs stay with


---------37:48----------
me


---------37:50----------
the tricky thing about Mitch Jones is


---------37:52----------
then you become Mitch Jones and then


---------37:54----------
what's frustrating to you is that when


---------37:55----------
people meet you on the street you want


---------37:58----------
them to see David Wright when you meet


---------38:01----------
people in real life I want to be myself


---------38:03----------
yeah I don't want to have to be this


---------38:04----------
like clowny thing that's like


---------38:06----------
entertaining people all the time you


---------38:08----------
know so in a bizarre way it reinforces


---------38:10----------
your loneliness because those are the


---------38:12----------
moments where David can be seen those


---------38:14----------
are the moments where like other people


---------38:16----------
can like you know get to know you and


---------38:18----------
you can start to form a real human


---------38:20----------
connection but instead all they see is


---------38:21----------
Miss Jones yeah that's true


---------38:24----------
I feel like Mitch Jones is the thing


---------38:27----------
that brings me any type of it's brought


---------38:30----------
me everything I have like you know I


---------38:32----------
mean like if I was just absolutely if I


---------38:34----------
was just if I was just if I just let


---------38:36----------
myself be like David the sad Khan


---------38:39----------
walking around I would just be another


---------38:40----------
depressed boomer who's broken lonely or


---------38:42----------
whatever absolutely right and that's


---------38:45----------
what makes this really hard so


---------38:47----------
understand this Mitch you have not


---------38:49----------
gotten to this place because you're dumb


---------38:51----------
you've gotten to this place because your


---------38:53----------
strategy works really well


---------38:55----------
Mitch Jones is your savior and and he's


---------39:01----------
what's holding you back right because


---------39:03----------
he's what he's what prevents exactly I'm


---------39:05----------
living in a tug of war constantly


---------39:09----------
absolutely how does that alive it feels


---------39:12----------
it feels bad man it feels bad because I


---------39:17----------
can't just like focus on one yeah I have


---------39:19----------
to do both yeah so so the problem here


---------39:22----------
is that like it's not David and Mitch


---------39:24----------
under the spotlight it's like they take


---------39:27----------
turns and there are times where you turn


---------39:28----------
off Mitch Jones you go home and then you


---------39:30----------
become David again and you don't like


---------39:32----------
David so you start to like move away


---------39:33----------
from him so I think that it's not that I


---------39:36----------
just like David it's more of just like


---------39:38----------
having to sit in that mental for a long


---------39:43----------
period of time drags me into it so deep


---------39:45----------
that I can't get out like I'll just


---------39:47----------
start just like I'll start getting very


---------39:49----------
like


---------39:49----------
antisocial and just doing like you know


---------39:52----------
whatever like just not productive things


---------39:55----------
you know so it's almost like it's better


---------39:57----------
to just not let that person come out


---------39:58----------
because it's almost always negative


---------40:02----------
exactly so now I want what now let's


---------40:04----------
understand that right so how can you


---------40:06----------
heal if you never let that person out


---------40:10----------
which kind of makes sense because if you


---------40:12----------
let that person out he takes over leads


---------40:14----------
to like all kinds of bad [ __ ] happening


---------40:16----------
on stream you become less successful so


---------40:19----------
I think what I would like to really help


---------40:21----------
you do Mitch is teach you how to let


---------40:24----------
David out how to let those negative


---------40:25----------
feelings out without spiraling out of


---------40:27----------
control


---------40:28----------
mm-hmm I I would like you to be able to


---------40:31----------
be yourself and feel those negative


---------40:33----------
feelings and then also to like you know


---------40:35----------
it's kind of we're gonna open the closet


---------40:37----------
door we're gonna take out something


---------40:39----------
that's disorganized we're gonna organize


---------40:40----------
a little bit and then put it back in the


---------40:42----------
closet mm-hmm because I I don't think


---------40:46----------
that you're gonna I mean this is not


---------40:47----------
you've a strategy that you have is like


---------40:50----------
materialistically successful but I don't


---------40:53----------
think it's gonna lead you to peace oh


---------40:55----------
it's not and and you've gotta I mean you


---------40:58----------
can't you can't live like this you know


---------41:02----------
you've gotta you've got to learn how to


---------41:05----------
grieve and and and process those


---------41:07----------
feelings and then also like the more


---------41:09----------
that you do that the less you have to be


---------41:12----------
Mitch Jones and the more that you can be


---------41:14----------
like the authentic clowny David who's


---------41:16----------
like kind of like Mitch Jones and then


---------41:17----------
my hope my real hope for you is that as


---------41:20----------
you become less of this like caricature


---------41:22----------
of yourself that you can start to form


---------41:25----------
like really authentic connections with


---------41:26----------
people and then my real hope for you is


---------41:29----------
that like at the end of all of this you


---------41:30----------
it's not about success it's about you


---------41:32----------
not being alone anymore that's really


---------41:35----------
more than anything else in the world I


---------41:36----------
want you to not I have a question for


---------41:39----------
you yeah you think it's best for me to


---------41:42----------
just find like my peace of mind to be


---------41:45----------
able to make connections and that's more


---------41:47----------
important than like the success of my


---------41:48----------
twitch channel I'm asking you because


---------41:51----------
like yeah they almost don't go hand in


---------41:53----------
hand like if I'm working on myself and


---------41:55----------
doing my own thing like that person


---------41:56----------
could be a bad boring streamer you know


---------41:58----------
like so so I don't accept your premise


---------42:02----------
because I think that


---------42:03----------
the way that so previously when David


---------42:06----------
used to come on Twitch it led to a bad


---------42:08----------
stream I don't accept that that has to


---------42:12----------
be true going forward yes I agree I


---------42:15----------
think the maturing could be a good arc


---------42:18----------
for my thing and also I think you should


---------42:21----------
be your clowny [ __ ] self like I think


---------42:23----------
you should be what twitch loves you for


---------42:25----------
because I think that's a real part of


---------42:26----------
you yeah for sure


---------42:28----------
and I am I so overwhelmingly I've worked


---------42:33----------
with a lot of people Mitch and a lot of


---------42:35----------
people are afraid because they this is


---------42:37----------
how it like this is how life works where


---------42:38----------
people come up with all these weird


---------42:40----------
compensatory mechanisms like like you


---------42:43----------
know I'll just give you an example so I


---------42:44----------
was working with someone who whose dad


---------42:46----------
the one time that their dad ever said


---------42:51----------
something good about them is when they


---------42:54----------
were a normal weight they got set to fat


---------42:56----------
camp and they lost stuff and were at


---------42:59----------
like the bottom end of like like below


---------43:01----------
that is like when they start to become


---------43:03----------
anorexic and when they came back from


---------43:06----------
fat camp the one nice thing they're


---------43:08----------
there their dad ever said to them is you


---------43:10----------
look good rest of the time it was like


---------43:14----------
emotional abuse and judgement you're


---------43:16----------
[ __ ] this up and you're doing that


---------43:18----------
bad and things like that


---------43:19----------
so one one time in her life was like she


---------43:21----------
ever got positive feedback from her dad


---------43:23----------
and so her desire to like meet her dad's


---------43:27----------
expectations caused her to like study so


---------43:30----------
hard and work so hard and take care of


---------43:32----------
her appearance where she became


---------43:34----------
incredibly incredibly successful entered


---------43:37----------
the world of finance made like [ __ ] tons


---------43:40----------
of money married someone who is equally


---------43:42----------
ambitious and rich and so her whole life


---------43:44----------
is based off of like this track of


---------43:47----------
success which is rooted in you know not


---------43:50----------
to oversimplify things but essentially


---------43:52----------
like a pattern it's not that she was


---------43:54----------
trying to make her dad happy it's that


---------43:56----------
in order to make her dad happy she


---------43:58----------
learned a certain way of functioning


---------43:59----------
which was giving it a hundred percent


---------44:01----------
which was going all-in which is what you


---------44:04----------
do to when you go on stream and she's


---------44:07----------
afraid that if she lets go of that


---------44:10----------
initial wound that all of the ambition


---------44:14----------
and hard work is gonna go with it that's


---------44:17----------
a gray


---------44:17----------
we're putting it yeah that's that's


---------44:20----------
spot-on that's exactly I feel yeah I


---------44:21----------
feel as though if I were to actually get


---------44:25----------
my [ __ ] together quote-unquote that


---------44:28----------
could ruin me yep because a lot of what


---------44:31----------
the appeal of my channel has been is


---------44:32----------
honestly it's it's a [ __ ] tornado you


---------44:35----------
never know what you're gonna get it


---------44:36----------
could be some craziness or whatever like


---------44:39----------
it's just always something ridiculous


---------44:41----------
right and like that's good content it is


---------44:43----------
you know and it's just like if it's just


---------44:46----------
like normal David like you know then


---------44:49----------
then then what like I don't I don't have


---------44:51----------
a college degree you know what I mean


---------44:53----------
like I don't know what I do yeah so I


---------44:54----------
think it's a very reasonable fear and I


---------44:56----------
mean the reason I shared that story with


---------44:58----------
you is because I think you know it's a


---------44:59----------
reasonable fear


---------45:00----------
the other interesting thing is you


---------45:01----------
wouldn't fear that unless deep down you


---------45:05----------
understood that these two things are


---------45:06----------
connected


---------45:07----------
yeah does that make sense it does yeah


---------45:10----------
so what do you think happened is is we


---------45:12----------
started working as I started working


---------45:14----------
with this person and she started to feel


---------45:16----------
more confident in herself what do you


---------45:18----------
think happened I'd say that her wound


---------45:22----------
slowly healed and she stayed successful


---------45:24----------
absolutely yeah in fact she became more


---------45:27----------
successful yeah I don't doubt it because


---------45:30----------
those ideals don't go away especially


---------45:32----------
when they've been they've been like


---------45:33----------
there for that long so healing her


---------45:35----------
wounds gonna only just make her more


---------45:37----------
powerful in the end of it yeah but what


---------45:40----------
what is healing your wounds gonna do


---------45:42----------
Mitch


---------45:42----------
I mean potentially the same thing


---------45:45----------
absolutely so that's what I've seen time


---------45:48----------
and time again mm-hmm well I would love


---------45:51----------
to do that and honestly if I could like


---------45:53----------
become a different entity to where like


---------45:55----------
I don't have to you know exert myself so


---------46:00----------
hard you know is it make sense


---------46:02----------
absolutely that would be great yeah I


---------46:04----------
would love that I would love to be


---------46:06----------
respected for not being like yeah like I


---------46:09----------
used to be respected for like for


---------46:11----------
example for like being very good at


---------46:12----------
World War Craft like that was nice like


---------46:14----------
not just being like oh it's that guy


---------46:16----------
who's controversial and whatever you


---------46:18----------
know it's it's way better to be known


---------46:21----------
for something being good at something


---------46:22----------
than this just be be known big to be


---------46:24----------
known somebody yes absolutely so you're


---------46:27----------
talking about kind of like Fame versus


---------46:28----------
notoriety right


---------46:30----------
yeah it's like I want to be sown for


---------46:32----------
actually being good at something not for


---------46:34----------
just being some [ __ ] jackass clown


---------46:35----------
who hits on girls and cringes around you


---------46:38----------
know yeah so let's be I'm gonna teach


---------46:41----------
you kind of how to process your emotions


---------46:42----------
in a second but let's just talk about


---------46:43----------
successive twitch screaming for a second


---------46:45----------
okay so here's the thing to understand


---------46:48----------
her psychological wounds when I'm


---------46:50----------
talking about my patient her


---------46:51----------
psychological wounds and her


---------46:53----------
psychological healing has nothing I mean


---------46:55----------
in a sense it has something to do with


---------46:56----------
her her success in her job but like


---------46:59----------
being good at your job is about being


---------47:01----------
[ __ ] good at your job yeah for sure


---------47:04----------
so if you want to be a successful twitch


---------47:06----------
streamer you need to do the things that


---------47:07----------
will make you a successful twitch


---------47:09----------
streamer don't think for a moment in the


---------47:11----------
same way that all this deep dark hurt


---------47:12----------
and stuff that hasn't really made you a


---------47:14----------
successful twitch streamer like you've


---------47:16----------
sort of sniffed out and evolved into


---------47:18----------
someone who's become a successful twitch


---------47:20----------
streamer and in the same way if you


---------47:22----------
believe that healing this is gonna


---------47:24----------
magically make you more successful


---------47:25----------
that's not gonna happen either oh of


---------47:28----------
course not it don't work it just makes


---------47:30----------
you lighter to be able to work harder


---------47:31----------
right absolutely so I think your life


---------47:34----------
will improve but being a successful


---------47:36----------
twitch streamer is about doing the


---------47:38----------
things that make you a successful twitch


---------47:39----------
streamer and if that involves being I


---------47:42----------
know that I know that left and right gut


---------47:45----------
yeah so the next thing is that you know


---------47:47----------
I think they come to you because you're


---------47:48----------
kind of this clowny person and stuff


---------47:50----------
like that and I think you should


---------47:51----------
continue to channel that and also if


---------47:53----------
they come to you because you're a little


---------47:54----------
bit of a tornado you should also do that


---------47:56----------
because I think naturally you're a


---------47:58----------
little bit of a tornado a hundred


---------48:00----------
percent yeah right I love a little bit


---------48:01----------
of spice in my life is yeah so so then


---------48:03----------
I'd say continue doing that like right


---------48:05----------
so you don't want to be you don't want


---------48:07----------
to be like wholesome like you you don't


---------48:09----------
want to be like wholesome because that's


---------48:10----------
just not who you are oh right yeah but


---------48:15----------
but you also don't want to be a [ __ ]


---------48:16----------
train wreck who disappears for months at


---------48:18----------
a time and is like you know like I think


---------48:20----------
it's fine to display than the


---------48:22----------
been there and and there's something


---------48:25----------
about I think there's something about


---------48:27----------
you know you being able to smile and


---------48:30----------
make jokes and also from time to time


---------48:32----------
show that you're like you feel alone and


---------48:34----------
stuff like that I think that's actually


---------48:35----------
why you became successful because I


---------48:38----------
think that like you got to understand


---------48:40----------
that twitch chat is like broken right


---------48:42----------
like we're all broken we're all [ __ ]


---------48:44----------
man we're all broken and so what we love


---------48:47----------
to see is someone who can smile and


---------48:49----------
enjoy their life and like still be


---------48:50----------
successful and kind of clown around


---------48:52----------
because I'm so good at hiding it back in


---------48:54----------
the day man I swear disagree hundred


---------49:03----------
percent Mitch I think all of them knew


---------49:06----------
you know they knew and you put on such a


---------49:10----------
good front that they thought they could


---------49:13----------
do that too they thought they could


---------49:15----------
become Mitch but deep down they [ __ ]


---------49:17----------
knew yeah it's all a matter of time so


---------49:20----------
David comes out of office they knew and


---------49:24----------
the fact the fact that you hit it so


---------49:26----------
well is I think what gave them so much


---------49:27----------
hope right because they didn't see it


---------49:30----------
yeah but they knew deep down nature I


---------49:33----------
think they knew I swear to God I just


---------49:36----------
when I watch this but I even felt it man


---------49:39----------
like the way I felt was I'm just like


---------49:40----------
all right like I'm I'm doing it like


---------49:42----------
we're out here like I don't have any


---------49:43----------
problems like let's just positive


---------49:45----------
positive positive like I just radiated


---------49:47----------
positivity for so long so [ __ ] toxic


---------49:50----------
dude that is so toxic is it yes just be


---------49:54----------
a positive ball of fun that's bad yeah


---------49:58----------
because I mean that's you pushing David


---------50:00----------
into the shadows right so I think it's


---------50:02----------
fine to be a positive ball of fun but I


---------50:03----------
think you have to give yourself space to


---------50:06----------
be negative yeah no but I've been


---------50:09----------
negative now for a long time so like you


---------50:11----------
know like it went from like polar ships


---------50:13----------
like I'm talking like super positive


---------50:15----------
everything was good to like depressed


---------50:17----------
awful terrible you know like I'm talking


---------50:20----------

---------50:23----------
right so this is something so so now


---------50:25----------
make sure this is this is exactly like


---------50:27----------

---------50:28----------
white thinking why do you think I've


---------50:30----------
been like pushing you with black and


---------50:32----------
white thinking


---------50:35----------
because it's pretty obvious that's what


---------50:39----------
I do it's like always pull they're


---------50:41----------
opposites there's no ground exactly yeah


---------50:45----------
and the monk is the one who walks the


---------50:46----------

---------59:49----------

go ahead no no it's cool


---------60:02----------
I just I don't want to come off as


---------60:03----------
though like I'm in pain or victim or any


---------60:06----------
of that [ __ ] I just got it you know like


---------60:08----------
it's bad like I can't do that what keeps


---------60:11----------
you from doing that it's not good I've


---------60:17----------
been here I just I feel uncomfortable


---------60:19----------
with like I get ridiculed or like it's


---------60:22----------
it's just I've it's just not good okay


---------60:25----------
you're so Mitch a couple of things to


---------60:28----------
just think about okay so the first is


---------60:31----------
that if you want to have a conversation


---------60:32----------
off of stream I think I'm open to that


---------60:35----------
so you just let me know so think about


---------60:37----------
that okay okay you know it's it's


---------60:39----------
totally fine I just I feel like I'm


---------60:42----------
being opened up and that's good it feels


---------60:45----------
good it really feels like I'm like free


---------60:46----------
bad negative energy but at the same time


---------60:49----------
like I just I've been very much so like


---------60:52----------
[ __ ] on in the past for like doing so


---------60:54----------
you know like I've had I've been to very


---------60:58----------
negative experiences in in sharing my


---------61:01----------
sadness absence yeah I'm with you so I


---------61:05----------
think that let's let's move


---------61:10----------
yeah you good you got that way why are


---------61:14----------
the dogs in here


---------61:20----------
that's no I think that's actually


---------61:22----------
exactly what you need


---------61:30----------
I think they sense something yeah the


---------61:34----------
dogs are just rolling around


---------61:35----------
I appreciate you more than you know and


---------61:39----------
this has nothing to do with you like


---------61:40----------
it's not like I feel so this is very


---------61:42----------
good I just I just don't want to put


---------61:44----------
myself in a situation where I'm gonna be


---------61:47----------
perfectly opened up to be like attacked


---------61:50----------
you know yep yeah so I think if that's


---------61:52----------
been your experience let's respect that


---------61:55----------
let's respect those boundaries I think


---------61:57----------
Mitch I'm gonna help you pull out of


---------61:59----------
this okay okay you want to pull out of


---------62:04----------
this whatever you whatever whatever you


---------62:08----------
think is correct


---------62:09----------
I'm I'm okay I'm just letting you know


---------62:10----------
like I just had I just overwhelming a


---------62:13----------
lot a lot of things like hitting me at


---------62:14----------
once and it's yeah that's all you know I


---------62:16----------
got I'd like I'd like to explain to you


---------62:19----------
intellectually what's going on within


---------62:21----------
you right now what do you think about


---------62:22----------
that I would I would like to yeah okay


---------62:26----------
so this is gonna have the added benefit


---------62:28----------
of as we engage our intellectual mind


---------62:30----------
your feelings hopefully will calm down a


---------62:32----------
little bit okay so Mitch this [ __ ] is


---------62:35----------
right beneath the surface this is a


---------62:36----------
high-pressure situation does that make


---------62:39----------
sense like all we have to do is calm


---------62:41----------
your mind a little bit and like all we


---------62:44----------
have to do is like like you know in this


---------62:46----------
is kind of like you know poking a hole


---------62:49----------
in a dam and then there's so much water


---------62:51----------
that like a little bit comes out like


---------62:53----------
all we're trying to do is approach in a


---------62:54----------
tiny tiny hole and instead of just like


---------62:56----------
one little trickle of water coming out


---------62:58----------
there's so much pressure back there that


---------63:00----------
all of these feelings are coming out


---------63:03----------
Yeah right all we have to do so


---------63:05----------
understand this when we start to


---------63:06----------
meditate which by the way you're gifted


---------63:08----------
at when we start to meditate well you're


---------63:12----------
gifted at you're good at it when we


---------63:14----------
start to meditate what happens is our


---------63:16----------
mind becomes empty okay is our mind


---------63:19----------
becomes empty it becomes somewhat of a


---------63:21----------
vacuum and whatever pressure is built up


---------63:24----------
within us starts to fill that vacuum of


---------63:27----------
the mind so there are some ways that I


---------63:30----------
can trigger emotion in you by asking


---------63:32----------
certain questions right so I can


---------63:33----------
pointedly ask you about your mom and


---------63:35----------
that can trigger emotion but even


---------63:37----------
talking about your mom the emotion is


---------63:39----------
pretty manageable stay with me listen


---------63:41----------
listen you with me yeah


---------63:44----------
stay with the intellectual okay yeah I'm


---------63:48----------
trying to I'm trying hard my emotions is


---------63:50----------
poor and man I'm trying okay do you


---------63:53----------
actually so then let me ask you do you


---------63:54----------
think we should just sit with those


---------63:55----------
emotions for a little bit or would you


---------63:57----------
like me to try to kind of put it put a


---------64:00----------
band-aid I was enjoying you yeah I was


---------64:02----------
enjoying the band-aid okay good


---------64:03----------
so let's continue with the painting so I


---------64:05----------
think this is just there's just a pile


---------64:07----------
of emotions that's down there and it


---------64:09----------
doesn't take a whole lot of emptiness to


---------64:12----------
let those emotions out so oftentimes


---------64:15----------
people who meditate for like extended


---------64:17----------
period like you know once you get good


---------64:18----------
at meditation people have these kinds of


---------64:21----------
like emotional breakthroughs where like


---------64:24----------
something deep that's buried within them


---------64:26----------
like kind of comes out and the deeper


---------64:29----------
it's buried the better you have to get


---------64:31----------
at meditation the more you have to empty


---------64:33----------
your mind in order to let that out does


---------64:35----------
that make sense


---------64:36----------
yeah it does in your case either you're


---------64:39----------
really really good at meditating which I


---------64:41----------
do believe you're gifted in or it's not


---------64:44----------
buried very deep does that make sense it


---------64:48----------
does make sense yes so I am yeah so


---------64:53----------
buddy like I just don't think like like


---------64:55----------
I'm gonna just say to simply you see how


---------64:59----------
much emotion is in there you see all of


---------65:01----------
the stuff that's in there the misery the


---------65:02----------
sadness the anger the aloneness all that


---------65:05----------
crap is in there there is no way like


---------65:07----------
what you longed for is peace there is no


---------65:10----------
way you can attain peace while that is


---------65:12----------
there


---------65:14----------
yeah the good news so what happens if


---------65:19----------
you you cut yourself Mitch what happens


---------65:21----------
to the wound heals overtime how does it


---------65:26----------
know to do that well I'd say white blood


---------65:30----------
cells going to the area and get very


---------65:32----------
present and started working their magic


---------65:34----------
and yeah so the cool thing about the


---------65:38----------
human body is that wounds heal over time


---------65:40----------
that's just how we work it's [ __ ]


---------65:42----------
amazing all we have to do though is let


---------65:45----------
them right so in your case you've done


---------65:48----------
such a good job at building up walls


---------65:50----------
around this stuff where it's like you're


---------65:52----------
not letting your mental white blood


---------65:54----------
cells like get to the wound and start


---------65:56----------
the process of healing it whether you


---------65:58----------
believe it or not like so you felt an


---------66:00----------
overwhelming amount of emotion and then


---------66:02----------
you described as feeling good and bite


---------66:06----------
you


---------66:08----------
it's kind of weird like so that's


---------66:09----------
actually the healing it's like


---------66:13----------
unfortunately healing doesn't look like


---------66:15----------
what it looks like and Wow


---------66:16----------
yeah it doesn't which is just green


---------66:19----------
numbers and then your health bar goes up


---------66:21----------
yeah there's even some manna biscuits


---------66:23----------
new yeah yeah unfortunately that's not


---------66:26----------
how it works I wish it was man yeah me


---------66:29----------
too man


---------66:30----------
I feel like emotional healing is so


---------66:31----------
difficult and tricky and hard to


---------66:33----------
understand absolutely man absolutely


---------66:36----------
it's so hard and and and but I I think


---------66:41----------
if you feel a little bit lighter you


---------66:43----------
know you talked about feeling heavy in


---------66:44----------
your head how does your head feel now a


---------66:47----------
little better I just know that I very


---------66:50----------
much so suppressed like that could have


---------66:51----------
been a full-blown like yeah like I felt


---------66:54----------
so heavy like so many things wanted to


---------66:58----------
express themselves and I just don't I


---------67:00----------
don't want to feel those right now so I


---------67:03----------
know that like yeah yeah so this is what


---------67:05----------
I hate about twitch so normally what I


---------67:08----------
like about doing this kind of work so I


---------67:09----------
do this kind of work with people in my


---------67:11----------
office and then what we tend to do is


---------67:13----------
they they can't because it's also


---------67:15----------
private and then what I'll do is I'll


---------67:17----------
hug them so generally speaking is a


---------67:20----------
psychiatrist it's a bad idea to touch


---------67:22----------
your patients because people say you


---------67:24----------
shouldn't touch your patients some time


---------67:25----------
ago I couldn't help myself and I just


---------67:27----------
started hugging people like I hugged my


---------67:29----------
patients because I feel like that's


---------67:31----------
really what like what you need what you


---------67:33----------
really need in that moment and this is


---------67:34----------
what I hate about twitch I was talking


---------67:36----------
about this at the beginning of the


---------67:36----------
stream that twitch feels fundamentally


---------67:38----------
unsatisfying to me because what you need


---------67:40----------
in that moment is to be held yeah and


---------67:43----------
the dog sensed it then Tillich's they


---------67:49----------
really did and and what you really need


---------67:52----------
in those moments is to let that out and


---------67:54----------
to be held and to not be alone which


---------67:56----------
like I know that twitch chat is with us


---------67:57----------
and you're not truly alone but like


---------67:59----------
physically and like oxytocin levels and


---------68:02----------
stuff like that like you just need to be


---------68:03----------
not alone yeah is it weird that like


---------68:06----------
twitch to me feels like my my only


---------68:09----------
family it feels like my only thing that


---------68:11----------
like I can truly just talk to and just


---------68:13----------
like vent and whatever no I don't think


---------68:16----------
it is I think it was weird until I


---------68:19----------
actually started looking at it for what


---------68:21----------
it


---------68:21----------
was instead of judging it from like


---------68:23----------
boomer perceptions yeah so like you know


---------68:27----------
the boomer generation we fundamentally


---------68:29----------
believed that human connection cannot be


---------68:32----------
attained over the Internet


---------68:33----------
like there was a time where like online


---------68:35----------
dating was not the norm it was what the


---------68:37----------
rejects did and it was like shameful


---------68:40----------
that like you met your your partner


---------68:42----------
online like cuz you couldn't find


---------68:43----------
someone in real life so you had to like


---------68:45----------
to be online dating where the weirdos


---------68:46----------
happen but now like online dating is the


---------68:49----------
norm and there are some ways I think I


---------68:51----------
you know you say this is the really this


---------68:54----------
is what pisses me off if I could if I


---------68:56----------
could take one thought out of your mind


---------68:57----------
it would be the one where I'm afraid to


---------68:59----------
do this because people are gonna attack


---------69:01----------
me I believe I have a very so I think


---------69:06----------
your history with uh like I with like


---------69:10----------
showing emotion with which I guess that


---------69:11----------
makes sense yeah so so I understand why


---------69:14----------
you feel that way and I think that that


---------69:16----------
is an appropriate and logical feeling


---------69:18----------
and I also think that twitches your


---------69:20----------
family and I think that's what's [ __ ]


---------69:22----------
beautiful about it is that like like


---------69:25----------
what I have seen is like you know I mean


---------69:27----------
I you know I'm I watched which I


---------69:29----------
participate in twitch I enjoy myself a


---------69:32----------
dank meme from meme from time to time


---------69:34----------
tink means you know just like just


---------69:36----------
really dank it like cut the kind of


---------69:38----------
stuff that you who you missed out in the


---------69:40----------
good times man I'm telling you


---------69:42----------
those were the dankest memes no dude


---------69:46----------
watch it which then of course man no


---------69:49----------
you're a dank meme err in the back of


---------69:50----------
the day


---------69:51----------
dude the dankest like so look man I was


---------69:53----------
around I was around I was around when


---------69:56----------
memes were born okay


---------69:57----------
oh shoot true boom like true boomer like


---------70:00----------
all your base are belong to us like


---------70:02----------
people don't even know what that means


---------70:03----------
anymore they don't understand this right


---------70:07----------
yeah like yeah ah you you know yet that


---------70:11----------
no I don't know what that is


---------70:13----------
see this is like you [ __ ] with Z


---------70:17----------
noobs like you guys don't know like like


---------70:23----------
man so like this is like back when memes


---------70:25----------
were born man like buffle axe you guys


---------70:29----------
know what I'm talking about


---------70:30----------
come on twitch you guys know about


---------70:34----------
okay so we're a little bit over our head


---------70:36----------
or out of our league here yeah so one


---------70:38----------
day we're gonna have to do dr. K does


---------70:40----------
the history of memes and I'm going to


---------70:41----------
show you guys the sweetest dankest most


---------70:43----------
original memes oh well anyway so but I


---------70:49----------
was surrounding the good old days and I


---------70:51----------
think it's not weird right so Mitch what


---------70:53----------
I want you to understand is that twitch


---------70:55----------
can be your family and and that's why I


---------70:58----------
like you know I on the one hand you're


---------70:59----------
afraid of what they're gonna do to you


---------71:00----------
because in the past they have hurt you


---------71:02----------
but just like a normal family sometimes


---------71:05----------
they do things that hurt you and


---------71:06----------
sometimes they do things that make you


---------71:07----------
feel loved mm-hmm that's all it was a


---------71:11----------
lot easier that's for sure yeah but it's


---------71:15----------
it's not real though you know like I


---------71:17----------
need to find like things that actually


---------71:18----------
ground me that aren't I don't know I I


---------71:21----------
wouldn't say that it's not real I just


---------71:23----------
don't think that it's enough like so


---------71:26----------
sorry I I think that the what the vibes


---------71:29----------
that I feel over the Internet are


---------71:30----------
actually genuine but it's just not


---------71:32----------
enough oh yeah no I feel it for sure


---------71:35----------
like I told you I have like a weird


---------71:37----------
empathetic side of myself and like when


---------71:39----------
I can truly feel that like that like


---------71:43----------
love power from the internet it like


---------71:45----------
shoots me to like being a normal person


---------71:47----------
for like a couple weeks it's weird


---------71:49----------
okay it's really weird all right okay


---------72:00----------
so Mitch so practically do you meditate


---------72:06----------
do I


---------72:07----------
I do sometimes yes I don't practice it


---------72:10----------
all the time but like there haven't it


---------72:13----------
depends on the phase I'm in in my life


---------72:14----------
you know but I definitely have gone


---------72:16----------
years where I meditate at least once or


---------72:21----------
twice a week so I'm a little bit


---------72:23----------
honestly I'm a little bit lost as to how


---------72:26----------
to advise you so generally speaking what


---------72:29----------
I so I think what you did today with


---------72:31----------
that little bit of meditation was


---------72:32----------
actually really good for you and I think


---------72:33----------
you need to keep doing it I think the


---------72:36----------
concern that I have is that I'm not sure


---------72:38----------
that you have the enough of a guardrail


---------72:41----------
around you to keep from like really that


---------72:43----------
dam bursting


---------72:45----------
so yeah but is the dam bursting you're


---------72:47----------
like very bad


---------72:48----------
well that's spillover in two days and


---------72:50----------
weeks or I should I hope not but the


---------72:52----------
short answer is I don't know in your


---------72:54----------
case right so I think there's a lot of


---------72:56----------
emotion that's right underneath the


---------72:58----------
surface and so my generally what I'll


---------73:01----------
tell people is I'll tell them to like


---------73:03----------
practice a certain kind of meditation or


---------73:05----------
something like that in your case


---------73:06----------
unfortunately I just don't know if


---------73:08----------
that's like really like safer handleable


---------73:11----------
right now I would say that if you're


---------73:14----------
interested in trying again you should


---------73:16----------
think about finding another therapist


---------73:18----------
because you only went once right yeah I


---------73:20----------
went to a therapist once and I didn't


---------73:22----------
really get very far with them either


---------73:23----------
yeah so I would really consider it like


---------73:26----------
add that to your list of you know


---------73:28----------
blueberries and other things like


---------73:30----------
smoothies and things that you do to take


---------73:31----------
care of yourself because I think you're


---------73:33----------
in a slightly different place now and


---------73:34----------
you may be able to get more out of it


---------73:36----------
just a thought the other thing is I


---------73:40----------
think you feel this stuff deeply in your


---------73:42----------
body do you exercise uh very uh


---------73:49----------
inconsistently but do you go to do you


---------73:52----------
have access to a yoga class I've never


---------73:55----------
done yoga but I do stretch from time to


---------73:57----------
time I see you got it okay done you got


---------74:00----------
to go to yoga I do massages and like


---------74:03----------
deep tissue stuff just like nah yoga


---------74:06----------
never Taichi no never no touchy


---------74:09----------
okay so you got a do yoga or Tai Chi one


---------74:11----------
of those two okay I think that's like


---------74:14----------
where you get super hot and then they


---------74:16----------
like stretch we're hot it's not about


---------74:18----------
stretching at all it's also not about


---------74:20----------
heat it is about mind body so the goal


---------74:24----------
of yoga is not about stretching it's


---------74:26----------
about to put yourself in a physical


---------74:30----------
posture in which you're stable and also


---------74:32----------
brings the attention of the mind to the


---------74:34----------
present that's the goal of yoga so it's


---------74:37----------
a meta to meditative experience absolute


---------74:41----------
so than like a physical one absolutely


---------74:43----------
so it is a mind-body practice so it's


---------74:45----------
was really that sounds like it could be


---------74:48----------
really good for healing like stuff like


---------74:50----------
this it is really good for healing am i


---------74:53----------
cry in front of all the Q yoga girls and


---------74:55----------
stuff like I don't really want to


---------74:56----------
no you won't do that you may do that at


---------74:58----------
the end but that's exactly what we want


---------75:01----------
right and if you crying for the key yoga


---------75:03----------
girls you need to learn how to let


---------75:05----------
yourself be David instead of Mitch in


---------75:07----------
front of the cute yoga girls it's hard I


---------75:10----------
swear when you have an audience it's


---------75:11----------
almost like you just immediately want to


---------75:13----------
like feel like good because you know


---------75:14----------
it's like it's like yes I'm professional


---------75:16----------
or whatever it something's bad there's a


---------75:18----------
bad snake but to it that's what we gotta


---------75:20----------
[ __ ] fix in you man like I know it's


---------75:24----------
hard but like yeah so go and instead of


---------75:26----------
being watched by thousands of people on


---------75:28----------
the internet it's just gonna be half a


---------75:29----------
dozen cute girls and guys it's like you


---------75:35----------
prefer yeah so so just give it a shot


---------75:38----------
and then the next time we talk like


---------75:40----------
please do it at least once or ideally


---------75:42----------
three times so that you can tell me or


---------75:44----------
do you want me to do yoga three times in


---------75:48----------
the next couple weeks


---------75:49----------
yeah like ideally in the next week and


---------75:51----------
then you let me know you know if if part


---------75:55----------
of the audience makes this harder for


---------75:57----------
you then you let me know and then we can


---------75:59----------
also talk you know uh you know not on


---------76:02----------
stream but if if you know but I I think


---------76:05----------
it's gonna be good for you as I


---------76:07----------
appreciate that I well if you if you if


---------76:12----------
we could do both like on stream and off


---------76:14----------
stream because there are things that are


---------76:15----------
very deep and like would almost like


---------76:20----------
come off as bias for sure on stream but


---------76:22----------
I would have to talk to you about it


---------76:23----------
sense yeah yeah so we can we can we can


---------76:26----------
set up a you know some time but I think


---------76:28----------
in the short term here's why I think


---------76:30----------
yoga is better for you so like when we


---------76:32----------
do meditation it's a purely mental


---------76:34----------
practice so all of the emotions come out


---------76:37----------
Yoga is gonna give you a chance to let


---------76:39----------
some of that stuff out like physically


---------76:41----------
without it sort of like mentally rushing


---------76:43----------
in and try it a couple of times and then


---------76:46----------
when we check in next you can just tell


---------76:48----------
me how it's going whether you like it or


---------76:49----------
you don't like it and I can try to give


---------76:50----------
you some other suggestions in terms of


---------76:52----------
guidance I assumed that I will like it


---------76:55----------
so I think you're gonna like it I do


---------76:56----------
like I like anything that's like like I


---------76:59----------
love like things like that like saunas


---------77:01----------
and all the kind of stuff it's good free


---------77:03----------
yeah


---------77:04----------
and who knows maybe you'll make an


---------77:07----------
authentic human connection but don't


---------77:10----------
expect Asians it's so weird man like I'm


---------77:12----------
so shy and like unwilling to talk to


---------77:16----------
people off stream but then as soon as


---------77:18----------
the cameras on I'm just like talking to


---------77:21----------
everyone right like it's just yeah it's


---------77:23----------
so weird like yeah you should see me off


---------77:26----------
stream and I roll around like a


---------77:28----------
depressed person I don't talk to anyone


---------77:29----------
like I'm so different it's so strange I


---------77:32----------
believe yeah literally so strange yeah


---------77:36----------
that's because twitch is a wonderful


---------77:37----------
twitch makes people feel comfortable


---------77:40----------
right that's what's so beautiful about


---------77:43----------
like twitch in this community like I


---------77:45----------
know that okay and stuff like that but I


---------77:47----------
think there's something about you know


---------77:49----------
being a shy person who has trouble


---------77:50----------
talking to people and like but like


---------77:52----------
you're one of us like it's about us yeah


---------77:55----------
it's us right it's not about the normies


---------78:00----------
we just always been that way man twitch


---------78:03----------
has always been this like it's like


---------78:05----------
amazing community in this corner of the


---------78:07----------
internet this is like such like a like a


---------78:09----------
tight-knit community you know yeah it's


---------78:11----------
not like YouTube or any other or like


---------78:13----------
platformers where it's just seems so


---------78:15----------
like spread out and like just not as


---------78:19----------
like me it's a not a family you know


---------78:23----------
like twitch feels like it's like they're


---------78:25----------
the boys they're like half these guys


---------78:26----------
have been riding with me since like 2011


---------78:29----------
you know what I mean like they've been


---------78:30----------
watching and like playing the same [ __ ]


---------78:33----------
like they it's just it's truly amazing


---------78:34----------
like what has actually happened if you


---------78:36----------
look at it like that you know yeah yeah


---------78:39----------
which is cool yes I I really really


---------78:42----------
respect those people man like any of you


---------78:44----------
guys that have been like oh geez


---------78:45----------
and like I've seen the ups and downs and


---------78:48----------
all that stuff like I appreciate you


---------78:49----------
guys man and I could truly you mean a


---------78:52----------
lot to me man


---------78:53----------
and like without you guys I probably


---------78:54----------
wouldn't I'd be [ __ ] let's just say


---------78:56----------
that I wouldn't be I wouldn't have had


---------78:59----------
any outlet for all my selfish


---------79:01----------
one last thing I'll leave you with okay


---------79:03----------
so this is gotta mom yeah so in my mocha


---------79:06----------
so I think that life has dealt you a


---------79:08----------
very crappy hand but you've got a couple


---------79:10----------
of aces in there


---------79:11----------
you are alive at the right time right


---------79:13----------
like this didn't happened to you like 30


---------79:15----------
years ago before there was twitch and


---------79:18----------
Wow and before you could be a good mage


---------79:20----------
like we are alive today yeah like we're


---------79:25----------
being a good mage involved Dungeons &


---------79:27----------
Dragons which is amazing and I love but


---------79:28----------
also it's like you know so like like I I


---------79:31----------
think that you know it's my firm belief


---------79:32----------
and this may be a belief that's out of


---------79:35----------
fear that life gives us challenges and


---------79:37----------
sometimes life gives us a lot of like


---------79:39----------
shitty stuff but life also gives us the


---------79:41----------
capacity like gives us the tools to do


---------79:43----------
what we need to to like overcome the


---------79:46----------
challenges that we face so sure you you


---------79:49----------
can feel alone because of your brother


---------79:51----------
and your mom and your dad and stuff like


---------79:52----------
that and also you happen to be alive at


---------79:56----------
a time where they're like thousands of


---------79:57----------
people who can be your virtual family


---------79:59----------
and do genuinely care about you yeah and


---------80:02----------
and so it's kind of like weird and so


---------80:04----------
it's our job to sort of you know not


---------80:06----------
love I mean we can be upset about oh you


---------80:08----------
know it's unfortunate if this happened


---------80:10----------
absolutely you're allowed to be upset


---------80:11----------
and grief and stuff like that but like


---------80:13----------
like it's not about black and white


---------80:15----------
right it's not that you're [ __ ] or


---------80:17----------
that you're lucky it's that both of


---------80:19----------
those things are true at the same time


---------80:20----------
mm-hmm


---------80:21----------
that there's David and there's Mitch and


---------80:23----------
Mitch is like this glorious guy who's


---------80:25----------
like you know doing this stuff on on


---------80:27----------
Twitch and then there's David who's kind


---------80:29----------
of like you know when he shows up like


---------80:31----------
twitch doesn't like it and stuff like


---------80:32----------
that it's about putting it all together


---------80:33----------
it's about like being a whole person and


---------80:36----------
understanding there are parts of your


---------80:38----------
life that suck and there are things


---------80:39----------
about your life that you're really


---------80:40----------
grateful for and it's been really


---------80:43----------
awesome to hear you express genuine


---------80:45----------
appreciation for the person that you are


---------80:47----------
in your circumstances and also to beas


---------80:49----------
likes to see you be so at the same time


---------80:52----------
like broken because of like how messed


---------80:55----------
up your life is and how alone you are


---------80:56----------
that you can be both of those things at


---------80:59----------
the same time and that's really what


---------81:00----------
life is and the goal of becoming a monk


---------81:03----------
is to be able to sit with both of those


---------81:06----------
things that's where peace comes from


---------81:08----------
it's not the sunlight it's not the


---------81:11----------
shadow it's Twilight


---------81:14----------
right by Stephenie Meyer and that's what


---------81:23----------
I want to help you do right it's it's to


---------81:24----------
face the bad and accept the good like


---------81:27----------
both of them it's not either/or it's not


---------81:28----------
being perfect it's not about being


---------81:30----------
successful it's about the highs and the


---------81:31----------
lows that's what life is


---------81:33----------
mm-hmm and that's the journey that like


---------81:36----------
everyone wants to see because that's the


---------81:38----------
journey that they can relate to


---------81:41----------
good breath good sigh thoughts questions


---------81:47----------
no I I really think talking to you is a


---------81:50----------
next-level experience for me I've never


---------81:52----------
actually had any type of therapy that's


---------81:55----------
done really anything for me


---------81:56----------
and it's very strange to give someone


---------82:00----------
else full control over like your


---------82:03----------
emotions like I feel like you could just


---------82:05----------
like give me like a weird pressure point


---------82:09----------
and just drop me and render me useless


---------82:11----------
for a week like I don't know yeah so the


---------82:14----------
reason this works really well is because


---------82:16----------
you know display it's not therapy


---------82:18----------
okay and secondly one of my teachers


---------82:21----------
once told me that I should use my power


---------82:23----------
for good and not evil yeah well you make


---------82:26----------
me realize things that I kind of already


---------82:29----------
knew but it's like you just like make it


---------82:30----------
so right there in my face I have to like


---------82:32----------
see it you know yeah yeah that's what


---------82:35----------
I'm here for and I also had one more


---------82:37----------
question yeah before we go try soive how


---------82:43----------
what is the best way of dealing with


---------82:45----------
like negativity and like people that are


---------82:47----------
just negative right


---------82:48----------
like I really struggle with this because


---------82:50----------
I always have this like weird righteous


---------82:53----------
way of like wanting like the truth or


---------82:55----------
like you know karma or whatever you want


---------82:57----------
to call it right like I get carried up


---------82:59----------
in these dumb little mind games with


---------83:02----------
like irrelevant situations and I'm


---------83:03----------
wondering how you would go about that


---------83:05----------
yeah so I've got kind of a weird you


---------83:08----------
know nature analogy because we're


---------83:10----------
talking about meditation and stuff so


---------83:12----------
what I'm what I'm envisioning is a


---------83:15----------
gigantic wave or a wave that's hitting


---------83:19----------
you right that's their negativity you're


---------83:22----------
there's kind of there's a kind of like


---------83:23----------
swept up Ness does that make sense to


---------83:26----------
what you're describing


---------83:27----------
so how do you withstand a wave you just


---------83:32----------
dive through it you can dive through it


---------83:34----------
absolutely that's not what I was


---------83:36----------
thinking but that does work that's what


---------83:38----------
I do yeah so I think it in my case like


---------83:42----------
I just have my feet on the ground just


---------83:45----------
let it hit you yeah absolutely right so


---------83:47----------
dive through it let it pass through you


---------83:49----------
let it let it get past you like the


---------83:51----------
important thing is to be stable within


---------83:52----------
yourself so I think one thing is that if


---------83:55----------
you engage with them it doesn't work


---------83:58----------
well right that's like trying to push


---------84:01----------
the wave away yeah I have this weird


---------84:04----------
thing where I just get so like I want to


---------84:06----------
like engage and I want to like I want to


---------84:08----------
like show them that they're wrong you


---------84:09----------
know yes it's so toxic so that's that's


---------84:14----------
ego right so you want to convince them


---------84:16----------
that they're wrong what you need to do


---------84:18----------
is dive through it yeah so you need to


---------84:21----------
move past them not like don't try to


---------84:23----------
stop the wave don't try to fight the way


---------84:25----------
because that doesn't work hmm


---------84:27----------
the other way to think about it is like


---------84:29----------
you know how do you get like if I have a


---------84:31----------
bucket of water or like let's say I have


---------84:34----------
like a bathtub like how do I get the


---------84:35----------
water to be still and calm down if it's


---------84:39----------
like display


---------84:41----------
like splish-splash late times absolutely


---------84:44----------
right so the more that you try to like


---------84:45----------
if I try to force all the waves down if


---------84:48----------
I like see a wave I'm like no you stay


---------84:50----------
still this water needs to say so this


---------84:51----------
water needs to say and that's what you


---------84:53----------
do you engage with them hmm


---------84:55----------
and then it's like trying to force water


---------84:57----------
to be still yes did your analogies are


---------85:00----------
always spot on it I'll understand yeah


---------85:03----------
so so what you let them do is let it


---------85:05----------
wash over you so like understand that if


---------85:08----------
you want to show them that something if


---------85:10----------
you want to show them ah that's coming


---------85:13----------
from you it's not actually coming from


---------85:15----------
them they're hitting a chord with you


---------85:17----------
that you don't want to be true mm-hmm


---------85:21----------
right so like some people have


---------85:22----------
criticized me and I think the best way


---------85:24----------
to handle criticism is to accept it


---------85:26----------
people like yeah I'm cool with criticism


---------85:29----------
I get more so annoyed with like certain


---------85:31----------
people that have just like super like I


---------85:35----------
could get into it so that's a lot but I


---------85:37----------
have this weird thing that like attracts


---------85:39----------
me to like negativity and like it's like


---------85:42----------
it's like a continuing theme in my life


---------85:44----------
so at Canter's yeah so I mean I'd say as


---------85:47----------
best as you can dive through it right so


---------85:49----------
let it wash over you like those people


---------85:51----------
are negative so take stock and kind of


---------85:54----------
who you are and like understand that you


---------85:56----------
can't convince someone so like Mitch you


---------86:00----------
know so you were earlier saying how what


---------86:02----------
I do is special and helpful right yeah


---------86:04----------
am I trying to convince you of anything


---------86:06----------
no I don't think so I think you're just


---------86:10----------
really learning yeah but how are you


---------86:14----------
learning without me convincing you of


---------86:15----------
anything cuz you're unlocking the


---------86:19----------
knowledge that's already there okay so I


---------86:23----------
think that's kind of the approach that


---------86:24----------
you've got to take for that right


---------86:26----------
whether they want to see what is there


---------86:29----------
is up to them you can help them along


---------86:32----------
but if they're in a place where they


---------86:34----------
don't want to see it you've got to like


---------86:35----------
let that move past you let them wash


---------86:37----------
over you


---------86:38----------
hmm I understand that trolls are gonna


---------86:41----------
be trolls like that's what like you know


---------86:45----------
you can't like that's what's gonna


---------86:46----------
happen but you can't change a trolls


---------86:49----------
mind like they have to want to learn


---------86:51----------
and overtime like the people that you


---------86:53----------
can engage with I think it's about ego


---------86:55----------
and stuff like that I think this is


---------86:56----------
actually worth like kind of a full


---------86:58----------
conversation so if we know I would love


---------87:01----------
to dive into this yeah because so I


---------87:03----------
think they'd be dealing with negativity


---------87:04----------
from other people and sort of this idea


---------87:06----------
that you want to show them and teach


---------87:08----------
them like how it is and like oh yeah


---------87:10----------
like yeah I have this weird like


---------87:13----------
self-righteous like this thing in me


---------87:15----------
where I'm just like I have to prove them


---------87:16----------
wrong you know yeah I know I'm right I


---------87:19----------
know I'm right and like yeah I just and


---------87:21----------
I just get so [ __ ] carried away with


---------87:23----------
that I ended up being losing myself in


---------87:25----------
those kind of situations as well you


---------87:26----------
know yeah it's it's a really common


---------87:28----------
problem especially like I don't know if


---------87:30----------
you've used this thing called the


---------87:31----------
internet but it's full of people that


---------87:32----------
self-righteous and right and want to


---------87:34----------
show other people how they're wrong yeah


---------87:36----------
I mean it's you know I check out the


---------87:40----------
internet because there are people who


---------87:42----------
are full of that thing there mmm-hmm


---------87:44----------
there there's like they're these so that


---------87:47----------
the Internet has all these different


---------87:48----------
websites but they're basically all the


---------87:50----------
same so like there's this website called


---------87:52----------
YouTube that has videos and people argue


---------87:54----------
with each other about who's right and


---------87:56----------
then there's this website called reddit


---------87:58----------
where they post something so they post a


---------88:01----------
link and then like right beneath it they


---------88:02----------
argue about who's right and and they're


---------88:06----------
just basically lots of these things


---------88:07----------
called websites and they're all about


---------88:09----------
arguing you even have like reviews of


---------88:11----------
like restaurants where they argue with


---------88:13----------
each other about whether the food is


---------88:15----------
good or the food is bad and so it's it's


---------88:18----------
I mean there's a whole you know billions


---------88:20----------
of people out there who are just like


---------88:22----------
you and trying to teach everyone that


---------88:24----------
they're wrong and we're self-righteous


---------88:28----------
so you know we could talk about it next


---------88:30----------
time but I think it it you know in short


---------88:33----------
as best as you can try to implement that


---------88:35----------
imagery of just like dive through it


---------88:37----------
yeah like the monk wouldn't care right


---------88:40----------
like the monk would just like let it


---------88:41----------
happen not get on developed in like my


---------88:45----------
own ego of like trying to like prove


---------88:46----------
someone wrong or whatever it doesn't


---------88:48----------
matter in the end of the day right like


---------88:49----------
so I'll leave you with one last thought


---------88:52----------
okay so yeah when you can when you


---------88:55----------
should convince someone is when you were


---------88:57----------
righteous but you are not talking about


---------88:58----------
being righteous you were talking about


---------89:00----------
being self-righteous


---------89:02----------
so that's ego okay so like what is


---------89:05----------
righteous that's when you're completely


---------89:07----------
unbiased looking at something right


---------89:08----------
that's what it's not about you it's


---------89:11----------
about them or about it it's about


---------89:13----------
service


---------89:14----------
it's about righteousness to do what is


---------89:16----------
right yes but I think what you are


---------89:19----------
talking about use the right word because


---------89:20----------
I think you're yourself right just


---------89:22----------
that's about ego this is so should you


---------89:25----------
try to convince other people of things


---------89:27----------
absolutely I mean that I spend a lot of


---------89:28----------
my time doing that but I do so when when


---------89:31----------
I actually am when my cause is just and


---------89:33----------
it's not about me it's about that okay


---------89:36----------
right so if you're like oh yeah just


---------89:40----------
like okay that makes sense for sure so


---------89:42----------
like what if you're like so certain like


---------89:45----------
you can teach people like you can teach


---------89:46----------
someone like are you like no you're


---------89:48----------
right right like you're like so sure of


---------89:49----------
it


---------89:50----------
that's still self righteous right no not


---------89:53----------
necessarily so I think the issue is


---------89:55----------
about like what's important to you are


---------89:57----------
you serving a cause are you trying to


---------90:01----------
prove them wrong and prove you right a


---------90:04----------
little bit of both yeah so I think that


---------90:08----------
needs to be separated because I do think


---------90:10----------
that like you know sometimes I'll I mean


---------90:12----------
sometimes I'll take a hard line with


---------90:15----------
people mm-hmm and you know I tend to be


---------90:19----------
nice on stream and usually I'm a nice


---------90:21----------
guy but sometimes if my blood gets up


---------90:24----------
and I think that there's injustice being


---------90:26----------
done I will use my power to destroy


---------90:29----------
others that's kind of how I feel yeah


---------90:35----------
and I think that that's okay okay


---------90:39----------
I you know I I think it's hard so you


---------90:43----------
have to have your ego in check and in


---------90:45----------
your case I don't think yours is very


---------90:46----------
healthy right now so yeah yeah for sure


---------90:50----------
all right well thank you dr. kay okay


---------90:52----------
she am in you're very welcome Mitch


---------90:54----------
strong word today I'm yeah definitely


---------90:57----------
definitely you are yeah definitely again


---------91:00----------
some work with whatever the hell is


---------91:02----------
going on good but I were to take care of


---------91:05----------
I appreciate it I appreciate it have a


---------91:07----------
good one man you too


---------91:09----------
okay so that was fun I really enjoy


---------91:20----------
talking to Mitch yeah no I'm not gonna


---------91:29----------
know so this is the thing right so like


---------91:31----------
if you actually think about it like


---------91:32----------
seeing into people's emotions we just


---------91:35----------
got it I gotta clear the air here so


---------91:37----------
right so like seeing into people's


---------91:38----------
emotions and understanding who they are


---------91:40----------
is also like what's used by like super


---------91:42----------
super toxic narcissistic people like


---------91:44----------
when you get someone who can understand


---------91:46----------
things and is like narcissus and


---------91:47----------
predatory they like destroy people so


---------91:50----------
you know but sometimes I think if like


---------91:53----------
there's injustice being done in the


---------91:55----------
world like you should like you know you


---------91:59----------
should stand up and fight and do what


---------92:01----------
you want like to do what's right


---------92:04----------
and help other people okay so guys this


---------92:12----------
is fun what we're gonna do I just want


---------92:15----------
to thank everyone for coming on again


---------92:17----------
and watching Mitch I think you know I


---------92:24----------
hope some of that stuff was resonating


---------92:27----------
with y'all you know I think a lot of the


---------92:31----------
stuff that Mitch struggles with is


---------92:33----------
actually true for a lot of people right


---------92:34----------
so like we wall off our emotions so a


---------92:36----------
couple takeaways when we have hurt we


---------92:39----------
tend to wall it off and create like a


---------92:41----------
version of ourselves we create like this


---------92:44----------
character and we try to be that


---------92:46----------
character because being that character


---------92:48----------
is better than like being like the hurt


---------92:50----------
version but the goal is to actually take


---------92:52----------
those walls down and like let that hurt


---------92:54----------
out and process it so you can be free of


---------92:57----------
it


---------92:57----------
because the thing about walling off your


---------93:00----------
negative emotions is it's like you're


---------93:02----------
encumbered like you know like what you


---------93:04----------
guys know like in an RPG when I don't


---------93:06----------
know if this hasn't happen and Wow


---------93:08----------
because you're like capped by space but


---------93:11----------
you know some like RPGs will have


---------93:12----------
encumbrance so you can be like way down


---------93:14----------
and it gives you a movement penalty and


---------93:15----------
that's what walled-off emotions are like


---------93:17----------
it's like you're feeling like way down


---------93:19----------
and sure you can still play the game but


---------93:21----------
it's like kind of hard


---------93:22----------
yeah your your can't fast travel like


---------93:25----------
you're just gimped in some way right so


---------93:28----------
the goal is to actually be like a


---------93:29----------
complete person and a being a complete


---------93:32----------
person is about letting all that


---------93:33----------
negativity out and kind of dealing with


---------93:35----------
it and accepting it and then you'll kind


---------93:38----------
of feel better about yourself you'll be


---------93:40----------
more at peace like that's where peace


---------93:41----------
comes from and understand that peace is


---------93:43----------
different from fun so Mitch has done is


---------93:46----------
he's walled all that off and then like


---------93:48----------
in order to compensate for the negative


---------93:50----------
emotions he rides highs right like he's


---------93:53----------
like super super fun and clowny and all


---------93:55----------
that kind of stuff so he like has this


---------93:57----------
inflated positivity to kind of balance


---------94:00----------
out that like walled off negativity when


---------94:02----------
instead what you want is to like


---------94:03----------
actually have both of those kind of


---------94:04----------
things be there at the same time sex


---------94:07----------
sweet and savory and spicy
