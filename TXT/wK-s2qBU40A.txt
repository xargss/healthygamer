---------00:00----------
just a reminder that like we're going to


---------00:02----------
talk about dopamine detox today


---------00:03----------
a lot of the things that people struggle


---------00:05----------
with and when people have questions like


---------00:07----------
how do i build confidence how do i you


---------00:10----------
know


---------00:10----------
let go of past resentment how do i


---------00:13----------
better understand anxiety like how can i


---------00:15----------
develop like a meditation program to


---------00:17----------
help me with like


---------00:18----------
feelings of depression or inadequacy all


---------00:21----------
of those questions so what we actually


---------00:22----------
did is take like the most


---------00:24----------
prominent questions in our community and


---------00:26----------
actually package them together


---------00:28----------
in a really formal way and that's what


---------00:30----------
dr k's guides are


---------00:31----------
so if you guys have um you know


---------00:33----------
particular


---------00:34----------
issues where like you're watching stream


---------00:36----------
and one day you're like oh my god like


---------00:38----------
that's me i feel personally attacked sag


---------00:40----------
like oh what do i do about that that's


---------00:42----------
what the guides are there for i think


---------00:43----------
they really cover like 70


---------00:46----------
of the introductory questions that


---------00:47----------
people will have


---------00:49----------
um so you guys can you know check those


---------00:51----------
out they should be coming out in about


---------00:53----------
a month or two so what we're going to do


---------00:56----------
is we're just going to start


---------00:57----------
with googling dopamine detox


---------01:01----------
this is gonna explain part of the reason


---------01:02----------
why dopamine detox is tough so recently


---------01:04----------
i heard about this whole dopamine detox


---------01:06----------
idea


---------01:07----------
usually when i hear about these trends


---------01:09----------
or whatever i ignore them but this time


---------01:11----------
it was different not only did i become


---------01:14----------
more productive but i also quit smoking


---------01:16----------
wow


---------01:17----------
that's really impressive so what is a


---------01:19----------
dopamine detox


---------01:21----------
so like what is dopamine great so he


---------01:24----------
says that it is


---------01:26----------
a type of neurotransmitter okay


---------01:29----------
this shows a picture of it good detox is


---------01:32----------
a process where you move something toxic


---------01:34----------
or unhealthy out of your body


---------01:36----------
this is also called detoxification


---------01:40----------
this is where things get weird right


---------01:41----------
because in the dopamine detox are we


---------01:43----------
removing


---------01:44----------
dopamine from our body so however


---------01:47----------
dopamine what makes dopamine so bad is


---------01:48----------
that it


---------01:49----------
is is that your brain keeps looking for


---------01:51----------
it over what you actually want so this


---------01:54----------
is where we get into a problem


---------01:56----------
so we're going to dig into the


---------01:57----------
neuroscience here this is the statement


---------01:59----------
is untrue


---------02:00----------
so dopamine is what determines


---------02:03----------
what you want so if we look at like what


---------02:06----------
dopamine does in the brain it actually


---------02:08----------
determines your it the dopamine reward


---------02:12----------
circuitry


---------02:12----------
is a circuit of motivation and behavior


---------02:15----------
so like


---------02:15----------
when you want something that is because


---------02:17----------
of dopamine so what does a dopamine d


---------02:20----------
a dopamine detox removes almost all


---------02:22----------
dopamine from your body


---------02:24----------
for how for however you choose to do it


---------02:27----------
so this statement is so horribly


---------02:29----------
incorrect that it blows my mind


---------02:31----------
okay so this is like saying going on a


---------02:33----------
diet is removing


---------02:35----------
almost all calories from your body for


---------02:37----------
however long you do it


---------02:39----------
okay the goal of a dopamine detox and


---------02:42----------
this is a this is a really important


---------02:43----------
point which will illustrate down the


---------02:44----------
road


---------02:45----------
is not to remove dopamine at all we're


---------02:47----------
not trying to remove dopamine dopamine


---------02:48----------
is a neurotransmitter i don't know if


---------02:50----------
you guys know this but like


---------02:51----------
parkinson's disease is


---------02:55----------
the result of destruction of your


---------02:57----------
dopaminergic neurons


---------02:58----------
in a particular part of your brain and


---------03:02----------
so like if we removed all the dopamine


---------03:03----------
from


---------03:04----------
our body what we would end up with is


---------03:06----------
parkinson's disease


---------03:08----------
this is not true we do not want to


---------03:10----------
remove the dopamine levels


---------03:12----------
my point here is that people who are


---------03:15----------
spreading this information do not have


---------03:18----------
so this was like on the front page so i


---------03:20----------
granted i used


---------03:21----------
go i don't know exactly what would


---------03:22----------
happen if i use google probably be


---------03:23----------
influenced by my search history


---------03:26----------
so i use duckduckgo in in you know in


---------03:29----------
privacy mode


---------03:30----------
and so like the first thing that i want


---------03:32----------
y'all to understand about dopamine detox


---------03:33----------
is


---------03:34----------
like most of the information out there


---------03:35----------
is like done


---------03:37----------
sure like this person had a personal


---------03:38----------
experience and i think it's great that


---------03:39----------
they're sharing that personal experience


---------03:40----------
but like they don't understand actually


---------03:42----------
like what the goal is


---------03:43----------
okay so then let's see what they say


---------03:45----------
next okay so step one so how do


---------03:47----------
you just remove it all yourself you just


---------03:50----------
ah


---------03:51----------
one of my favorites from things of the


---------03:53----------
internet that involves self-help and


---------03:54----------
growth


---------03:56----------
growth blogs you just remove it just


---------04:00----------
remove it chat


---------04:01----------
what's wrong what's wrong with you


---------04:03----------
dumbasses


---------04:04----------
just remove it just just log out


---------04:08----------
just like food none just don't eat chat


---------04:12----------
anything else that gives you dopamine


---------04:15----------
stop eating


---------04:16----------
log out of all your devices just stop


---------04:19----------
playing video games chat just stop


---------04:20----------
drinking just stop doing drugs just


---------04:22----------
cigarettes oh like no wonder he quit


---------04:24----------
smoking he was like oh my god


---------04:27----------
you just get rid of it chat for how long


---------04:30----------
do you do a dopamine detox most people


---------04:32----------
said


---------04:32----------
for 24 hours however there were some


---------04:35----------
people like alex becker who did it for


---------04:37----------
much longer oh alex becker did it for


---------04:38----------
march so i decided to go for 36.


---------04:41----------
wow that's so horribly incorrect because


---------04:45----------
this does not


---------04:46----------
understa like this person does not


---------04:47----------
understand the mechanisms through which


---------04:49----------
a dopamine detox works we'll get to this


---------04:51----------
okay


---------04:52----------
where i failed will i do it again what i


---------04:54----------
don't understand


---------04:55----------
most of it chat most of it wow for a


---------04:58----------
fail


---------04:59----------
so i don't even know let's just move on


---------05:00----------
to the next one okay all right


---------05:02----------
so how to reset your mind with a


---------05:04----------
dopamine detox


---------05:06----------
from project life mastery okay is there


---------05:08----------
some stuff about world health


---------05:09----------
organization


---------05:12----------
okay there's a how to reset your mind


---------05:15----------
dopamine detox youtube video


---------05:17----------
this guy is smiling and is wearing a


---------05:19----------
suit cool


---------05:21----------
ready to succeed faster and master every


---------05:24----------
area of your life


---------05:24----------
click here to join my life master


---------05:26----------
accelerator mastery


---------05:28----------
life mastery accelerator program


---------05:31----------
a dopamine detox can change your life


---------05:34----------
okay let's look at the neuroscience


---------05:35----------
dopamine functions in the


---------05:36----------
neurotransmitter that is correct


---------05:38----------
it affects many aspects of your behavior


---------05:40----------
some of which include learning


---------05:42----------
motivation mood


---------05:43----------
this is also correct so this this


---------05:44----------
neuroscience seems better chat your


---------05:46----------
brain is addicted to dopamine and it


---------05:47----------
will try to stimulate


---------05:49----------
the repetition of behavior that produce


---------05:50----------
dopamine in the first place technically


---------05:52----------
released


---------05:53----------
dopamine in the first place not produced


---------05:55----------
it but close enough right we can let


---------05:57----------
that slide


---------05:57----------
once you get what you desire dopamine


---------06:00----------
turns off as a result you end up feeling


---------06:02----------
not as satisfied as you thought you


---------06:04----------
would


---------06:05----------
sort of okay you may end up feeling


---------06:07----------
empty okay


---------06:08----------
okay he talks about phenol ethyl amines


---------06:11----------
here


---------06:12----------
falling in love i'm not quite sure


---------06:16----------
what this has to do a simple and


---------06:18----------
powerful example is sugar addiction


---------06:19----------
dopamine creates a craving for sugar


---------06:22----------
so he talks a little bit about


---------06:23----------
satisfaction which makes sense so this


---------06:25----------
is actually like this is pretty good


---------06:27----------
oh wow look discover the seven proven


---------06:29----------
business models that made me an internet


---------06:31----------
millionaire in less than three years


---------06:33----------
and he's sitting on a car get


---------06:36----------
instant access to free video training


---------06:39----------
and get started


---------06:40----------
free four-part video training and he's


---------06:42----------
sitting on a b discover how to make


---------06:44----------
money publishing books on amazon


---------06:47----------
mastermind your way towards success


---------06:50----------
i'm con hmm


---------06:53----------
okay let's go back to this i'm getting


---------06:55----------
i'm getting a little bit distracted by


---------06:58----------
you know i guess this guy is an expert


---------07:00----------
at amazon


---------07:02----------
publishing or dopamine


---------07:06----------
i'm confused investing for beginners


---------07:09----------
supplements


---------07:10----------
how to master your mind and emotions how


---------07:12----------
to start an amazon fba physical products


---------07:15----------
business


---------07:16----------
she makes 40 000 per month on amazon and


---------07:19----------
up nlp training


---------07:21----------
what it's really like to be a


---------07:22----------
millionaire okay i'm a little bit


---------07:24----------
confused about what this guy's


---------07:26----------
okay so here's where things can get


---------07:27----------
messy when you stop engaging in


---------07:28----------
addictive behaviors all at once you may


---------07:30----------
experience withdrawal


---------07:31----------
symptoms this is a dangerous way to


---------07:32----------
detox your system this is also true so


---------07:35----------
withdrawal from alcohol and


---------07:36----------
benzodiazepines can even be


---------07:37----------
life-threatening


---------07:38----------
it becomes the only way that you are


---------07:40----------
able to experience happiness please use


---------07:42----------
dopamine


---------07:42----------
people use dopamine hits as a way to


---------07:44----------
mask negative emotions that they don't


---------07:46----------
want to feel


---------07:47----------
this is also correct you can only


---------07:49----------
distract yourself for so long before


---------07:51----------
those emotions rise to the surface and


---------07:53----------
start affecting


---------07:54----------
every area of your life sort of true


---------07:57----------
best way to reset your mind is to


---------07:58----------
cultivate here and now transmitters


---------08:00----------
these include serotonin endorphins


---------08:03----------
oxytocin and gaba


---------08:04----------
okay so this is where the neuroscience


---------08:06----------
once again is just way off


---------08:08----------
these neurotransmitters allow you to


---------08:10----------
enjoy the present moment experience


---------08:11----------
connection and be at peace with yourself


---------08:13----------
that's just


---------08:14----------
horribly incorrect so just to give you


---------08:15----------
guys an example okay so this is


---------08:17----------
neuroscience 101


---------08:19----------
neurotransmitters are like letters of


---------08:22----------
the alphabet


---------08:23----------
they can be used for all kinds of things


---------08:26----------
so for example serotonin is used in your


---------08:28----------
gi system and if you get way too much


---------08:30----------
serotonin in your gi system


---------08:32----------
if you cultivate too much of the here


---------08:34----------
and now transmitter of serotonin


---------08:36----------
you will end up with diarrhea this is


---------08:38----------
bad


---------08:39----------
gaba is a supr suppressing or


---------08:43----------
or inhibiting neurotransmitter that is


---------08:45----------
activated in


---------08:46----------
increased by the use of alcohol and


---------08:48----------
benzodiazepines


---------08:50----------
using so like alcohol literally


---------08:53----------
activates your gaba receptors


---------08:54----------
and and stimulates gaba production


---------08:58----------
so this is the one thing that i really


---------09:00----------
notice about you know people


---------09:01----------
like this dude who like i'm sure that


---------09:03----------
he's trying to help people and it seems


---------09:05----------
like you know he's got


---------09:06----------
he's actually doing a pretty good job


---------09:07----------
with the science um but it seems like


---------09:09----------
his expert


---------09:10----------
his expertise is in mastermind your way


---------09:13----------
towards success


---------09:15----------
he's an internet on entrepreneur life


---------09:17----------
and business coast


---------09:18----------
and philanthropist right so it seems


---------09:20----------
like he's not claiming to be a


---------09:21----------
neuroscientist which is great


---------09:23----------
um but like this is like so


---------09:25----------
neurotransmitters in the brain


---------09:27----------
and all over your body do all sorts of


---------09:29----------
things so oxytocin for example


---------09:32----------
is also what causes people to lactate


---------09:36----------
if they're you know in the postpartum


---------09:39----------
period


---------09:40----------
so like neurotransmitters don't just do


---------09:42----------
one thing they're actually like letters


---------09:44----------
of the alphabet so if you think about a


---------09:46----------
letter of the alphabet


---------09:47----------
it's used in a lot of different words


---------09:49----------
right maybe some letters may be more


---------09:51----------
common


---------09:51----------
in particular kinds of words but our


---------09:54----------
body like it's basically a signal


---------09:56----------
that the body sends and depending on


---------09:58----------
where the signal is sent like in in the


---------10:00----------
basal ganglia


---------10:02----------
dopamine is used for like regulating


---------10:04----------
motor stuff


---------10:06----------
right like how i move so like for


---------10:07----------
example people who have like basal


---------10:09----------
ganglia problems will have like their


---------10:11----------
their movement is not


---------10:12----------
smooth with their arms it'll be like a


---------10:14----------
ratchet movement so you cultivate these


---------10:16----------
here and now transmitters by slowly


---------10:18----------
starting to remove


---------10:18----------
behaviors that are causing issues in


---------10:20----------
your life


---------10:22----------
pick one thing in your life that you're


---------10:23----------
addicted to whether it's video games


---------10:24----------
pornography social media


---------10:27----------
coffee or sugar give your mind a rest


---------10:29----------
and allow your baseline to return just


---------10:31----------
just give your mind rest chat meditation


---------10:34----------
is a powerful way to increase your


---------10:35----------
dopamine levels naturally and reset your


---------10:37----------
brain i actually don't know if it's true


---------10:40----------
that's true i don't know if meditation


---------10:41----------
does anything to alter your dopamine


---------10:42----------
levels


---------10:43----------
it may this this could be correct it's


---------10:45----------
also been


---------10:46----------
found to rebuild your frontal cortex


---------10:49----------
this is true i don't know about rebuild


---------10:51----------
but it does improve prefrontal cortical


---------10:55----------
function


---------10:57----------
which leads to self-control and


---------10:59----------
willpower that is correct


---------11:00----------
i encourage you to do some research i


---------11:02----------
completely agree because this doesn't


---------11:03----------
seem like a whole lot of research


---------11:06----------
yes chad i encourage you to do that if


---------11:08----------
you're struggling don't give up hope


---------11:09----------
that's cool right that's a message of


---------11:11----------
positivity


---------11:12----------
are you ready to do a dopamine detox


---------11:15----------
okay so i don't know exactly what this


---------11:17----------
person is doing


---------11:19----------
but


---------11:24----------
yeah so like this is my point like so


---------11:26----------
he's you know standing in a cool


---------11:28----------
place and speaking to people and stuff i


---------11:30----------
i just don't know


---------11:32----------
so this is the problem with dopamine


---------11:33----------
detox is like no one knows like what on


---------11:35----------
earth they're talking about


---------11:37----------
like i don't get that this person is


---------11:40----------
you know he's this is great i mean this


---------11:42----------
is actually pretty similar to what we do


---------11:44----------
right chad it's like


---------11:45----------
purpose vision spirituality like


---------11:48----------
neuroscience sprinkled in like


---------11:50----------
it's kind of like us right so this dude


---------11:52----------
is like happy and he's successful and


---------11:54----------
there he is in sunglasses with a car


---------11:57----------
and oh my goodness


---------12:01----------
wow this is so this guy must know a lot


---------12:04----------
about


---------12:06----------
you know dopamine detox and then


---------12:10----------
there are


---------12:14----------
testimonials great


---------12:17----------
yeah so i just don't know


---------12:20----------
i don't know about this stuff okay so it


---------12:22----------
looks like he's got


---------12:23----------
courses affiliate marketing mastery


---------12:27----------
mastering book publishing the 24-hour


---------12:29----------
book system


---------12:30----------
amaz amazing selling machine so i i just


---------12:33----------
this is my point is like people what


---------12:35----------
what i think is going on right now when


---------12:36----------
it comes to like information


---------12:38----------
about dopamine detoxes is that like


---------12:40----------
people like this who seems like he's


---------12:42----------
good at selling stuff right


---------12:44----------
so his expertise is in selling and he's


---------12:46----------
like oh like this is great like


---------12:47----------
people will search for dopamine detox my


---------12:49----------
website will pop


---------12:50----------
up because he knows about you know


---------12:52----------
marketing stuff and then i will talk a


---------12:54----------
little bit about it and then


---------12:56----------
presumably he will people will purchase


---------12:58----------
my products and services


---------13:00----------
so this is like the problem with with a


---------13:02----------
lot of the information about dopamine


---------13:03----------
detox


---------13:04----------
is that it seems like people just sort


---------13:06----------
of like talk about it right but really


---------13:08----------
don't know what they


---------13:10----------
are talking about so now let's let's


---------13:13----------
let's


---------13:14----------
before we get too far let's look at like


---------13:17----------
so let's look at the flip side right so


---------13:18----------
if i were to go to pubmed


---------13:21----------
and do a search for dopamine detox what


---------13:23----------
would i find


---------13:25----------
right so so first of all i don't know if


---------13:27----------
you guys know this but you know if i do


---------13:29----------
you should see a bunch of papers okay


---------13:32----------
when you search things on pubmed so if i


---------13:33----------
search for


---------13:34----------
dopamine detox essentially i find


---------13:36----------
nothing so narcotic antagonists and drug


---------13:38----------
dependents


---------13:39----------
pilot studies showing enhancement


---------13:40----------
compliance with cin10 amino acid


---------13:43----------
precursors and


---------13:44----------
and keflanase inhibition therapy this is


---------13:47----------
the other problem with dopamine detox


---------13:49----------
which i want everyone to understand is


---------13:50----------
that dopamine detox has not actually


---------13:52----------
been studied


---------13:53----------
okay so there are not clinical trials on


---------13:56----------
dopamine detox


---------13:58----------
so everything that i wanted to share


---------13:59----------
with you guys today is going to be


---------14:00----------
grounded in neuroscience


---------14:02----------
it's stuff that i've done clinically but


---------14:03----------
if we really look at like have there


---------14:05----------
been randomized controlled trials on


---------14:07----------
dopamine detoxes


---------14:09----------
there have not right so there have not


---------14:12----------
been actual studies that i've been able


---------14:14----------
to find


---------14:15----------
that have a specific protocol for a


---------14:17----------
dopamine detox


---------14:19----------
and kind of like you know how to


---------14:21----------
accomplish it okay


---------14:22----------
so in a sense like while i'm being


---------14:24----------
critical of these people like if we want


---------14:26----------
to be a little bit more fair we have to


---------14:27----------
at least acknowledge that


---------14:29----------
part of the reason that these people are


---------14:31----------
giving crappy information is because


---------14:33----------
frankly good information is not out


---------14:35----------
there yet so now what i'd like to do is


---------14:37----------
share with you guys my experience of


---------14:39----------
like


---------14:40----------
um you know when i've worked with people


---------14:41----------
with dopamine detox first of all


---------14:43----------
explaining to all


---------14:44----------
how the neurotransmitters actually work


---------14:47----------
okay


---------14:49----------
um so we can still so this is where like


---------14:51----------
remember that there's like the end of


---------14:52----------
evidence-based medicine which is like


---------14:54----------
review articles when we have a bunch of


---------14:56----------
studies


---------14:56----------
but before that we tend to have clinical


---------14:58----------
interventions


---------15:00----------
so this is where we can use our good


---------15:01----------
understanding of science and we'll


---------15:03----------
present with you guys with like good


---------15:04----------
literature and stuff like that


---------15:05----------
like this is stuff that is really


---------15:07----------
grounded in a lot of science what i'm


---------15:08----------
about to explain


---------15:09----------
and then we can actually like based on


---------15:11----------
our understanding of basic neuroscience


---------15:14----------
um we can actually like elucidate okay


---------15:16----------
what's going on


---------15:17----------
in in like a dopamine tolerant brain


---------15:20----------
like what happens in the mind of someone


---------15:22----------
who's playing video games


---------15:23----------
we can even hypothesize based on what's


---------15:26----------
happening in the circuitry in the brain


---------15:28----------
what the symptoms should present as and


---------15:30----------
we'll sort of do that and then y'all


---------15:32----------
tell me


---------15:32----------
like okay actually yeah that makes sense


---------15:34----------
this is actually what i experience


---------15:36----------
and so if that's the case then we can


---------15:38----------
sort of do an intervention


---------15:40----------
which i've done and i'll explain how to


---------15:41----------
do that intervention and clinically what


---------15:43----------
i've seen


---------15:43----------
okay so let's start by understanding


---------15:45----------
what dopamine actually does in the brain


---------15:48----------
dopamine pathway so this comes from


---------15:50----------
wikipedia


---------15:51----------
okay so this is a picture of a couple of


---------15:54----------
important


---------15:54----------
dopamine pathways in the brain the ones


---------15:57----------
that we're going to be looking at


---------15:58----------
are the mesocortical and the mesolimbic


---------16:02----------
so


---------16:02----------
and then the vta is also important so


---------16:04----------
these three parts of the brain are going


---------16:06----------
to be kind of where your


---------16:08----------
dopamine reward and behavior and


---------16:10----------
motivation circuitry are


---------16:12----------
so this is important to understand about


---------16:14----------
dopamine okay so dopamine is involved


---------16:16----------
in not necessarily the the feeling of


---------16:20----------
pleasure


---------16:20----------
okay and we're gonna explain this a


---------16:22----------
little bit later and this is where a lot


---------16:24----------
of people get tripped up


---------16:25----------
dopamine is the reward is the


---------16:27----------
neurotransmitter that our brain uses


---------16:29----------
to reinforce a behavior first and


---------16:32----------
foremost


---------16:33----------
so it's not necessarily the feeling of


---------16:35----------
pleasure because as we're going to


---------16:37----------
discover


---------16:38----------
hedonics and motivation are actually two


---------16:41----------
separate


---------16:42----------
neurochemical neuro circuits okay


---------16:46----------
so hedonics is the ability to experience


---------16:48----------
pleasure


---------16:49----------
and dopamine is involved in motivation


---------16:52----------
and reward


---------16:52----------
so when we engage in a behavior that


---------16:55----------
rewards us in some way


---------16:57----------
that reinforcement is going to be via


---------16:59----------
dopamine and the two pathways we're


---------17:01----------
going to be looking at the most are the


---------17:02----------
mesocortical


---------17:03----------
pathway and especially the mesolimbic


---------17:05----------
pathway so this is where the mesolimbic


---------17:07----------
pathway is in


---------17:08----------
involved in reward related cognition


---------17:11----------
which includes incentive salience this


---------17:13----------
is huge


---------17:14----------
so wanting and enjoying are actually not


---------17:19----------
the same part of the brain okay which is


---------17:21----------
going to become important in a second


---------17:23----------
so dopamine is what makes us want stuff


---------17:25----------
the liking and pleasure


---------17:27----------
is involved in the mesolimbic pathway


---------17:28----------
but there's actually a separate circuit


---------17:30----------
that involves that more which we'll dig


---------17:32----------
into once things get complicated which


---------17:34----------
is how the brain works


---------17:35----------
sorry to say it's not like super simple


---------17:37----------
and so it also has to do with aversion


---------17:39----------
related cognition


---------17:40----------
and positive reinforcement what aversion


---------17:42----------
related cognition means


---------17:43----------
is that like basically if we avoid


---------17:46----------
things so we can reward behaviors


---------17:48----------
through


---------17:49----------
a version as well so like if i don't go


---------17:52----------
to you know if i don't ask anyone out to


---------17:54----------
prom or if i don't go to prom


---------17:56----------
i'm gonna be like more peaceful because


---------17:59----------
you know i'm scared of going to prom i'm


---------18:02----------
scared of feeling alone i'm scared of


---------18:03----------
all that stuff


---------18:04----------
so dopamine is involved in that kind of


---------18:06----------
motivational circuitry way as well it's


---------18:08----------
like the motivation of avoidance


---------18:09----------
the mesocortical pathway is a little bit


---------18:11----------
different because this involves


---------18:13----------
executive


---------18:14----------
function so what that sort of means is


---------18:15----------
that our mesocortic so our mesolimbic


---------18:18----------
pathway


---------18:19----------
this pathway here okay which goes from


---------18:22----------
the ventral tag mental area


---------18:24----------
up to i forget what this part is this is


---------18:26----------
the oh nucleus accumbens


---------18:28----------
okay so uh this pathway is really around


---------18:32----------
motivation and reward


---------18:33----------
in the mesocortical pathway so remember


---------18:35----------
our frontal cortices are the ones that


---------18:37----------
give us a sense of control and willpower


---------18:39----------
so what this means executive function is


---------18:41----------
the ability to plan out a task


---------18:43----------
over time and execute on those pieces so


---------18:46----------
if i want to find a job that involves


---------18:48----------
polishing up my resume it involves


---------18:50----------
updating my linkedin profile


---------18:52----------
if it involves like these other kinds of


---------18:54----------
things then applying to jobs responding


---------18:55----------
to emails


---------18:56----------
sending you thank you notes after


---------18:58----------
interviews all of those things are


---------19:00----------
are essentially executive function


---------19:03----------
and if we really look at it this is why


---------19:05----------
it's important if we


---------19:07----------
really look at it the key thing about


---------19:09----------
dopamine here


---------19:10----------
is that that circuit is not rewarded for


---------19:13----------
each of those steps right so the


---------19:14----------
mesocortical pathway


---------19:16----------
is the one that allows us to take


---------19:18----------
actions


---------19:19----------
without being rewarded each step of the


---------19:22----------
way so when i


---------19:22----------
update my resume like i don't get a


---------19:24----------
dopamine hit right


---------19:26----------
if i apply like update my linkedin


---------19:28----------
profile i don't get a dopamine hit


---------19:30----------
and yet our brains ability to


---------19:32----------
essentially


---------19:34----------
execute long-term tasks that are not


---------19:36----------
immediately rewarding


---------19:38----------
are governed by the mesocortical pathway


---------19:40----------
and so what we actually find is that


---------19:42----------
when people get


---------19:42----------
too like dopaminergic dopamine heavy


---------19:45----------
when their mesolimbic pathway


---------19:47----------
dominates their mesocortical pathway


---------19:49----------
what we actually wind up with is people


---------19:51----------
who


---------19:52----------
are unable to engage in action that is


---------19:54----------
not


---------19:55----------
immediately rewarding so it's sort of


---------19:57----------
like they can't do what they should and


---------19:58----------
can only do what they want


---------20:00----------
okay so like you guys let me know


---------20:03----------
whether that


---------20:03----------
sort of makes sense in terms of


---------20:05----------
something that you struggle with


---------20:07----------
because that's like this is what the


---------20:08----------
neuroscience tells us right so we can


---------20:10----------
look at


---------20:10----------
these two different functions of


---------20:12----------
executive function


---------20:14----------
and like mesolimbic what it does and we


---------20:16----------
can draw hypotheses


---------20:18----------
based on the science of what the


---------20:20----------
clinical presentation


---------20:21----------
of this messed up circuitry looks like


---------20:23----------
so the next thing that we're going to


---------20:24----------
talk a little bit about


---------20:25----------
is the anterior cingulate cortex okay so


---------20:28----------
now i'm going to explain


---------20:29----------
a couple of things to y'all the anterior


---------20:31----------
cingulate cortex


---------20:33----------
is involved in something called effort


---------20:36----------
computation


---------20:37----------
and what effort computation means is


---------20:39----------
that there's basically


---------20:41----------
any time we take an act this is the


---------20:43----------
anterior cingulate cortex


---------20:45----------
anytime we we are calculating an act or


---------20:48----------
any


---------20:48----------
time we're thinking about doing


---------20:49----------
something our mind essentially has


---------20:52----------
something called an effort calculation


---------20:54----------
so it sort of says like okay i can do


---------20:56----------
this


---------20:57----------
and get this reward this requires this


---------20:59----------
much energy for this kind of reward


---------21:01----------
or i can invest in invest in a lot of


---------21:03----------
energy for a lot of reward


---------21:05----------
or i can best invest a lot of energy for


---------21:08----------
a low reward


---------21:09----------
or i can invest very little energy for a


---------21:12----------
high reward right


---------21:13----------
so i can do something like spend 10


---------21:16----------
years becoming a doctor


---------21:17----------
which is a high effort high reward


---------21:20----------
sometimes i can even do things that my


---------21:21----------
mind will tell me like oh there's no


---------21:23----------
point in asking this person out because


---------21:25----------
they'll never say yes


---------21:26----------
so that's a high effort low reward


---------21:28----------
strategy


---------21:30----------
and then even there are things that are


---------21:31----------
low effort high reward strategies like


---------21:33----------
i'm gonna spend all my money on dogecoin


---------21:35----------
amc and gamestop right and just just


---------21:39----------
i'm just gonna you know i'm gonna spend


---------21:40----------
ten bucks and i'm gonna make ten


---------21:42----------
thousand it's


---------21:42----------
easy chat easy done okay so this the


---------21:46----------
anterior cingulate cortex is involved in


---------21:48----------
all of these effort computations


---------21:50----------
and essentially what happens um is that


---------21:53----------
when we get


---------21:54----------
impaired dopaminergic neurons in the


---------21:58----------
nucleus accumbens


---------21:59----------
right so the nucleus accumbens is in the


---------22:01----------
mesolimbic pathway


---------22:03----------
what it actually does is changes the


---------22:05----------
effect of our anterior cingulate cortex


---------22:08----------
and when it does that what we


---------22:09----------
essentially do is are unable to choose


---------22:11----------
anything except for the low reward low


---------22:14----------
effort option


---------22:14----------
so i'm gonna draw this out a little bit


---------22:16----------
okay so let's understand


---------22:18----------
what we're talking about from the top


---------22:20----------
dopamine is a diverse structure


---------22:23----------
that does all kinds of stuff in our


---------22:24----------
brain it does things like


---------22:27----------
motivation and reward executive function


---------22:31----------
and even things like movement so we


---------22:33----------
don't want to empty our brain of


---------22:34----------
dopamine that's a terrible terrible idea


---------22:36----------
means we won't be motivated to do


---------22:37----------
anything so when we look at motivation


---------22:40----------
reward this is something called the


---------22:41----------
mesolimbic pathway


---------22:43----------
and we look at executive function this


---------22:44----------
is mesocortical the limbic system


---------22:47----------
is our emotional circuit of the brain


---------22:49----------
the cortices are our frontal lobes okay


---------22:52----------
so mesocortical is planning


---------22:54----------
mesolimbic rewarding behavior


---------22:58----------
okay so sometimes there is a tension


---------23:01----------
where the mesolimbic beats the rewarding


---------23:04----------
mesocorticle


---------23:05----------
what that means is that we're going to


---------23:07----------
choose rewarding behavior


---------23:09----------
over like planning and executing tasks


---------23:11----------
over long periods of time


---------23:13----------
if we meditate what we can do is reverse


---------23:15----------
this


---------23:17----------
because we're enhancing our cortical


---------23:18----------
circuits we're going to be able to take


---------23:21----------
do planned actions more than like


---------23:24----------
immediately rewarding actions so if we


---------23:26----------
look at our frontal cortex


---------23:28----------
the frontal cortex is involved with


---------23:31----------
things like


---------23:32----------
impulse control right so i don't know if


---------23:35----------
you all remember but when we looked back


---------23:36----------
at the wikipedia thing over here


---------23:38----------
what we see is that adhd is deficient in


---------23:40----------
both of these pathways especially the


---------23:42----------
mesocortical pathway


---------23:44----------
more so than the mesolimbic pathway next


---------23:46----------
thing that we're going to talk about now


---------23:47----------
this is where things get even more


---------23:48----------
complicated the anterior


---------23:50----------
cingulate cortex so this involves effort


---------23:53----------
computation


---------23:55----------
so what this means is that sometimes


---------23:56----------
your mind is saying


---------23:58----------
oh this is not worth it and when you


---------24:02----------
alter the dopamine system here


---------24:05----------
this actually goes and messes up the


---------24:08----------
anterior cingulate cortex


---------24:10----------
and messes up your effort computation so


---------24:13----------
when you impair


---------24:14----------
dopamine the only choice that you can


---------24:16----------
make is low effort


---------24:19----------
for low reward right remember we've got


---------24:23----------
effort and then we can sort of do a two


---------24:25----------
by ten two table


---------24:26----------
reward so high effort low effort


---------24:29----------
high reward low reward and basically


---------24:32----------
when we mess up our anterior cingulate


---------24:34----------
cortex this is the only quadrant


---------24:36----------
that we can do things in we can't afford


---------24:39----------
to do anything that


---------24:40----------
involves high effort for a high reward


---------24:42----------
and so like this is where


---------24:44----------
this is going to become kind of


---------24:45----------
important because what we see in a


---------24:47----------
dopamine detox is essentially going to


---------24:49----------
be that


---------24:50----------
people sort of get stuck in this


---------24:52----------
particular pattern so like what is the


---------24:53----------
neuroscience


---------24:55----------
correlation with like what all of these


---------24:57----------
things what does this mean


---------24:59----------
how is this going to present clinically


---------25:01----------
okay what this


---------25:02----------
sort of means like this is what i look


---------25:03----------
for in people who have messed up


---------25:05----------
dopamine circuits okay


---------25:06----------
the things that you are motivated


---------25:08----------
towards


---------25:10----------
aren't fun that's a better way to put it


---------25:12----------
so this is key because essentially what


---------25:14----------
happens


---------25:15----------
our mesolimbic pathway is sort of active


---------25:18----------
but something about our reward circuitry


---------25:20----------
builds up tolerance


---------25:21----------
so it doesn't actually feel fun so this


---------25:24----------
is the other thing that happens is that


---------25:25----------
there's like remember there's this war


---------25:27----------
between the mesocortical and the


---------25:28----------
mesolimbic


---------25:29----------
so the second feature of like when your


---------25:31----------
dopamine circuits are messed up


---------25:33----------
is that you should do something


---------25:37----------
but you can't this like weird basal


---------25:39----------
mesolimbic circuit


---------25:41----------
is actually ending up being stronger


---------25:42----------
than the mesocortical circuit


---------25:44----------
which in turn means this part of your


---------25:47----------
brain that is telling you okay these are


---------25:48----------
the planned actions i need to take


---------25:50----------
i need to execute them in this way is


---------25:52----------
losing to the immediately rewarding


---------25:54----------
behavior


---------25:55----------
this is just more of a clinical


---------25:56----------
observation this isn't really borne out


---------25:58----------
in the neuroscience


---------25:59----------
but things that's that other people


---------26:03----------
are highly motivated towards are hard


---------26:06----------
for you


---------26:07----------
so this is not really borne out i don't


---------26:08----------
understand the neuroscience of this


---------26:10----------
statement but


---------26:11----------
i wish i had something for you all there


---------26:13----------
but i i just don't


---------26:14----------
so like these are the three signs of


---------26:16----------
like you needing a dopamine detox number


---------26:18----------
one


---------26:19----------
there seems to be a high degree of like


---------26:22----------
compulsion


---------26:23----------
towards a behavior that does not feel


---------26:25----------
enjoyable so if we kind of think about


---------26:27----------
that like what is going on there


---------26:28----------
right because what's happening is that


---------26:31----------
the part of your brain and this is why


---------26:32----------
it's important to understand that


---------26:33----------
dopamine is not


---------26:35----------
just a pleasure chemical because you


---------26:37----------
would think that if it was just a


---------26:38----------
pleasure chemical and you


---------26:40----------
no longer felt pleasure then you would


---------26:42----------
no longer engage in the behavior


---------26:45----------
right so like if i don't enjoy playing


---------26:47----------
video games why the hell


---------26:48----------
like if i play league of legends for 10


---------26:50----------
hours a day and i'm frustrated during


---------26:52----------
most of it


---------26:52----------
why the hell do i constantly do that


---------26:55----------
crap so


---------26:56----------
it's kind of weird right so we have to


---------26:58----------
understand that dopamine is not


---------26:59----------
a is not just a pleasure chemical


---------27:01----------
because if it was a pleasure chemical


---------27:03----------
and i was motivated towards a behavior


---------27:05----------
and that behavior wasn't fun then i


---------27:07----------
would no longer be motivated towards it


---------27:08----------
so what that means is that like we have


---------27:10----------
to understand that there are two


---------27:11----------
different circuits going on in the brain


---------27:12----------
and that like


---------27:13----------
dopamine can reinforce behaviors


---------27:17----------
without necessarily leading to enjoyment


---------27:19----------
and it's that discrepancy which i really


---------27:21----------
find people to be like


---------27:22----------
uh those are the kinds of people that


---------27:24----------
benefit from a dopamine detox


---------27:26----------
so what's happening is your mesolimbic


---------27:28----------
circuit is


---------27:29----------
active and is pushing you towards a


---------27:32----------
particular behavior


---------27:33----------
but then like your ability to experience


---------27:35----------
pleasure from it


---------27:36----------
has actually developed a sense of


---------27:38----------
tolerance what this means is that if


---------27:40----------
so like the thing about dopamine the


---------27:42----------
dopamine detox has nothing to do with


---------27:43----------
your dopamine level it has everything to


---------27:45----------
do with your dopamine receptors okay so


---------27:47----------
basically this is what happens


---------27:48----------
in my brain i have a neuron


---------27:52----------
that releases a chemical signal into


---------27:54----------
something called a synaptic cleft


---------27:56----------
and in the synaptic cleft i have on the


---------27:59----------
other side a neuron that has receptors


---------28:02----------
so what happens is i essentially like


---------28:04----------
you know i release neurotransmitter from


---------28:06----------
one


---------28:06----------
neuron and it moves over to the next


---------28:09----------
neuron and activates the signal


---------28:10----------
what happens over time is that if i


---------28:13----------
release a bunch of signal


---------28:15----------
the receiving neuron is like hey i'm


---------28:17----------
getting way too much signal


---------28:19----------
and down regulates the receiving end of


---------28:22----------
the receptor


---------28:23----------
so the way that i kind of think about


---------28:24----------
this is like imagine that i have


---------28:26----------
you know a speaker volume and then the


---------28:29----------
computer volume


---------28:30----------
if my computer volume is jacked all the


---------28:32----------
way through the roof


---------28:33----------
what i'm going to do is turn down the


---------28:35----------
speaker volume so that like


---------28:37----------
the end up like the the the sound that


---------28:39----------
the


---------28:40----------
volume of the music ends up being


---------28:42----------
pleasant right and if


---------28:44----------
my computer volume is is way down


---------28:47----------
towards the bottom what i'm going to do


---------28:48----------
is


---------28:48----------
turn up my speaker volume so that once


---------28:51----------
again i have an equilibrium of like


---------28:53----------
volume that i'm listening to so our


---------28:55----------
brain does the same thing with


---------28:56----------
neurotransmitter signals


---------28:58----------
so for those of you who use caffeine


---------29:00----------
like when you start drinking caffeine


---------29:02----------
it can like keep you up all night but as


---------29:04----------
you drink caffeine on a daily basis


---------29:07----------
you develop a chemical dependence which


---------29:09----------
means that you down


---------29:10----------
regulate your caffeine receptors in your


---------29:12----------
brain so that if you want to stay up all


---------29:15----------
night with caffeine you actually have to


---------29:16----------
end up drinking more


---------29:18----------
so this principle of physiologic


---------29:20----------
tolerance is very well understood


---------29:22----------
is the same reason that you know people


---------29:23----------
can be like you know light drinkers or


---------29:26----------
heavy like


---------29:26----------
heavy drinkers right like you can be


---------29:28----------
someone who's a lightweight or a


---------29:29----------
heavyweight when it comes to drinking


---------29:31----------
and that all has to do with your degree


---------29:33----------
of physiologic tolerance with alcohol


---------29:35----------
there are other things involved it's


---------29:36----------
just not neurochemical because your


---------29:37----------
liver is involved and stuff like that


---------29:39----------
but basically essentially the more


---------29:41----------
signal you dump into your brain


---------29:43----------
the more your brain is going to down


---------29:44----------
regulate that signal so this is the


---------29:46----------
other important thing when that person


---------29:47----------
said that you do this for 24 hours 24


---------29:49----------
hours ain't going to do crap


---------29:50----------
because the the neurophysiology of


---------29:53----------
what's


---------29:54----------
going on is receptor adapt adaptation


---------29:57----------
so receptor adaptation requires weeks to


---------30:00----------
equilibrate


---------30:01----------
so if you think about if you go off of


---------30:03----------
caffeine for 24 to 36 hours


---------30:06----------
you're not going to be detoxed off a


---------30:07----------
caffeine right like


---------30:09----------
you're just going to be miserable for 24


---------30:11----------
hours and you're not going to be totally


---------30:13----------
fine


---------30:13----------
so if you also think about alcohol


---------30:15----------
addiction so for example alcohol


---------30:17----------
addiction can take anywhere from like


---------30:19----------
five to six days for the medical you


---------30:21----------
know the medically dangerous part


---------30:23----------
and then you can even have lingering


---------30:24----------
effects of chronic alcohol use for weeks


---------30:27----------
to months


---------30:27----------
as your neurochemistry like re-adapts


---------30:30----------
and your neurons start


---------30:31----------
developing new cellular machinery and


---------30:33----------
stuff like that it gets actually quite


---------30:34----------
complicated


---------30:36----------
so what we're going to do for dopamine


---------30:37----------
detox the goal


---------30:39----------
is to fix that receptor regulation


---------30:42----------
okay so when i bombard my mind with


---------30:44----------
dopamine so now we're going to get to


---------30:45----------
things like


---------30:46----------
video games and technology so when i use


---------30:48----------
like when i when i go under reddit and i


---------30:49----------
want you guys to really pay attention to


---------30:51----------
this for a second okay when you go on to


---------30:52----------
reddit like i know i do this


---------30:54----------
when i don't even think about it right i


---------30:55----------
don't think to myself oh i'm really


---------30:57----------
going to enjoy doing this like wow i


---------30:59----------
can't wait to hop onto reddit today


---------31:01----------
it's sort of like my mind is like kind


---------31:02----------
of bored or there's some sort of like


---------31:05----------
you know gap in what i'm doing and my


---------31:08----------
mind reflexively goes to like


---------31:10----------
social media or like reddit or something


---------31:12----------
like that and i get like i click on the


---------31:14----------
meme and i get that quick hit that quick


---------31:15----------
hit that quick hit


---------31:16----------
it's not actually fun it's not like when


---------31:18----------
i'm i'm you know if i go on vacation i


---------31:20----------
don't like think to myself oh man it


---------31:21----------
would be so awesome


---------31:22----------
to spend six hours a day just like on


---------31:24----------
the internet browsing memes like you


---------31:26----------
don't look forward to it


---------31:27----------
but it still is reinforcing in some way


---------31:30----------
so you could you guys see how it's like


---------31:32----------
it's not really like a craving


---------31:33----------
it's like sort of like a neuroscientific


---------31:36----------
behaviorally reinforced


---------31:38----------
mechanism that's active and we get that


---------31:40----------
quick dopamine hit we get that quick


---------31:42----------
dopamine hit we get that quick dopamine


---------31:43----------
hit


---------31:44----------
so what we want to do through a dopamine


---------31:46----------
detox is reset


---------31:48----------
our levels because what happens is when


---------31:50----------
i play a video game for 10 hours a day


---------31:52----------
i'm getting a constant stream of


---------31:54----------
dopamine that constant stream of


---------31:56----------
dopamine is going to down regulate my


---------31:58----------
dopamine receptors


---------31:59----------
this also we don't actually hasn't been


---------32:01----------
studied so this is a clinical


---------32:03----------
observation


---------32:04----------
based on principles of neuroscience okay


---------32:06----------
and as our dopamine receptors get down


---------32:08----------
regulated we will enjoy things less


---------32:10----------
but something weird happens because the


---------32:12----------
reinforcement circuitry the behavioral


---------32:15----------
circuitry seems to stay intact and that


---------32:18----------
has something to do with probably


---------32:19----------
other neurotransmitters and things like


---------32:20----------
that that's like the endocannabinoid


---------32:22----------
system


---------32:22----------
and habit formation and stuff i'm not


---------32:24----------
going to go into that now but there's


---------32:25----------
another interesting there's a part two


---------32:26----------
to this lecture which is really fast so


---------32:28----------
essentially what happens is as i get the


---------32:30----------
constant stream of dopamine it's sort of


---------32:31----------
like if i'm drinking sipping


---------32:33----------
coffee throughout the day my brain is


---------32:35----------
gonna adapt to that level and it's gonna


---------32:36----------
down regulate my dopamine receptors


---------32:39----------
then we wind up in this situation where


---------32:40----------
now that my dopamine receptors are kind


---------32:42----------
of down regulated


---------32:44----------
other activities start to feel less


---------32:46----------
pleasurable


---------32:48----------
because if you think about the dopamine


---------32:50----------
hit from let's say


---------32:52----------
reading a book or going for a walk these


---------32:56----------
these things start to feel less


---------32:58----------
pleasurable so this is the next thing to


---------33:00----------
think about


---------33:01----------
when you need to dopamine detox is do


---------33:03----------
activities that


---------33:04----------
normal people seem to enjoy seem to like


---------33:07----------
not be very enjoyable to you


---------33:09----------
if the answer is yes then you need a


---------33:10----------
dopamine detox okay


---------33:13----------
so like just to kind of summarize like


---------33:14----------
what we're looking for for dopamine


---------33:16----------
detox is if your life has a constant


---------33:18----------
stream of dopamine and what we're


---------33:20----------
talking about is video game usage


---------33:21----------
social media usage these are the things


---------33:23----------
that kind of like bombard your brain


---------33:25----------
with dopamine


---------33:27----------
if that's the case and you wind up in


---------33:29----------
this clinical presentation


---------33:31----------
of feeling compelled or a compulsive


---------33:33----------
behavior


---------33:34----------
that does not actually lead to enjoyment


---------33:37----------
so if you play video games for 10 hours


---------33:39----------
a day


---------33:39----------
and like don't actually have fun then


---------33:42----------
you may need a dopamine detox if you


---------33:44----------
spend a bunch of time on social media


---------33:46----------
and don't even enjoy it


---------33:47----------
you may need a dopamine detox one person


---------33:49----------
is mentioning pornography


---------33:50----------
that could absolutely be a part of it


---------33:52----------
right so this is why we're not going to


---------33:54----------
be intervention specific


---------33:56----------
we're not going to be like you know


---------33:57----------
addiction specific what we're explaining


---------33:59----------
is the


---------34:00----------
neurochemistry of the dopamine reward


---------34:02----------
system and so whatever you do that


---------34:04----------
results in this presentation


---------34:07----------
makes uh dopamine detox potentially


---------34:09----------
useful for you


---------34:10----------
does that make sense like it's not about


---------34:12----------
what the addiction is it's not what


---------34:14----------
about what the behavior is it's about


---------34:16----------
the clinical signs of a particular


---------34:19----------
brain that is messed up in terms of


---------34:21----------
dopamine reward system


---------34:23----------
okay so you feel compelled to do


---------34:25----------
something but you don't


---------34:26----------
enjoy it things that other people tend


---------34:29----------
to be able to do


---------34:30----------
or be able to enjoy that you can't enjoy


---------34:34----------
you may want to consider a dopamine


---------34:35----------
detox and then the last thing is sort of


---------34:37----------
like


---------34:38----------
you're unable to control the part of


---------34:40----------
your mind that is or there's a war


---------34:42----------
between like


---------34:43----------
what you know you should do but you end


---------34:45----------
up just going towards the compulsive


---------34:47----------
behaviors over and over and over again


---------34:48----------
like that's the third sign


---------34:50----------
okay
