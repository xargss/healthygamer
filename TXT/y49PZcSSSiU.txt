---------00:00----------
so welcome hutch


---------00:01----------
can you


---------00:02----------
start by telling us a little bit about


---------00:04----------
um what kind of


---------00:06----------
you know stuff you do on the interwebs


---------00:09----------
and where we can find you


---------00:11----------
sure yeah so typically if you just


---------00:13----------
search hutch on most of the platforms


---------00:15----------
you should find me there's another hutch


---------00:16----------
out there i'm sorry to disappoint some


---------00:18----------
people in your chat my chat was saying


---------00:19----------
that


---------00:20----------
some people in your chat was were


---------00:21----------
expecting another hutch who does gta rp


---------00:25----------
that's unfortunately not me but i


---------00:27----------
started doing video stuff with video


---------00:30----------
games and youtube


---------00:31----------
in 2008 uh when there were no


---------00:35----------
gamers that were doing it for money so


---------00:37----------
back then we were like the the original


---------00:39----------
people that were doing it it was just a


---------00:41----------
hobby


---------00:42----------
y'all are the ogs


---------00:44----------
yeah some people will call me an og sure


---------00:46----------
yeah and then um


---------00:48----------
people figured out that if you can get


---------00:50----------
enough people to watch it then you can


---------00:51----------
make money doing it and sort of the rest


---------00:53----------
is history but


---------00:54----------
since then i've sort of


---------00:56----------
gone through like i've had to reinvent


---------00:58----------
myself a couple times i'm a little bit


---------00:59----------
older now and um so you know i dabble in


---------01:02----------
political coverage as well as video game


---------01:04----------
stuff and more recently i've started a


---------01:06----------
podcast of my own discussing mental


---------01:09----------
health best practices with other


---------01:10----------
creators


---------01:11----------
oh wow that's that's been a ton of fun


---------01:13----------
and um uh you know i try to advocate for


---------01:16----------
for people to take care of themselves


---------01:18----------
and be open about their struggles and


---------01:20----------
that's something i always have done with


---------01:22----------
the platform that i have so i reached


---------01:23----------
out to you thinking like it would just


---------01:25----------
be such a great uh idea to sit down and


---------01:27----------
get a chance to talk to you cool so um


---------01:30----------
can you tell me a little bit more about


---------01:31----------
the podcast or tell us a little bit more


---------01:33----------
about the podcast


---------01:35----------
um yeah it's just uh it's just this


---------01:37----------
podcast like i call it fitter happier


---------01:39----------
it's a that's a radiohead song and


---------01:41----------
there's some lyrics behind that that


---------01:42----------
makes sense but no it's just i bring in


---------01:44----------
other creators and and i you know i try


---------01:46----------
to make it clear that i'm not a


---------01:47----------
therapist and so and this isn't therapy


---------01:49----------
and uh you know that if they have any


---------01:51----------
questions they should if any viewers


---------01:53----------
have any questions they should


---------01:54----------
definitely consult a professional and uh


---------01:56----------
and then we just talk about people's


---------01:57----------
various struggles uh


---------02:00----------
more specifically as it pertains to


---------02:01----------
content creation because there's this


---------02:03----------
expectation that you're always supposed


---------02:04----------
to be on you're always supposed to be


---------02:06----------
happy and funny um


---------02:08----------
and i'm trying to challenge that as much


---------02:10----------
as i can because i think that that can


---------02:11----------
lead to bad outcomes sometimes


---------02:14----------
yeah can you explain that a little bit


---------02:17----------
sure i just think that


---------02:19----------
um it's easy to get lost in your online


---------02:24----------
persona when you do this for a living


---------02:25----------
that's happened to me a couple of times


---------02:27----------
i've struggled with


---------02:29----------
sort of a sense of identity of who i was


---------02:32----------
and uh there were different times where


---------02:34----------
i was letting the kind of person that i


---------02:37----------
would become


---------02:38----------
while recording content i was sort of


---------02:40----------
letting that take over


---------02:43----------
uh most of my personality


---------02:45----------
uh and that person wasn't very likable


---------02:47----------
to me when i when it when i would stop


---------02:49----------
and think about it


---------02:50----------
and so


---------02:51----------
um yeah i would say that that issues of


---------02:53----------
identity and kind of keeping a solid


---------02:55----------
foundation of who i am has been


---------02:57----------
something that i've struggled with and


---------02:58----------
it's gotten a lot better for me recently


---------03:00----------
but


---------03:02----------
it's it's it's been my downfall a couple


---------03:04----------
a couple different times


---------03:05----------
and is so hutch did you thanks so much


---------03:08----------
for sharing man like there's so much


---------03:09----------
there that i would love to talk to you


---------03:11----------
about


---------03:12----------
um


---------03:12----------
i wanted to just uh kind of clarify a


---------03:15----------
couple things so


---------03:17----------
what do you think would be like a good


---------03:19----------
use of our time today like do you want


---------03:21----------
to talk about


---------03:22----------
you know what you sort of learned


---------03:24----------
running the podcast uh kind of like


---------03:26----------
talking about content creation or were


---------03:29----------
you hoping to have or do you think it


---------03:30----------
would be more productive have a little


---------03:32----------
bit more of a personal conversation


---------03:33----------
because i'm super curious about your


---------03:35----------
experience of you know figuring out who


---------03:37----------
you are and sort of getting lost


---------03:40----------
in your identity and and things like


---------03:42----------
that


---------03:43----------
i think the latter would be the better a


---------03:46----------
better um way to spend this time of of


---------03:49----------
discussing uh the personal stuff i don't


---------03:51----------
know if i have too much of an interest


---------03:52----------
in discussing like the podcast stuff


---------03:54----------
okay cool can you hold on just one


---------03:56----------
second uh my producer is calling me


---------03:58----------
because much like you i'm i'm a little


---------04:00----------
bit of a boomer


---------04:01----------
and i use this thing called a telephone


---------04:04----------
all good


---------04:06----------
hey what's up


---------04:09----------
yeah sure


---------04:11----------
no no thanks


---------04:14----------
okay i had your volume too


---------04:16----------
oh i see so it's been fixed now um and


---------04:19----------
so i thought maybe it was your producer


---------04:21----------
telling you that you got the wrong hatch


---------04:24----------
no i think i think we love the hutch


---------04:26----------
that we got whether right or wrong


---------04:28----------
um


---------04:29----------
and and so


---------04:30----------
just to clarify is your understanding


---------04:32----------
that what we're doing if we're going to


---------04:34----------
have a personal conversation is your


---------04:36----------
understanding that you kind of mentioned


---------04:38----------
on your podcast that you kind of say


---------04:39----------
consult a professional do you think that


---------04:41----------
what we're doing today is therapy


---------04:44----------
um not in the strictest sense of the


---------04:45----------
word i wouldn't say okay


---------04:47----------
um


---------04:48----------
so what what do you think we are gonna


---------04:50----------
do today


---------04:51----------
well just to clarify i i have my own


---------04:53----------
therapist and so like i understand that


---------04:55----------
the sessions that i have with that


---------04:56----------
therapist are going to be um


---------04:59----------
comprehensive and long-term and that


---------05:01----------
sort of thing and i understand that this


---------05:03----------
is just a conversation so okay um


---------05:06----------
i'm sorry i forgot your question what


---------05:07----------
was it again oh that's fine so i i'm


---------05:09----------
kind of curious so


---------05:10----------
you um


---------05:12----------
mentioned like i was really intrigued by


---------05:14----------
what you said about like loss


---------05:17----------
uh you sort of lost your sense of


---------05:19----------
identity and sort of had trouble


---------05:20----------
figuring out kind of who you are


---------05:23----------
can you tell me a little bit about that


---------05:27----------
yeah you know i think


---------05:29----------
if i go all the way back to when i was a


---------05:30----------
kid i struggled with um relating to my


---------05:34----------
peers getting along with my peers i was


---------05:35----------
very


---------05:38----------
social very very naturally hyper-social


---------05:42----------
when i was a young young kid i would


---------05:44----------
walk up and introduce myself to


---------05:45----------
strangers and


---------05:47----------
i was just very curious about the world


---------05:50----------
and then when i got into uh second grade


---------05:52----------
i went to like a private catholic school


---------05:54----------
and that was in that catholic school


---------05:55----------
through


---------05:56----------
uh 12th grade


---------05:58----------
it took me a long time to connect with


---------05:59----------
my peers i was sort of ostracized and


---------06:01----------
teased and that kind of thing and what i


---------06:04----------
figured out at some point was if i can


---------06:05----------
make them laugh then i can sort of get


---------06:08----------
into the in-crowd


---------06:09----------
and so i


---------06:11----------
i didn't realize it but i was sort of


---------06:12----------
modeling my personality back then based


---------06:15----------
on what other people thought of me


---------06:17----------
and i wasn't really spending a lot of


---------06:19----------
time with my own self and you know


---------06:21----------
cultivating the things within me that i


---------06:23----------
liked um


---------06:26----------
and uh by the time i got to adulthood


---------06:28----------
just


---------06:29----------
generally speaking that was very


---------06:30----------
confusing


---------06:32----------
because i didn't know who i was and uh


---------06:34----------
that that question terrified me


---------06:37----------
what was scary about that question


---------06:41----------
well imagine thinking that


---------06:44----------
you have an idea of who you are and then


---------06:46----------
all of a sudden something comes along


---------06:48----------
and challenges that


---------06:51----------
uh it it just feels like the rug is


---------06:54----------
pulled out from underneath you all of a


---------06:55----------
sudden it felt like i didn't know how to


---------06:57----------
interact with people i didn't know how


---------06:58----------
to


---------07:00----------
exist in the world and so like really


---------07:02----------
small and mundane things like an


---------07:04----------
interaction with a barista at starbucks


---------07:05----------
provoked a ton of anxiety for me like


---------07:07----------
just everything was overwhelming


---------07:10----------
um


---------07:11----------
can you help me understand that


---------07:14----------
um


---------07:16----------
it's kind of i mean


---------07:19----------
i don't know how else to explain it i


---------07:20----------
mean everything i was just afraid all


---------07:22----------
the time it was fear was uh my god fear


---------07:25----------
fear was a very um


---------07:27----------
present


---------07:29----------
constantly every waking moment of the


---------07:31----------
day i was consumed with fear holy [ __ ]


---------07:34----------
dude that sounds terrible


---------07:36----------
oh yeah it was tough it was real tough


---------07:38----------
yeah


---------07:40----------
how did that start


---------07:43----------
um well back then i was


---------07:46----------
uh


---------07:47----------
i was abusing


---------07:48----------
uh marijuana like uh quite a bit


---------07:52----------
uh to the point where i you know i went


---------07:54----------
from being on the dean's list my first


---------07:55----------
semester to


---------07:58----------
almost failing out my second semester of


---------07:59----------
college uh


---------08:02----------
so it was for me at the time it was


---------08:04----------
helping me to just sort of cope with


---------08:06----------
things i was still having fun i was


---------08:07----------
still like


---------08:09----------
you know having a good time with life


---------08:11----------
and then uh after a while


---------08:15----------
marijuana would provoke uh really


---------08:17----------
intense panic attacks


---------08:19----------
i think that's what really kicked it off


---------08:21----------
like i would i would have these


---------08:22----------
conversations with myself


---------08:24----------
uh when i was high and those


---------08:26----------
conversations i didn't i didn't have any


---------08:28----------
good answers to the things that i was


---------08:30----------
asking myself and so i would invent


---------08:33----------
these horrible things about myself


---------08:35----------
to sort of explain you know why i was


---------08:38----------
having a hard time so i just i would i i


---------08:40----------
became like a bad person in my own mind


---------08:42----------
i thought i was a monster can can you um


---------08:46----------
i'm having trouble envisioning


---------08:50----------
what you were saying to yourself and


---------08:52----------
because it sounds like you were trying


---------08:53----------
to make sense of something


---------08:56----------
right you were coming your mind was


---------08:57----------
generating hypotheses


---------08:59----------
to explain your situation so can you


---------09:02----------
help us understand a little bit about


---------09:04----------
like what kind of situation would you


---------09:06----------
kind of come up with some sort of answer


---------09:08----------
for or understanding


---------09:11----------
um it's hard to go back and remember the


---------09:14----------
specifics honestly mostly it was just


---------09:16----------
nonsense like i you know


---------09:18----------
if i had a if i had a


---------09:20----------
awkward interaction with a girl or


---------09:22----------
something like that well that meant that


---------09:23----------
i was


---------09:24----------
you know forever going to be this


---------09:25----------
awkward weirdo mess and i was just


---------09:27----------
doomed to be


---------09:29----------
like that forever


---------09:31----------
and you can apply that you can imagine


---------09:32----------
applying that to all different types of


---------09:34----------
things but if i could give you like one


---------09:36----------
example that would be like one example


---------09:37----------
that i would give you of a story that i


---------09:39----------
would tell myself


---------09:41----------
to sort of try to make sense of


---------09:44----------
why i was struggling so much


---------09:46----------
it wasn't that i had gone through hard


---------09:47----------
stuff as a kid and and i was just having


---------09:50----------
difficulty sort of


---------09:51----------
unraveling all that when i was an adult


---------09:53----------
it was oh i'm just this fundamentally


---------09:55----------
bad person i'm i'm crazy i felt like i


---------09:58----------
thought i was going to lose my mind i


---------10:00----------
became convinced that i was going to


---------10:01----------
eventually just lose my mind


---------10:03----------
how did you get become convinced that


---------10:07----------
um well i mean just


---------10:09----------
if you can if you can imagine just


---------10:11----------
feeling afraid all the time and like


---------10:13----------
what that would do to your thought


---------10:14----------
process you're not really going to have


---------10:16----------
a lot of like rational thoughts when


---------10:18----------
you're in a place of


---------10:19----------
total fear


---------10:21----------
like my body was was releasing


---------10:23----------
adrenaline and cortisol as if i was


---------10:25----------
being chased by a tiger in the in the in


---------10:28----------
the you know rain forest or something


---------10:30----------
but it was like that all the time for


---------10:32----------
for no


---------10:34----------
uh


---------10:35----------
rational reason it was none of it was


---------10:37----------
rational


---------10:38----------
and did it seem rational at the time


---------10:41----------
yeah i firmly believed it yeah


---------10:46----------
oh hutch


---------10:47----------
so first of all i i really um i think


---------10:49----------
there's a lot of good that can come out


---------10:51----------
of this conversation and part of that is


---------10:53----------
because


---------10:54----------
i can tell that you've grown a lot


---------10:57----------
and and so i think what could be really


---------10:59----------
illustrative is


---------11:01----------
um


---------11:04----------
as we sort of explore


---------11:06----------
where you were and how you got to where


---------11:08----------
you are i think it could actually give


---------11:09----------
people a road map


---------11:11----------
who are like where you were maybe years


---------11:13----------
ago um but i want to ask you is there


---------11:16----------
something in particular that you kind of


---------11:18----------
wanted to talk about or anything that


---------11:20----------
that maybe i could help you with


---------11:23----------
anything you're curious about given


---------11:26----------
yeah so i i knew that you would ask this


---------11:28----------
question because i saw that you you


---------11:29----------
start these sessions by asking that same


---------11:31----------
question


---------11:32----------
and i've been sort of grappling a little


---------11:34----------
bit with uh like what i wanted to talk


---------11:36----------
about i mean i can tell you that


---------11:38----------
uh i had a sister pass away about a year


---------11:40----------
ago and i was there for


---------11:42----------
the last week of her life um i was there


---------11:45----------
like with her you know me and my family


---------11:47----------
took care of her as she was dying


---------11:50----------
and that has had a really profound


---------11:52----------
impact on me and it's sort of triggered


---------11:53----------
similar


---------11:55----------
feelings of confusion about my identity


---------11:57----------
because


---------11:58----------
when it actually happened it felt like i


---------12:00----------
was entering this


---------12:01----------
new phase of my life like it felt like i


---------12:03----------
was a different person after


---------12:05----------
that experience happened because it was


---------12:07----------
uh you know if you can and i'm sure many


---------12:10----------
people can just imagine how difficult


---------12:12----------
that would be so um that's been


---------12:13----------
something that's been


---------12:15----------
challenging for me recently and this is


---------12:17----------
something that you've talked about uh


---------12:19----------
with your therapist is aware of this


---------12:21----------
yeah okay


---------12:22----------
yeah um sure so


---------12:29----------
let me just can i think for a second


---------12:32----------
sure yeah i mean the the grief part


---------12:34----------
itself is pretty i think straightforward


---------12:36----------
at this point for me but it it that that


---------12:38----------
experience sort of relates to this other


---------12:40----------
sort of broader issue of identity


---------12:43----------
and um and and and my difficulties with


---------12:45----------
that so


---------12:46----------
i just wanted to clarify that yeah i


---------12:49----------
think i i think i i took that away from


---------12:51----------
what you said


---------12:52----------
um yeah


---------12:54----------
so


---------12:55----------
how can you can you just explain that a


---------12:58----------
little bit so


---------12:59----------
what happened to your sense of identity


---------13:01----------
when


---------13:02----------
your sister passed away


---------13:07----------
how did you start to think about


---------13:08----------
yourself


---------13:11----------
well there was a lot of guilt because uh


---------13:13----------
she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer


---------13:15----------
at the end of 2019


---------13:17----------
uh which has a very high mortality rate


---------13:19----------
as many uh-huh many of you viewers


---------13:21----------
probably know it's 95 percent of people


---------13:24----------
that get it die


---------13:25----------
and uh


---------13:27----------
i had all these plans of going up and


---------13:29----------
they lived in the she lived in the bay


---------13:31----------
area or the rest of my family i had all


---------13:33----------
these plans of going up and spending


---------13:35----------
time with her every month and then you


---------13:36----------
know a couple months later the pandemic


---------13:38----------
started


---------13:39----------
and so i didn't get to spend a lot of


---------13:41----------
time with her um for her last year


---------13:44----------
so i feel quite a bit of guilt about


---------13:46----------
that um i wish i would have


---------13:50----------
said mortar uh during that time


---------13:54----------
okay


---------13:56----------
um and so that


---------13:59----------
has led me to feel


---------14:01----------
a lot of guilt and so that's been


---------14:02----------
something that's uh


---------14:05----------
you can you can kind of get lost in that


---------14:06----------
guilt i think so yeah


---------14:09----------
so


---------14:10----------
um


---------14:14----------
let me just so hutch i'm tempted to ask


---------14:17----------
you a question which i think will


---------14:20----------
uh


---------14:23----------
advance the conversation but i'm


---------14:25----------
concerned that it may not be


---------14:28----------
a nice question or may evoke some


---------14:30----------
negative emotion


---------14:32----------
what do you think we should do


---------14:34----------
i'm okay with being challenged that way


---------14:37----------
okay


---------14:38----------
so let me ask you this so it sounds like


---------14:40----------
your sister was diagnosed with


---------14:41----------
pancreatic cancer and you know you're


---------14:43----------
right it has a very high mortality rate


---------14:46----------
um


---------14:47----------
and so you had plans to visit her and


---------14:49----------
then the pandemic hit


---------14:52----------
and then you spent the last week with


---------14:54----------
her so i'm kind of curious what kind of


---------14:57----------
person


---------14:59----------
doesn't vis visit their terminally ill


---------15:01----------
sister with cancer


---------15:04----------
the year before they die


---------15:08----------
uh well i think that could be like a


---------15:10----------
really broad question because i think a


---------15:12----------
lot of people could have different


---------15:13----------
reasons for not doing that


---------15:15----------
in this case it was i was asked not to


---------15:17----------
come


---------15:19----------
so it wasn't like i was choosing not to


---------15:21----------
come it was she was already sick and


---------15:23----------
they were taking the pandemic very


---------15:25----------
seriously and


---------15:26----------
so was i so


---------15:29----------
so then why are they guilt


---------15:35----------
uh well


---------15:38----------
i could have picked up the phone more


---------15:40----------
um


---------15:41----------
and i didn't know what to say to her to


---------15:43----------
make


---------15:45----------
her feel better and um


---------15:48----------
and i think a part of me avoided picking


---------15:50----------
up the phone and i think that's where i


---------15:52----------
feel the most amount of guilt okay it's


---------15:54----------
not like we didn't it's not like we


---------15:55----------
didn't talk and there was also a large


---------15:58----------
stretches where she was very sick and


---------16:00----------
couldn't pick up the phone even if she


---------16:02----------
wanted to


---------16:04----------
but it's just something that i think


---------16:06----------
about there was just so much that i


---------16:08----------
wanted to say and i also didn't want to


---------16:11----------
remind her that she was dying


---------16:13----------
so i i had no idea how to


---------16:16----------
have that conversation with her


---------16:25----------
sorry


---------16:26----------
sometimes when things get really morbid


---------16:28----------
i just


---------16:29----------
i i laugh because if i don't laugh i'll


---------16:32----------
cry


---------16:33----------
um


---------16:41----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------16:43----------
what what do you say you feel guilty


---------16:44----------
about not calling her or not knowing


---------16:47----------
what to say or


---------16:51----------
uh both yeah um


---------16:53----------
i


---------16:56----------
yeah both um i wish when she was


---------17:00----------
much more lucid and much more


---------17:02----------
capable of having those phone calls i


---------17:04----------
wish i would have used the phone more i


---------17:05----------
wish i would have called her every night


---------17:07----------
um


---------17:10----------
and it and it took me going up there and


---------17:12----------
seeing her


---------17:14----------
deteriorating to


---------17:16----------
realize that i


---------17:17----------
that the mistake that i had made um


---------17:24----------
and it's uh that's just difficult to


---------17:26----------
deal with because it's so final there's


---------17:27----------
no there's no do-overs with that


---------17:35----------
can you help me understand where


---------17:36----------
identity comes into this so i'm i'm


---------17:38----------
hearing that after she passed away you


---------17:40----------
said something about


---------17:42----------
you know it's kind of related and and


---------17:44----------
you started uh


---------17:46----------
think about yourself differently


---------17:49----------
yeah so


---------17:52----------
i'm i'm very blessed at this point in my


---------17:54----------
life i have a relationship that is very


---------17:57----------
stable um we just got engaged actually


---------18:00----------
this last weekend so congratulations


---------18:03----------
thank you i mean she's just such a great


---------18:04----------
partner to me and so she's been there to


---------18:06----------
help me go through this and so


---------18:09----------
if i was alone i think


---------18:11----------
i may have fallen into old patterns of


---------18:14----------
coping


---------18:16----------
um


---------18:17----------
which is to say like very destructive


---------18:19----------
patterns


---------18:21----------
um


---------18:23----------
so


---------18:24----------
when i look at like what's happened


---------18:26----------
my


---------18:28----------
feelings of guilt around what happened


---------18:30----------
with my sister


---------18:32----------
uh


---------18:33----------
you know absent my relationship i think


---------18:35----------
that could have been like a really dark


---------18:38----------
time for me


---------18:39----------
um


---------18:40----------
where i can get to kind of like really


---------18:41----------
avoidant behavior or sometimes really


---------18:43----------
destructive destructive behavior


---------18:46----------
um


---------18:47----------
and so i guess


---------18:49----------
i guess maybe


---------18:50----------
it makes more sense to focus on just


---------18:52----------
like


---------18:53----------
in terms of our discussions how to get


---------18:55----------
through the difficulties of this life


---------18:56----------
without


---------18:58----------
shutting down or


---------19:01----------
falling into destructive


---------19:03----------
patterns of coping


---------19:06----------
well it sounds like you're doing pretty


---------19:07----------
good at that


---------19:10----------
i'm doing okay i mean


---------19:12----------
it's a struggle sometimes but i'm


---------19:14----------
actually doing much better than i used


---------19:16----------
to


---------19:16----------
which is


---------19:17----------
very good good for you man


---------19:20----------
thanks so i think if we want to talk


---------19:22----------
about avoidance you know what is it that


---------19:24----------
you


---------19:24----------
[Music]


---------19:26----------
would be avoiding


---------19:30----------
in what context so you kind of mentioned


---------19:32----------
that if it wasn't for this relationship


---------19:35----------
you're afraid you would have fallen into


---------19:36----------
avoidance behaviors


---------19:38----------
right yeah and so they avoid its


---------19:40----------
behaviors but then there's also like


---------19:42----------
what is it that you're avoiding so what


---------19:44----------
do you what what do you think you would


---------19:46----------
have tried to avoid


---------19:48----------
um i think i would have tried to avoid


---------19:50----------
the pain


---------19:52----------
just the emotional pain


---------19:54----------
and one hurts


---------19:58----------
like how does it affect my body like


---------20:00----------
physically or um


---------20:02----------
yeah i mean what sure physically


---------20:04----------
mentally


---------20:07----------
if if i go through a really difficult or


---------20:09----------
challenging


---------20:10----------
thing sometimes my anxiety can become so


---------20:13----------
overwhelming that it's difficult to


---------20:14----------
function uh it's difficult to work


---------20:17----------
especially in the kind of profession


---------20:18----------
that i do where it's like it's my job to


---------20:20----------
basically entertain people and


---------20:23----------
uh that can be difficult when you are


---------20:26----------
constantly


---------20:28----------
hurting


---------20:29----------
difficult sounds like the understatement


---------20:31----------
of the year


---------20:33----------
it's impossible yeah i've i've dipped


---------20:35----------
i've dipped from content creation a


---------20:36----------
couple different times just totally


---------20:38----------
dipped and disappeared for a little bit


---------20:40----------
yeah um yeah


---------20:43----------
so can you tell me like when you say


---------20:45----------
okay let me let me try it a different


---------20:47----------
way so you said that you were avoiding


---------20:49----------
picking up the phone


---------20:51----------
can you help me understand


---------20:53----------
what was hard about picking up the phone


---------21:00----------
um well


---------21:07----------
she had uh


---------21:10----------
she and some other people in my family


---------21:13----------
were um


---------21:17----------
they wanted to have hope that she could


---------21:19----------
uh overcome the diagnosis


---------21:22----------
and that she could be a part of that


---------21:23----------
five percent


---------21:25----------
and i operate much more


---------21:29----------
i don't know what the word i'm thinking


---------21:30----------
of is


---------21:31----------
i look at odds and i look at statistics


---------21:33----------
and i and i take them at face value


---------21:35----------
and so i began grieving basically


---------21:38----------
right when the diagnosis was given i


---------21:41----------
began


---------21:42----------
preparing for


---------21:44----------
that eventual outcome


---------21:46----------
um


---------21:48----------
but i also was conscious of the i didn't


---------21:50----------
want to bring that around her i didn't


---------21:52----------
want her to


---------21:54----------
experience that any kind of pessimism or


---------21:57----------
fatalism when it came to


---------22:00----------
accepting the the outcome or the


---------22:02----------
probable outcome


---------22:04----------
and


---------22:05----------
so that just made it


---------22:07----------
difficult for me because i didn't know


---------22:08----------
what i didn't know what to say a lot of


---------22:11----------
the time because i couldn't say anything


---------22:12----------
to make her feel better and i couldn't


---------22:14----------
take away


---------22:16----------
her pain


---------22:17----------
she had also just given birth to a


---------22:19----------
little boy like she had wanted to be her


---------22:20----------
mom her whole life


---------22:22----------
and so she had just given birth and then


---------22:24----------
it was only a couple months after the


---------22:27----------
the birth that she got the diagnosis


---------22:30----------
and so the whole story is just um


---------22:33----------
very very very sad i mean her her little


---------22:35----------
boy is is great and


---------22:37----------
it's just he's such a blessing to be


---------22:39----------
around


---------22:40----------
so we're all very grateful that she she


---------22:42----------
gave him us or she gave us him before


---------22:45----------
she left but um


---------22:47----------
it was just so overwhelmingly sad to me


---------22:50----------
that i didn't want to make her sad


---------22:51----------
either


---------22:53----------
and so i would just think about her a


---------22:54----------
lot instead of picking up the phone and


---------22:56----------
she was just constantly on my mind


---------22:59----------
so i'm hearing that you know there's


---------23:04----------
almost uh


---------23:05----------
i'm gonna use a loaded word here there's


---------23:07----------
almost like a propaganda going on right


---------23:11----------
there's a there's a sense of um


---------23:15----------
you know playing the music while the


---------23:17----------
titanic goes down


---------23:19----------
where your sister and maybe the rest of


---------23:21----------
your family were like shooting for


---------23:23----------
optimism


---------23:24----------
yeah


---------23:25----------
and and what i'm hearing was really hard


---------23:27----------
for you is that like you kind of saw the


---------23:29----------
odds and you were like


---------23:32----------
like you couldn't be optimistic in this


---------23:34----------
circumstance


---------23:36----------
but i would but i didn't fault them for


---------23:38----------
for wanting that i understood why she


---------23:40----------
would want to hang on to that absolutely


---------23:43----------
absolutely so so i and i i kind of get


---------23:46----------
you like i i think i understand your


---------23:47----------
struggle because


---------23:48----------
there you are sort of facing the reality


---------23:51----------
and there they are holding on to hope


---------23:52----------
which like makes perfect sense right and


---------23:54----------
when someone's got cancer like


---------23:57----------
you want people around you like giving


---------23:59----------
you hope you don't want people around


---------24:00----------
you


---------24:02----------
you know


---------24:04----------
and so you were kind of what i'm almost


---------24:05----------
hearing is that like you're almost


---------24:07----------
protecting her by not picking up the


---------24:08----------
phone


---------24:12----------
i don't know if i quite thought about it


---------24:13----------
that way at the time it felt when i look


---------24:16----------
back on it it feels cowardly like it


---------24:18----------
feels like i should have just powered


---------24:20----------
through and maybe even faked it


---------24:23----------
yeah so that i can understand so like


---------24:24----------
maybe maybe what you should have done is


---------24:26----------
fake it right that makes sense


---------24:29----------
um you know pick up the phone and be


---------24:31----------
falsely optimistic and like


---------24:33----------
be like a you know a cheerleader for her


---------24:36----------
um


---------24:37----------
but


---------24:38----------
and i can see that for sure at the same


---------24:40----------
time i do wonder a little bit because


---------24:42----------
what i'm sort of hearing is that


---------24:45----------
she couldn't kind of afford to have your


---------24:47----------
mentality be a part of her sphere


---------24:52----------
um i think that would have been really


---------24:54----------
difficult for her


---------24:55----------
if i you know if i would have brought


---------24:57----------
that energy into into her life yeah so i


---------25:00----------
i'm i am kind of hearing and i'm curious


---------25:02----------
what do you what do you think about that


---------25:04----------
because that that does seem quite quite


---------25:06----------
you know


---------25:07----------
brotherly to me to sort of recognize


---------25:10----------
that you're in a dark place and and


---------25:12----------
you're seeing these like negative odds


---------25:14----------
and like you don't want to expose your


---------25:15----------
sister to that because


---------25:17----------
you know


---------25:19----------
heaven knows she's got enough to deal


---------25:20----------
with


---------25:25----------
yeah


---------25:26----------
that's an actor accurate


---------25:28----------
characterization i think yeah yeah and


---------25:30----------
what do you what do you think about it


---------25:32----------
when i sort of say it like that


---------25:35----------
i still beat myself up i mean the louder


---------25:37----------
voice is saying just you should have


---------25:39----------
just faked it you should have just


---------25:40----------
picked up the call and faked infected


---------25:41----------
and


---------25:43----------
yeah


---------25:46----------
um i think that makes a lot of sense


---------25:52----------
what else is that voice saying


---------26:02----------
um i just miss her


---------26:16----------
i told myself i wasn't gonna cry by the


---------26:18----------
way


---------26:19----------
okay we


---------26:21----------
are


---------26:22----------
crying um yeah a little bit


---------26:26----------
i just miss her a lot


---------26:28----------
i miss her a lot


---------26:30----------
that doesn't sound to me like the same


---------26:32----------
voice that is calling you a coward


---------26:36----------
well there's a lot of voices fighting up


---------26:37----------
there sometimes yep


---------26:41----------
so i i mean do you think the one that


---------26:44----------
so here's what i'm envisioning there's a


---------26:46----------
there's a toxic voice in there right


---------26:48----------
we're gonna call it toxic but there's


---------26:50----------
maybe there's a part of you that tells


---------26:51----------
you i'm not really toxic i'm just real


---------26:53----------
i'm the reality of it


---------26:55----------
yeah and and it's kind of saying you


---------26:58----------
know like you should have manned up you


---------27:00----------
should have like you know put on a


---------27:02----------
bright face you should have been


---------27:03----------
optimistic


---------27:05----------
if that voice is really really


---------27:06----------
devastating it may even say maybe if you


---------27:09----------
had done that things would have been


---------27:10----------
different today does it ever say those


---------27:12----------
kinds of things


---------27:13----------
no


---------27:14----------
okay i'm happy to hear that


---------27:16----------
yeah um


---------27:20----------
and so you feel


---------27:22----------
he's mentioned cowardly and i think


---------27:24----------
that's a good word because it implies


---------27:27----------
like an identity


---------27:29----------
right like sadness is not an identity


---------27:32----------
cowardly is an identity you see that


---------27:35----------
yeah


---------27:36----------
and so what do you what do you kind of


---------27:38----------
i'm going to ask a question i asked


---------27:40----------
before but just modify it a little bit


---------27:42----------
what kind of person doesn't put on a


---------27:44----------
brave face for their sister dying of


---------27:46----------
cancer


---------27:48----------
someone who's selfish


---------27:49----------
um


---------27:51----------
somebody who


---------27:55----------
can't put the needs of somebody else uh


---------27:57----------
ahead of their own


---------27:59----------
and a time that calls for it the most


---------28:03----------
um


---------28:05----------
i think selfish selfishness is more


---------28:08----------
a more accurate description of


---------28:11----------
that toxic voice


---------28:13----------
uh than


---------28:14----------
cowardly i think


---------28:16----------
although i think maybe they can be a


---------28:17----------
little intertwined


---------28:19----------
yeah


---------28:20----------
um uh yeah i can sort of see that


---------28:24----------
i can see how those two are intertwined


---------28:26----------
in the sense that


---------28:28----------
you know you weren't able to


---------28:31----------
put her first right and the reason you


---------28:32----------
weren't able to put her first is because


---------28:34----------
you couldn't tolerate


---------28:36----------
being falsely optimistic


---------28:41----------
yeah i mean also just just generally on


---------28:43----------
top of the fact that it was difficult it


---------28:44----------
was just a difficult difficult situation


---------28:47----------
it was a difficult thing to process


---------28:50----------
you know


---------28:51----------
to go from having your sister who wanted


---------28:54----------
to be a mom her whole life having a kid


---------28:56----------
for the first time and she you know


---------28:58----------
she was a great mom and she would have


---------29:00----------
been a


---------29:01----------
incredible mom


---------29:03----------
i think


---------29:04----------
that was like her calling i think she


---------29:06----------
she wanted kids since she was a kid


---------29:09----------
um and we used to kind of tease her for


---------29:11----------
that


---------29:12----------
like a playful teasing but um


---------29:16----------
so to to have this blessing of a child


---------29:19----------
and then


---------29:20----------
one one or two months later get this


---------29:22----------
horrible diagnosis that was uh


---------29:27----------
pretty incredibly powerful 180.


---------29:30----------
um time just kind of stopped i think


---------29:32----------
when i when i got that when i got the


---------29:34----------
call from my mom to let me know that she


---------29:35----------
had the diagnosis


---------29:37----------
i felt like everything just kind of


---------29:39----------
slowed down and got quiet


---------29:41----------
i


---------29:42----------
felt like i was entering this new


---------29:44----------
part of my life


---------29:46----------
can you tell me about that part of your


---------29:48----------
life


---------29:49----------
what were you entering into


---------30:04----------
um


---------30:09----------
i was entering a world without her


---------30:17----------
uh for the first time in my life and um


---------30:24----------
that bothers me


---------30:37----------
oh boy that sounds like a shitty world


---------30:40----------
i don't even never even met the woman


---------30:41----------
and i


---------30:43----------
i mean i didn't make a promise not to


---------30:44----------
cry so i get to cry you can cry if you


---------30:46----------
want to


---------30:48----------
i'm gonna grab it i have one


---------30:54----------
uh she was a wonderful sister so i mean


---------30:56----------
it was it was a devastating loss


---------31:00----------
yeah that much is clear


---------31:02----------
yeah on on both accounts


---------31:07----------
can i ask you something hutch did you


---------31:09----------
yeah i mean so it sounds like you wanted


---------31:10----------
to talk to her more


---------31:12----------
um


---------31:15----------
but it sounds like you talked to her


---------31:16----------
some like while she was lucid


---------31:19----------
a little bit yeah


---------31:20----------
went up there and


---------31:22----------
yeah


---------31:23----------
well we went up there a couple uh i went


---------31:25----------
up there with us me a couple i mean um


---------31:28----------
esme is my fiance so she came up with me


---------31:31----------
one time when we did uh we did like a


---------31:34----------
the most kobut friendly


---------31:36----------
visit that we could do it was all


---------31:37----------
outside and


---------31:39----------
uh you know we didn't we stayed at a


---------31:40----------
hotel and you know we didn't we didn't


---------31:42----------
do hugs um


---------31:44----------
which is also like really difficult yeah


---------31:46----------
i was gonna say that sounds hard to go


---------31:48----------
through an experience like that and not


---------31:50----------
have the the freedom to hug


---------31:53----------
hug her put her on your arm like


---------31:55----------
everything in me wanted to just comfort


---------31:56----------
her in that way so that i mean


---------31:58----------
kobe really made the whole situation


---------31:59----------
like a lot worse um


---------32:02----------
so i did i did spend some time with her


---------32:04----------
uh and i did call her


---------32:07----------
a few times and i texted her


---------32:09----------
um and then of course i was there for


---------32:12----------
at the end but


---------32:14----------
she wasn't super lucid by the end a


---------32:17----------
little bit and then the last couple days


---------32:19----------
not at all


---------32:27----------
did you ever share with her your


---------32:29----------
kind of negativity


---------32:32----------
no


---------32:35----------
no she


---------32:37----------
she i never told her that i felt


---------32:41----------
i never told her that i thought she was


---------32:43----------
gonna probably gonna die no


---------32:46----------
do you think she picked up on it anyway


---------32:49----------
i don't think so


---------32:53----------
i i hope not i don't i don't think so


---------32:55----------
though


---------33:06----------
but it it's a


---------33:09----------
you start to think about your own death


---------33:10----------
too


---------33:12----------
um


---------33:16----------
the finality of death is


---------33:20----------
terrifying to me now in a way that it


---------33:22----------
you know i was always kind of afraid of


---------33:23----------
death but i think i'm even more afraid


---------33:25----------
of death now


---------33:27----------
and i don't have the benefit of uh


---------33:29----------
religious faith to


---------33:32----------
help me


---------33:34----------
cope with that fear


---------33:36----------
um


---------33:38----------
can you help me understand what what


---------33:40----------
makes you afraid of death


---------33:44----------
i just i think we live in a on a very


---------33:46----------
beautiful planet at a really


---------33:48----------
crucially important and interesting time


---------33:52----------
in terms of like the


---------33:55----------
path of human development and um


---------33:58----------
i feel very blessed in the life that i


---------34:00----------
have i feel very blessed to be born when


---------34:02----------
i was


---------34:03----------
on this planet to be able to witness


---------34:05----------
everything i mean it can be a [ __ ] show


---------34:07----------
out there a lot of the times but


---------34:09----------
and especially here in these states oh


---------34:11----------
boy but um


---------34:14----------
it's still a beautiful world that we


---------34:16----------
live in and the the idea that you know


---------34:18----------
when i die


---------34:20----------
you know


---------34:22----------
you know probably never going to see it


---------34:23----------
again if if reincarnation is real i'd


---------34:26----------
probably end up on another planet as an


---------34:27----------
amiibo or something uh


---------34:30----------
so that that thought is very sad to me


---------34:32----------
to to not be able to


---------34:35----------
see how the rest of the story plays out


---------34:36----------
and to


---------34:38----------
spend time with the people that i care


---------34:39----------
about here and


---------34:41----------
it's just horrifying it's a horrifying


---------34:43----------
thought


---------34:53----------
so


---------34:54----------
i'm tempted


---------34:55----------
to teach


---------34:58----------
okay um


---------34:59----------
i i don't know if it's appropriate or


---------35:01----------
not but


---------35:02----------
so especially i think because you it's


---------35:04----------
clear to me you've done a lot of work


---------35:06----------
um you have a therapist


---------35:08----------
so


---------35:10----------
you know


---------35:10----------
i just want to share some thoughts if


---------35:12----------
that's okay i mean i can ask you more


---------35:13----------
questions if you like but i'm really i'd


---------35:15----------
like to share some thoughts and really


---------35:17----------
see what you kind of think about them


---------35:19----------
i'd be happy to listen for a while


---------35:22----------
um


---------35:24----------
yeah maybe give you a bit of a break


---------35:27----------
so


---------35:32----------
man where do i can i have a second to


---------35:34----------
kind of


---------35:36----------
yeah of course


---------35:47----------
i think the challenge here is i don't i


---------35:49----------
don't know


---------35:50----------
how much of what i'm going to say is


---------35:51----------
going to make sense but


---------35:53----------
i don't know we'll try to figure out so


---------35:55----------
let's just talk


---------36:00----------
so you had a sense


---------36:02----------
of who you were growing up and i i think


---------36:05----------
that what i'm sort of hearing is that


---------36:07----------
who you are has not really been set set


---------36:11----------
in stone and is fluctuated and maybe


---------36:13----------
actually it was kind of always down


---------36:15----------
there


---------36:16----------
but depending on how turbulent the


---------36:19----------
surface of the water is you weren't able


---------36:21----------
to really connect with who you were


---------36:23----------
and that you've


---------36:24----------
done i think that's a really good way of


---------36:27----------
putting it yeah


---------36:28----------
and over time you know as you've gotten


---------36:30----------
knocked about by the waves you've sort


---------36:33----------
of figured out the hard way


---------36:36----------
who you are


---------36:37----------
you know it was either get swept away or


---------36:40----------
find that anchor you know that that core


---------36:42----------
of who you are


---------36:43----------
and that you've done a lot of positive


---------36:45----------
growth in that direction


---------36:52----------
yeah i think that i had to think about


---------36:53----------
that but yeah i think that's that's


---------36:55----------
somewhat accurate yeah


---------36:57----------
so i think when your sister gets


---------36:58----------
diagnosed with cancer you know it throws


---------37:02----------
it throws your world into confusion


---------37:04----------
right like so the world like operated


---------37:07----------
based on certain principles like i'm


---------37:09----------
here like my my sister


---------37:11----------
is meant to be a mother her entire


---------37:13----------
that's what she's put on this earth to


---------37:15----------
do


---------37:16----------
and now she's got a kid and and this is


---------37:18----------
like you know we're figuring things out


---------37:20----------
um you know i'm dating someone things


---------37:22----------
are kind of going well like this is the


---------37:23----------
way that life is supposed to be like had


---------37:25----------
some bumpy patches a lot to be grateful


---------37:27----------
for you know some struggles but like


---------37:29----------
things are sort of sorting themselves


---------37:31----------
out


---------37:32----------
and you were feeling good about yourself


---------37:34----------
yeah i was on a hot streak yeah a good


---------37:37----------
point in my life


---------37:38----------
and then you know that the diagnosis


---------37:40----------
hits


---------37:41----------
and then you know tragedy hits with it


---------37:45----------
um


---------37:46----------
you found yourself not being able to


---------37:48----------
delude yourself


---------37:50----------
into thinking she would make it


---------37:53----------
uh you started judging yourself for


---------37:58----------
not being able to lie


---------38:01----------
to someone that you cared about


---------38:04----------
um i know that's not the way that you


---------38:05----------
think about it i saw the way that you


---------38:07----------
looked there for a second but let's be


---------38:08----------
on and this is where the teaching kind


---------38:10----------
of comes in


---------38:12----------
what we're talking about is lying


---------38:14----------
we don't really think about it that way


---------38:17----------
and this is sort of where the teaching


---------38:18----------
kind of comes in is


---------38:20----------
um


---------38:21----------
you know i've worked with a lot of


---------38:22----------
people who have cancer and a lot of


---------38:24----------
people are you know


---------38:26----------
terminally ill with cancer because i'm a


---------38:27----------
psychiatrist and


---------38:29----------
i trained at a general hospital which


---------38:31----------
means a lot of my work is not with


---------38:33----------
psychiatric patients it's actually


---------38:36----------
you know there was something like 23


---------38:37----------
beds out of 960 that are for psychiatric


---------38:40----------
patients


---------38:41----------
and the other


---------38:43----------
940 so some odd beds are for people who


---------38:46----------
are hospitalized for medical conditions


---------38:49----------
the cancer award was quite big


---------38:51----------
so a lot of the work that i did was on


---------38:53----------
the cancer awards


---------38:55----------
and


---------38:56----------
you know i


---------38:59----------
i don't know if this is going to make


---------39:00----------
you feel better or worse because i can


---------39:02----------
see your mind interpreting it kind of


---------39:04----------
both ways


---------39:05----------
but i think one of the most terrifying


---------39:07----------
things for a cancer patient


---------39:10----------
is


---------39:10----------
everyone around them is being hopeful


---------39:14----------
and they [ __ ] know the odds


---------39:16----------
right they're the patient a doctor is


---------39:18----------
gonna explain to them


---------39:19----------
but since everyone around them is being


---------39:22----------
hopeful


---------39:24----------
they can't show the abject terror that


---------39:28----------
they feel inside


---------39:30----------
because no one is there who like


---------39:33----------
like you know she can't


---------39:35----------
break down and cry in front of her mom


---------39:37----------
or her kid or you know the dad or you


---------39:40----------
know like she can't afford to do that


---------39:42----------
because


---------39:43----------
we're all like in this play right like


---------39:45----------
we're like acting it out and we're gonna


---------39:48----------
hope because everyone tells people with


---------39:49----------
cancer like you gotta hope


---------39:52----------
right we place like a moral judgment on


---------39:54----------
the right way to behave when faced with


---------39:56----------
a terminal illness


---------39:59----------
and so


---------40:01----------
you know my experience with with those


---------40:02----------
people is that the best thing that i


---------40:05----------
could offer them was not hope


---------40:07----------
but a place where


---------40:09----------
they didn't have to be hopeless alone


---------40:14----------
because like hopelessness is one thing


---------40:15----------
and i think it's something you


---------40:16----------
understand because it sounds like


---------40:18----------
you kind of did this


---------40:20----------
being hopeless is one thing being


---------40:21----------
hopeless alone is entirely something


---------40:23----------
else


---------40:24----------
yeah


---------40:26----------
and there's a part of me and i don't


---------40:28----------
want you to beat yourself up for this


---------40:30----------
but you know there's a part of me that


---------40:31----------
wants to say that


---------40:34----------
you know


---------40:36----------
i don't know i'm just gonna say it


---------40:37----------
because i it's i think it's authentic


---------40:39----------
that like what you had to offer your


---------40:41----------
sister wasn't


---------40:42----------
a mistake


---------40:44----------
that like the way that you felt about


---------40:46----------
her like if everyone else is pretending


---------40:48----------
that the five percent is gonna roll like


---------40:49----------
you don't think


---------40:51----------
that she is


---------40:53----------
unbeli unbelievably terrified that the


---------40:56----------
dice are not going to go her way


---------40:59----------
no she told me she told me as much


---------41:02----------
yeah oh so i'm really happy to hear that


---------41:04----------
because i i wonder you know why she told


---------41:06----------
you


---------41:09----------
i asked her if she was afraid


---------41:13----------
and she told me that she told me the


---------41:14----------
truth


---------41:15----------
so so oh thank god because here i was i


---------41:18----------
was afraid because i think that's the


---------41:20----------
right move honestly and i was afraid


---------41:22----------
that i was gonna replace one kind of


---------41:24----------
guilt with another but now i actually


---------41:26----------
feel really good


---------41:27----------
because i think that's the kind of


---------41:29----------
question that people who are offering


---------41:31----------
someone false hope or not


---------41:33----------
they can't ask


---------41:34----------
you get that


---------41:36----------
like we can't ask her if she's afraid


---------41:39----------
but if there's if there's one thing that


---------41:41----------
reassures me that you are a good brother


---------41:43----------
to her it's actually asking that


---------41:44----------
question


---------41:47----------
because she gets to share that right


---------41:49----------
because like when you ask her that


---------41:50----------
question like those thoughts are there


---------41:52----------
man she's living with them day in and


---------41:54----------
day out just like you lived with a day


---------41:56----------
in a day out


---------41:57----------
right she's thinking about what's gonna


---------41:59----------
happen to her son like she's thinking


---------42:00----------
about all that [ __ ]


---------42:02----------
and she's


---------42:04----------
keeping it inside


---------42:08----------
and there you are terrified right so you


---------42:10----------
ask like you're not like hey i'm afraid


---------42:11----------
that everything's gonna go to [ __ ]


---------42:13----------
and you're gonna die like you're not


---------42:15----------
dumping it on her


---------42:16----------
what you're really doing now


---------42:18----------
my water works really going


---------42:20----------
um just because i'm thinking about it


---------42:21----------
but like i think that


---------42:23----------
that's the most important question that


---------42:26----------
you could have asked her it's the most


---------42:27----------
important thing you could have said


---------42:31----------
and what did she say when you asked her


---------42:38----------
i think i'll keep that between her and


---------42:39----------
me sure


---------42:41----------
but she was


---------42:42----------
she was afraid


---------42:43----------
yeah


---------42:46----------
i think the important thing


---------42:48----------
fair enough i'm glad you drew that


---------42:50----------
boundary by the way um


---------42:52----------
but i cannot in the purpose of teaching


---------42:54----------
hutch i can tell you as is someone who


---------42:57----------
professionally works with terminally ill


---------42:59----------
people


---------43:00----------
that question is the most therapeutic


---------43:03----------
and supportive question you can ask


---------43:06----------
when someone is facing death pretending


---------43:08----------
it's not coming


---------43:10----------
helps


---------43:11----------
i mean don't get me wrong


---------43:14----------
but it's like insufficient man


---------43:18----------
having her brother understand and be


---------43:20----------
willing to listen


---------43:23----------
right like


---------43:24----------
because it sounds like she answered your


---------43:26----------
question and like you listen we don't


---------43:27----------
have to go into it but i'm hearing that


---------43:30----------
you know you gave her a door to walk


---------43:32----------
through and she needed to walk through


---------43:34----------
it


---------43:36----------
well i told her i was scared too and i


---------43:38----------
and i don't remember if the conversation


---------43:41----------
went too much further after that other


---------43:43----------
and and i feel like


---------43:48----------
there's a part of me that that wishes i


---------43:49----------
would have


---------43:52----------
said more than that um but i asked her


---------43:55----------
she was afraid she said yes i said i am


---------43:56----------
too and um


---------44:00----------
it felt like a moment of honesty and but


---------44:03----------
but i didn't want


---------44:06----------
i i i could tell she was really


---------44:08----------
struggling with that with that fear and


---------44:11----------
um


---------44:13----------
especially with her her mom instincts uh


---------44:16----------
she want she wanted to be there for for


---------44:18----------
her boy um


---------44:20----------
and


---------44:21----------
i put myself in her shoes and just


---------44:22----------
imagine how devastating that must have


---------44:24----------
been


---------44:25----------
i think maybe i'm angry that there was


---------44:26----------
just nothing


---------44:28----------
i could say to make her feel better


---------44:30----------
um


---------44:34----------
and i wish that there was


---------44:36----------
something i it just


---------44:39----------
i think it's a natural instinct to to go


---------44:41----------
back and scrutinize like the way that


---------44:43----------
you behaved and like look for ways you


---------44:44----------
could have done it better or whatever


---------44:46----------
i think that's a very human thing to do


---------44:49----------
um


---------44:51----------
but it


---------44:52----------
it's difficult to grapple with sometimes


---------44:54----------
when i when i think about that question


---------44:56----------
like what could i have said or what


---------44:57----------
could i have done differently


---------44:59----------
and um


---------45:02----------
yeah it's been it's been very


---------45:03----------
challenging


---------45:05----------
so hutch i don't know if you're gonna be


---------45:07----------
able to hear or receive this


---------45:10----------
um


---------45:12----------
but


---------45:13----------
and i i never met your sister i'm not


---------45:15----------
omniscient


---------45:18----------
i've spent


---------45:20----------
the better part of 16 years of my life


---------45:23----------
trying to figure out how to help other


---------45:24----------
human beings


---------45:26----------
and i think i've figured some of it out


---------45:29----------
and every instinct of everything that


---------45:32----------
i've learned


---------45:33----------
leads me to conclude that what you said


---------45:36----------
in that moment


---------45:38----------
helped immensely


---------45:45----------
now i'm not saying you couldn't have


---------45:47----------
said more


---------45:49----------
but i think there's also something that


---------45:51----------
we i think this is a mistake on


---------45:53----------
our part we sometimes believe as a


---------45:55----------
society that saying more is worth more


---------46:00----------
yeah


---------46:03----------
one moment of honesty


---------46:06----------
in


---------46:09----------
one moment of because like i don't


---------46:11----------
especially between like brothers and


---------46:13----------
sisters like you don't need to say a


---------46:14----------
whole lot


---------46:19----------
right


---------46:20----------
yeah


---------46:24----------
like i remember when i got engaged


---------46:28----------
um you know my dad


---------46:30----------
was like i'm not sure she's the one for


---------46:33----------
you


---------46:34----------
but if you really like if this is the


---------46:36----------
one that you want i'm behind you and


---------46:37----------
that was it it was like one sentence


---------46:42----------
it's all i needed to hear


---------46:45----------
there wasn't a long discussion about


---------46:47----------
whether she was the one or wasn't the


---------46:48----------
one or whatever like


---------46:50----------
it was just like one sentence


---------46:53----------
but


---------46:55----------
it means


---------46:56----------
it was enough


---------46:59----------
and that would that actually meant


---------47:00----------
something to you that was that was a you


---------47:02----------
you you took that as a


---------47:05----------
a kind gesture


---------47:08----------
yeah so i can give you more examples


---------47:10----------
if you want


---------47:11----------
yeah so the day i got so i i struggled


---------47:14----------
to get into medical school for three


---------47:16----------
years i i really didn't much like


---------47:18----------
yourself i kind of didn't do great in


---------47:20----------
college except i wasn't even dean's list


---------47:21----------
the first semester it was


---------47:23----------
f straight out of the gate


---------47:25----------
and so for years you know i started


---------47:28----------
medical school at the age of 27 or 28


---------47:32----------
and so there was a gap there between


---------47:34----------
like undergrad for like five years


---------47:37----------
where you know i wasn't really


---------47:38----------
accomplishing much and my dad was always


---------47:40----------
like pretty supportive you know he


---------47:42----------
didn't seem like disappointed in me or


---------47:43----------
anything like that but


---------47:45----------
um and i was terrified right because


---------47:47----------
like he's not gonna say hey you're


---------47:48----------
[ __ ] for life like he never said that


---------47:51----------
um but i was like i'm [ __ ] for life


---------47:54----------
it's like 25 years old no job no money


---------47:57----------
no you know i'm not going anywhere who


---------48:00----------
and so the day i got into medical school


---------48:03----------
um


---------48:04----------
you know i still remember now i'm gonna


---------48:06----------
get emotional because he passed away uh


---------48:09----------
soon after i got into medical school but


---------48:10----------
you know he told me that like now that


---------48:12----------
you've gotten and he was crying and he


---------48:13----------
said nothing is gonna hold you back


---------48:16----------
and that's all he said he was like now


---------48:18----------
that you've gotten your break like


---------48:20----------
nothing is gonna hold you back


---------48:22----------
and it was like


---------48:24----------
it was honesty and like i realized in


---------48:26----------
that moment that he was like terrified


---------48:28----------
just like i was


---------48:31----------
you know and that like i mean


---------48:33----------
he never showed it to me


---------48:35----------
until that moment because he you know


---------48:37----------
everything was going to be fine then


---------48:39----------
presumably and he was right


---------48:41----------
you know i don't think i've been held


---------48:42----------
back by much and and


---------48:45----------
but


---------48:46----------
you know a few words are like they can


---------48:48----------
be transformative


---------48:58----------
my my mom she went when she called me to


---------49:01----------
let me know that um


---------49:03----------
it was time to come up there and


---------49:06----------
her time was limited


---------49:08----------
one of the reasons why she wanted me to


---------49:09----------
come up there was you know if there's


---------49:10----------
anything that you want to say to her in


---------49:12----------
person then then this would be the time


---------49:13----------
to do it


---------49:14----------
and i really really struggled with


---------49:16----------
figuring out what i wanted to say


---------49:19----------
because i could say something that was


---------49:21----------
five pages long


---------49:23----------
uh with all the memories that we have


---------49:25----------
and and all the different myriad ways


---------49:28----------
that she positively impacted my life


---------49:33----------
but i couldn't organize my thoughts all


---------49:35----------
that much beyond just


---------49:38----------
um thinking about how much


---------49:40----------
gratitude i had that she was my big


---------49:42----------
sister


---------49:43----------
and i ended up just that was all i


---------49:46----------
that was the thing that i said to her i


---------49:47----------
just asked her you know do you know how


---------49:48----------
much i love being your little brother


---------49:50----------
she kind of jokingly said well now i do


---------49:53----------
like even towards even towards the end


---------49:54----------
she was trying to like make us laugh a


---------49:56----------
little bit and um


---------49:59----------
but i think


---------50:01----------
maybe that was enough like maybe that


---------50:03----------
was enough of of like


---------50:06----------
telling her what i wanted what i wanted


---------50:08----------
to you know say


---------50:10----------
um


---------50:14----------
and maybe it wasn't but


---------50:16----------
but yeah


---------50:24----------
there's no manual for this there's no


---------50:26----------
you know there's no there's there's no


---------50:28----------
book to tell you what to do in these


---------50:29----------
situations and


---------50:30----------
you just


---------50:32----------
do your best


---------50:33----------
uh


---------50:35----------
you just show up and do your best and


---------50:36----------
that's what i tried to do um


---------50:43----------
i'd like to be able to look back on that


---------50:44----------
on that on that time that with


---------50:47----------
some degree of acceptance and i think


---------50:49----------
that's what i'm struggling with is sure


---------50:51----------
accepting that it happened the way that


---------50:53----------
it did


---------50:55----------
what would have been enough hutch


---------51:04----------
what does enough look like


---------51:10----------
i genuinely have


---------51:12----------
no concept of i have no idea


---------51:16----------
you know why


---------51:19----------
because it's not a real thing


---------51:24----------
so now we get to the weird part okay


---------51:26----------
enough is an abstraction of the mind


---------51:30----------
okay let


---------51:31----------
i may have to explain myself here


---------51:34----------
so you have an id


---------51:35----------
so we have an identity


---------51:37----------
right like we have this like


---------51:39----------
identity that kind of


---------51:41----------
sets standards for ourselves


---------51:44----------
but like


---------51:45----------
there is no such thing as enough


---------51:48----------
there's only what is


---------51:51----------
like the only thing that exists is what


---------51:53----------
you said what does it mean if there's


---------51:55----------
enough how do we measure that right like


---------51:57----------
let's be really precise here because i


---------51:58----------
think that idea of enough


---------52:00----------
is born out of your guilt


---------52:04----------
the two are intrinsically tied


---------52:07----------
and you want to hold on to your guilt


---------52:10----------
like your guilt is like sure there's a


---------52:12----------
part of you that wants to let it go but


---------52:14----------
there's something about


---------52:17----------
not being enough for her which got


---------52:20----------
it's hard to describe but like you know


---------52:22----------
i think the reason that


---------52:26----------
you know guilt doesn't hold on to us


---------52:27----------
like we hold on to it


---------52:30----------
what possible reason would i have to


---------52:32----------
want to hold on to guilt like what


---------52:34----------
psychological need would that be


---------52:35----------
fulfilling because of your sense of


---------52:37----------
identity right so if we look at why do


---------52:40----------
people hold on to negative ideas


---------52:42----------
it's because of who they believe they


---------52:44----------
are


---------52:48----------
so what does that say about my sense of


---------52:49----------
identity then


---------52:51----------
i'd say that there's an echo left over


---------52:53----------
from your hard times which as you


---------52:55----------
mentioned has resurfaced


---------52:58----------
because i think that you what like what


---------53:00----------
would enough been for like it's


---------53:02----------
ridiculous


---------53:03----------
you want to do enough for your sister


---------53:05----------
that doesn't doing enough for your


---------53:07----------
sister doesn't


---------53:09----------
doing enough for your sister starts the


---------53:11----------
moment she dies


---------53:14----------
that's not the end of doing enough for


---------53:17----------
your sister she's got a kid you have a


---------53:19----------
nephew


---------53:20----------
she's not going to be able to take care


---------53:21----------
of him you want to do enough do enough


---------53:23----------
why that


---------53:24----------
it starts now buddy


---------53:26----------
forget it like i mean not don't forget


---------53:28----------
about her that sounds mean but like


---------53:29----------
seriously like


---------53:31----------
you're you're like you're thinking about


---------53:32----------
the wrong thing


---------53:35----------
like this is just starting


---------53:39----------
and the more that you get caught up in


---------53:41----------
like doing enough i mean i think you did


---------53:43----------
enough i mean she was it sounds like you


---------53:45----------
guys had a close relationship sounds


---------53:47----------
like she felt loved


---------53:49----------
you know


---------53:50----------
she was joking at the end but don't


---------53:52----------
confuse


---------53:53----------
humor


---------53:54----------
for the real feelings underneath


---------53:59----------
and that's just all be like i mean what


---------54:00----------
could you like it's the pandemic you


---------54:02----------
showed up when you could you said what


---------54:04----------
you were capable of


---------54:06----------
could you have said more yes but this is


---------54:09----------
also where you have to like meet


---------54:10----------
yourself where you're at


---------54:12----------
right you can't expect yourself in the


---------54:14----------
third grade and know what you know now


---------54:15----------
about your identity


---------54:17----------
all that exists were you enough back


---------54:19----------
then in the third grade


---------54:26----------
i think it's like you said i just was


---------54:27----------
what i was


---------54:28----------
exactly and so when did that change


---------54:31----------
were you


---------54:32----------
enough in the fourth grade sure


---------54:34----------
enough in the fifth grade sure and


---------54:36----------
somewhere along the way something


---------54:38----------
happens and you start becoming not


---------54:40----------
enough


---------54:43----------
it's idiocy


---------54:46----------
it's ahamkada it's ego


---------54:48----------
go ahead you wanna say something


---------54:50----------
um that's that's


---------54:52----------
uh uh that feeling of not being enough


---------54:54----------
that's all i remember i i don't have a


---------54:56----------
time in my life where i felt like i was


---------54:58----------
enough so


---------55:00----------
yeah


---------55:01----------
so


---------55:02----------
this is where the teaching comes in so


---------55:04----------
this is where the feeling has existed


---------55:07----------
it's just looking for a particular way


---------55:10----------
to like thing to latch onto does that


---------55:12----------
make sense


---------55:14----------
yeah


---------55:14----------
and boy is losing your sister a really


---------55:17----------
easy thing for it to latch on to


---------55:19----------
being enough has nothing to do with her


---------55:22----------
it has everything to do with you


---------55:25----------
and if you tell me that you've had the


---------55:27----------
feeling of not being enough forever well


---------55:29----------
yeah


---------55:30----------
right that should give you evidence that


---------55:32----------
you didn't do anything wrong by your


---------55:33----------
sister


---------55:34----------
it's just there's something about your


---------55:36----------
identity it's something that you carry


---------55:37----------
with you


---------55:38----------
that makes you feel like you're you're


---------55:40----------
not enough and if you pay attention and


---------55:43----------
you go back and we ask you lots of


---------55:44----------
different stories about your upbringing


---------55:46----------
we can come up with a time in fourth


---------55:47----------
grade when you didn't feel like you were


---------55:49----------
enough and then your jokes weren't funny


---------55:51----------
enough and then you became a content


---------55:52----------
creator and you made good content and


---------55:54----------
the next week you made content that


---------55:56----------
didn't have as many views and then you


---------55:58----------
weren't goody enough


---------56:01----------
and then you start dating this girl and


---------56:03----------
you were racked with insecurity because


---------56:05----------
you don't know if you were enough


---------56:08----------
and then over time you grew that you'd


---------56:09----------
realize that was bs and then you asked


---------56:11----------
her to marry you and now you're gonna


---------56:13----------
get married


---------56:16----------
we can see the enoughness the lack of oh


---------56:19----------
i'm not enough i'm not enough


---------56:21----------
but in any of those individual


---------56:23----------
situations were you ever not enough for


---------56:25----------
your fiance no bro you've been you


---------56:26----------
you've been great do you need to grow


---------56:29----------
sure are you gonna continue to grow


---------56:30----------
absolutely


---------56:32----------
you'd have to ask her


---------56:34----------
you ask her for me see what she says


---------56:37----------
i think i know the answer yeah i think i


---------56:39----------
do too


---------56:41----------
and so


---------56:42----------
not being enough is part of your it's


---------56:45----------
part of what you carry


---------56:47----------
and it's just really really hard because


---------56:49----------
it's like really easy


---------56:51----------
for that insecurity to latch on to i


---------56:54----------
didn't say enough for my


---------56:56----------
my sister


---------56:58----------
it was like what the [ __ ] does enough


---------57:00----------
even me like what are you gonna


---------57:02----------
like


---------57:03----------
like what could you possibly say


---------57:06----------
that will


---------57:07----------
just think about the tragedy of her


---------57:09----------
being a newborn you know having a


---------57:10----------
newborn son and then dying of cancer


---------57:13----------
like what are you gonna say like how


---------57:14----------
you're not gonna make a dent in that


---------57:17----------
you can only say what you can say


---------57:20----------
right and i think you actually did jen


---------57:22----------
you honestly like my professional


---------57:23----------
opinion is that like you offered her


---------57:25----------
something really really important


---------57:28----------
which is


---------57:30----------
someone to be afraid with which when the


---------57:32----------
end is coming


---------57:34----------
like


---------57:35----------
people don't want to put on a brave face


---------57:38----------
it's false it's a lie


---------57:41----------
so i think that authenticity and if we


---------57:43----------
think about even like what i do on


---------57:45----------
stream and stuff like we don't pull


---------57:46----------
punches like am i making you feel bad


---------57:48----------
because we're both crying


---------57:51----------
like does it hurt to have this


---------57:52----------
conversation of course i never met the


---------57:54----------
girl i feel devastated


---------57:57----------
right i have my own grief


---------58:00----------
does it mean it's bad that we should


---------58:01----------
retreat away from this


---------58:08----------
does it mean that it's bad that we


---------58:10----------
should retreat away from the feeling of


---------58:11----------
grief you mean


---------58:13----------
all of it all the negativity


---------58:15----------
you know my point is that like


---------58:17----------
being someone that you can say like are


---------58:19----------
you afraid and she says yes and then you


---------58:21----------
saying i am too like that's huge bro


---------58:24----------
like objectively


---------58:26----------
you can go ask a hundred grief


---------58:27----------
counselors what they think about the


---------58:28----------
value of that but like generally


---------58:29----------
speaking when we get trained to you know


---------58:31----------
deal with people in grief like we get


---------58:32----------
trained not to tell them hey


---------58:34----------
everything's gonna be okay what they


---------58:36----------
actually train us to do is like help


---------58:38----------
them be with them in the negativity


---------58:42----------
so i'm pretty sure yeah


---------58:43----------
it seems very counterintuitive because


---------58:45----------
you your instinct is to protect them


---------58:47----------
from that feeling yes protect him from


---------58:49----------
that feeling of uh


---------58:51----------
sadness and fear but you're not going to


---------58:53----------
protect him from [ __ ] dude your your


---------58:55----------
sister knows


---------58:58----------
you can't


---------58:59----------
you know and that's why like for example


---------59:01----------
when i work with people who are suicidal


---------59:03----------
i will say very counterintuitive things


---------59:06----------
so when someone's suicidal and i say


---------59:09----------
cheer up you have so much left to live


---------59:11----------
for


---------59:12----------
how do you think that makes a suicidal


---------59:14----------
person feel


---------59:15----------
i'd probably roll my eyes at you if you


---------59:17----------
said that to me if i was in a suicidal


---------59:19----------
place exactly


---------59:21----------
isolated


---------59:23----------
alone


---------59:24----------
makes the suicidality worse


---------59:28----------
instead saying hey help me understand


---------59:30----------
why life isn't worth living wow that


---------59:32----------
sounds awful it sounds like you don't


---------59:34----------
have a lot left to live for


---------59:38----------
right you don't want to leave them alone


---------59:42----------
and then once you're with them once


---------59:43----------
they're not alone then you can start


---------59:45----------
moving forward


---------59:48----------
right then i can say hey i understand


---------59:50----------
why you feel that way


---------59:52----------
i'm having trouble being hopeless when i


---------59:54----------
listen to you


---------59:56----------
everything you're saying is correct


---------59:58----------
but i still have hope in spite of that


---------60:00----------
what do you think about that


---------60:04----------
so authenticity and honesty is like


---------60:07----------
the basis of human emotional support


---------60:15----------
yeah


---------60:17----------
so


---------60:18----------
i i mean i i know i kind of bounced


---------60:20----------
around but i i think kind of going back


---------60:22----------
this idea if you felt


---------60:24----------
if you felt like you've never been


---------60:26----------
enough like that's what you need to work


---------60:27----------
on but that doesn't have to do with her


---------60:30----------
right and i met what i say earlier in


---------60:32----------
terms of like if she passed away like


---------60:34----------
enough doesn't start with her end with


---------60:36----------
her death that starts with her death


---------60:39----------
so how do you even begin to


---------60:42----------
start challenging a voice that's as loud


---------60:45----------
and ingrained


---------60:48----------
as the one that i'm describing that says


---------60:50----------
that i'm


---------60:50----------
not enough i can't think of that is the


---------60:53----------
loudest voice in my i'm a content


---------60:55----------
creator we're all


---------60:56----------
insecure [ __ ] lunatics we're all


---------60:58----------
messes uh


---------61:02----------
self-esteem comes from like metrics and


---------61:03----------
stuff like that it's just so


---------61:06----------
yeah


---------61:07----------
it's a beautiful question and your


---------61:09----------
answer is right there


---------61:11----------
you don't challenge it


---------61:12----------
you accept it


---------61:14----------
so there's a part of you


---------61:16----------
that feels like you're not enough and


---------61:18----------
how do you treat that part of you


---------61:21----------
uh like it's an authority


---------61:24----------
okay


---------61:26----------
so


---------61:28----------
not the answer i was looking


---------61:31----------
it's not a belief it's like a it's a


---------61:33----------
conviction it's not i wonder if i'm not


---------61:35----------
enough it's


---------61:37----------
so i may have to change my answer


---------61:40----------
um


---------61:41----------
but i'm going to share what i wanted to


---------61:42----------
share with you anyway so


---------61:46----------
the thing is you're trying to get rid of


---------61:48----------
it


---------61:50----------
right


---------61:51----------
it would make my life a lot easier i


---------61:52----------
think


---------61:53----------
so i think that's why it's not going


---------61:55----------
away


---------61:58----------
so when there's a part of ourselves


---------62:00----------
so i would say that how do you start


---------62:02----------
challenging something like that you if


---------62:05----------
you want to get rid of it the way that


---------62:07----------
you


---------62:08----------
do that


---------62:09----------
is not by challenging it by actually


---------62:12----------
accepting it


---------62:14----------
so


---------62:15----------
there's a big difference between arguing


---------62:18----------
with yourself when you say i am not


---------62:20----------
enough and arguing with yourself and


---------62:21----------
saying no i am enough and then you guys


---------62:23----------
fight in your mind


---------62:25----------
no peace will come from that i'm sure


---------62:27----------
you've tried it a thousand times


---------62:29----------
no peace comes from fighting against


---------62:31----------
yourself a house divided itself against


---------62:34----------
itself cannot stand


---------62:36----------
you can't think your way out of that


---------62:38----------
kind of thing you can't


---------62:40----------
so what you can do is say i'm not enough


---------62:43----------
and that's okay


---------62:47----------
and then you just live your life and put


---------62:48----------
one foot in front of the other


---------62:50----------
sort of


---------62:52----------
it's harder than i'm making it sound


---------62:54----------
which i'm hearing the skepticism in your


---------62:56----------
voice


---------62:57----------
no that wasn't skepticism actually


---------62:59----------
i i understand that to a certain degree


---------63:01----------
so so it's it's to understand that that


---------63:04----------
feeling of not being enough was not


---------63:06----------
something that


---------63:08----------
is random


---------63:10----------
you were taught that


---------63:12----------
right how does a child you think about


---------63:14----------
your nephew does your nephew think he's


---------63:16----------
enough


---------63:17----------
oh yeah he fights he plays with blocks


---------63:19----------
he's having a great time yeah


---------63:22----------
and so like if you think about it how


---------63:23----------
does a child like that start to believe


---------63:25----------
that they're not enough because someone


---------63:27----------
teaches it to


---------63:28----------
them they learn it


---------63:32----------
so what you need to understand is that


---------63:34----------
somewhere within you like there's


---------63:36----------
something that you learned


---------63:38----------
right because it's such a strong belief


---------63:40----------
like it's not


---------63:41----------
you know i i don't know that there's


---------63:42----------
like a not enough circuit in your brain


---------63:45----------
i mean there sort of is but it's neither


---------63:47----------
here nor there


---------63:49----------
but i think that what it comes down to


---------63:51----------
is somewhere along the way like you felt


---------63:53----------
like you were not enough and now what


---------63:55----------
happens is there's a part of you that's


---------63:57----------
telling you you're not enough and what


---------63:58----------
are you doing you're pushing it away


---------64:01----------
right


---------64:02----------
you're telling it you're not good enough


---------64:04----------
you need to stop telling me that i'm not


---------64:06----------
good enough you see that it's like


---------64:07----------
cyclic


---------64:09----------
i know it's kind of getting abstract but


---------64:11----------
you were so there's a part of you that's


---------64:13----------
telling you


---------64:15----------
that is not being accepting towards


---------64:16----------
yourself that's telling you to do better


---------64:18----------
and what are you telling your mind you


---------64:20----------
need to do better you need to start


---------64:22----------
telling me i'm enough [ __ ] you do better


---------64:25----------
toxic part of my mind get the hell out


---------64:27----------
of here


---------64:30----------
i i typically don't have that kind of a


---------64:32----------
self-dialogue though it's it's uh it's


---------64:35----------
more of a


---------64:36----------
yeah i'm not enough okay and then i just


---------64:39----------
either make a joke of it or cope in some


---------64:41----------
other way yeah so i don't i'm


---------64:44----------
using a little bit of hyperbole with my


---------64:46----------
dialogue i don't think you respond to it


---------64:47----------
that way but i do think that that's a


---------64:50----------
shade of not acceptance so i think


---------64:51----------
you've learned how to cope with it


---------64:52----------
that's what i'm really hearing is you've


---------64:54----------
heard you've learned healthy coping


---------64:56----------
mechanisms in response to that voice but


---------64:59----------
you haven't figured out how to uproot


---------65:01----------
the voice


---------65:03----------
well if i do what would that make me


---------65:05----------
though because like one of the reasons i


---------65:07----------
you know i can be kind of funny like


---------65:10----------
i just you know some people are a lot


---------65:11----------
more funny than me but i can be kind of


---------65:13----------
a funny guy


---------65:14----------
and that is one of the ways that i dealt


---------65:16----------
with


---------65:17----------
feelings of


---------65:19----------
inadequacy it was just turning


---------65:20----------
everything into a joke


---------65:22----------
um


---------65:23----------
so if i were to uproot that


---------65:26----------
part of me that tells me that i'm not


---------65:28----------
enough i have concerns about


---------65:31----------
my long-term financial well-being what


---------65:33----------
if i'm no longer funny like what if i'm


---------65:35----------
no longer interesting or entertaining


---------65:37----------
and now we understand why it stays


---------65:41----------
because you're afraid of what would


---------65:42----------
happen to you if it goes


---------65:45----------
so do you want to change that part of


---------65:46----------
yourself


---------65:48----------
yeah there we go


---------65:52----------
right


---------65:53----------
so this is the really confusing thing


---------65:55----------
when i you asked me earlier why would


---------65:57----------
someone want to hold on to their guilt


---------65:59----------
why the [ __ ] would someone want to hold


---------66:00----------
on to the toxic voice in their head


---------66:02----------
that's telling them that they're not


---------66:03----------
enough now


---------66:04----------
you have the answer


---------66:08----------
so understand that everything in your


---------66:10----------
mind so like this is kind of cool like


---------66:12----------
if you don't believe in any religions or


---------66:14----------
spirituality or stuff like that let's


---------66:16----------
assume biology for a second or maybe you


---------66:18----------
do i don't know


---------66:20----------
i'm


---------66:21----------
i'm i


---------66:23----------
i


---------66:24----------
think that there is


---------66:25----------
something much much bigger than me and i


---------66:27----------
choose not to try to define it so i'm


---------66:29----------
open to i'm not i don't get offended by


---------66:31----------
other people's religious beliefs yeah


---------66:32----------
right i was just anyway that was an


---------66:35----------
interesting aside we can talk about that


---------66:36----------
in a second but let's let's talk about


---------66:38----------
so your mind like you have neurons right


---------66:40----------
and neurons like have like action


---------66:43----------
potentials and they fire and they calm


---------66:45----------
down and they depolarize and they move


---------66:47----------
sodium and potassium like there's like


---------66:49----------
science and biology and chemistry and


---------66:52----------
biochemistry in physics that governs


---------66:54----------
everything in your brain


---------66:56----------
and your brain has evolved


---------66:58----------
this is kind of weird just think about


---------66:59----------
this for a second your brain has evolved


---------67:02----------
with the ability to be anxious with the


---------67:04----------
ability to be afraid with the ability to


---------67:06----------
feel guilty


---------67:08----------
why the hell does do our brains


---------67:11----------
have the capability like why aren't we


---------67:13----------
just happy all the time we could have


---------67:15----------
evolved that way


---------67:18----------
why does your brain torture you like


---------67:19----------
this is a system that was designed to


---------67:21----------
produce this right


---------67:23----------
and so what people don't understand is


---------67:24----------
that all emotions


---------67:27----------
have evolutionary benefit all emotions


---------67:29----------
have value all emotions have function if


---------67:32----------
they didn't have function it wouldn't


---------67:33----------
have evolved


---------67:36----------
yeah okay you know


---------67:37----------
so it's kind of interesting because


---------67:40----------
even this idea of not being enough what


---------67:42----------
i'm hearing is that it propels you you


---------67:44----------
use it


---------67:45----------
and so what would happen if it went away


---------67:47----------
you're afraid that you wouldn't be funny


---------67:49----------
anymore that's what i'm hearing


---------67:52----------
not just that though i'm afraid of a


---------67:53----------
cascading series of just


---------67:57----------
mental collapse just not just like how i


---------67:59----------
am in my job but like what kind of a


---------68:00----------
boyfriend would i be what kind of a


---------68:02----------
friend would i be what kind of a general


---------68:04----------
person would i be and that's question


---------68:06----------
that question mark is what scares me the


---------68:08----------
the unknown of


---------68:11----------
letting that go i don't think it's an


---------68:13----------
unknown bro


---------68:15----------
you remember what it was like before you


---------68:17----------
learned how to crack a joke in the


---------68:18----------
second grade


---------68:20----------
uh yeah


---------68:22----------
that's what you'd go back to


---------68:24----------
because how did you get


---------68:26----------
well i'm not trying to regress into like


---------68:28----------
a


---------68:28----------
seven year old


---------68:30----------
exactly which is why you're not gonna


---------68:31----------
let go of your your fuel for jokes


---------68:34----------
you see that


---------68:36----------
because you learned how to be funny and


---------68:37----------
you learn how to get people to like you


---------68:39----------
and where does the fuel from your jokes


---------68:41----------
come from the sense of inadequacy


---------68:44----------
pain


---------68:45----------
pain you're damn right traumatic pain


---------68:47----------
yes yeah and so who would you be without


---------68:50----------
your pain


---------68:51----------
so now we come back to identity you'd be


---------68:54----------
who you are


---------69:00----------
i'm just afraid that i wouldn't be


---------69:01----------
interesting at that point


---------69:03----------
yep


---------69:04----------
but you will be don't worry about that


---------69:07----------
i mean you are worried about that which


---------69:08----------
is okay so we have to meet you where


---------69:09----------
you're at and let yourself be afraid


---------69:11----------
so i know it's kind of weird but like


---------69:13----------
you're afraid that people won't like you


---------69:15----------
if you get better


---------69:18----------
right that you won't be funny


---------69:20----------
that there will be a collapse


---------69:22----------
you know there's there's i'm of two


---------69:24----------
minds on that because i have


---------69:26----------
you should have seen me


---------69:27----------
like 12 years ago doc because i was


---------69:30----------
i was a [ __ ] mess like and and you


---------69:31----------
could see it i wore it on my face like


---------69:33----------
if you tuned into my videos


---------69:35----------
like people used to leave comments like


---------69:37----------
are you okay


---------69:38----------
like how i looked physically because i


---------69:40----------
wasn't taking care of myself and um


---------69:45----------
and and since that point i have gotten


---------69:48----------
better i've gotten healthier i've i've


---------69:51----------
progressed and i have my own like little


---------69:54----------
community on on twitch here and


---------69:56----------
they see that and they comment about


---------69:58----------
that and they give me you know praise


---------70:00----------
for that and it and it feels good to


---------70:03----------
to know that


---------70:04----------
i mean i already know that i i've gotten


---------70:06----------
better but to to to have other people


---------70:08----------
see that happening is is validating to


---------70:11----------
me


---------70:12----------
um and so it matters on that level


---------70:15----------
sure so i do i do i do recognize that


---------70:17----------
like that


---------70:19----------
it's it's sort of a


---------70:21----------
it's sort of a


---------70:24----------
false expectation that people would no


---------70:27----------
longer be interested in in who i am or


---------70:29----------
my content or whatever if i were to get


---------70:31----------
better there's a problem that recognizes


---------70:33----------
that that that's that's false how


---------70:35----------
interesting


---------70:36----------
right but i said well i still grapple


---------70:38----------
with it it's like i'm with you so


---------70:41----------
most of what keeps us stuck so this is


---------70:43----------
another common misconception when we get


---------70:45----------
stuck we think that we don't know what


---------70:48----------
to do or that we lack motivation


---------70:51----------
but most of the time what keeps us stuck


---------70:53----------
is conflict


---------70:55----------
because there's the doubt


---------70:57----------
right there's like and it's it's been


---------70:59----------
fascinating to talk to you bro because


---------71:00----------
it's clear to me that you've done an


---------71:02----------
immense amount of work


---------71:04----------
so what i see is someone who's like


---------71:06----------
halfway there or even well past halfway


---------71:08----------
it's like 75 80 percent


---------71:11----------
and yeah i know it's it's shocking


---------71:14----------
shocking


---------71:16----------
but i i think that's really the issue


---------71:18----------
right is is like so and what's happening


---------71:20----------
is


---------71:21----------
what these people are teaching you and i


---------71:22----------
know it's kind of weird but i think


---------71:23----------
twitch is doing a lot of good in the


---------71:25----------
world but what they're teaching you is


---------71:28----------
that oh you're not like a screwed up


---------71:29----------
degenerate that used to be kind of funny


---------71:32----------
and we accept you anyway


---------71:35----------
right we can be proud of how far you've


---------71:37----------
come


---------71:39----------
well chat roasts me harder than anybody


---------71:41----------
else on the internet but


---------71:43----------
they do it


---------71:44----------
out of kindness i think exactly so


---------71:47----------
that's also where like they say they


---------71:48----------
roast you right but they also like


---------71:52----------
they do it


---------71:53----------
it's kind of like i i run a group for


---------71:55----------
esports professionals and one of them


---------71:56----------
got a girlfriend


---------71:58----------
and the funniest thing was


---------72:01----------
man they would not leave him alone


---------72:04----------
they were like


---------72:06----------
his teammates were roasting him for it


---------72:07----------
uh not just his teammates it's like kind


---------72:10----------
of a more open group for esports


---------72:12----------
everyone was roasting him they just


---------72:13----------
could not stop giving him [ __ ]


---------72:15----------
and so i was like what are and if you


---------72:17----------
look at everyone's smiling right


---------72:19----------
okay and i was like asking people i was


---------72:21----------
like why you know what are we doing here


---------72:22----------
like i asked the person like how do you


---------72:24----------
feel everyone's giving you [ __ ]


---------72:26----------
and he's like i kind of feel like


---------72:27----------
embarrassed but i sort of feel good and


---------72:29----------
we ask everyone else like how do y'all


---------72:30----------
feel and we're like we all feel good


---------72:31----------
we're also smiling right and it's like


---------72:34----------
what we're actually doing this is the


---------72:35----------
way that men communicate their approval


---------72:38----------
yeah


---------72:39----------
right yeah


---------72:40----------
it's the negative expression of a


---------72:42----------
positive affection


---------72:45----------
yeah that pisses me off sometimes i like


---------72:47----------
like i buy into that [ __ ] a lot good


---------72:49----------
because i just i'm programmed to do that


---------72:52----------
but sometimes i really get bothered by


---------72:54----------
the fact that


---------72:56----------
guys it's hard for it's hard for a lot


---------72:58----------
of men


---------72:59----------
and i think that's getting better which


---------73:01----------
is it gives me a sign it's a sign of um


---------73:05----------
it's a sign that you should be


---------73:06----------
optimistic about where things are headed


---------73:08----------
everybody talks about how everybody's


---------73:09----------
becoming such sensitive babies these


---------73:10----------
days it's all [ __ ] because i think


---------73:12----------
it's a good thing that that men are


---------73:14----------
starting to feel more


---------73:15----------
safe to express those emotions but yeah


---------73:18----------
it does bother me sometimes i wish


---------73:19----------
people i wish


---------73:20----------
friends could just simply just say like


---------73:22----------
i'm [ __ ] proud of you you did a good


---------73:24----------
thing that's so great without having to


---------73:26----------
wrap it into some sarcastic


---------73:28----------
yeah you know [ __ ] whatever i mean


---------73:31----------
20 years ago if we were crying the way


---------73:33----------
that we were 20 you know maybe half an


---------73:35----------
hour ago we'd have to toss out no homos


---------73:38----------
right yeah people yeah people would be


---------73:39----------
like you know people can see you right


---------73:41----------
like this is live and they can actually


---------73:42----------
see you crying yeah


---------73:44----------
and we were crying and what are we doing


---------73:45----------
now hutch


---------73:47----------
we're smiling yeah


---------73:49----------
yeah right so i if that bothers you i


---------73:52----------
want to actually commend you


---------73:54----------
because you coming on here and


---------73:56----------
expressing your emotions


---------73:59----------
is going to be rewiring the neurons of


---------74:01----------
every person who's watching they're


---------74:03----------
going to be learning


---------74:05----------
right that it's actually okay to express


---------74:07----------
myself


---------74:08----------
that i don't have to rap


---------74:10----------
i sure hope so yeah and i think that's


---------74:12----------
what you're doing with your podcast too


---------74:14----------
i think you're showing people that it's


---------74:16----------
okay to struggle


---------74:20----------
yeah that's the goal yeah


---------74:23----------
kind of


---------74:25----------
did you um i wanted to kind of go back


---------74:27----------
to this conflict for a second


---------74:29----------
which conflict so just the not enough


---------74:31----------
business


---------74:32----------
um yeah


---------74:34----------
i just want to kind of tie that up if


---------74:36----------
you have other questions um that's fine


---------74:38----------
but


---------74:38----------
uh you know so here's what i sort of


---------74:40----------
understand there's a part of you that's


---------74:42----------
felt like for a long time


---------74:44----------
you haven't felt like you


---------74:45----------
it's enough did you kind of get what i


---------74:47----------
was saying that


---------74:49----------
that


---------74:51----------
how can i say this so sometimes we have


---------74:53----------
these things in our minds that are


---------74:54----------
looking for excuses


---------74:56----------
so the best example i can come up with


---------74:58----------
is i i had a i'd have a patient who had


---------75:01----------
been


---------75:02----------
cheated on


---------75:04----------
by someone they cared about a lot


---------75:06----------
um they found out like just before they


---------75:07----------
got married and so they called the


---------75:08----------
wedding off quite traumatized for it and


---------75:11----------
then their


---------75:12----------
afterward their mind would like look for


---------75:14----------
reasons


---------75:16----------
why their future partners would be


---------75:17----------
cheating on them they were like paranoid


---------75:19----------
for it does that make sense yeah and and


---------75:22----------
so what happens is in our mind once we


---------75:23----------
have a belief about ourselves like i'm


---------75:26----------
not worthy enough like i'm like she


---------75:28----------
started to think really negatively about


---------75:29----------
herself right because when you get


---------75:31----------
cheated on you feel like you did


---------75:32----------
something wrong you could blame the


---------75:34----------
other person


---------75:36----------
but you also feel like there's something


---------75:37----------
fundamentally wrong with you and so any


---------75:40----------
sign in the external world for her


---------75:42----------
internal psychological complex she'd


---------75:43----------
like latch on to


---------75:45----------
okay yeah i see right and so that's just


---------75:48----------
how the mind works like once i have a


---------75:49----------
belief about something you can see this


---------75:50----------
in politics because you know i know you


---------75:52----------
do some political content now like


---------75:54----------
people who have a political belief will


---------75:57----------
sift information to reinforce whatever


---------75:59----------
they believe


---------76:01----------
so it's just a function of the brain


---------76:03----------
it's a function of our psychology and if


---------76:05----------
you have this thing in in you this


---------76:07----------
authoritative voice that tells you i'm


---------76:09----------
not enough


---------76:10----------
it's gonna find whatever it needs to


---------76:12----------
from time to time depending on your


---------76:15----------
emotional state like if you're feeling


---------76:16----------
good about yourself the voice will be


---------76:18----------
quiet but if you ever start getting into


---------76:20----------
a dark place it'll reactivate and it'll


---------76:23----------
find reasons


---------76:24----------
and boy the death of your sister is just


---------76:26----------
a juice like how on earth are you gonna


---------76:28----------
fight against its authority there it's


---------76:30----------
not even a contest


---------76:32----------
and no wonder you say yes sir when it


---------76:35----------
says something to you now because it's


---------76:37----------
playing the trump card you didn't call


---------76:38----------
her enough


---------76:40----------
you know


---------76:41----------
yeah


---------76:43----------
it


---------76:44----------
and


---------76:45----------
as that part of you so how do you deal


---------76:47----------
with that one is i'm seeing that you're


---------76:48----------
starting to deal with it already because


---------76:50----------
you're starting to recognize oh like i


---------76:51----------
used to be this degenerate on on youtube


---------76:54----------
and now i've like cleaned myself up and


---------76:56----------
people are like


---------76:57----------
they're like


---------76:58----------
good job


---------77:00----------
right


---------77:01----------
and so you can and but there's there's


---------77:03----------
still that conflict and then there's


---------77:04----------
also these other confusing things that


---------77:06----------
you have about you know if i really fix


---------77:08----------
myself if i get to be like completely


---------77:10----------
normal like what if people don't think


---------77:12----------
i'm funny because so much of our


---------77:14----------
humor comes from pain


---------77:16----------
and this is where i'd reassure you hutch


---------77:18----------
just because you feel better about


---------77:20----------
yourself doesn't mean you're going to


---------77:22----------
lose access to that


---------77:25----------
you'll know what it feels like to be in


---------77:27----------
pain you'll be able to you know it's an


---------77:30----------
old friend


---------77:32----------
you don't need a gps to navigate that


---------77:34----------
road anymore


---------77:35----------
like you know it by heart


---------77:37----------
and it's


---------77:39----------
going i wanted to ask you a question um


---------77:40----------
yeah is the problem of identity of


---------77:43----------
people not having a strong sense of who


---------77:44----------
they are is this a common


---------77:46----------
thing that's out there


---------77:48----------
i mean it's just something that i i've


---------77:49----------
struggled with


---------77:51----------
in such a


---------77:52----------
pronounced way for my whole life


---------77:55----------
and i see some people


---------77:56----------
obviously i don't have access to like


---------77:58----------
every detail of their lives but they


---------77:59----------
seem so comfortable in their own skin


---------78:01----------
and


---------78:02----------
i feel like an alien a lot of the times


---------78:04----------
just wondering how common that is


---------78:07----------
yeah so it's a universal human condition


---------78:10----------
and it's getting worse


---------78:12----------
so if you look at like you know the


---------78:14----------
sense of who you are as a person we


---------78:16----------
talked a little bit about how not being


---------78:17----------
enough like that's not a real thing


---------78:20----------
like literally it's not a scientific


---------78:22----------
thing it's a construction of the mind


---------78:24----------
you are what you are and the more that


---------78:26----------
you begin to realize that the more


---------78:27----------
comfortable you'll be in your own skin


---------78:29----------
because he can't be any different


---------78:31----------
is it again is it getting worse because


---------78:32----------
of social media and the students


---------78:34----------
yeah yes


---------78:36----------
absolutely


---------78:37----------
and why would you ask about social media


---------78:39----------
what's your hypothesis there


---------78:41----------
oh i mean i just spend way


---------78:43----------
way too much time on twitter sometimes


---------78:45----------
like


---------78:46----------
way too much time and um it's gotten


---------78:48----------
better but i still have days where i'll


---------78:51----------
be on twitter interacting with people


---------78:53----------
for like eight hours


---------78:54----------
and i feel like absolute [ __ ] at the end


---------78:56----------
of it


---------78:58----------
and then i wake up the next day and


---------78:59----------
maybe do it again like it's it's it's


---------79:01----------
like uh sort of like alcoholism in that


---------79:04----------
yeah absolutely


---------79:05----------
so let's talk about that for a second


---------79:07----------
and then we'll talk about you and why


---------79:10----------
it's been hard for you and what that


---------79:11----------
means for your garma


---------79:13----------
okay so


---------79:15----------
yep oh yeah we're gonna go off the rails


---------79:17----------
now you ready okay i'm down


---------79:19----------
so hutch the first thing to understand


---------79:21----------
is that there's a self you remember how


---------79:23----------
he's talking about there's turbulent


---------79:24----------
stuff at the top and then there's you


---------79:26----------
down below


---------79:28----------
yep so the buddha called that the buddha


---------79:32----------
buddhism


---------79:33----------
he called that the self


---------79:35----------
the interesting thing is if you look at


---------79:36----------
ask these like yogi's from thousands of


---------79:39----------
years ago


---------79:40----------
what is the self the answer they came up


---------79:42----------
with was neti neti and neti means not


---------79:45----------
this


---------79:47----------
so if you ask someone if you ask these


---------79:48----------
yogis what is the self is it


---------79:50----------
a person they'll say


---------79:52----------
it's not that


---------79:54----------
is it


---------79:56----------
a cosmic thing they'll say it's not that


---------79:58----------
is it black not that is it white not


---------80:00----------
that


---------80:01----------
is it conscious they'll say no is it


---------80:03----------
unconscious no


---------80:05----------
they the self is formless


---------80:08----------
and so i know it sounds kind of weird


---------80:09----------
but we'll ask you to do this in a second


---------80:11----------
you know i'll ask you to like meditate


---------80:12----------
so like close your eyes and notice that


---------80:14----------
there's like an experiencer we'll go


---------80:16----------
through this more formally in a second


---------80:18----------
okay


---------80:19----------
but like there is a thing no not right


---------80:22----------
now


---------80:23----------
there's a thing that experiences all of


---------80:26----------
your life


---------80:27----------
so the experiences can be separated


---------80:29----------
there's happiness and sadness but who is


---------80:32----------
the person who is experiencing the


---------80:34----------
happiness or sadness


---------80:36----------
it kind of goes like one level like


---------80:38----------
deeper into the matrix


---------80:41----------
and what they sort of realized is they


---------80:42----------
followed the the matrix all the way back


---------80:45----------
to its source and what they found was


---------80:47----------
the self


---------80:49----------
so then what they sort of discovered is


---------80:51----------
that that thing is formless and we'll


---------80:52----------
we'll show you how to get there in a


---------80:54----------
second sort of or take one step


---------80:56----------
then what they realized is that we also


---------80:58----------
have an identity but the identity and


---------81:00----------
the self are two different things so the


---------81:02----------
identity is what they call the ahamgara


---------81:04----------
or the ego


---------81:05----------
and the identity is anything about you


---------81:09----------
it is not you it is anything about you


---------81:11----------
so anything you can put down on a piece


---------81:13----------
of paper


---------81:15----------
is part of your ego but it's not really


---------81:17----------
who you are


---------81:18----------
so for example i call you hutch


---------81:21----------
is that your name


---------81:23----------
well sure i mean my first name is sean


---------81:27----------
but people call you hutch


---------81:29----------
yeah people call you sean


---------81:32----------
which one is you


---------81:35----------
i think they're both me


---------81:37----------
how does that work


---------81:40----------
i don't know i didn't think about it


---------81:41----------
that much i just answered reflexively


---------81:43----------
yeah it's weird right so like i would


---------81:45----------
say that those things are both you and


---------81:47----------
neither of them are you


---------81:49----------
right if i like


---------81:51----------
you know does your nephew know that your


---------81:53----------
name is sean


---------81:56----------
i don't know he's very very young so i i


---------81:58----------
don't i don't know if he knows my name


---------82:00----------
quite yet the answer is probably no but


---------82:02----------
does he know who you are


---------82:04----------
yeah


---------82:05----------
how's that possible


---------82:08----------
um because this little tiny human brain


---------82:10----------
is


---------82:11----------
forming memories


---------82:13----------
sure right so there's something going on


---------82:15----------
there but name isn't a part of it


---------82:17----------
so if you think about who am i


---------82:19----------
if you ask me who am i i'm going to say


---------82:20----------
my name i'm all look like the first


---------82:23----------
thing that we answer with is actually


---------82:24----------
false it's not who we are it's just


---------82:26----------
something that we attach to ourselves


---------82:28----------
anything that you put on a resume is not


---------82:30----------
who you are it's part of your identity


---------82:32----------
for sure but it's not part of the self


---------82:35----------
and so the fundamental confusion that we


---------82:37----------
have is we start to identify with our


---------82:40----------
identity which we can't really blame


---------82:42----------
ourselves for right because when i think


---------82:44----------
about like if i start to think of myself


---------82:45----------
as like i'm a doctor and i


---------82:48----------
attach myself to that identity or i


---------82:50----------
think of to myself as i'm someone who


---------82:52----------
applied to medical school three times in


---------82:53----------
a row and failed to get in


---------82:55----------
that's all part of identity it's all


---------82:56----------
things that i can put on my resume it's


---------82:58----------
like people can ask me about it but it's


---------83:00----------
not who i am


---------83:02----------
right it's just attributes of my life


---------83:05----------
and that's where our suffering comes


---------83:07----------
from because when i start to attach


---------83:09----------
myself of being a doctor i can become


---------83:11----------
prideful which is going to be a source


---------83:13----------
of suffering because once i have pride


---------83:15----------
there are doctors who are better than i


---------83:16----------
am why don't i get


---------83:18----------
respected as much as other people do


---------83:20----------
you know they're doctors on tick tock


---------83:22----------
who have more followers than i do


---------83:25----------
so any kind of seemingly positive thing


---------83:28----------
that comes out of identity actually


---------83:30----------
brings suffering with it and then what


---------83:31----------
if i lose my medical license then


---------83:34----------
suffering comes with it


---------83:36----------
so all of the attributes


---------83:39----------
of our of our identity are the cause of


---------83:41----------
our suffering that's what with the would


---------83:42----------
say and that the closer that you get to


---------83:45----------
who you are


---------83:46----------
and you sort of remember this right


---------83:48----------
because you had this fluctuating


---------83:49----------
identity didn't matter what the [ __ ] it


---------83:51----------
was like it could have been whatever it


---------83:52----------
still sucked


---------83:54----------
until you got the hell away from all of


---------83:56----------
it


---------83:59----------
and i would venture that i don't know if


---------84:00----------
you've ever put your nephew to sleep but


---------84:02----------
if you've ever put your nephew to sleep


---------84:04----------
if you haven't you should try it


---------84:05----------
sometime you know hopefully


---------84:08----------
he lives all the way up in the bay area


---------84:09----------
so i don't get to see him as much so


---------84:10----------
maybe one day you'll have kids and then


---------84:12----------
you'll understand this when you put your


---------84:14----------
kid to sleep like there's no hutch


---------84:17----------
there's no content creator there's no


---------84:20----------
or maybe you've got a fiance right so i


---------84:22----------
don't know if you've like ever fallen


---------84:23----------
asleep with your fiance or she's ever


---------84:25----------
fallen asleep and you just like laid in


---------84:26----------
bed with her and in that moment like


---------84:28----------
you're not you don't have a beard


---------84:31----------
you don't have a certain hair color


---------84:32----------
you're not like a particular height you


---------84:34----------
just are you


---------84:35----------
and you're holding her and there's just


---------84:37----------
an experience there


---------84:39----------
and the more that you tap into that


---------84:41----------
experience or you don't have a bank


---------84:42----------
account you don't have a mortgage you


---------84:44----------
don't even have a name you're just like


---------84:46----------
a human and you're in enveloped within


---------84:49----------
that experience and it feels [ __ ]


---------84:50----------
amazing


---------84:52----------
watching a sunset


---------84:55----------
you know


---------84:56----------
yeah


---------84:57----------
like


---------84:58----------
taking a really good piss


---------85:01----------
after you've been driving for a long


---------85:02----------
time


---------85:03----------
and at that point yeah i chase i chased


---------85:06----------
that feeling that that


---------85:07----------
clarity i suppose you could call it the


---------85:09----------
the


---------85:10----------
stillness i i've chased that feeling


---------85:13----------
with all kinds of destructive ways


---------85:14----------
throughout my life because my


---------85:16----------
thoughts are so loud


---------85:18----------
and so gambling that would quiet those


---------85:20----------
thoughts or drugs may have quieted those


---------85:23----------
thoughts or sex may have quieted those


---------85:25----------
thoughts and so beautiful or or


---------85:27----------
obsessively playing video games or chess


---------85:29----------
i mean just i would chase that feeling


---------85:31----------
of stillness because whenever i would


---------85:33----------
not have something to stimulate my mind


---------85:35----------
these loud negative thoughts would just


---------85:37----------
sort of


---------85:38----------
swim in my mind with you a hundred


---------85:40----------
percent right so now we come to social


---------85:42----------
media and dopamine


---------85:44----------
yeah so what happens so first thing is


---------85:46----------
that social media amplifies our ego


---------85:49----------
because what we're doing is we're not


---------85:51----------
showing we're showing ourselves to the


---------85:53----------
world right it's all about display it's


---------85:56----------
all about resume it's all about what you


---------85:58----------
show it's not about who you are


---------86:01----------
and so is where that we actually have a


---------86:03----------
lot of like stuff that is moving us away


---------86:06----------
from our


---------86:07----------
self and into our identity and so


---------86:09----------
suffering is coming with it but holy


---------86:11----------
[ __ ] is it dopaminergically reinforcing


---------86:14----------
because it feels good


---------86:16----------
right sometimes


---------86:18----------
yeah and it and it feels bad which then


---------86:20----------
begs the question why on earth are we


---------86:22----------
doing it if it feels bad so you know


---------86:24----------
like you're kind of saying you're on


---------86:25----------
twitter for eight hours and that's where


---------86:26----------
like what's happening is we're getting


---------86:28----------
like that dopamine reinforcement without


---------86:29----------
any sort of like spiritual gratification


---------86:32----------
it's like spiritually empty


---------86:34----------
yes right and so this is where what we


---------86:36----------
we tend to find is that people chase


---------86:39----------
oblivion they chase the stillness they


---------86:41----------
actually chase nirvana which is like the


---------86:44----------
state of enlightenment


---------86:45----------
with drugs


---------86:47----------
because it like it gets us kind of close


---------86:50----------
to there


---------86:51----------
and this is why like buddha figured this


---------86:53----------
out and he was like


---------86:54----------
you can get to that sense of peace


---------86:58----------
consistently and even permanently you


---------87:00----------
can live in that way where 24 7 you are


---------87:04----------
detached from your identity and you're


---------87:06----------
just living as an experiencer and that


---------87:08----------
is enlightenment


---------87:09----------
and he was like that would work in the


---------87:10----------
western world but yeah


---------87:12----------
so it it wouldn't


---------87:14----------
right so this is the challenge is that


---------87:16----------
like someone who's enlightened doesn't


---------87:19----------
care about their resume and so they


---------87:21----------
won't necessarily chase success and so


---------87:23----------
it is problematic


---------87:25----------
he ran into a lot of problems in his


---------87:26----------
material life


---------87:29----------
and then we kind of get to why you've


---------87:31----------
struggled for it


---------87:32----------
why this has been a problem for you and


---------87:35----------
that's because your karma


---------87:37----------
is


---------87:37----------
to learn


---------87:39----------
so i think you've been given so i've


---------87:40----------
noticed this really interesting trend


---------87:42----------
which is that people who have a lot to


---------87:43----------
be grateful for suffer a lot in terms of


---------87:46----------
questions of like identity


---------87:50----------
and so there's an interesting there's


---------87:51----------
even an interesting theory that


---------87:53----------
the more ready you are for spiritual


---------87:56----------
growth the greater advantages you'll be


---------87:58----------
born with


---------88:00----------
because you can't meditate on an empty


---------88:02----------
stomach you can't chase enlightenment if


---------88:05----------
you have to worry about making rent at


---------88:06----------
the end of the month


---------88:07----------
literally the adrenaline and cortisol


---------88:09----------
and the stress you don't have time for


---------88:11----------
any of that crap


---------88:15----------
and it feels a bit


---------88:17----------
i i don't know if it feels a bit like


---------88:21----------
earlier than now though


---------88:22----------
it looked like well i had good karma


---------88:25----------
therefore i've been you know i've had


---------88:26----------
some yeah


---------88:28----------
so i don't like thinking about it in


---------88:29----------
terms of separating me from other people


---------88:31----------
it could have been just a crap shoot


---------88:32----------
just total luck luck of the draw yeah so


---------88:35----------
that's your ego as well


---------88:37----------
so any comparison that you make to


---------88:38----------
another person is your ego


---------88:42----------
okay we're not talking about other


---------88:43----------
people we're talking about you


---------88:46----------
okay you know if you think about taking


---------88:47----------
care of your nephew does that make you a


---------88:49----------
better uncle than most people


---------88:51----------
sure


---------88:52----------
most people aren't going to do as much


---------88:53----------
for their nephew as you will


---------88:55----------
because


---------88:56----------
most people's enough you still have a


---------88:57----------
mom


---------88:58----------
but we're not concerned about them we're


---------88:59----------
not saying that you're holier than now


---------89:01----------
it's just it's your [ __ ] duty


---------89:03----------
it is it is you


---------89:05----------
has nothing to do with anyone else


---------89:07----------
all right


---------89:09----------
so i wouldn't worry about that like


---------89:10----------
seriously


---------89:11----------
this is an important point and it's all


---------89:13----------
there it's their karma too don't worry


---------89:15----------
about it


---------89:17----------
so i say this to a lot of people


---------89:18----------
but it's important for you to understand


---------89:20----------
that like this like this is an important


---------89:22----------
question for like your growth as a human


---------89:25----------
you know and i think you're grappling


---------89:27----------
with which i think is super healthy like


---------89:28----------
it's fantastic


---------89:30----------
the question being who am i or what yes


---------89:32----------
yes


---------89:34----------
and this idea of like you know when i


---------89:35----------
share with you that you're not and not


---------89:37----------
not enough is not a real thing


---------89:41----------
all you've ever been is what you are and


---------89:43----------
all you will ever be is what you are


---------89:46----------
and the more centered you become in that


---------89:49----------
the happier you'll


---------89:50----------
be i get kind of tripped up on i just


---------89:54----------
sometimes i think about


---------89:55----------
the fact that i'm one bad year away from


---------89:59----------
being a monster you know like i don't


---------90:01----------
if i go through some


---------90:03----------
some people that we we consider to be


---------90:04----------
evil or whatever um


---------90:08----------
they had a


---------90:09----------
young self they had a young pure self at


---------90:12----------
one point and then something happened to


---------90:14----------
them people don't choose to become evil


---------90:16----------
and do evil things


---------90:18----------
so sometimes i think about like the


---------90:20----------
fragility of


---------90:21----------
of uh identity and how it can be broken


---------90:24----------
down by horrible and traumatic


---------90:25----------
experiences and i get afraid


---------90:28----------
and what if something really [ __ ] up


---------90:29----------
happens to me and then


---------90:30----------
i turn into a monster i i don't think


---------90:32----------
about that so much any anymore these


---------90:34----------
days i'm i have those thoughts less but


---------90:36----------
that was one thing i got really tripped


---------90:38----------
up on when i was about


---------90:39----------
19 or 20


---------90:40----------
i couldn't see a meaningful difference


---------90:42----------
between me and


---------90:43----------
you know evil people


---------90:45----------
it's all turbulence at the top


---------90:49----------
i'm not saying that you didn't see i'm


---------90:51----------
with you


---------90:53----------
that you had those thoughts


---------90:55----------
but


---------90:56----------
even if you're a monster i know it


---------90:57----------
sounds kind of weird


---------90:59----------
you are what you


---------91:00----------
are right and i know that sounds kind of


---------91:03----------
like a weird spiritual statement but


---------91:05----------
it's actually like a scientific


---------91:06----------
statement no you can't you know and so


---------91:09----------
that's where like and the more you begin


---------91:12----------
to understand that


---------91:14----------
like sometimes you got to be careful


---------91:15----------
because you'll have like false gurus


---------91:17----------
who will use that as justification to do


---------91:20----------
horrendous things


---------91:22----------
the most common example is you know


---------91:23----------
spiritual gurus who put their dick where


---------91:25----------
it doesn't belong


---------91:26----------
no that happens


---------91:28----------
all the time


---------91:30----------
so but but i actually think that on some


---------91:32----------
level like you know you have to


---------91:34----------
understand that we're all one step away


---------91:35----------
from becoming a monster


---------91:37----------
that's how we


---------91:39----------
you have to respect it


---------91:41----------
right that's what's going to make you


---------91:43----------
like a good person


---------91:45----------
like is like the the people the people


---------91:47----------
who commit the worst evils in the world


---------91:50----------
are the ones who are convinced that


---------91:51----------
they're righteous and they're not


---------91:52----------
monsters


---------91:56----------
sure yeah


---------91:57----------
so so i and i think this this also goes


---------91:59----------
into


---------92:00----------
like


---------92:01----------
non-dualism and things like that but


---------92:03----------
this is just the idea that there's


---------92:04----------
neither good nor bad there's just what


---------92:06----------
is like like you know go outside and


---------92:08----------
look at a flower is the flower good or


---------92:10----------
is it bad then look at a blade of grass


---------92:12----------
is the blade of grass good or bad now if


---------92:14----------
your mind is comparative it'll say that


---------92:16----------
the flower is prettier than the blade of


---------92:18----------
grass then you'll assign a judgment you


---------92:20----------
won't accept things as they are and then


---------92:22----------
you'll elevate some people and you'll


---------92:24----------
you'll denigrate others


---------92:25----------
the blade of grass is just doing its


---------92:27----------
thing


---------92:28----------
you know yeah that's isn't that more or


---------92:30----------
less the whole point of the yin yang the


---------92:32----------
the fact that the it's all encompassed


---------92:34----------
in one circle so that's duality is an


---------92:36----------
illusion


---------92:37----------
yes


---------92:38----------
yes yeah


---------92:41----------
yeah and so are you a monster or are you


---------92:43----------
a good person


---------92:46----------
i mean i can be a shitty person for sure


---------92:48----------
but i i


---------92:50----------
i genuinely try to be a good person i


---------92:51----------
try to be an empathetic person yeah so i


---------92:54----------
think as long as you live that way right


---------92:56----------
so as long as you recognize that there's


---------92:59----------
both within you


---------93:01----------
then i think you'll move towards being a


---------93:03----------
better person


---------93:06----------
and and if we think about like you know


---------93:07----------
what that core is that core of you is


---------93:09----------
capable of everything and nothing are


---------93:11----------
you sean or you hutch well i'm kind of


---------93:12----------
both


---------93:15----------
and there are arguments to be made that


---------93:16----------
that's a contradiction that you can't be


---------93:18----------
two people sean


---------93:21----------
right people will say like you can't be


---------93:22----------
both that's stupid you got to have one


---------93:24----------
name but no that's not how it is they're


---------93:26----------
neat it's neither you you're not a


---------93:29----------
monster you're not a good person you are


---------93:30----------
what you are


---------93:33----------
everything and nothing


---------93:34----------
yep yeah


---------93:39----------
yeah okay


---------93:41----------
well you've given me a lot to think


---------93:43----------
about


---------93:44----------
that's what we're here for


---------93:47----------
um i've really enjoyed this conversation


---------93:49----------
by the way thanks thank you for having


---------93:50----------
me on i appreciate the insight me too


---------93:53----------
how do you feel about learning a little


---------93:54----------
bit of meditation


---------93:58----------
uh


---------93:59----------
my thoughts get loud but i'm down i'm


---------94:02----------
i'm open to the experience okay


---------94:05----------
so


---------94:06----------
if this isn't um


---------94:10----------
if this is hard for you not a big deal


---------94:12----------
there are other techniques that we'll


---------94:14----------
we'll send you so we have a we made a


---------94:16----------
meditation guide and you should get


---------94:17----------
access to that just because you're a


---------94:19----------
guest on stream so you know you can


---------94:21----------
watch that and there are a bunch of


---------94:22----------
techniques like introductory things that


---------94:24----------
you can start with but based on where


---------94:26----------
you are there's a particular technique


---------94:29----------
that i want to share with you


---------94:31----------
and it's kind of tricky so it's sort of


---------94:33----------
an advanced technique and you may not be


---------94:35----------
ready for it yet you may have to work up


---------94:36----------
to it but i still want to share it with


---------94:38----------
you okay


---------94:39----------
so


---------94:41----------
i'm going to start reading to you okay


---------94:44----------
but what i want you to do is close your


---------94:46----------
so sit up straight so your spine should


---------94:47----------
be straight when you meditate and then


---------94:49----------
i'm going to start saying different


---------94:50----------
things to you okay


---------94:52----------
but what i and that i'm going to


---------94:53----------
instruct you to pay attention to


---------94:57----------
different things while i'm speaking to


---------94:58----------
you it's gonna be weird okay so first


---------95:01----------
i'm gonna ask you to pay attention to


---------95:03----------
the words


---------95:04----------
that i'm saying


---------95:06----------
all right


---------95:07----------
and then what i'm gonna ask you to pay


---------95:09----------
attention to is not the words


---------95:12----------
but where the words enter your ear


---------95:16----------
so i want you to notice not what you


---------95:18----------
hear


---------95:19----------
but the faculty of hearing


---------95:22----------
does that make sense


---------95:23----------
yeah


---------95:25----------
and so what we're going to sort of


---------95:26----------
recognize is that the words are outside


---------95:29----------
of you right there's you and then


---------95:31----------
there's the words on the outside with me


---------95:33----------
yeah


---------95:34----------
and how do we determine that the words


---------95:36----------
are on the outside it's because you are


---------95:38----------
observing them so you're the observer


---------95:40----------
and they're the object of observation


---------95:42----------
right


---------95:44----------
and so then what's going to happen is


---------95:45----------
when i ask you to observe the faculty of


---------95:47----------
hearing is the faculty of hearing a part


---------95:50----------
of you or is it then outside of you


---------95:56----------
okay so i know it's it's weird


---------95:59----------
feels inside i don't know it does feel


---------96:01----------
inside that's why we're gonna do this


---------96:03----------
practice okay


---------96:06----------
so


---------96:07----------
um i want you to start by listening to


---------96:09----------
my words okay


---------96:11----------
and just try to you know interpret them


---------96:14----------
and understand them so the development


---------96:16----------
of adult attachment styles for lessons


---------96:19----------
why are some adults secure or insecure


---------96:21----------
in their relationships the authors


---------96:23----------
review four lessons they have learned


---------96:25----------
from longitudinal research on the


---------96:28----------
developmental antecedents of adult


---------96:30----------
attachment styles


---------96:31----------
first although adult attachment appears


---------96:34----------
to have its origins in early caregiving


---------96:36----------
experiences


---------96:37----------
those associations are weak and


---------96:40----------
inconsistent across measurement domains


---------96:43----------
second attachment styles appear to be


---------96:46----------
more malleable in childhood and


---------96:48----------
adolescence


---------96:49----------
so now what i want you to do is don't


---------96:51----------
listen to my words i'm gonna keep


---------96:53----------
reading but i want you to pay attention


---------96:55----------
to the faculty of hearing


---------96:57----------
notice your ability to hear


---------96:59----------
and don't really focus on the words okay


---------97:03----------
third early experiences do not determine


---------97:05----------
adult outcomes fourth there is still a


---------97:08----------
lot to learn and future research


---------97:10----------
requires examining relationship specific


---------97:13----------
attachment patterns the distinction


---------97:15----------
between distal and proximal factors and


---------97:18----------
interactions between relational and


---------97:20----------
genetic vulnerabilities

---------97:35----------
so now what i want you to do i'm going


---------97:37----------
to keep reading to you in a second


---------97:39----------
is


---------97:41----------
move between hearing my words right now


---------97:44----------
and noticing the faculty of hearing


---------97:48----------
and notice that as the experiencer


---------97:51----------
you can observe the words on the outside


---------97:53----------
and the words are on the outside and the


---------97:54----------
person who experiences it is on the


---------97:56----------
inside


---------97:58----------
but as you notice now go to the faculty


---------98:00----------
of hearing


---------98:01----------
and notice that as you as you move into


---------98:03----------
the faculty of hearing suddenly the


---------98:05----------
experiencer goes further within


---------98:08----------
and your ability to hear


---------98:12----------
is actually


---------98:13----------
outside of you now you're observing it


---------98:16----------
from within


---------98:17----------
it's no longer a part of you but is


---------98:20----------
actually outside of you


---------98:23----------
and now what we're gonna do is open your


---------98:25----------
eyes


---------98:28----------
and look at my face


---------98:30----------
and see my face


---------98:32----------
see the different now look at your room


---------98:35----------
notice all the different objects in your


---------98:37----------
room


---------98:39----------
and i want you to pick one direction


---------98:43----------
and instead of looking at an object let


---------98:45----------
your eyes remain open


---------98:48----------
notice the faculty of sight


---------98:51----------
so notice that there is a looking not on


---------98:54----------
any particular object


---------98:56----------
but that there's like all sorts of


---------98:57----------
objects there and that there's a looker


---------99:00----------
and put your attention on the site


---------99:02----------
itself not the object of the site


---------99:10----------
does that make sense


---------99:12----------
as much as it can


---------99:15----------
and so if you want to do the third level


---------99:17----------
of this practice


---------99:20----------
you can actually


---------99:22----------
notice the faculty of sight


---------99:24----------
okay


---------99:25----------
then what you can do is look at a


---------99:27----------
picture of your sister


---------99:29----------
and what you'll see is that within the


---------99:31----------
when you look at the picture of sister


---------99:33----------
there's the object


---------99:36----------
you can notice the faculty of sight and


---------99:38----------
then there's an internal emotional


---------99:40----------
experience that'll happen when you see


---------99:41----------
her and then what i want you to do is


---------99:44----------
zoom out and look at that emotional


---------99:46----------
experience there will be sadness there


---------99:47----------
will be grief there will be tragedy


---------99:48----------
there will be love but you can even take


---------99:50----------
a step back from that and just look at


---------99:52----------
all of those feelings


---------99:54----------
and when you keep on going all the way


---------99:57----------
inside what you'll notice is that


---------100:00----------
even though you feel sad there will be


---------100:02----------
peace in spite of the sadness


---------100:05----------
and then eventually if you keep going


---------100:07----------
you'll find what's at the bottom of the


---------100:08----------
ocean and that everything above it is


---------100:10----------
waves


---------100:14----------
is that the same thing as catharsis


---------100:21----------
so i'd say catharsis is a slice of this


---------100:24----------
process but it goes deeper than


---------100:26----------
catharsis


---------100:29----------
yeah


---------100:30----------
so


---------100:31----------
what a what catharsis is what i'd say is


---------100:34----------
that as long as the mind is turbulent we


---------100:36----------
can't see inside and all the knowledge


---------100:38----------
is really at the bottom


---------100:41----------
what catharsis is is like


---------100:43----------
a moment where all the waves are still


---------100:46----------
and then we can see into something and


---------100:48----------
then we have like this revelation that


---------100:50----------
is like transformative


---------100:52----------
yeah


---------100:54----------
but it goes even deeper than that


---------100:56----------
so i'd say that


---------100:58----------
there are stages of enlightenment and


---------101:00----------
i'd say catharsis is arguably like


---------101:02----------
catharsis in the flow state or like


---------101:04----------
early early early stages of some idea or


---------101:07----------
temporary enlightenment


---------101:10----------
okay gotcha


---------101:13----------
well i did feel um


---------101:15----------
a bit calmer after that exercise


---------101:17----------
immediately opening opening my eyes felt


---------101:20----------
like i was in a different place


---------101:22----------
yeah so you know i think the good news


---------101:24----------
is that the spiritual stuff like we


---------101:26----------
don't really know


---------101:28----------
much


---------101:29----------
if any of that [ __ ] works we just don't


---------101:31----------
know there just isn't data the good news


---------101:34----------
is that any of it will affect your


---------101:36----------
cortisol and neuro adrenaline


---------101:38----------
any of it will affect your co2 your


---------101:40----------
respiratory rate your o2


---------101:42----------
all those things no spiritual stuff


---------101:44----------
aside from like a physiologic


---------101:46----------
perspective there's overwhelming data


---------101:48----------
that you know any kind of mindfulness


---------101:49----------
practice will help


---------101:51----------
so at the least you'll get some kind of


---------101:52----------
physiologic benefit and if any of this


---------101:55----------
weird spiritual stuff happens to be


---------101:56----------
correct you may get something a little


---------101:58----------
bit more


---------101:59----------
how often do you meditate


---------102:01----------
do you do it every day every day


---------102:04----------
so i do different kinds of meditation


---------102:05----------
there's one sort of meditation that i've


---------102:07----------
done every day


---------102:09----------
but at a minimum of three breaths is is


---------102:12----------
like kind of the core meditation that i


---------102:13----------
do and then i'll do like formal


---------102:15----------
meditation practices maybe about 20


---------102:17----------
minutes a day three to five days a week


---------102:21----------
okay


---------102:23----------
it sounds like a realistic goal yeah so


---------102:25----------
i'd start with five minutes and it i


---------102:27----------
don't know if you know but our practice


---------102:28----------
was like two or three minutes that's it


---------102:30----------
man


---------102:31----------
so like you don't have to do a whole lot


---------102:32----------
to feel a little bit better i was


---------102:34----------
teaching this one practice in the


---------102:36----------
emergency room that was like


---------102:38----------
180 seconds and people loved it it was


---------102:40----------
enough for them


---------102:42----------
but


---------102:44----------
cool i had um one more question for you


---------102:46----------
that's okay yeah you said that you


---------102:48----------
worked with um terminally ill patients


---------102:51----------
i'm wondering


---------102:53----------
what kind of an effect that had on you i


---------102:54----------
mean how did you


---------102:57----------
how do you not


---------102:58----------
succumb to the overwhelming sadness you


---------103:00----------
must have felt connecting with these


---------103:02----------
people that were coming to the end of


---------103:04----------
their lives what is it what does


---------103:05----------
maintenance for a therapist look like


---------103:08----------
it's a beautiful question so um how did


---------103:10----------
it affect me it helped me understand


---------103:13----------
life in a profound way


---------103:16----------
so i am grateful for that ex there's a


---------103:18----------
handful of experiences i'm really


---------103:20----------
grateful for and that's definitely the


---------103:21----------
top of the list


---------103:22----------
yeah you know we live our entire lives


---------103:26----------
like getting caught up with crap that


---------103:28----------
doesn't matter


---------103:30----------
talking about like oh you know so and so


---------103:32----------
didn't like invite me to their birthday


---------103:34----------
party


---------103:36----------
you know and like there's like even crap


---------103:38----------
going on like in the residency where


---------103:40----------
like


---------103:41----------
you know there's like a class president


---------103:42----------
and like people are applying for crap


---------103:44----------
and this person like five people are


---------103:46----------
applying for this grant and only one


---------103:47----------
person got it it's all kind of crap that


---------103:49----------
our ego


---------103:50----------
gets wrapped up in that we think is


---------103:52----------
important because it has to do with me


---------103:55----------
so the biggest lesson that i learned is


---------103:57----------
like a lot of that crap doesn't matter


---------103:58----------
really gives you perspective


---------104:00----------
yeah


---------104:01----------
and as for how i survived


---------104:04----------
well i noticed the emotions and then i


---------104:06----------
stepped away from them


---------104:08----------
let's see


---------104:10----------
right so like even like i was super sad


---------104:13----------
with you like i felt tragedy and so be


---------104:15----------
it


---------104:16----------
right that's not tragedy is not i know


---------104:18----------
it sounds kind of weird but it's not a


---------104:19----------
bad part of life it's just a part of


---------104:21----------
life


---------104:22----------
no i understand that


---------104:24----------

---------104:26----------

---------104:27----------
