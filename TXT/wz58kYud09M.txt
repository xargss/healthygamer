---------00:01----------
cool cool man so


---------00:03----------
i see you have a shirt that says your


---------00:04----------
name on i mean sorry uh


---------00:06----------
a hat yeah simple my mom made it i got a


---------00:10----------
i went bald recently for content and um


---------00:14----------
it was not a very good look so i'm a hat


---------00:17----------
guy now


---------00:18----------
you went bald for content what does that


---------00:20----------
mean


---------00:21----------
i was doing uh marbles do you know what


---------00:24----------
marbles is


---------00:25----------
nope it's like this thing where you can


---------00:27----------
have


---------00:28----------
some random marble win it's just


---------00:30----------
completely luck based


---------00:31----------
and one of the marbles was give myself a


---------00:34----------
haircut it was getting out of hand


---------00:36----------
quarantine and um i tried to do a


---------00:39----------
haircut


---------00:39----------
i did but it was going really bad so i


---------00:41----------
was like i'm gonna just cut it all off


---------00:43----------
so i ended up going bald it wasn't good


---------00:47----------
so it wasn't molding no i wasn't malden


---------00:50----------
i was probably kind of mauled in by the


---------00:52----------
end of it because then i was bald


---------00:53----------
but cool it wasn't yeah and do you


---------00:57----------
normally do your speed runs without a


---------00:58----------
shirt on


---------01:01----------
ah yeah people were asking if you were


---------01:05----------
going to have a shirt and i


---------01:06----------
i got a little bit scared


---------01:09----------
because i don't really know what i'm


---------01:10----------
getting myself into before i interview


---------01:12----------
someone


---------01:13----------
yeah but uh it just kind of became a


---------01:17----------
meme


---------01:17----------
i had like this reward i might on my


---------01:19----------
channel where you could have me take my


---------01:21----------
shirt off and then another reward where


---------01:22----------
you can have me put it back on people


---------01:26----------
would always just take it off so i was


---------01:27----------
just off a lot


---------01:28----------
and yeah it just happened while i had


---------01:31----------
world record and now everyone thinks i'm


---------01:32----------
just never wear a shirt


---------01:34----------
cool well i'm i mean i i feel a little


---------01:37----------
bit more comfortable with you wearing


---------01:38----------
your shirt today


---------01:40----------
i'm glad you're also wearing a shirt yep


---------01:43----------
and uh


---------01:44----------
you know i don't know about you but i'm


---------01:46----------
naked from the from below the waist


---------01:48----------
yeah because that's always that's the


---------01:50----------
advantage of


---------01:51----------
coving and you gotta let them breathe


---------01:53----------
got a lot of breathing


---------01:55----------
um and so you're uh you're a speed


---------01:57----------
runner for mario 64.


---------02:00----------
yeah one of my favorite games of all


---------02:02----------
time


---------02:03----------
it's a good game they they knocked it


---------02:05----------
out of the park


---------02:06----------
yeah they really did any um and so


---------02:10----------
how i mean help me understand like when


---------02:12----------
you're a speed runner for a game like


---------02:14----------
is that something that you do on a daily


---------02:16----------
basis or yeah


---------02:18----------
yeah so it's basically a grind like for


---------02:20----------
months at a time i mean i


---------02:22----------
started playing you take a lot of breaks


---------02:24----------
like i've gotten a lot of burnout but i


---------02:25----------
started playing the game in 2012


---------02:27----------
on and off since then so for the past


---------02:29----------
eight years and


---------02:31----------
for the past it's been about nine months


---------02:34----------
now


---------02:34----------
nine ten months i've been pretty much


---------02:36----------
playing it almost every day


---------02:37----------
and just trying to lower my time and


---------02:39----------
like a typical stream is just


---------02:41----------
restarting over and over for like


---------02:44----------
upwards of six eight hours and just


---------02:46----------
trying to beat your best run


---------02:48----------
interesting and what is the record


---------02:52----------
i currently hold the record with 138 28


---------02:55----------
of doing


---------02:55----------
all the stars but there's different


---------02:57----------
categories there's like beat the game


---------02:58----------
with no stars beat the game with like 16


---------03:01----------
stars


---------03:02----------
so there's different categories some of


---------03:03----------
them are like memes that people don't


---------03:05----------
really care that much about and then


---------03:06----------
some of them are like


---------03:07----------
very competitive a lot of people run


---------03:09----------
them and are trying to get the record


---------03:11----------
cool so you hold the record for 120


---------03:14----------
stars and


---------03:15----------
and mario 64. yeah shortest amount wow


---------03:18----------
yeah one hour and 38 minutes


---------03:21----------
and 28 seconds wow that's crazy


---------03:25----------
it's pretty fast yeah i mean i can't


---------03:27----------
even imagine


---------03:29----------
i've seen some speed runs of of mario 64


---------03:31----------
where they like bug the game out


---------03:35----------
is that like common or


---------03:38----------
yeah that's more common for the shorter


---------03:39----------
categories but for 120 star there's


---------03:42----------
actually not that much


---------03:43----------
like glitching that you do there's a


---------03:45----------
couple things here and there but most of


---------03:46----------
it's just


---------03:47----------
moving really fast like the mechanics of


---------03:49----------
the game are really good


---------03:50----------
so it's mostly just legit just moving


---------03:53----------
quick


---------03:54----------
cool and and when do you decide when


---------03:56----------
you're done


---------03:58----------
how do you figure that out when you're


---------04:00----------
done as in like when to restart


---------04:02----------
no like when you're done with this


---------04:03----------
endeavor in your life


---------04:05----------
that's i mean that's kind of where i'm


---------04:07----------
at right now because like the goal for


---------04:09----------
the past eight years was


---------04:10----------
get the world record it was like it was


---------04:13----------
kind of haunted me for a while


---------04:14----------
i was like because i got very close to


---------04:16----------
getting the record multiple times in the


---------04:17----------
past i


---------04:18----------
i was like number three or number four


---------04:19----------
and i was able to get the record but i'd


---------04:21----------
never sealed the deal


---------04:23----------
and it was only until recently that i


---------04:24----------
got it for the first time and that was


---------04:26----------
like my that felt like my i guess


---------04:28----------
dharma i don't know it felt like my


---------04:29----------
grand goal like i had to do it


---------04:31----------
and and if i couldn't do it then i was


---------04:33----------
like a failure or something like i


---------04:35----------
wouldn't be able to


---------04:35----------
do anything else if i put my mind to it


---------04:37----------
i would fail like i did with this but


---------04:40----------
now i have it and now i'm like i do want


---------04:43----------
to keep playing and push the time lower


---------04:45----------
but i'm struggling to find


---------04:47----------
that same meaning or that same passion


---------04:50----------
that i had


---------04:51----------
before getting the record makes sense


---------04:54----------
and


---------04:54----------
is that what we're talking about today


---------04:57----------
uh yeah that's part of what i want to


---------04:58----------
talk about today like dharma


---------05:00----------
that kind of thing yeah what else do you


---------05:01----------
want to talk about when you say it's


---------05:02----------
part


---------05:03----------
what else uh changing


---------05:06----------
undesirable traits through meditation


---------05:09----------
like what that process looks like okay


---------05:13----------
and


---------05:17----------
um probably flow state i'd like to talk


---------05:20----------
about that a bit


---------05:21----------
okay we can do all of those things


---------05:24----------
anything else i think that'll probably


---------05:27----------
cover


---------05:28----------
yeah i'll probably cover most of it and


---------05:30----------
um am i calling you simply


---------05:32----------
or would you like me to call you


---------05:34----------
something else you can call me ryan


---------05:36----------
ryan okay is that a randomly generated


---------05:40----------
name from


---------05:41----------
one of the little marbles or is that


---------05:44----------
ryan yeah yeah


---------05:48----------
okay so what do you want to start with


---------05:50----------
dharma changing undesirable


---------05:52----------
states i mean traits are flow states


---------05:55----------
uh i think we should start with dharma


---------05:57----------
that's kind of what we're on right now


---------05:58----------
okay


---------05:59----------
tell me what what's your understanding


---------06:01----------
of dharma


---------06:03----------
my understanding of dharma is it's your


---------06:06----------
it's like


---------06:07----------
what will give you life or like what


---------06:09----------
your passion is like what you want to do


---------06:11----------
what you feel like you should be doing


---------06:13----------
just kind of your duty like


---------06:17----------
your natural thing you'll gravitate


---------06:18----------
towards what feels the best to do


---------06:21----------
like most pure kind of thing


---------06:25----------
so yeah like your meaning what gives you


---------06:28----------
a lot of meaning like feeling connected


---------06:30----------
okay so the first thing that i want to


---------06:34----------
point out is that you tossed out a bunch


---------06:36----------
of things that are all very different


---------06:38----------
okay right so what you should do


---------06:41----------
and what you want to do


---------06:44----------
are very different yeah so i i think


---------06:48----------
i think you have an understanding of


---------06:49----------
dharma i don't mean to say that you


---------06:50----------
don't understand it


---------06:52----------
what i'm pointing out is that when we


---------06:53----------
define the term the first thing is like


---------06:56----------
what you want to do what feels the best


---------06:57----------
to do what you gravitate towards


---------06:59----------
what makes you feel connected and what


---------07:01----------
you should do can actually all be


---------07:03----------
different things


---------07:04----------
that's true and so this is the first


---------07:06----------
thing that's tricky about dharma is like


---------07:08----------
which one of these


---------07:08----------
is it i think you're close to it


---------07:12----------
so okay so i just want to point that out


---------07:16----------
right so those are all different things


---------07:17----------
and


---------07:18----------
and it sounds like to me like you have a


---------07:20----------
good sense of what it truly means


---------07:21----------
because


---------07:22----------
you're kind of approaching dharma from a


---------07:24----------
lot of different


---------07:26----------
angles what i want to do what feels good


---------07:29----------
um and so what do you believe


---------07:32----------
your tatarma is


---------07:35----------
well about like the nine months ago when


---------07:39----------
i started grinding once again


---------07:41----------
uh about a month into the grind i was in


---------07:44----------
masters i was at getting my master's


---------07:46----------
degree going


---------07:47----------
for computer science and then i just had


---------07:50----------
like a very deep


---------07:51----------
feeling inside that i had never had


---------07:53----------
before in my life that was like


---------07:55----------
basically


---------07:56----------
telling me okay you have to you have to


---------07:57----------
like drop out and just go full time with


---------07:59----------
mario


---------08:00----------
and i was like wow it just felt it it


---------08:02----------
just felt right i was like


---------08:04----------
this is what i have to do and then i


---------08:06----------
talked to my parents about that they


---------08:07----------
were like whatever you know they're not


---------08:09----------
not the happiest about it but they're


---------08:11----------
pretty supportive parents


---------08:12----------
wow and so that at that moment it felt


---------08:16----------
like my dharma was like full-time


---------08:18----------
streaming and doing speed running to get


---------08:19----------
the record that's kind of


---------08:21----------
where i was at and yeah


---------08:25----------
that's pretty much it and and how did


---------08:27----------
you feel


---------08:28----------
grinding grinding it out


---------08:31----------
uh there's a lot of days where i felt


---------08:32----------
really good like some full days of just


---------08:35----------
absolute joy feeling like really really


---------08:37----------
connected


---------08:38----------
uh with my with my chat with my


---------08:40----------
community and just with myself like i


---------08:42----------
felt very


---------08:42----------
in tune i guess might be the word just


---------08:45----------
very good


---------08:46----------
and then there was weeks where


---------08:49----------
i was playing really bad like getting


---------08:52----------
nothing going at all


---------08:53----------
and i felt really down and i felt like i


---------08:55----------
was in a really weird spot because i


---------08:57----------
dropped out


---------08:58----------
to pursue this you know kind of dream


---------09:01----------
and it wasn't going well


---------09:03----------
and i was like it felt almost like my


---------09:04----------
dharma got corrupted because


---------09:06----------
i i feel like i lost sight like normally


---------09:09----------
it was like playing because i liked the


---------09:10----------
game


---------09:11----------
and then it turned into okay i need to


---------09:14----------
play good


---------09:15----------
so i can get like my viewers so i can


---------09:17----------
still have the stream running because


---------09:18----------
like if you're playing really bad


---------09:20----------
and you're just not in the best mood


---------09:21----------
obviously people don't really care to


---------09:22----------
watch you know


---------09:23----------
like part of being a speedrunner is


---------09:25----------
you're gonna get viewers based off like


---------09:27----------
how good you're playing are you on a run


---------09:29----------
because people like to come in when


---------09:30----------
somebody's on a run and there's like


---------09:32----------
full days where you don't get anywhere


---------09:34----------
you're just resetting


---------09:36----------
in the beginning okay


---------09:39----------
and so how did your dharma get corrupted


---------09:41----------
i think it's a good way to put it


---------09:43----------
what it was just


---------09:46----------
things that i ran into while like going


---------09:48----------
for


---------09:49----------
the dharma i guess yeah i was i noticed


---------09:53----------
i started caring a lot more about


---------09:54----------
viewers and like watching that


---------09:56----------
and yeah that kind of thing because i


---------09:58----------
knew you know


---------09:59----------
this is only sustainable as long as i


---------10:01----------
can like keep


---------10:03----------
viewers or keep getting money because i


---------10:06----------
need to pay rent or whatever


---------10:08----------
and so i started worrying more about


---------10:10----------
those things and it kind of


---------10:12----------
didn't allow me to feel like comfortable


---------10:15----------
like i just always had that fear in the


---------10:16----------
back of my head so i was unable to


---------10:18----------
i felt like i couldn't hit a flow state


---------10:20----------
at all because i was always thinking


---------10:21----------
about those kind of things


---------10:22----------
yep and i know that's when i would play


---------10:24----------
the best it's like when i'm actually


---------10:25----------
having fun i just like stopped having


---------10:26----------
fun


---------10:28----------
so what's your understanding of how


---------10:32----------
thinking about viewership corrupts your


---------10:34----------
dharma


---------10:36----------
uh what do you mean so how does that


---------10:38----------
work


---------10:40----------
like so you're you're suggesting to us a


---------10:42----------
couple of observations one is that


---------10:44----------
you had this you know calling deep


---------10:47----------
within your chest that was like drop out


---------10:49----------
of your master's play


---------10:51----------
program and play super mario 64. yeah


---------10:54----------
all day every day


---------10:56----------
and you did that for a little while and


---------10:57----------
you felt fulfilled you were entering


---------10:59----------
flow states it felt like it was the


---------11:00----------
right thing to do


---------11:02----------
um you were you were in tune as you put


---------11:05----------
it which is such a great way to put it


---------11:07----------
and then things started to not go well


---------11:10----------
i'm not entirely clear what's we know


---------11:12----------
what came first but then your dharma


---------11:14----------
became corrupted


---------11:15----------
and what it feels like it got corrupted


---------11:17----------
by is you started thinking about viewers


---------11:20----------
you started thinking about making your


---------11:21----------
rent


---------11:22----------
you started thinking about things being


---------11:24----------
sustainable or unsustainable


---------11:26----------
yeah and then you were in a dark place


---------11:28----------
so how does


---------11:29----------
how do those thoughts corrupt your


---------11:31----------
dharma like what is the mechanism there


---------11:34----------
um i'm not really sure


---------11:38----------
okay so we're we'll explain that okay


---------11:41----------
okay so


---------11:42----------
the first question before that happened


---------11:45----------
what was your mind focused on


---------11:50----------
just mario like extreme was doing fine


---------11:53----------
so i was like okay i'm just


---------11:54----------
focusing on mario like i don't know it


---------11:56----------
feels kind of momentum based a lot i


---------11:58----------
think


---------11:58----------
life in general just momentum is a word


---------12:00----------
i find myself using a lot to describe


---------12:02----------
how things go on


---------12:04----------
for and i feel like it can destroy a lot


---------12:06----------
of things well and


---------12:07----------
in speed running like you can have a


---------12:10----------
good week


---------12:11----------
where like you're playing good bad above


---------12:13----------
flow state whatever you're just


---------12:14----------
popping off and then i think there's


---------12:17----------
like some weird thing that happens where


---------12:18----------
you start to expect that


---------12:20----------
and then maybe you have one bad day and


---------12:22----------
then that's the beginning of the ball


---------12:24----------
and then the momentum just picks up and


---------12:26----------
then it's not just a bad day it's like


---------12:28----------
two bad days and it's like oh my god i'm


---------12:30----------
not i'm not good anymore i can't play


---------12:31----------
anymore like people don't want to watch


---------12:33----------
so i don't know if it if it's like a


---------12:35----------
switch to viewers right away i think


---------12:37----------
it's like a gradual thing


---------12:39----------
okay so it's almost like there's a


---------12:41----------
momentum with the badness and the


---------12:43----------
momentum with the goodness


---------12:45----------
yeah so ryan let me ask you a couple


---------12:48----------
questions first


---------12:49----------
so are you i i'm finding


---------12:52----------
the desire to teach do you are you


---------12:56----------
looking more


---------12:57----------
for me to explore things with you or to


---------12:59----------
teach you


---------13:00----------
things um


---------13:06----------
i'm down for either one okay so i think


---------13:09----------
what i would like to do is i think your


---------13:11----------
your the description of your experience


---------13:13----------
is wonderful so i think you've stumbled


---------13:16----------
upon a couple of really really key


---------13:18----------
concepts and when i ask you


---------13:21----------
how does dharma get corrupted so here's


---------13:23----------
what you're giving me


---------13:25----------
i had dharma this is what it felt like


---------13:28----------
it came from somewhere i dropped out of


---------13:29----------
my master's program then my dharma got


---------13:32----------
corrupted and i noticed these thoughts


---------13:34----------
and then i ask you how does dharma get


---------13:36----------
corrupted i ask you to tell me the


---------13:38----------
principle


---------13:39----------
behind your observation and you're not


---------13:41----------
quite able to describe it


---------13:43----------
which is perfectly fine so then what i


---------13:46----------
feel like i should do is i should take


---------13:47----------
your observations which are


---------13:49----------
spot on and try to give you the equation


---------13:52----------
that


---------13:52----------
governs your observations


---------13:55----------
okay does that make sense yeah so i'd


---------13:58----------
like to teach you


---------14:00----------
how dharma gets corrupted okay how


---------14:03----------
momentum works


---------14:04----------
because wouldn't it be cool if you


---------14:06----------
understood how to make


---------14:08----------
momentum that would be pretty dope yeah


---------14:11----------
so we're going to talk about that


---------14:12----------
and also to understand that momentum


---------14:14----------
goes both ways right you can have a


---------14:16----------
negative momentum and you can have a


---------14:17----------
positive momentum


---------14:19----------
and so what we understand is people


---------14:21----------
because no one teaches this stuff is


---------14:22----------
like we observe that there's momentum


---------14:24----------
but we like don't understand if i asked


---------14:26----------
you


---------14:27----------
ryan where does momentum come from


---------14:31----------
it's like i mean little by little like a


---------14:34----------
little thing


---------14:35----------
you do laundry and then that's building


---------14:36----------
up a little bit of momentum and then


---------14:37----------
you're like okay


---------14:38----------
i can i can take care of a chore maybe i


---------14:39----------
can do like


---------14:41----------
something okay just mario yeah so so


---------14:44----------
we'll talk about that


---------14:46----------
so the first thing that i i want to


---------14:47----------
point out to people is that


---------14:50----------
you know when when ryan when you talk


---------14:52----------
about mario and being living your dharma


---------14:55----------
you're not how much are you thinking


---------14:58----------
about the world


---------14:59----------
record when you feel in tune with your


---------15:03----------
dharma


---------15:04----------
not at all explain that to us


---------15:08----------
i mean when like when i'm actually


---------15:11----------
playing like


---------15:12----------
yeah i'm playing well or whatever like


---------15:13----------
i'm in the middle of a run


---------15:15----------
i i guess you just get stung so much as


---------15:17----------
a runner where you make a mistake and


---------15:19----------
lose the run that you learn that you


---------15:20----------
can't really get attached and you can't


---------15:22----------
think about oh this is the one this will


---------15:23----------
be the one this is the record


---------15:25----------
because i mean that'll probably mess you


---------15:26----------
up you'll get psyched out and then


---------15:29----------
it's just inefficient because if you do


---------15:30----------
reset then you're going to be like hurt


---------15:32----------
and then playing when you're hurt sucks


---------15:34----------
you're just not so so what


---------15:36----------
what causes the hurt where is the heart


---------15:38----------
born


---------15:39----------
expectation beautiful right so i want


---------15:42----------
you guys to really listen to what ryan


---------15:44----------
is saying


---------15:44----------
this is a guy who quit his master's


---------15:46----------
degree to beat the world record


---------15:48----------
and my question to him is how much do


---------15:50----------
you think about the world record when


---------15:52----------
you play and he says


---------15:53----------
not at all which sounds huh


---------15:57----------
ideally you're not thinking about it at


---------15:58----------
all yeah right so like which sounds


---------16:00----------
bizarre like that sounds contradictory


---------16:02----------
but i think


---------16:02----------
the reason that ryan has beat the world


---------16:04----------
record is because he understands this


---------16:06----------
stuff pretty well and to understand that


---------16:08----------
like


---------16:09----------
so here's how i'll explain it


---------16:12----------
so when you're doing your dharma you're


---------16:14----------
not actually thinking about an


---------16:16----------
outcome you're focused on the task so


---------16:19----------
what what ryan fell in love with is


---------16:22----------
mario


---------16:23----------
and like he had set sort of the world


---------16:25----------
record is almost like an arbitrary goal


---------16:28----------
because your mind needs something to


---------16:30----------
move towards


---------16:31----------
but generally speaking when you wake up


---------16:33----------
and you stream you're trying your best


---------16:36----------
not to think about viewers not to think


---------16:38----------
about your time you're just devoting


---------16:39----------
yourself to the task at hand


---------16:43----------
so an analogy that i oftentimes use is


---------16:46----------
like one from


---------16:47----------
medicine right so like in medicine like


---------16:49----------
you train a lot and you work a lot


---------16:52----------
but at the end of the day like you can't


---------16:54----------
save a life


---------16:56----------
it's just not something you can do so


---------16:58----------
whenever you're you're a doctor and


---------17:00----------
let's say you go to the hospital to do


---------17:01----------
your job you've prepared


---------17:04----------
to be in the moment and you have a


---------17:05----------
dharma to you have a duty to save lives


---------17:07----------
but you actually can't do it which


---------17:09----------
sounds bizarre


---------17:11----------
and and you know the best doctors are


---------17:12----------
the ones who just give it their all and


---------17:14----------
that's really the most that you can do


---------17:16----------
and it's the ones who create


---------17:18----------
expectations


---------17:19----------
that first of all tend to do a worse job


---------17:22----------
and also


---------17:24----------
actually i don't know if that's true


---------17:28----------
they suffer more for sure


---------17:31----------
but i think it's it's interesting


---------17:32----------
because if you really like listen to


---------17:34----------
ryan it's like very bizarre to hear the


---------17:36----------
guys


---------17:36----------
who holds the world record for 120 stars


---------17:40----------
in mario 64 to say when you think when


---------17:42----------
you play the game what do you


---------17:43----------
do you think about the record and he's


---------17:44----------
like i try not to but that is what what


---------17:47----------
i've heard


---------17:48----------
time and time and time again for people


---------17:50----------
who pursue their dharma


---------17:52----------
right if we you know you can take your


---------17:54----------
pick of


---------17:55----------
whoever so when i think about my dharma


---------17:57----------
like i just show up


---------18:00----------
and whether the dude has a shirt or


---------18:02----------
doesn't have a shirt or whatever


---------18:04----------
right i can't like be expecting certain


---------18:06----------
things and when i expect certain things


---------18:09----------
it tends to get worse so what i really


---------18:11----------
try to do is i show up and i tell myself


---------18:13----------
every day that i stream that


---------18:15----------
you know i hope people watch it's great


---------18:16----------
if people watch i'm here for people to


---------18:18----------
watch but at the end of the day


---------18:19----------
i'm going to talk to you ryan for like


---------18:21----------
an hour and a half and


---------18:22----------
i'm going to try to help you and that's


---------18:24----------
what i devote myself to


---------18:26----------
so i want to use this word which we we


---------18:28----------
which we don't really use very much in


---------18:29----------
the west nowadays because it has


---------18:31----------
religious connotations


---------18:32----------
but devotion so when we think about


---------18:35----------
devotion we think about like religion


---------18:38----------
but what i hear from you ryan is that


---------18:40----------
you devoted yourself


---------18:42----------
to the task of mario does that make


---------18:46----------
sense


---------18:47----------
yeah and so there's something subtly


---------18:49----------
lacking


---------18:50----------
ego there it's actually not about you


---------18:53----------
it's about the purity of mario


---------18:55----------
does that make sense so you're smiling


---------18:58----------
so what what


---------18:59----------
feels like that's resonating with you


---------19:01----------
can you tell us about that


---------19:03----------
the game is good and it's just like it's


---------19:06----------
done so much for me


---------19:07----------
as a person and so that's definitely


---------19:10----------
what it is about is like just for mario


---------19:14----------
to be able to push it further and like


---------19:16----------
see where the game can go


---------19:18----------
yeah right so i want you guys to pay


---------19:19----------
attention so


---------19:22----------
are you talking in first person second


---------19:24----------
person or third person


---------19:28----------
um that third person


---------19:31----------
i think absolutely which is strange


---------19:34----------
right so we we'd expect


---------19:36----------
a speed runner to talk in the first


---------19:38----------
person


---------19:39----------
about mario i really enjoy the game i


---------19:42----------
want to do the best i want to hold the


---------19:44----------
world record


---------19:45----------
but the interesting thing is that i


---------19:47----------
would venture that your dharma gets


---------19:49----------
corrupted


---------19:50----------
when you start thinking in the first


---------19:51----------
person yeah


---------19:54----------
definitely so when you say yeah


---------19:55----------
definitely can you give us an example


---------19:59----------
i mean and this this will link to


---------20:02----------
something else like changing


---------20:03----------
undesirable traits but for a long time i


---------20:05----------
was in like the shadow


---------20:07----------
it felt like of the other runners that


---------20:09----------
held the record


---------20:10----------
and when i was in those modes of


---------20:12----------
operation like


---------20:13----------
seeing them get good runs or seeing them


---------20:15----------
like get more viewers or like do better


---------20:17----------
than me


---------20:17----------
would just make things worse because i


---------20:19----------
would like compare myself


---------20:21----------
and kind of feel guilty and feel like


---------20:23----------
jealous and then


---------20:24----------
trying to play with that on your


---------20:25----------
shoulders is just like really tough like


---------20:27----------
i had


---------20:28----------
i've you have to learn how to like


---------20:29----------
transcend it into


---------20:32----------
admiration or like turn it into them


---------20:34----------
making you more competitive


---------20:36----------
how do you do that find an inspiration


---------20:39----------
uh i think it was just like dealing with


---------20:41----------
the jealousy for too long and just


---------20:43----------
feeling like


---------20:44----------
it i mean i still i still have like


---------20:46----------
chelsea i don't think that's gone


---------20:48----------
um i think just now that i'm on top it's


---------20:49----------
like harder to be jealous because i'm


---------20:50----------
like i have


---------20:51----------
i finally did it but it's just


---------20:56----------
finally being able to get good runs and


---------20:58----------
like feel like you can do it and


---------21:01----------
yeah how do you do that though right so


---------21:04----------
i'm imagining like i'm watching other


---------21:06----------
people's


---------21:06----------
records and i get number three and i


---------21:10----------
look at them and i say


---------21:11----------
[ __ ] those guys and


---------21:14----------
and i find myself wanting to be like


---------21:16----------
them why can't i be like them


---------21:18----------
why can't i be better why can't i focus


---------21:20----------
on the game why do i have to have these


---------21:22----------
kinds of thoughts


---------21:25----------
i know i shouldn't worry about them i


---------21:26----------
should just worry about mario


---------21:28----------
yeah how do you actually get out of that


---------21:30----------
frame of mind


---------21:34----------
probably looking at it more objectively


---------21:35----------
like not even looking at the run as


---------21:37----------
their run


---------21:38----------
just looking at their run as the run


---------21:40----------
like this is the run to beat


---------21:41----------
and looking at their strategies and


---------21:43----------
seeing okay what am i not doing because


---------21:45----------
not everybody's doing the same strats


---------21:46----------
we're


---------21:47----------
like some people are doing faster stuff


---------21:48----------
here faster stuff there


---------21:50----------
and so i basically just kept working on


---------21:52----------
my own strats until i felt like i


---------21:55----------
until it just felt like i can definitely


---------21:57----------
get record no problem


---------21:58----------
like just practicing a lot off stream


---------22:01----------
learning new stuff


---------22:02----------
and then getting to the point where i'm


---------22:04----------
doing the same stuff as them


---------22:06----------
i'm i am fast enough etc and then


---------22:09----------
finally being able to see the results


---------22:12----------
from how do you how do you go from why


---------22:14----------
can't i be


---------22:15----------
like them to because this is important


---------22:17----------
right the person who is jealous of the


---------22:19----------
number one who's sitting at number three


---------22:21----------
is lacking confidence they have jealousy


---------22:24----------
they have envy


---------22:26----------
how do you move from there to i can't do


---------22:29----------
this


---------22:29----------
i am fast enough you finally have a run


---------22:33----------
that's like really good pace you you


---------22:36----------
finally like


---------22:37----------
you don't beat it like you don't finish


---------22:38----------
it but you get close like you're getting


---------22:40----------
to the end of the run


---------22:41----------
and that's after just practicing and


---------22:43----------
finally like hitting the stuff that i've


---------22:44----------
been practicing


---------22:45----------
in a run because like practice versus


---------22:47----------
runs there's two completely different


---------22:50----------
worlds like you can hit something in


---------22:51----------
practice but then when you're actually


---------22:53----------
trying to go


---------22:53----------
and doing that straight on a run it's


---------22:55----------
like it's going to be a lot different


---------22:57----------
okay so what i'm hear you say is that


---------22:59----------
you practice


---------23:02----------
and when you practice i think what


---------23:04----------
you're doing is you're devoting yourself


---------23:05----------
once again to the task


---------23:07----------
and then the ego steps aside so i want


---------23:10----------
to point out a couple things


---------23:12----------
one is that so what are the things that


---------23:15----------
corrupt dharma


---------23:16----------
so ego is one when you start to compare


---------23:19----------
and if we listen to to ryan twitch what


---------23:22----------
you guys will also see is he says that


---------23:24----------
the jealousy is still there


---------23:26----------
right i think a big mistake that people


---------23:28----------
make is they assume that once they


---------23:30----------
conquer something it's gone even the


---------23:33----------
word conquer


---------23:34----------
implies like victory forever


---------23:37----------
but that's not how it works and dharma


---------23:39----------
is not something you


---------23:40----------
find that is like finite and then you've


---------23:42----------
done it


---------23:43----------
it's something that i want you guys to


---------23:45----------
understand that ryan has been struggling


---------23:46----------
to find his dharma


---------23:47----------
like every single day for the last nine


---------23:50----------
months


---------23:51----------
because it gets corrupted and you feel


---------23:53----------
it slip away


---------23:55----------
right and then you have to like try to


---------23:56----------
get it again and then you've got it for


---------23:58----------
a little while and then it like slips


---------24:00----------
away


---------24:00----------
and then you have to like get it again


---------24:02----------
yeah and so it's a practice so the


---------24:04----------
biggest thing that people i think


---------24:06----------
misunderstand is that when we talk about


---------24:07----------
dharma it's sort of like oh i found my


---------24:09----------
dharma period


---------24:10----------
even i struggle every day with like


---------24:12----------
finding my dharma


---------24:14----------
it's something that is like kind of an


---------24:15----------
ongoing task so ego so what are the


---------24:17----------
signs of ego you find yourself comparing


---------24:20----------
what is the solution to comparison you


---------24:22----------
practice


---------24:23----------
and what practice means is that you


---------24:24----------
focus on the task because then it's not


---------24:26----------
about


---------24:27----------
them or you or their time or your time


---------24:30----------
it's about i'm gonna try to do this


---------24:32----------
thing in the game


---------24:35----------
does that make sense yeah okay


---------24:38----------
and then what happens is like when you


---------24:39----------
start to do the thing and you stop


---------24:41----------
worrying about other people then what


---------24:44----------
happens is


---------24:44----------
your mind is free of the bias of other


---------24:47----------
people and then you're like oh when i


---------24:48----------
actually look at


---------24:50----------
what i'm able to produce it's actually


---------24:52----------
pretty good it still needs work but it's


---------24:54----------
pretty good


---------24:56----------
and even if it's crappy you can still


---------24:58----------
work on it and then eventually you'll


---------25:00----------
get to pretty good


---------25:02----------
but the key thing is to focus on the


---------25:04----------
task at hand


---------25:05----------
and and this is where people talk about


---------25:07----------
being in the present


---------25:09----------
um but ego corrupts the dharma that's


---------25:11----------
number one


---------25:12----------
next thing that corrupts dharma is


---------25:14----------
expectation


---------25:17----------
and you know ryan you said something


---------25:19----------
about this can you say something a


---------25:21----------
little bit more about


---------25:23----------
you know how expectation creeps in


---------25:28----------
it's very subtle um like for me at least


---------25:31----------
in speedrunning it'll be


---------25:32----------
it'll be like okay this level that i'm


---------25:35----------
going into


---------25:35----------
is pretty easy you know like from an


---------25:37----------
objective standpoint


---------25:38----------
what we do in this level isn't that hard


---------25:41----------
and what's funny is that when you have


---------25:42----------
those thoughts


---------25:43----------
like those levels will slap you the


---------25:44----------
hardest like i'll get through the


---------25:45----------
hardest part


---------25:47----------
objectively the hardest part of the run


---------25:49----------
slam it be like oh that was so good


---------25:51----------
now i just need to make it through this


---------25:52----------
level and i'm and once i do that thought


---------25:55----------
i think that's already the expectation


---------25:56----------
it's like this is an easy level


---------25:58----------
and like classifying it as easy now it's


---------26:00----------
like okay if i mess it up


---------26:01----------
i'm a big failure like i just messed


---------26:03----------
that up so bad i lost my time and now i


---------26:05----------
feel terrible


---------26:06----------
and if it's a reset i feel like a huge


---------26:08----------
[ __ ] because i'm just like wow i


---------26:09----------
can't believe


---------26:10----------
i messed up on the easy level and now


---------26:12----------
the next runs are gonna hurt


---------26:13----------
because i'm like in that hurt mindset


---------26:17----------
yeah so you know it's interesting so i


---------26:18----------
work with some esports professionals


---------26:21----------
and one of the interesting things that


---------26:23----------
we uncover like you know what causes


---------26:25----------
tilt


---------26:27----------
is it expectation yes


---------26:30----------
and and what kind of expectation so


---------26:34----------
i was talking to someone are you feeling


---------26:35----------
the mobas


---------26:37----------
yep so that's why league is actually


---------26:39----------
what got me into mario


---------26:40----------
funny enough how does that work so


---------26:43----------
you play league and then you're like


---------26:44----------
[ __ ] this [ __ ] on everyone


---------26:48----------
league not a lot of good experiences


---------26:51----------
with that game but i


---------26:53----------
it brought me to twitch and twitch is


---------26:54----------
where i found mario like in 2012 one of


---------26:57----------
the biggest streamers on twitch


---------26:58----------
was siglemek and he was a mario


---------27:00----------
speedrunner and that


---------27:02----------
that's what gave me inspiration to try


---------27:03----------
it out cool so


---------27:05----------
here's an interesting thing so you're


---------27:06----------
right it's expectation so


---------27:10----------
let me ask you something if you're


---------27:12----------
playing a game


---------27:13----------
and let's say you go 0 and 2 in mid


---------27:18----------
there's a chance you get tilted right


---------27:20----------
yeah


---------27:21----------
so do you think you're more likely to


---------27:23----------
get tilted


---------27:25----------
by the end of the game are you more


---------27:26----------
likely to be tilted if you start 0 and 2


---------27:29----------
or you start 2-0


---------27:33----------
tuna for sure why interesting right


---------27:36----------
very interesting pay attention folks


---------27:39----------
so if you're starting 2-0 you're like oh


---------27:41----------
man i'm popping off i got this


---------27:43----------
i'm in a good spot like you're probably


---------27:45----------
a little bit


---------27:46----------
fed you know you feel like you can


---------27:48----------
influence the game a lot


---------27:49----------
and then if anything goes wrong or you


---------27:52----------
start to fall apart you're going to be


---------27:53----------
way more upset


---------27:54----------
but a comeback is way more hype like o2


---------27:56----------
you're like


---------27:57----------
well this game's already in the [ __ ]


---------27:59----------
and now you're just kind of


---------28:00----------
grinding away and then if you can bring


---------28:02----------
it back it's like


---------28:04----------
it's you didn't expect it at all you


---------28:05----------
don't expect nothing when you're o2


---------28:07----------
you're like all right


---------28:08----------
i'm expecting a loss so anything's


---------28:09----------
better than a loss yep


---------28:11----------
absolutely right so it's bizarre so like


---------28:14----------
this is something that i think really


---------28:15----------
holds back a lot of good players


---------28:18----------
is this idea that when you're 2-0 you're


---------28:21----------
expecting a win


---------28:22----------
and when they're like jungler or


---------28:24----------
whatever ganks you twice


---------28:26----------
you're way more tilted because you were


---------28:30----------
supposed to win that game


---------28:32----------
you dumpstered all over that shitty


---------28:35----------
and then your jungler is [ __ ] afk


---------28:37----------
while theirs is ganking you


---------28:38----------
whereas like bizarrely if you're 0-2


---------28:41----------
because their jungler ganked you twice


---------28:43----------
you can still be a little bit tilted


---------28:45----------
there but it's completely different


---------28:47----------
yeah you can go 0-2 because they're


---------28:49----------
jungler gank twice and then you can get


---------28:51----------
one solo kill or their jungler your


---------28:53----------
jungler finally shows up and ganks them


---------28:55----------
once and then you're one and two


---------28:57----------
completely different game from if you're


---------28:58----------
two and oh and their jungler ganks you


---------29:00----------
twice


---------29:01----------
or even once and then you're two in one


---------29:04----------
and you're still more tilted


---------29:06----------
yeah for sure crazy right expectation


---------29:11----------
expectation is the enemy


---------29:14----------
meditation and spiritual training is


---------29:17----------
like so this is the thing no one teaches


---------29:18----------
us this stuff


---------29:20----------
but literally you can train yourself to


---------29:22----------
expect less


---------29:23----------
it's a cognitive process and we'll talk


---------29:25----------
about changing undesirable traits and


---------29:27----------
meditation and stuff like that


---------29:28----------
you can literally rewire your brain to


---------29:31----------
expect


---------29:32----------
less when you rewire your brain to


---------29:35----------
expect less


---------29:38----------
you'll be less likely to tilt and


---------29:39----------
therefore you'll win more games


---------29:41----------
because the crazy thing is that when


---------29:42----------
you're 2-0 and you get


---------29:45----------
get ganked twice by their jungler and


---------29:47----------
you start tilting


---------29:49----------
the funny thing is like you're probably


---------29:51----------
still even


---------29:52----------
or maybe you're a little bit behind


---------29:54----------
because later kills are worth more than


---------29:55----------
early kills


---------29:57----------
but you're not as far behind as your


---------29:59----------
tilt itself would think


---------30:02----------
yeah it distorts your perspective it


---------30:03----------
absolutely distorts it and then you end


---------30:05----------
up losing more games than you really


---------30:07----------
should


---------30:08----------
and the reason that you lose the game


---------30:09----------
that you should win is because you


---------30:11----------
thought you should have won it already


---------30:13----------
which is bizarre yeah so freeing


---------30:16----------
yourself


---------30:17----------
expectation and the thoughts are subtle


---------30:20----------
right and this is also where meditation


---------30:22----------
comes in because like you see


---------30:24----------
and if you train yourself to catch the


---------30:26----------
subtlety so meditation is about actually


---------30:29----------
increasing the subtlety of your mind


---------30:30----------
that's one of the definitions of the


---------30:32----------
practice


---------30:33----------
it's your ability to notice things that


---------30:35----------
are smaller and smaller and smaller


---------30:37----------
about yourself


---------30:40----------
um and so when you


---------30:44----------
it's like you're watching like you're


---------30:46----------
playing the game and then you look over


---------30:48----------
and you happen to see your viewer


---------30:49----------
account yeah


---------30:51----------
and if you glance over and your viewer


---------30:53----------
count is lower than it was yesterday


---------30:55----------
what happens you start to feel worse


---------31:00----------
why what are the thoughts you have


---------31:03----------
it's like why am i why am i lower than


---------31:05----------
usual am i not being as entertaining


---------31:07----------
sometimes it's obvious like you just


---------31:09----------
know that you're i mean


---------31:10----------
especially back when i was like months


---------31:12----------
ago when i was grinding


---------31:14----------
if you're doing bad runs you're gonna


---------31:16----------
expect it to be lower


---------31:18----------
because you're just like playing bad


---------31:19----------
it's like people aren't going to be


---------31:20----------
there


---------31:21----------
but it still hurts you're like wow


---------31:23----------
people just want to see like good runs


---------31:25----------
and that's fair that's how it is


---------31:28----------
it's kind of how speedrunning works yep


---------31:31----------
well so the interesting thing is that i


---------31:33----------
think that when you say that's


---------31:34----------
fair that's not expectation


---------31:38----------
my sense is that when you when you look


---------31:40----------
at the lower view account you say that's


---------31:42----------
fair you're actually moving towards


---------31:44----------
dharma


---------31:46----------
i think looking back on these moments i


---------31:48----------
can say that it's fair but in those


---------31:50----------
moments when it actually is happening i


---------31:52----------
probably don't


---------31:52----------
feel that same way because if it's


---------31:54----------
hurting then i'm probably not thinking


---------31:55----------
it's fair i'm like


---------31:58----------
yeah yeah right so but that too you can


---------32:01----------
see the difference


---------32:02----------
the way that you respond to that moves


---------32:04----------
you further away from dharma or closer


---------32:07----------
if you say yeah these guys are you know


---------32:10----------
my my viewer count is lower


---------32:13----------
because i'm not performing as well let


---------32:14----------
me focus on performing


---------32:17----------
and if the viewers are going to come


---------32:19----------
they're going to come but it has to do


---------32:21----------
ultimately do with the way that i play


---------32:22----------
the game


---------32:24----------
and if you start thinking about oh the


---------32:26----------
viewers are not coming and then you


---------32:28----------
start thinking if ego arises


---------32:31----------
and this too if you start to feel bad


---------32:33----------
then ego is more likely to arise


---------32:35----------
what do you think about that when you


---------32:37----------
feel bad is when you compare more


---------32:41----------
that's definitely pretty accurate


---------32:45----------
um


---------32:48----------
if you feel bad you start to compare


---------32:50----------
more yeah


---------32:52----------
because i mean you'll be lower and


---------32:54----------
you'll be like well yesterday i had


---------32:56----------
more viewers or these other players get


---------32:59----------
more viewers


---------33:00----------
when they play worse than me or


---------33:01----------
something like that you just start going


---------33:03----------
on weird tangents that don't even make


---------33:04----------
sense anymore it's like


---------33:05----------
the momentum yeah yeah so so this is


---------33:09----------
what happens so


---------33:10----------
bad emotion leads to ego ego leads to


---------33:13----------
comparison


---------33:16----------
comparison is a function of the ego


---------33:20----------
so if you're comparing are you always in


---------33:21----------
an ego state


---------33:24----------
generally speaking i'm gonna say yes


---------33:27----------
you can make comparisons without ego but


---------33:29----------
for the most part


---------33:30----------
ego is what triggers the most comparison


---------33:34----------
so so you know this because you can look


---------33:36----------
at a different speed runner and you can


---------33:39----------
analyze how they do things and how you


---------33:41----------
do things and there doesn't have to be


---------33:43----------
ego there


---------33:44----------
yeah but comparison


---------33:47----------
is usually ego you can look at their


---------33:51----------
thing as their own thing


---------33:53----------
and you can look at your thing as your


---------33:55----------
own thing and you can acknowledge the


---------33:58----------
difference between those two


---------33:59----------
but that isn't comparison right


---------34:02----------
comparison is when you set the two side


---------34:04----------
by side and you say like


---------34:07----------
this does that make sense yeah


---------34:11----------
and so you can you can look at a


---------34:14----------
gazelle and you can say wow a gazelle is


---------34:16----------
fast and you can look at a cheetah and


---------34:18----------
you can say wow


---------34:19----------
cheetah's fast and then the second you


---------34:21----------
say like oh like look at that cheetah


---------34:23----------
that cheetah so much faster than the


---------34:24----------
gazelle


---------34:25----------
that becomes a comparison although that


---------34:27----------
doesn't sound like it's ego at all but


---------34:28----------
yeah you know generally speaking i'd say


---------34:30----------
that for our population and our


---------34:33----------
community


---------34:34----------
most of the comparisons they make are


---------34:36----------
not dispassionate


---------34:37----------
and that most of them are dependent on


---------34:39----------
ego


---------34:42----------
okay so um


---------34:45----------
how do you protect yourself from that


---------34:48----------
do you have any ideas from getting


---------34:51----------
caught in like an ego state


---------34:52----------
yep just staying as focused as you can


---------34:56----------
on the task


---------34:58----------
like i like the flow state or whatever


---------35:00----------
you kind of hit that if you can just


---------35:02----------
what i do is just like listen to sounds


---------35:04----------
in the game and if i can listen to those


---------35:06----------
for a prolonged amount of time


---------35:08----------
like deeply then all of a sudden i'm


---------35:10----------
like it's like i built that momentum up


---------35:12----------
like


---------35:12----------
i was able to put one minute or two


---------35:14----------
minutes of pure focus in and now i'm


---------35:16----------
like


---------35:16----------
in the zone okay i think beautiful so


---------35:19----------
that is a tar now


---------35:20----------
that you're doing so i want you guys to


---------35:22----------
notice means a focusing technique


---------35:24----------
your camera's broke yeah thank you


---------35:28----------
so adharana is a focusing technique it's


---------35:30----------
essentially a meditative practice


---------35:33----------
and what i want you guys to notice is


---------35:35----------
that when he focuses his mind


---------35:37----------
on sounds what he does is doesn't give


---------35:41----------
fuel to the negative thoughts and the


---------35:45----------
negative thoughts


---------35:46----------
breed additional thoughts right when you


---------35:49----------
give in to an expectation what happens


---------35:53----------
you've basically opened pandora's box


---------35:55----------
like that's the beginning of the


---------35:56----------
negative momentum yep so tell me what


---------35:58----------
pandora's box looks like can you give us


---------36:00----------
an actual example


---------36:03----------
um i mean one that i'm dealing with a


---------36:05----------
lot recently is like


---------36:07----------
so i have the decision like i want to


---------36:09----------
keep my sleep schedule good right so


---------36:11----------
it's like 2 a.m


---------36:12----------
and i'm like okay i can either go to bed


---------36:14----------
or i can go like


---------36:15----------
my one of my big vices is eating and


---------36:17----------
just like staying up late


---------36:19----------
uh so it's like either i go to bed or i


---------36:21----------
just make like a plate of chips watch a


---------36:23----------
quick video then i go to bed


---------36:24----------
and then if i go make that food come


---------36:27----------
back down then before i know it i'm like


---------36:29----------
it's like two hours later i ate like


---------36:31----------
multiple


---------36:32----------
bags of chips or like i'll just make


---------36:35----------
snacks like we have so much


---------36:36----------
junk food in this house i'll just be


---------36:38----------
like deep in the dumpster


---------36:40----------
all of a sudden and it feels like i got


---------36:41----------
there like i don't even remember


---------36:43----------
how i got here you know it's just like


---------36:45----------
all of a sudden you're


---------36:46----------
in the gutter yep right so so


---------36:50----------
so pandora's box one thing leads to


---------36:52----------
another there's a so i want you guys to


---------36:54----------
notice that the


---------36:55----------
deviation from dharma starts with a


---------36:58----------
subtle thought it's a tiny tiny thought


---------37:01----------
i can go to bed or it's not even a


---------37:03----------
decision it's just a possibility at that


---------37:05----------
point


---------37:05----------
yeah and then you give in to that


---------37:07----------
possibility and then that thought


---------37:09----------
breeds another thought which breeds


---------37:11----------
another thought which breeds another


---------37:13----------
thought


---------37:14----------
and then you get stuck in a cycle of


---------37:17----------
shame


---------37:17----------
or a stop like a panic attack or stuck


---------37:20----------
in anxiety paralyzed by fear


---------37:24----------
and all of those big big thoughts that


---------37:26----------
two hours later


---------37:28----------
you're covered in crumbs and your


---------37:30----------
stomach is upset


---------37:32----------
and there's like grease on your face and


---------37:33----------
you said make a plate of chips which


---------37:35----------
sounds delicious usually i eat them out


---------37:37----------
of the bag but it sounds like you take


---------37:39----------
it to the next level


---------37:40----------
yeah i've never heard of anyone making a


---------37:43----------
plate of chips maybe nachos


---------37:44----------
nachos yeah i make nachos i'll just like


---------37:46----------
get tortilla chips and put cheese on


---------37:48----------
them and then if we have meat i'll put


---------37:49----------
some meat on them


---------37:50----------
damn straight little my dude i didn't


---------37:53----------
that didn't slip by me i can tell


---------37:55----------
make a plate i know what that's like


---------37:58----------
all right put some black beans on there


---------38:00----------
if you want to be if you want to


---------38:01----------
alleviate your


---------38:03----------
guilt you can even chop up like fresh


---------38:04----------
tomatoes are good bell pepper is good


---------38:07----------
oh that's dangerous no but i mean like


---------38:09----------
at least if you're gonna


---------38:10----------
eat the plate of nachos like chop some


---------38:12----------
[ __ ] in there and then


---------38:13----------
get some veggies you know what i'm


---------38:14----------
saying true


---------38:17----------
you know black beans also potentially


---------38:18----------
healthier alternative to


---------38:20----------
to like taco meat i i get you though


---------38:25----------
not as tasty sometimes you want it to


---------38:26----------
just be greasy you just


---------38:28----------
want to be yeah but the chips and the


---------38:30----------
cheese is going to do that trust me


---------38:31----------
if you try putting some black beans on


---------38:33----------
there and you season them you got to


---------38:34----------
season them well


---------38:36----------
okay i'll give it a shot if you're


---------38:37----------
hungry enough at 2 30 in the morning


---------38:39----------
it's going to taste delicious man


---------38:41----------
you don't really need the taco beet try


---------38:43----------
it get back to me


---------38:45----------
me know i'll let you know dm me


---------38:48----------
let me know for sure um


---------38:51----------
but the the key thing here is that


---------38:53----------
there's a subtle thought and then it


---------38:55----------
leads to this pandora's boxes you put it


---------38:58----------
yeah and so the key thing is if you can


---------38:59----------
catch that subtle thought


---------39:01----------
at its inception and kind of


---------39:04----------
catch it and not let it grow and the way


---------39:06----------
that you not let it grow is you can


---------39:08----------
refocus your mind so i think you do a


---------39:10----------
good job of like you're the hotter in a


---------39:11----------
practice


---------39:11----------
which is you listen to the sounds so


---------39:14----------
literally what you're doing with your


---------39:15----------
concentration and your attention


---------39:17----------
is you're focusing on a sound and if


---------39:18----------
you're focusing on a sound you literally


---------39:20----------
cannot think at the same time


---------39:23----------
you may have distracting thoughts so


---------39:25----------
like your mind is focused on the sound


---------39:27----------
and then it like deviates this way and


---------39:28----------
then you bring it back to the sound


---------39:30----------
then it deviates this way and you bring


---------39:31----------
it back to the sound if it deviates a


---------39:33----------
third time and each time it deviates it


---------39:35----------
gets a little bit weaker a little bit


---------39:37----------
weaker a little bit weaker


---------39:38----------
and then ultimately it'll stop and then


---------39:40----------
you'll be in the zone


---------39:41----------
so that's literally the practice of


---------39:43----------
meditation


---------39:45----------
yeah um and it starts with a subtle


---------39:48----------
thought we talked about expectation


---------39:50----------
we talked about ego so now we're going


---------39:53----------
to talk about


---------39:55----------
momentum any questions so far


---------40:00----------
no okay so quick question we're gonna


---------40:02----------
we're gonna


---------40:03----------
i'm gonna just check in with twitch chat


---------40:05----------
for a second i usually don't look at


---------40:06----------
twitch chat but


---------40:08----------
twitch chat do you guys have any


---------40:09----------
questions so far or is this making sense


---------40:14----------
i see you got some new emotes in the


---------40:15----------
chat i was looking earlier you got the


---------40:17----------
the fish fish bog do you see those on


---------40:20----------
your screen


---------40:21----------
i don't know what that is it's like the


---------40:23----------
fish that's just


---------40:24----------
going crazy oh that's what that is i've


---------40:26----------
been seeing that thing a lot


---------40:29----------
i didn't realize it was a fish


---------40:34----------
okay so so i'm asking them if they have


---------40:36----------
questions and all i'm seeing is the fish


---------40:38----------
i should have missed anything about that


---------40:40----------
no no i mean it's fine it's just


---------40:45----------
they're going crazy okay okay so i'm


---------40:48----------
gonna assume that this is good


---------40:49----------
because we're just seeing fish what does


---------40:51----------
the fish mean does the fish mean people


---------40:53----------
are happy or unhappy yeah it's just like


---------40:55----------
excitement it's


---------40:56----------
it's just like intensity like you just


---------40:58----------
amplify whatever you're saying if you


---------40:59----------
put the fish next to it i feel like


---------41:01----------
it's just high intensity okay


---------41:04----------
okay so so they seem to be they feel


---------41:07----------
like this is a super high intensity


---------41:09----------
conversation


---------41:10----------
about this no they're just saying it


---------41:13----------
because i said


---------41:14----------
fish fog okay yeah okay so let's talk


---------41:17----------
about momentum


---------41:18----------
so i want you to reframe so momentum is


---------41:20----------
like something that they obs you observe


---------41:22----------
after the fact


---------41:23----------
first thing right you're like yeah like


---------41:26----------
momentum is happening you don't know how


---------41:29----------
exactly how you create it but you


---------41:31----------
observe it


---------41:32----------
as an after effect


---------41:36----------
yeah i mean at least in the negative


---------41:38----------
senses i think when i'm doing like


---------41:40----------
positive things i can kind of feel it in


---------41:42----------
the moment but when it's like negative


---------41:43----------
or


---------41:44----------
bad it's like i go and start to go like


---------41:47----------
out of touch


---------41:48----------
and just sort of unconscious and then i


---------41:50----------
look back and i'm like wow that


---------41:52----------
that escalated quickly so i'm gonna


---------41:54----------
reframe momentum


---------41:56----------
with a different word i'm gonna call it


---------41:59----------
karma


---------42:00----------
or karma okay what do you think about


---------42:02----------
that does that


---------42:03----------
ring any bells for you yeah i've heard


---------42:06----------
you talk a lot about karma


---------42:08----------
it's it's like the cause and effect yep


---------42:11----------
and it's rawest form you call it like


---------42:13----------
cause effect


---------42:14----------
yep so if we think about momentum what i


---------42:17----------
think this means is that you are sowing


---------42:19----------
a seed


---------42:21----------
that reaps a fruit


---------42:24----------
which in turn gives you many more seeds


---------42:27----------
that you can plant


---------42:28----------
and that it like exponentially amplifies


---------42:32----------
yep so sowing positive karma leads to


---------42:35----------
positive karma and then if you continue


---------42:37----------
to sow positive karma


---------42:38----------
you're gonna reap positive karma and the


---------42:41----------
same is true of negativity


---------42:43----------
right if you give in to that first


---------42:45----------
subtle negative thought


---------42:47----------
you will reap 10 more negative thoughts


---------42:50----------
yeah and that becomes even harder


---------42:54----------
and then if you indulge those 10


---------42:55----------
thoughts you will reap


---------42:57----------
a hundred negative thoughts and even


---------43:00----------
women


---------43:02----------
and then you find yourself being 25


---------43:04----------
years old living at home


---------43:06----------
not sure what to do with your life


---------43:08----------
because you are


---------43:09----------
swimming in a half decade


---------43:12----------
of negative karma that you've sowed for


---------43:15----------
yourself


---------43:16----------
and whether it be nachos at 2 a.m


---------43:21----------
or you know indulging in certain kinds


---------43:24----------
of like


---------43:25----------
content on the internet that sort of


---------43:27----------
traps you or makes you thumb sick which


---------43:29----------
you can explain what that is


---------43:30----------
but like there's a lot of like negative


---------43:32----------
karma like using substances i think is a


---------43:35----------
good example


---------43:36----------
of something that alleviates feelings in


---------43:38----------
the present


---------43:39----------
but opens you up for negative karma down


---------43:41----------
the road


---------43:42----------
yeah you're more likely to turn to that


---------43:43----------
again absolutely because it doesn't


---------43:45----------
actually solve anything right it just


---------43:46----------
makes you feel better


---------43:47----------
yeah and even in some cases like if you


---------43:49----------
look at substances like marijuana


---------43:51----------
marijuana actually decreases your


---------43:53----------
motivate it doesn't make people stupider


---------43:54----------
but what it does is


---------43:55----------
is hamper with your motivational drives


---------43:59----------
and so the classic idea of a pothead is


---------44:00----------
someone who sits around and doesn't do


---------44:02----------
anything all day that's because


---------44:04----------
you know that's sort of somewhat true so


---------44:06----------
there are productive people who use


---------44:07----------
marijuana on a regular basis but if you


---------44:09----------
take 100 people


---------44:10----------
and they use marijuana and you take 100


---------44:12----------
people who don't use marijuana


---------44:13----------
the people who don't use marijuana are


---------44:16----------
more likely to be more productive


---------44:18----------
on average and so a lot of what what


---------44:21----------
happens in terms of like being stuck in


---------44:23----------
life


---------44:23----------
is essentially you're reaping all of


---------44:25----------
these bad fruit


---------44:27----------
fruits i mean the seeds that you sow


---------44:30----------
so you're reaping negative fruit from


---------44:33----------
sowing bad seeds


---------44:34----------
and in momentum it works both ways


---------44:38----------
right like like if you maintain a good


---------44:40----------
sleep schedule like why do you care


---------44:42----------
about maintaining a good sleep schedule


---------44:44----------
because then i everything else will be


---------44:47----------
better like i cannot focus


---------44:50----------
how the [ __ ] does that what do you mean


---------44:51----------
everything else will be better how does


---------44:52----------
that work


---------44:53----------
what do you mean everything will be


---------44:54----------
better what is it like just a flat out


---------44:55----------
buff 20


---------44:56----------
yeah yes you're damn right it is


---------45:00----------
and that's exactly how it works this is


---------45:02----------
sewing positive karma


---------45:04----------
right like literally your cognitions are


---------45:06----------
better


---------45:08----------
your brain clears out this waste product


---------45:10----------
called adenosine


---------45:12----------
which is like a waste product from your


---------45:14----------
brain and adenosine when your brain


---------45:16----------
uses energy for cognition it takes this


---------45:19----------
thing called


---------45:20----------
atp and turns it into adenosine


---------45:23----------
and then when you sleep you clear out


---------45:25----------
that adenosine and you turn it back into


---------45:27----------
atp


---------45:28----------
and it literally means that your brain


---------45:30----------
has more energy when you have restful


---------45:32----------
sleep


---------45:33----------
and people who do not have good restful


---------45:35----------
sleep cycles


---------45:36----------
which doesn't just mean the hours that


---------45:38----------
you sleep it also means the kind of


---------45:40----------
substances that are in your brain when


---------45:42----------
you fall asleep


---------45:43----------
it also means the ratio of like


---------45:46----------
rem sleep to non-rem sleep so generally


---------45:49----------
speaking this


---------45:50----------
your sleep cycle changes over the


---------45:52----------
duration of your sleep


---------45:55----------
so it starts out with longer i think


---------45:58----------
phase one and phase two sleep


---------46:00----------
and over time as you go through multiple


---------46:03----------
sleep cycles the phase one and phase two


---------46:05----------
shrink


---------46:06----------
and i think you have more non-rem sleep


---------46:08----------
i'm a little bit rusty on the details


---------46:11----------
but literally your fifth hour and sixth


---------46:14----------
hour of sleep


---------46:15----------
are not the same as your first or second


---------46:17----------
hour from


---------46:18----------
of sleep from a physiologic and


---------46:20----------
neuroscientific sense


---------46:22----------
and then furthermore that that shift


---------46:25----------
in your sleep cycle is reinforced by a


---------46:29----------
circadian rhythm do you know what that


---------46:30----------
means


---------46:32----------
that's just like your general sleep


---------46:34----------
schedule i don't know too much yep


---------46:35----------
so circadian rhythm is your body clock


---------46:38----------
so if you're used to sleeping at the


---------46:40----------
same time every day and it also is like


---------46:42----------
your bodily clock


---------46:43----------
it'll enhance the quality of your sleep


---------46:45----------
so i think a big problem in terms of


---------46:47----------
negative karma that our community faces


---------46:49----------
is that they're like


---------46:50----------
they have crappy sleep which in turn


---------46:53----------
means that they're like


---------46:54----------
when they you know when you rest you


---------46:56----------
play rpgs


---------46:58----------
on occasion so when you rest in an end


---------47:00----------
what happens to your mana bar


---------47:03----------
refill everything refills you're back


---------47:05----------
absolutely


---------47:06----------
and our community when they when they go


---------47:08----------
to sleep their mental


---------47:10----------
bar only fills up 60 and then they're


---------47:13----------
confused as


---------47:14----------
like why they suck at life right so it's


---------47:17----------
nuts


---------47:17----------
but like this kind of physiology


---------47:19----------
physiology stuff is is important


---------47:22----------
and then the other thing ryan i just


---------47:23----------
want to say explicitly is you are the


---------47:25----------
guy who holds the world record


---------47:27----------
for 120 stars in super mario


---------47:30----------
and you are also saying that sleep is


---------47:32----------
vitally important


---------47:34----------
yeah and so if you guys don't believe me


---------47:36----------
listen to the world champion


---------47:40----------
um it's tough though now cause like i


---------47:43----------
feel like since i got it


---------47:44----------
it's hard to care as much about that you


---------47:46----------
know like the hunger


---------47:47----------
yeah like the thirst to play well isn't


---------47:50----------
as


---------47:51----------
in front of my mind like i feel like


---------47:52----------
that i was able to keep a more


---------47:53----------
consistent sleep schedule before the


---------47:55----------
world record than after


---------47:56----------
yep so that's just like whatever now


---------47:58----------
we're going to talk about that and we're


---------48:00----------
going to explore a little bit further i


---------48:01----------
just want to tie up one last thing about


---------48:03----------
karma so what i want you to think about


---------48:05----------
for all of you guys is what are you


---------48:07----------
sewing for tomorrow


---------48:10----------
and and just like you said earlier if i


---------48:12----------
can do the laundry maybe i can play


---------48:14----------
super mario


---------48:16----------
right so every action you take you're


---------48:18----------
sewing you're sewing a seed that's going


---------48:20----------
to bear fruit


---------48:22----------
and so when you eat those nachos that's


---------48:25----------
cool like if you can even deviate a


---------48:27----------
little bit and throw a little bit of


---------48:28----------
tomato or bell pepper or cilantro on


---------48:30----------
there


---------48:31----------
that's actually going to help you out


---------48:33----------
the next day


---------48:36----------
that makes sense right so it's going to


---------48:38----------
help with your fiber


---------48:40----------
it's going to keep you regular it's


---------48:42----------
going to promote bacteria that are


---------48:43----------
anti-anxiety and anti-depression


---------48:46----------
in your gut when you have fresh fruits


---------48:49----------
and vegetables literally


---------48:50----------
not kidding there are studies that show


---------48:53----------
that you can take depressed mice


---------48:55----------
and do a stool transplant into healthy


---------48:57----------
mice and once you transplant their stool


---------49:00----------
from the depressed mouse to the healthy


---------49:02----------
mouse


---------49:02----------
the healthy mouse becomes depressed wild


---------49:06----------
but even something as simple as eating


---------49:08----------
fresh fruits and vegetables can actually


---------49:10----------
affect your mood


---------49:13----------
so think about good sleep good


---------49:15----------
absolutely


---------49:17----------
so but think about those things as


---------49:19----------
positive karmas and tell yourself that


---------49:21----------
like every time you you do an


---------49:22----------
action you're setting yourself up for a


---------49:25----------
man a buff


---------49:26----------
or a man a debuff three days from now


---------49:29----------
and the more that you can focus on


---------49:30----------
buffing up your mana bar like three four


---------49:32----------
five six seven days down the road the


---------49:34----------
better off you're gonna be


---------49:36----------
okay any questions about that or we you


---------49:39----------
wanna move to the hunger


---------49:40----------
that's no long that's now been satisfied


---------49:42----------
and no longer keeps you on track


---------49:44----------
um i guess one question about that is


---------49:47----------
like how


---------49:48----------
why is it so hard like even if you know


---------49:50----------
fully well like oh yeah if i go to sleep


---------49:52----------
that's definitely the better move


---------49:53----------
it's still really difficult to just


---------49:57----------
good like it's so easy to just stay up


---------50:00----------
and just make


---------50:00----------
make that play to nachos just why do you


---------50:03----------
think it's hard


---------50:08----------
probably because it's like an immediate


---------50:10----------
thing like you get an immediate


---------50:12----------
immediate satisfaction versus the


---------50:14----------
delayed


---------50:15----------
i'd go even further i'd say that what


---------50:18----------
you're get


---------50:19----------
what so this is the struggle it's not


---------50:21----------
even about immediate versus delayed


---------50:23----------
it's about real versus unreal


---------50:28----------
because what is that if you don't eat


---------50:30----------
the plate of nachos


---------50:31----------
what does tomorrow look like


---------50:34----------
it's the same and if you do eat the


---------50:37----------
nachos what does tomorrow look like


---------50:41----------
hopefully the same like you want to


---------50:43----------
believe there's no


---------50:44----------
there's no difference in your mind just


---------50:47----------
think about that for a second


---------50:50----------
and that's like the subtle thing yeah


---------50:52----------
you like if you you


---------50:54----------
think you can just do one but then once


---------50:56----------
you do one that's where it starts to


---------50:58----------
everything starts to like get distorted


---------51:01----------
because like like really when you're


---------51:02----------
sitting there and you're looking at the


---------51:04----------
plate of nachos and you say if i don't


---------51:05----------
eat this like what's gonna happen like


---------51:08----------
you're not


---------51:08----------
really sure it's just better for you


---------51:11----------
but what does that practically mean it


---------51:13----------
means nothing yeah


---------51:15----------
there's no tangible cost in your mind


---------51:19----------
so the reason that it's hard is not


---------51:20----------
because you're dumb or you're lazy


---------51:22----------
it's because your mind has a tangible


---------51:25----------
benefit


---------51:26----------
versus nothing


---------51:31----------
if you really stop and think about like


---------51:33----------
what you're gonna eat some you're gonna


---------51:35----------
chop up some bell pepper on your nachos


---------51:37----------
so


---------51:37----------
what happens nothing


---------51:41----------
nothing is gonna happen


---------51:44----------
if you eat the bell pepper you don't eat


---------51:46----------
the bell pepper how are you gonna ever


---------51:48----------
notice a difference you're not going to


---------51:49----------
notice a difference


---------51:51----------
yeah so this is where what you guys need


---------51:54----------
to learn how to do


---------51:56----------
is to act for no reason


---------51:59----------
the problem is that all of our actions


---------52:01----------
are driven by reasons


---------52:05----------
this is what paralyzes us


---------52:08----------
because we know what happens when you


---------52:09----------
play the game for reasons because we


---------52:11----------
talked about this right


---------52:13----------
what happens when you play the game for


---------52:14----------
reasons ryan


---------52:17----------
you start to get lost in the sauce


---------52:21----------
bizarre and crazy right yeah we're


---------52:24----------
taught our we're conditioned our entire


---------52:26----------
life to do something


---------52:27----------
because of something that's what [ __ ]


---------52:30----------
us


---------52:32----------
because what happened in our


---------52:33----------
generation's case is we were taught you


---------52:36----------
do this


---------52:36----------
and then this will happen and in our


---------52:39----------
case what happened


---------52:40----------
is like we were told go to college and


---------52:42----------
then you'll be


---------52:44----------
buy a house and then like that was a


---------52:46----------
scam


---------52:47----------
yeah and so we were taught yep we were


---------52:50----------
taught to do things for reasons and then


---------52:52----------
those reasons turned out to be false


---------52:54----------
so now you have a generation of people


---------52:55----------
who don't know how to act because every


---------52:57----------
time they've acted it's for a reason


---------53:01----------
and so bizarrely the way that you you


---------53:03----------
stop doing it


---------53:04----------
is that like you let go of the reason


---------53:07----------
you say to yourself


---------53:09----------
i'm not doing this because


---------53:12----------
stool transplants and rats alleviate


---------53:14----------
depression like that's a stretch


---------53:17----------
yeah right i'm doing this because i


---------53:19----------
choose to


---------53:20----------
i'm doing this because like as a human


---------53:22----------
being i want the capacity to control my


---------53:24----------
own life


---------53:26----------
and i want you guys to understand that


---------53:27----------
if you're doing something for a reason


---------53:29----------
you're not in control


---------53:30----------
because if you take the reason away you


---------53:32----------
wouldn't do it


---------53:34----------
but there's like a great reason and that


---------53:36----------
would that be dharma yes


---------53:37----------
that reason is internal though what i'm


---------53:40----------
talking about is a particular outcome


---------53:43----------
okay in terms of a reason right like if


---------53:45----------
i tell you why


---------53:46----------
why would you eat bell pepper like


---------53:48----------
there's an


---------53:49----------
external reason that you're weighing


---------53:51----------
against the immediate satisfaction of


---------53:53----------
eating the food


---------53:56----------
does that make sense or did i lose you


---------53:58----------
uh it's getting abstract okay


---------54:00----------
yeah let me try again so


---------54:03----------
you know there's a good outcome to


---------54:06----------
eating the plate of nachos


---------54:07----------
whereas not eating the nachos has an


---------54:09----------
unclear vague i'll be healthy


---------54:13----------
like that's not a real thing right


---------54:16----------
you have to like zoom out zoom out and


---------54:18----------
then and then also just do something for


---------54:20----------
the sake of doing it just like you said


---------54:21----------
when you play the game of mario


---------54:23----------
you're not thinking about an outcome


---------54:25----------
you're just doing it for the sake of


---------54:26----------
doing it


---------54:28----------
so what you need to train yourself to do


---------54:30----------
and it starts and then people say how do


---------54:32----------
you do this it starts small


---------54:33----------
right so the next time that you're


---------54:35----------
eating you prepare some food for


---------54:36----------
yourself


---------54:37----------
what you need to do is like do a tiny


---------54:39----------
like get a little bit of xp


---------54:40----------
the way that you get a little bit of xp


---------54:42----------
is you spend a little bit more effort


---------54:45----------
putting something on there that you


---------54:46----------
normally wouldn't put that's supposed to


---------54:48----------
be good for you


---------54:49----------
and you recognize that you are never


---------54:51----------
going to notice the difference


---------54:54----------
but you are doing it for the sake of


---------54:56----------
doing it you're playing the game for


---------54:57----------
mario you're not doing it for the world


---------54:59----------
record


---------55:00----------
so to act in that moment for the sake of


---------55:04----------
the thing


---------55:04----------
as opposed to some other thing you're


---------55:06----------
not doing it for viewership count you're


---------55:08----------
not doing it


---------55:08----------
for world record you're not doing it to


---------55:10----------
refill your mana bar


---------55:12----------
you're not doing it to be to live longer


---------55:16----------
you're not doing it to prevent


---------55:18----------
hemorrhoids you're just gonna do it


---------55:20----------
because that's what you've decided to do


---------55:23----------
just do it yes


---------55:26----------
but just do it is not easy that's not


---------55:29----------
how it works


---------55:30----------
just doing it is a god-awful struggle


---------55:33----------
against yourself


---------55:35----------
you recognize that within yourself there


---------55:37----------
are going to be a thousand reasons


---------55:38----------
which tell you don't do this thing


---------55:42----------
and then you tell them to go [ __ ]


---------55:43----------
themselves and you do it anyway


---------55:46----------
just do it is not easy it's in spite of


---------55:48----------
yourself


---------55:51----------
did you like force yourself yeah


---------55:54----------
not force overcome


---------55:58----------
okay and you're gonna lose that battle a


---------56:00----------
lot


---------56:02----------
and that's okay okay just gotta keep


---------56:05----------
resetting just like in mario 64 man


---------56:08----------
just got to keep going yep yep push


---------56:09----------
through it


---------56:11----------
okay other questions does that make


---------56:13----------
sense


---------56:15----------
okay so let's talk about the hunger so


---------56:18----------
you used to have this hunger


---------56:19----------
that aligned all of your actions yes


---------56:23----------
now what i don't know man now i'm just


---------56:27----------
like i got it


---------56:28----------
and you know before it was like this is


---------56:30----------
a challenge worth going for i've never


---------56:31----------
done it like if i can do it and conquer


---------56:33----------
the nerves that's huge


---------56:34----------
and now i did it once and i'm like and


---------56:36----------
and usually when people have gotten


---------56:37----------
world record in the past they keep going


---------56:39----------
and keep pushing and like push it lower


---------56:41----------
but every time it gets pushed lower it


---------56:42----------
does get harder to do


---------56:44----------
and so i'm just i'm really struggling to


---------56:47----------
to find


---------56:48----------
find that hunger yeah yeah so it sounds


---------56:52----------
to me like you've in a sense


---------56:53----------
completed this chapter of your life yeah


---------56:57----------
that's kind of where i'm at like i feel


---------56:58----------
sort of in limbo in that sense


---------57:00----------
yeah so then the question so that's okay


---------57:03----------
so let's start by just thinking


---------57:05----------
acknowledging that that just because


---------57:07----------
some people


---------57:09----------
continue to try to push it lower doesn't


---------57:11----------
mean you have to


---------57:14----------
how do you feel about yourself ryan


---------57:21----------
pretty good okay in general how did you


---------57:24----------
feel about yourself 10 months ago


---------57:27----------
um


---------57:31----------
10 months ago that's when i started


---------57:33----------
playing i felt really good


---------57:35----------
so i was like at the beginning of the


---------57:36----------
journey it felt like very fulfilled


---------57:38----------
okay 12 months ago really bad


---------57:42----------
tell me about that so at that time i was


---------57:46----------
dealing with like


---------57:47----------
carpal tunnel and tendonitis and that


---------57:50----------
was something that's why i had taken a


---------57:51----------
break from mario in the first place


---------57:53----------
and i was like really lost because i


---------57:54----------
wasn't doing anything like anything that


---------57:56----------
i liked doing


---------57:57----------
hurt because i had like this chronic


---------57:59----------
pain


---------58:00----------
and so like i like to make music i like


---------58:02----------
to um


---------58:06----------
what else coding obviously computer


---------58:08----------
science like i'd like to code stuff and


---------58:10----------
all that would just hurt and so i was


---------58:12----------
just kind of in pain and that was not


---------58:14----------
fun and so i didn't want to do anything


---------58:15----------
i couldn't play mario


---------58:17----------
and yeah i felt very very unfulfilled


---------58:20----------
that was probably like the worst part


---------58:22----------
probably like one of the darkest moments


---------58:23----------
of my life at least it felt like


---------58:25----------
just like very numb very unconscious


---------58:28----------
very robotic


---------58:28----------
and then um a viewer recommended a book


---------58:31----------
to me that


---------58:32----------
i was able to like conquer the


---------58:34----------
tendonitis and carpal tunnel with


---------58:36----------
and then i came back what's the book


---------58:39----------
the mind body prescription interesting


---------58:42----------
can you tell us about that it's this


---------58:46----------
idea that your repressed emotions are


---------58:49----------
causing


---------58:50----------
your pain like your tendonitis or carpal


---------58:54----------
tunnel


---------58:55----------
and so you have to like journal


---------58:59----------
and try to reflect and figure out what


---------59:01----------
are you not addressing


---------59:02----------
in your life that might be pressuring


---------59:05----------
you that you have no idea about


---------59:07----------
like yeah and did you find some that you


---------59:09----------
were


---------59:10----------
repressing something yeah it was mostly


---------59:13----------
stuff related to my family just like


---------59:15----------
worrying about


---------59:17----------
parts of my family was like a big one


---------59:20----------
and


---------59:20----------
myself like my pressure with school and


---------59:23----------
like doing the master's program


---------59:25----------
i think was causing a fair amount how do


---------59:27----------
you feel about the master's program


---------59:30----------
at the moment yeah like now um


---------59:34----------
i feel like it was a waste of time like


---------59:36----------
i


---------59:38----------
i did it mostly because my parents


---------59:40----------
wanted me to do it and it was like a


---------59:42----------
free ride


---------59:42----------
like i was able to get in and do


---------59:44----------
teachers assistantship so i was a ta


---------59:46----------
and then it was all paid for which


---------59:47----------
sounded like a great deal and i was like


---------59:48----------
okay i should do this


---------59:50----------
but then when i was actually doing it


---------59:51----------
like it felt very mundane and it felt


---------59:53----------
like


---------59:53----------
if i wanted to keep doing it i could


---------59:55----------
just do it on my own at this point like


---------59:56----------
i knew enough that i could just figure


---------59:58----------
out what i wanted to figure out if i


---------59:59----------
wanted to code something


---------60:00----------
or whatever do you want to code yeah


---------60:06----------
so are you learning how to code


---------60:11----------
that's something that is like it feels


---------60:13----------
like one of those side things that i


---------60:15----------
want to do that kind of fulfills


---------60:16----------
like i don't know soul i guess like it


---------60:19----------
feels very good to code


---------60:20----------
i've had some side projects in the past


---------60:22----------
and at the moment i'm like


---------60:23----------
waiting to get into the next one like i


---------60:25----------
have an idea i haven't sat down and


---------60:27----------
started it


---------60:28----------
what keeps you from sitting down and


---------60:29----------
starting it


---------60:37----------
i'm not really sure so i think that's


---------60:40----------
what we have to explore


---------60:43----------
so here's what i think um ryan


---------60:46----------
so i think that your karma and your


---------60:48----------
dharma


---------60:49----------
so karma triggers your dharma this is


---------60:52----------
the first thing to understand


---------60:54----------
so the example that i use is let's say


---------60:56----------
i'm a doctor


---------60:57----------
and i'm working in the emergency room


---------61:00----------
and what is my dharma


---------61:02----------
it depends on who comes in


---------61:05----------
right so if like no one comes in then my


---------61:07----------
time was to sleep well


---------61:10----------
if someone does come in overnight it's


---------61:12----------
to wake up and help those people


---------61:14----------
so in your case i think that your karma


---------61:17----------
called you to do certain things right so


---------61:20----------
if you think about it your circumstances


---------61:22----------
gave you the opportunity to do a


---------61:24----------
master's degree for free


---------61:26----------
and that sounds like a wonderful


---------61:27----------
wonderful thing you were so lucky ryan


---------61:30----------
so privileged yeah and then then you


---------61:32----------
were given that opportunity and then in


---------61:34----------
that opportunity you had this little


---------61:36----------
voice that said this is not for me


---------61:39----------
and then you embarked on this journey


---------61:40----------
your camera's blurry again by the way


---------61:42----------
oh no you embarked on this journey


---------61:46----------
and then you became a different person


---------61:48----------
over the course of the last year


---------61:50----------
and it is my belief that the person that


---------61:53----------
you are today


---------61:54----------
is necessary for the next thing that you


---------61:56----------
have to do


---------61:58----------
okay and that if you had not dropped out


---------62:01----------
of your master's program


---------62:03----------
you would still have to conquer that


---------62:05----------
level before you moved on to the next


---------62:08----------
one


---------62:09----------
but think about the person that you've


---------62:11----------
become over the last year it's a


---------62:13----------
completely different person


---------62:14----------
yeah and i don't think it's like it's


---------62:16----------
kind of bizarre but like you know in


---------62:17----------
video games we don't like go to the last


---------62:19----------
boss at level two


---------62:22----------
we go to the first boss at level two


---------62:25----------
yeah and then you get stronger and then


---------62:27----------
you do the next thing so now you have a


---------62:29----------
good understanding of like


---------62:31----------
to a certain degree expectation your


---------62:34----------
mind


---------62:34----------
how to do dharuna how to focus how to


---------62:37----------
let go of expectation how to let go of


---------62:39----------
comparison


---------62:40----------
that those are going to be important


---------62:42----------
skills for the next phase of your life


---------62:44----------
because the next phase of your life


---------62:46----------
sounds


---------62:47----------
like it's going to be directionless and


---------62:50----------
what you're going to happen


---------62:51----------
is as as you're directionless and you're


---------62:53----------
working on this little project


---------62:55----------
which is going to be your dharma you're


---------62:57----------
going to look at


---------62:58----------
a dozen other people who finish their


---------63:00----------
master's degrees and got jobs


---------63:04----------
and you're going to need a certain


---------63:05----------
amount of fortitude to stick with your


---------63:07----------
thing


---------63:09----------
yeah instead of deviating and the way


---------63:11----------
that you leveled that up


---------63:13----------
is through mario speedruns yeah


---------63:17----------
and so recognize that whatever force it


---------63:19----------
is that


---------63:20----------
has brought you this far is also


---------63:23----------
supporting you now


---------63:24----------
and now the next thing it's trying to


---------63:26----------
teach you is like


---------63:28----------
why aren't you doing that coding project


---------63:32----------
that's the next phase i i suspect it may


---------63:35----------
be something else


---------63:36----------
but i think that you know what you want


---------63:38----------
to do and your


---------63:40----------
your next phase isn't just figuring out


---------63:43----------
like the motivation and studying


---------63:46----------
yourself and looking at yourself and


---------63:47----------
starting to do those things


---------63:50----------
and remembering that like you can get


---------63:51----------
caught up about what you should do and


---------63:53----------
stuff like that but


---------63:54----------
once you pick up the controller and you


---------63:56----------
start playing the game the rest is going


---------63:57----------
to take care of itself


---------63:59----------
yeah starting is the hardest part yep


---------64:02----------
and so now you need to learn how to do


---------64:03----------
that


---------64:04----------
because now you've got 10 percent to 90


---------64:08----------
taken care of


---------64:09----------
[Music]


---------64:11----------
it's zero to ten you've been training on


---------64:13----------
10 to 90 for the last year


---------64:15----------
and even to a certain degree you've also


---------64:17----------
trained about getting zero to ten


---------64:20----------
but i i mean to me it feels like you


---------64:22----------
should code what do you think about that


---------64:25----------
i mean while i'm still streaming like


---------64:26----------
that's my main thing i'm still doing


---------64:28----------
full-time streaming


---------64:29----------
so i obviously want to keep doing that


---------64:31----------
but yeah i think


---------64:33----------
when i think about like when i felt the


---------64:34----------
best it's like i'm feeding myself


---------64:37----------
i feel like there's two pillars of my


---------64:40----------
well-being it's like health is like


---------64:41----------
sleeping


---------64:42----------
eating meditating exercising and then


---------64:44----------
there's like soul


---------64:46----------
and that's like the hobbies like mario


---------64:48----------
code in music


---------64:49----------
whatever and so i just need to


---------64:53----------
actually do it like yep but but once


---------64:56----------
again


---------64:56----------
notice that you know actually doing it


---------64:58----------
is not just doing it


---------65:00----------
it's the opposite that every day you


---------65:02----------
wake up


---------65:04----------
and because remember like the reason you


---------65:06----------
can't do it is because you don't know


---------65:07----------
why you're doing it there's no goal


---------65:11----------
does that make sense yeah and so what's


---------65:14----------
the solution


---------65:15----------
to that do you have a sense


---------65:20----------
going in without any expectations yep


---------65:24----------
what that means is to have no reason to


---------65:26----------
do it


---------65:28----------
remember that right so like the the key


---------65:30----------
here is like why is it hard to eat the


---------65:31----------
plated i mean


---------65:32----------
why is it easy to eat the plate of


---------65:33----------
nachos it's because you do something


---------65:36----------
for a reason or no reason and it's hard


---------65:39----------
to pick no reason over a reason


---------65:42----------
yeah for sure and so you're going to


---------65:44----------
wake up tomorrow


---------65:46----------
and you're going to have no reason to


---------65:47----------
code and you've got to do it anyway


---------65:49----------
acknowledge that notice that


---------65:51----------
say that there's a part of me that wants


---------65:53----------
to sow the seed of karma


---------65:55----------
that will bear fruit three months from


---------65:57----------
now


---------65:58----------
but the effort of digging and planting


---------66:01----------
and planting and sticking the seed in


---------66:02----------
is like you're not going to see any


---------66:04----------
yield from that maybe the seed will


---------66:05----------
never grow


---------66:08----------
just do it is not easy it's actually


---------66:10----------
very hard you have to do it in spite


---------66:12----------
of all the things that hold you back


---------66:15----------
i like that right it's like you have to


---------66:18----------
continue playing


---------66:19----------
in spite of the fact that you're number


---------66:22----------
three


---------66:25----------
moving forward in life is about


---------66:27----------
abandoning reasons


---------66:28----------
not finding them yeah


---------66:31----------
i think i realized that when i actually


---------66:34----------
like finally made that final push to


---------66:35----------
record like i


---------66:37----------
i was like i know i can't do anything


---------66:38----------
about viewership or anything i just like


---------66:40----------
completely surrendered


---------66:41----------
and i was like i'm just gonna play i'm


---------66:42----------
not looking anymore and then that's when


---------66:44----------
everything just got way better


---------66:46----------
yep so so these are concepts that


---------66:48----------
unfortunately have gotten tangled up


---------66:50----------
with re


---------66:50----------
religion but devotion and surrender are


---------66:53----------
key


---------66:55----------
yeah this concept of like that's


---------66:57----------
literally what happened with me too like


---------66:59----------
i showed up on twitch one day and i was


---------67:00----------
like i'm gonna do this thing


---------67:03----------
and i thought that if in one year if i


---------67:05----------
had 200 concurrent viewers that would be


---------67:07----------
a success


---------67:09----------
it turns out that yes slightly more than


---------67:12----------
that


---------67:13----------
yeah right and i i think it's about


---------67:14----------
devoting yourself to the action and not


---------67:16----------
worrying about the viewership count


---------67:19----------
recently too we had a little bit of a


---------67:21----------
you know an interesting conversation at


---------67:23----------
healthygamer about like


---------67:24----------
who we interview on stream and what kind


---------67:26----------
of content we do


---------67:28----------
because we noticed that the more bigger


---------67:30----------
streamers we have the bigger our


---------67:31----------
viewership is and so it's like do we


---------67:33----------
want to cater to that do we want to


---------67:34----------
continue growing


---------67:35----------
we said actually no that's not what we


---------67:38----------
showed up here to do


---------67:40----------
we showed up here to help people and if


---------67:41----------
our viewership tanks our viewership


---------67:43----------
tanks


---------67:43----------
so be it right it's about having


---------67:46----------
conversations oh you're not like because


---------67:47----------
here's the thing ryan you're not gonna


---------67:49----------
have some kind of emotional catharsis at


---------67:50----------
the end of this conversation


---------67:52----------
yeah which is gonna impact our


---------67:54----------
viewership


---------67:57----------
but instead what we're going to try to


---------67:59----------
do is help you


---------68:02----------
and if the viewership goes down the


---------68:03----------
viewership goes down


---------68:06----------
right you do the thing for the sake of


---------68:07----------
the thing


---------68:09----------
yeah and in your case


---------68:12----------
i don't know exactly what it looks like


---------68:14----------
but i i think i'm not too worried about


---------68:16----------
you finding your dog


---------68:17----------
because i think it's just you've got


---------68:19----------
that voice like you know you want to


---------68:21----------
code or make music or whatever


---------68:23----------
so you start planting those seeds and


---------68:25----------
then something will take


---------68:26----------
root and then karma will show up and


---------68:28----------
will tell you what to do


---------68:31----------
but garma waits until you're ready and


---------68:34----------
what that mean do you want what kind of


---------68:35----------
coding do you want to do if you don't


---------68:36----------
mind me asking


---------68:38----------
making games obviously right so like


---------68:41----------
this is where i think bizarrely if you


---------68:43----------
want to


---------68:44----------
make a particular kind of game or you


---------68:46----------
want to work for a studio


---------68:49----------
do you have a resume no


---------68:52----------
i mean yeah but it's outdated kind of so


---------68:54----------
like i i think that


---------68:56----------
you know as crazy as this sounds i think


---------68:58----------
if you say i was in a master's program


---------69:00----------
so you're gonna have a cover letter


---------69:02----------
and you say i love games i love to code


---------69:05----------
you've got to code a couple of things


---------69:06----------
so that you have like some kind of


---------69:07----------
resume then i would put on your cover


---------69:10----------
letter i draw i had a full ride master's


---------69:12----------
program that i dropped out of


---------69:13----------
to become a streamer and i hold the


---------69:16----------
record for super mario 64. now i'm ready


---------69:19----------
to get back into coding


---------69:21----------
i understand games i understand them in


---------69:23----------
and out


---------69:24----------
i'm also a good coder and i don't need a


---------69:26----------
degree for that


---------69:27----------
will you give me a job here's what i can


---------69:30----------
do


---------69:31----------
and if i was a game developer i would


---------69:33----------
[ __ ] hire you internet stuff


---------69:35----------
it's good right it's bizarre


---------69:39----------
there are a thousand kids out there who


---------69:40----------
have masters in computer science


---------69:43----------
very few hold the world record in


---------69:44----------
anything


---------69:46----------
it speaks to me of dedication of focus


---------69:49----------
of a love of video games and if you can


---------69:51----------
code on top of that


---------69:53----------
[ __ ] a


---------69:56----------
okay what do you think about that


---------69:59----------
i think you're right i think


---------70:03----------
i just gotta like just doing it but not


---------70:06----------
doing it for any reason


---------70:07----------
yep right and i would suspect


---------70:11----------
that you thought that certain things


---------70:14----------
needed to happen


---------70:15----------
before you could get a job where you


---------70:17----------
want a job


---------70:21----------
i guess i mean i'm not um not really at


---------70:23----------
the moment thinking about like getting a


---------70:25----------
job though like i kind of want to do it


---------70:26----------
solo


---------70:27----------
stuff with streaming but yeah yeah so i


---------70:30----------
mean i think if you want to do stuff


---------70:31----------
solo you do


---------70:31----------
you don't have to get a job but i think


---------70:33----------
if you want to make games you should


---------70:34----------
[ __ ] wake up tomorrow and you should


---------70:36----------
start making games


---------70:37----------
or today right or today beautiful


---------70:41----------
it's a trick question saw through the


---------70:43----------
trap


---------70:45----------
right so i pay attention to a chat this


---------70:46----------
guy understands what he's talking about


---------70:50----------
tomorrow is it's easy


---------70:54----------
it's hard yeah but so the last thing


---------70:57----------
that i'll leave you with ryan is that


---------70:58----------
there is a game inside you


---------71:02----------
and that one day maybe a year from now


---------71:05----------
maybe five years from now or 10 years


---------71:07----------
from now


---------71:08----------
there's a bit going to be a kid who is


---------71:09----------
lost and directionless


---------71:12----------
and in order to help him you have to


---------71:14----------
make the game that he's going to play


---------71:16----------
to inspire him


---------71:20----------
i like that so that is your title


---------71:24----------
that like you have to understand that


---------71:26----------
somewhere just think about the person


---------71:27----------
who made super mario 64. what kind of


---------71:29----------
struggles do you think they had


---------71:32----------
how did the game get made


---------71:37----------
i mean consoles coming out pressure to


---------71:40----------
bring out like the first 3d game and


---------71:42----------
like you want it to be good you want it


---------71:44----------
to be memorable


---------71:44----------
you want it to be like a crazy


---------71:46----------
experience


---------71:49----------
on all of those accounts those are all


---------71:51----------
expectations


---------71:52----------
you see that that is not it's meeting


---------71:56----------
expectations that gets the kind of


---------71:58----------
aaa trash that we see it's formulaic


---------72:02----------
video gaming


---------72:03----------
that we see a lot of


---------72:07----------
i don't believe for a second that the


---------72:09----------
person who made super mario 64


---------72:12----------
the team that made super mario 64 was


---------72:14----------
trying to live up to expectations


---------72:17----------
i think what happened if i if i had to


---------72:18----------
bet money what i would say is there was


---------72:20----------
a group of people who loved mario


---------72:22----------
and said we now have the technology to


---------72:24----------
have mario move


---------72:25----------
in more than two directions


---------72:28----------
what kind of mate game can we make


---------72:31----------
and it's that desire it's the desire to


---------72:33----------
like create something that


---------72:35----------
in the frontier of video gaming nothing


---------72:37----------
had ever been made before


---------72:39----------
i want to make a mario game where i can


---------72:41----------
hide a star


---------72:42----------
in a place that has never been hidden


---------72:44----------
before even the concept of stars


---------72:47----------
just think about that non-linearity of


---------72:50----------
levels


---------72:51----------
necessitated the concept of stars to


---------72:53----------
begin with


---------72:55----------
because where is the point there's a


---------72:57----------
there's a linear trajectory in a 2d game


---------73:00----------
right in a 3d game like how do you


---------73:02----------
design a linear trajectory they had to


---------73:04----------
break out of the idea of a start and a


---------73:06----------
finish to a level


---------73:08----------
how do you guide a player when there's


---------73:10----------
no end of the level


---------73:13----------
gotta have the objectives exact


---------73:15----------
collectibles the moons the stars


---------73:18----------
but see the moons and the stars are all


---------73:20----------
objectives that's not what the first


---------73:22----------
person thought


---------73:24----------
that's what the duplicators thought does


---------73:27----------
that make sense


---------73:29----------
yeah they'd seen it done before yep


---------73:32----------
so that's what i think it happens to


---------73:34----------
mario now is they're like repeating a


---------73:35----------
formula


---------73:37----------
and they innovate a little bit but i


---------73:38----------
think the person who made super mario 64


---------73:40----------
was true like the team was truly


---------73:42----------
revolutionary


---------73:44----------
they tried to make the best game that


---------73:45----------
they could with like this entire new


---------73:47----------
dimension of technology it's like


---------73:49----------
i've played the flute my whole life and


---------73:51----------
suddenly you're giving me a set of drums


---------73:54----------
it's like what can i make with this


---------73:55----------
entire other instrument and i think


---------73:56----------
that's what you've got to do


---------73:58----------
you've got to think about the game that


---------74:00----------
hasn't been made before


---------74:01----------
that you have to make because you're a


---------74:05----------
[ __ ] gamer man and you're one of us


---------74:08----------
so we need good [ __ ] to play


---------74:11----------
how does that sound for the thunder that


---------74:14----------
sounds pretty good


---------74:16----------
that does sound pretty good hesitations


---------74:20----------
i mean a little bit i still


---------74:23----------
like i think that is definitely part of


---------74:25----------
it but i feel like i still have


---------74:27----------
like streaming is like my main thing


---------74:30----------
that i'm doing like with most of my time


---------74:32----------
and so i guess i mean the game does


---------74:35----------
involve streaming so


---------74:37----------
that would that would make sense so i


---------74:40----------
don't think it's like exclusive


---------74:43----------
i think the the big problem that i see


---------74:45----------
with you is like a hump to get started


---------74:47----------
so i'd say get started


---------74:48----------
and maybe you won't end up making a game


---------74:50----------
maybe it won't work out whatever


---------74:52----------
but devote yourself to the task and see


---------74:54----------
if that amount of inspiration is enough


---------74:56----------
to get you started


---------74:57----------
and then your karma will determine the


---------74:59----------
rest


---------75:01----------
you'll wake up one day and then just


---------75:03----------
like you said with super mario 64


---------75:05----------
you'll wake up one day and you'll say i


---------75:07----------
can do this


---------75:10----------
and i can't do this exactly and so all


---------75:13----------
you have to do is sew the karma


---------75:15----------
to give yourself a chance


---------75:19----------
all right


---------75:22----------
sounds good i will give it a chance okay


---------75:25----------
give it a shot


---------75:26----------
what about undesirable traits


---------75:30----------
um something that has come up and has


---------75:33----------
always kind of been around is like


---------75:34----------
jealousy


---------75:35----------
like i said before like that was with


---------75:37----------
mario and now it's getting blurry man i


---------75:39----------
don't know why just


---------75:40----------
it's everything you should pour it in


---------75:41----------
the chair like when you do that is when


---------75:42----------
it gets bored all right that's okay all


---------75:43----------
right


---------75:45----------
and now it's like i have seen some


---------75:47----------
growth from


---------75:48----------
streaming um and now i i'm


---------75:52----------
before i wasn't really comparing or


---------75:54----------
sorry before i was comparing


---------75:55----------
and then i saw some growth you know from


---------75:57----------
world record


---------75:58----------
and now it's like i thought that i


---------76:01----------
solved it because i wasn't doing it


---------76:03----------
anymore but now i'm finding like


---------76:04----------
new things to compare to other streamers


---------76:06----------
that are bigger you know it's always


---------76:08----------
like the climb


---------76:09----------
and it's just it feels awful and that


---------76:11----------
that's part of the thing that pushes the


---------76:12----------
momentum sometimes like


---------76:14----------
it's it's not even about like should i


---------76:16----------
get a plate of chips


---------76:17----------
it's like i'm comparing and then the


---------76:19----------
next thing i know i'm like eating and


---------76:20----------
then i'm up late


---------76:22----------
if that makes sense at all yeah explain


---------76:25----------
that to us a little bit


---------76:27----------
so


---------76:31----------
like up late at night and i'm looking at


---------76:34----------
my stats


---------76:35----------
and then i'm thinking about other


---------76:36----------
streamers who are around my size who are


---------76:38----------
bigger than me or who have like grown


---------76:40----------
faster than me and just looking at their


---------76:42----------
size just like literally just looking at


---------76:44----------
the stats looking back and forth and


---------76:45----------
being like okay


---------76:45----------
i i'm not as i'm not growing as fast or


---------76:49----------
like


---------76:49----------
i'm not seeing like growth that i want


---------76:51----------
and then


---------76:53----------
i mean it seems so obvious like looking


---------76:54----------
back on it now but in the moment it


---------76:56----------
feels like


---------76:56----------
it just makes perfect sense like i'm not


---------76:59----------
it's not like egotistical


---------77:01----------
but or it's not like negative but that's


---------77:04----------
like the subtle thoughts


---------77:05----------
yep so let me ask you a question why do


---------77:08----------
you look at the stats late at night


---------77:13----------
it's like when i end stream i finish


---------77:15----------
stream and then i'll like look at my


---------77:16----------
stats


---------77:17----------
and then be like okay what frame of mind


---------77:19----------
are you in when you finish stream


---------77:22----------
um kind of tired like


---------77:26----------
feeling like i'd accomplish that so now


---------77:28----------
i can like turn my brain off kind of


---------77:29----------
thing and be lazy


---------77:31----------
yep and then when you when your brain is


---------77:33----------
in a lazy place


---------77:35----------
and you look at stats what happens


---------77:41----------
i start comparing myself


---------77:45----------
it's just like it's so easy to do it's


---------77:46----------
like automatic like


---------77:48----------
and and twitch will do it for you


---------77:49----------
they'll be like oh this stream compared


---------77:51----------
to your last stream like it'll say right


---------77:52----------
in front like


---------77:53----------
less followers or more viewers you know


---------77:56----------
and you either feel good or bad but like


---------77:58----------
i don't i don't want to have that at all


---------77:59----------
i don't want to be like


---------78:01----------
have those good feelings or have those


---------78:02----------
bad feelings so we can talk about you


---------78:04----------
know


---------78:05----------
the nature of your confidence and


---------78:06----------
jealousy and all that kind of crap


---------78:08----------
but today i want to focus on the process


---------78:10----------
and mechanism of mind


---------78:12----------
so first thing that i want to point out


---------78:14----------
is that when you're feeling lazy


---------78:16----------
and you're out of mana and you look at


---------78:19----------
your stats


---------78:20----------
yeah when you're exhausted


---------78:24----------
how able are you to catch the subtle


---------78:26----------
thoughts and steer them in a different


---------78:27----------
direction


---------78:29----------
not at all right and so then they start


---------78:33----------
to feed


---------78:34----------
and they start to grow it's just as


---------78:37----------
simple as when you look at your twitch


---------78:39----------
stats


---------78:41----------
i would once again i would once again


---------78:44----------
bet money that if you looked at twitch


---------78:46----------
stats


---------78:47----------
if you dedicated a time of your day to


---------78:50----------
work


---------78:51----------
on your stream not just look at it like


---------78:54----------
a report card


---------78:56----------
but say like okay how can i grow my


---------78:58----------
stream let's do some analysis


---------79:01----------
but you did so with a full mana bar your


---------79:03----------
experience will be completely different


---------79:08----------
so maybe don't do it late at night after


---------79:09----------
i'm burnt out when i'm not really in a


---------79:11----------
great place to


---------79:14----------
be doing it exactly right so if you're


---------79:16----------
not in a great place


---------79:17----------
your mind is gonna be exhausted and then


---------79:20----------
you're gonna latch on


---------79:21----------
to things that you normally wouldn't


---------79:23----------
latch onto with a clean head


---------79:26----------
definitely and so as bizarre as that is


---------79:29----------
like it's it's strange but like just the


---------79:31----------
fact that you're looking


---------79:32----------
and it's hard because i don't know why


---------79:36----------
our mind does this but


---------79:37----------
our mind feeds us the worst kind of


---------79:41----------
information when we are the most


---------79:43----------
vulnerable


---------79:45----------
when you're feeling bad about yourself


---------79:47----------
is when you go and like you look at like


---------79:50----------
the social media profile of your


---------79:52----------
ex-girlfriend who cheated on you


---------79:53----------
and saw how awesome her life is yeah you


---------79:57----------
just wanna


---------79:57----------
it's weird i have no idea but it's like


---------80:00----------
you want it to get worse


---------80:01----------
yep in a way like a part of you you just


---------80:03----------
want to make it the worst it can be


---------80:05----------
absolutely it's weird right that our


---------80:08----------
mind doesn't


---------80:08----------
and you let it yeah


---------80:12----------
because there's like i mean that happens


---------80:13----------
like with friends too like good friends


---------80:15----------
like


---------80:16----------
friends that i really like hanging out


---------80:17----------
with and like talking with you know


---------80:19----------
when good things happen to them like


---------80:20----------
there is always that side that's like


---------80:22----------
man i want i want that to happen to me


---------80:24----------
like i


---------80:25----------
like envy or jealousy and trying to find


---------80:27----------
a way to like


---------80:28----------
you know sometimes i'm like i'm so happy


---------80:30----------
for you but like i'm really


---------80:31----------
like the way i'm feeling is not exactly


---------80:33----------
that but i don't want to say that


---------80:34----------
because it's like


---------80:36----------
you're just a bad bad friend if you're


---------80:38----------
just like jealous of someone


---------80:40----------
yep so i i think uh ryan you have some


---------80:43----------
work left to do my friend


---------80:46----------
right so there's something about you and


---------80:48----------
and maybe this is a conversation for a


---------80:50----------
different day


---------80:51----------
because i don't know we have if we have


---------80:53----------
the time for it today but to think a


---------80:54----------
little bit about why can't you be happy


---------80:56----------
for someone else


---------80:57----------
because something within you is


---------80:59----------
unsatisfied


---------81:01----------
that makes sense right it's like when i


---------81:03----------
sit down to dinner


---------81:05----------
and i eat my meal and then someone else


---------81:08----------
is eating their meal and they say wow


---------81:09----------
this is really delicious


---------81:11----------
and i can be like oh wow that's awesome


---------81:13----------
man i'm glad you really enjoyed it


---------81:15----------
but if i don't have any food and i'm


---------81:17----------
broke and homeless and someone else is


---------81:19----------
talking about how


---------81:20----------
their food is so delicious it's really


---------81:22----------
hard for me to be genuinely happy with


---------81:24----------
that


---------81:25----------
for them all right so what's missing


---------81:29----------
you got to have a good meal you got to


---------81:30----------
be enjoying what you're eating then you


---------81:32----------
don't care


---------81:32----------
like yeah i think i've the jealousy has


---------81:36----------
definitely been worse


---------81:36----------
after the world record than before for


---------81:38----------
sure because i felt like way more


---------81:39----------
fulfilled


---------81:40----------
during the grind that makes sense


---------81:44----------
and so there's something left where like


---------81:45----------
you had to conquer some demons


---------81:48----------
to be able to walk away from on paper


---------81:50----------
what seemed like a wonderful opportunity


---------81:52----------
for a master's degree


---------81:54----------
and live your life and you've achieved


---------81:56----------
and it sounds also like you had to do


---------81:58----------
some emotional work


---------82:00----------
around conquering your tendonitis in


---------82:02----------
your carpal tunnel


---------82:03----------
yeah but i think there's definitely a


---------82:05----------
conversation that needs to be had about


---------82:07----------
like


---------82:08----------
why are you unsatisfied with the life


---------82:10----------
that you have


---------82:11----------
and i think you know the answer yeah


---------82:16----------
yeah got a code gotta feed my soul


---------82:19----------
a little bit more i don't i don't think


---------82:21----------
that that's the entirety of it


---------82:24----------
i think that something happened to you


---------82:26----------
that left you very unsatisfied you felt


---------82:28----------
like you got a bad beat


---------82:32----------
i think that there's there's some


---------82:33----------
expectation in your life that has been


---------82:36----------
dashed


---------82:38----------
yeah think about that it's probably the


---------82:40----------
world record like i had this big


---------82:42----------
goal and then i finally achieved it and


---------82:44----------
then like nothing really changed


---------82:46----------
i got surprised how little i felt after


---------82:48----------
getting it


---------82:49----------
felt like a void kind of


---------82:53----------
interesting i would suspect that


---------82:55----------
something happened even earlier in your


---------82:57----------
life and that it's not related to the


---------82:58----------
world record at all


---------83:00----------
but definitely you know you're saying


---------83:02----------
that the world record felt


---------83:04----------
kind of like a let yeah i mean in the


---------83:06----------
moment it felt amazing but like the


---------83:08----------
following days it's like


---------83:09----------
okay now what yeah so then now what is


---------83:13----------
also


---------83:13----------
some part of your being telling you now


---------83:16----------
what let's do something else


---------83:17----------
which is okay i have a question


---------83:21----------
about like when is there any like


---------83:23----------
question i can ask


---------83:24----------
myself when i to to check


---------83:27----------
like if i'm in the state of am i sewing


---------83:31----------
like negative or positive karma is there


---------83:32----------
a way


---------83:34----------
to check or do you just have is it just


---------83:35----------
depend on the thought like


---------83:37----------
better ways to tell okay is this going


---------83:39----------
to be bad or good


---------83:42----------
yes i think it's not so much a question


---------83:45----------
but a state of mind


---------83:46----------
so i'd say that the two things to look


---------83:48----------
at is am i experiencing negative emotion


---------83:51----------
and is ego present here


---------83:54----------
right so it's about looking at


---------83:56----------
expectation it's about looking at ego


---------83:58----------
it's about looking at your internal


---------83:59----------
state of self


---------84:01----------
and if you're behaving from a tranquil


---------84:03----------
center


---------84:04----------
then you'll sow positive karma


---------84:08----------
and if you're behaving from a


---------84:10----------
non-tranquil center then you'll sow


---------84:12----------
negative karma


---------84:14----------
and i would really like so i think a


---------84:16----------
good example is like really look at


---------84:18----------
yourself when you finish stream


---------84:19----------
why do you want to look at stream stats


---------84:22----------
then


---------84:25----------
it's just like it's become a habit over


---------84:27----------
time i guess i don't doubt it but why


---------84:30----------
did you start


---------84:38----------
i'm not sure i mean i think it's just


---------84:40----------
like a natural thing you want to see if


---------84:41----------
you're growing or not you want to see if


---------84:42----------
you're doing good


---------84:44----------
see there's reasons there


---------84:48----------
you want to see if you're growing or not


---------84:52----------
that's expectation it's about benchmarks


---------84:57----------
you know and i do think it's important


---------84:58----------
to do as a streamer like you've got to


---------85:00----------
look at your stats


---------85:01----------
but like you want to do so like i would


---------85:03----------
check your stats like once a week


---------85:05----------
that's a good idea and also compile it


---------85:07----------
with like okay what are strategies like


---------85:09----------
don't just look at other people and be


---------85:11----------
like driven by jealousy in a sense of


---------85:13----------
whether you're falling behind or not


---------85:15----------
recognize that as a streamer you need to


---------85:17----------
do some things to grow your stream


---------85:20----------
and sit down i mean this is in a sense


---------85:22----------
i'm lucky because


---------85:23----------
like i don't worry about growing my


---------85:25----------
stream like someone is kind enough to


---------85:27----------
help me do that


---------85:28----------
so they worry about all that [ __ ] and


---------85:30----------
for them like so it's it's nice because


---------85:32----------
i like literally in my life i've been


---------85:34----------
lucky enough to separate out the stream


---------85:36----------
growth from the actual streaming


---------85:40----------
is nice and and not everyone has that


---------85:43----------
privilege


---------85:43----------
and so i'm grateful for it and at the


---------85:45----------
same time you've got to do that


---------85:46----------
cognitively


---------85:48----------
yeah be your own like stream producer


---------85:51----------
for some hours of the day and i'd even


---------85:53----------
go as far as to say like


---------85:54----------
i don't know if you adhere to a schedule


---------85:56----------
or a calendar but i'd block off time and


---------85:59----------
be like okay i'm gonna look at three


---------86:01----------
other streamers and try to figure out


---------86:02----------
what are they doing that i want to do


---------86:04----------
just the same way that you did it with


---------86:06----------
with super mario 64.


---------86:08----------
which is not to compare yourself but


---------86:10----------
like be like okay what are the tricks


---------86:11----------
that they're using that i could think


---------86:13----------
about implementing


---------86:14----------
what do i want to go with what do i not


---------86:15----------
want to go with sit down look at all


---------86:16----------
your stream stats


---------86:18----------
okay because one of the most dangerous


---------86:20----------
things we see this in our coaching


---------86:21----------
program is like we collect a lot of


---------86:23----------
feedback


---------86:24----------
but we don't share it with our coaches


---------86:25----------
right away can you imagine why


---------86:30----------
collect a lot of feedback but you don't


---------86:32----------
share it with the coaches


---------86:33----------
right away


---------86:38----------
no so if we share bad feedback too


---------86:41----------
quickly


---------86:42----------
it's going to bias them the next session


---------86:46----------
sure right so what we want to do is


---------86:48----------
aggregate feedback


---------86:50----------
and look at trends not


---------86:53----------
not let people get biased because anyone


---------86:55----------
can have a bad day


---------86:56----------
but if i share a bad feedback what kind


---------86:58----------
of karma am i sewing for them for the


---------87:00----------
next week


---------87:02----------
more like they'll they'll be in their


---------87:04----------
head more they won't be able to just do


---------87:05----------
the task they're going to be like


---------87:07----------
i want to keep i want to be with coach


---------87:09----------
yep


---------87:10----------
i want to do good and then that will


---------87:12----------
inevitably be bad


---------87:13----------
yep right so we actually are careful


---------87:16----------
with how


---------87:17----------
how we share our data so we amalgamate


---------87:19----------
it and we look for trends


---------87:21----------
but anyone can have an off day and any


---------87:23----------
client can be


---------87:24----------
upset on a particular day or not feel


---------87:26----------
like they were helped


---------87:28----------
that's good i got to get the big sample


---------87:30----------
size example


---------87:32----------
and the problem is that when you're out


---------87:34----------
of mana at the end of the day


---------87:36----------
and you look at your stats your mind has


---------87:39----------
a cognitive bias towards the negative


---------87:43----------
and then over time it creates the


---------87:45----------
impression that you're doing a bad job


---------87:48----------
okay because not only is there


---------87:50----------
insufficient sample size there's


---------87:51----------
selectivity of the data that you collect


---------87:54----------
and we do this to ourselves all the time


---------87:57----------
right like there are people like in our


---------87:59----------
community who have


---------88:00----------
a lot of evidence that they're going to


---------88:03----------
die alone


---------88:05----------
and sure like that evidence is there


---------88:07----------
it's just incomplete or it's selective


---------88:10----------
sure biased yep and it's because they


---------88:14----------
look for it at that time when they're


---------88:15----------
like they're feeling bad about


---------88:17----------
themselves so let me go hit myself in


---------88:19----------
the nuts


---------88:20----------
and look at how my best friend is now


---------88:22----------
doing awesome


---------88:23----------
and i'm a piece of [ __ ] and then it


---------88:26----------
confirms for them right oh i'm a piece


---------88:28----------
of [ __ ]


---------88:29----------
see here's data right here let me go


---------88:32----------
look at that other guy who's also


---------88:34----------
successful oh see


---------88:35----------
they're doing better you never compare


---------88:38----------
yourself to the


---------88:38----------
the streamers that stopped streaming six


---------88:40----------
months ago do you


---------88:42----------
no


---------88:45----------
why not


---------88:49----------
because they're not streaming you wanna


---------88:52----------
just compare with whoever's around


---------88:53----------
whoever you can see


---------88:54----------
whoever you hear about yeah but you're


---------88:57----------
not it's not a fair sample size because


---------88:58----------
when you started streaming let's say 10


---------89:00----------
months ago


---------89:01----------
some people washed out yeah and so


---------89:04----------
you're


---------89:04----------
always comparing yourself to people


---------89:06----------
above you and it gives you a really


---------89:08----------
really bad sense of where you truly are


---------89:12----------
that's true you gotta watch out for all


---------89:15----------
these biases man they're a lot


---------89:16----------
i'm biased so really simply what i would


---------89:19----------
say you should do is is really pay


---------89:21----------
attention to the way that you


---------89:23----------
feel when you're looking at data


---------89:25----------
especially at the end of streams


---------89:27----------
okay because i think your jealousy


---------89:29----------
drives your data collection


---------89:31----------
definitely and that is not good


---------89:34----------
collection


---------89:35----------
skewed skewing it okay


---------89:39----------
right and then if you skew data


---------89:40----------
collection driven by jealousy


---------89:43----------
what is it going to do to the feelings


---------89:45----------
of jealousy


---------89:47----------
amplify them and then what's going to


---------89:49----------
happen to the kind of data you collect


---------89:52----------
it's going to be bad and eventually will


---------89:55----------
spiral


---------89:56----------
small karma big fruit


---------90:00----------
10 more karmas more jealousy more data


---------90:03----------
skewing


---------90:04----------
more jealousy data skewing


---------90:08----------
got it and now we get to watch any of


---------90:10----------
our streams with


---------90:11----------
popular streamers and you'll see that


---------90:14----------
all of them have [ __ ] impostor


---------90:15----------
syndrome


---------90:16----------
yeah it's like why is that it's because


---------90:18----------
these mechanisms are happening in your


---------90:20----------
mind


---------90:23----------
any other undesirable traits you want to


---------90:25----------
talk about


---------90:27----------
um i mean that's probably the biggest


---------90:31----------
one is


---------90:32----------
just like the jealousy thing so


---------90:34----------
concretely for jealousy the two things


---------90:36----------
i'd say to you one is be careful about


---------90:38----------
the way that you reinforce it


---------90:39----------
right so we just talked about that


---------90:41----------
second is i would do whatever that mind


---------90:43----------
body prescription


---------90:44----------
book told you to do i would consider


---------90:47----------
doing that again but


---------90:48----------
focusing on jealousy if you want to come


---------90:50----------
back on stream we can dig into that


---------90:51----------
together


---------90:52----------
okay or you can kind of do it on your


---------90:55----------
own but i think that that jealousy is a


---------90:56----------
some squad i don't know how much how


---------90:58----------
many of our streams that you watch


---------91:00----------
but we've talked about um you can check


---------91:02----------
out our youtube channel on the vedic


---------91:04----------
psychology


---------91:05----------
or like the vedic model of the mind but


---------91:06----------
i think you have


---------91:08----------
do you have like a specific video on


---------91:10----------
that like i've heard you say subscribe


---------91:15----------
yep so let me see if i can find it


---------91:17----------
actually


---------91:18----------
let's see if any of our mods are around


---------91:25----------
i can do some digging afterwards okay


---------91:27----------
around actually actually what you should


---------91:29----------
do is go


---------91:30----------
to our wiki because i think there's a


---------91:32----------
link in information on our wiki


---------91:34----------
okay okay yeah here's the link


---------91:39----------
i'm going to post in a twitch chat okay


---------91:41----------
okay


---------91:43----------
um and then just look at some scar and


---------91:46----------
then yeah let's see if we can


---------91:48----------
yep yeah there's there's a link in there


---------91:51----------
so the wiki's had to do it


---------91:54----------
right sweet i'll check that out


---------91:58----------
um yeah so any other questions


---------92:04----------
uh how much time do you have uh about


---------92:07----------
10 15 minutes what's up i think the last


---------92:10----------
thing something i forgot to mention is


---------92:12----------
like going deeper with


---------92:14----------
meditation or like meditating on


---------92:17----------
those undesirable traits like obviously


---------92:19----------
outside of meditation is one thing but


---------92:21----------
am i able to like tackle the jealousy


---------92:22----------
like inside of meditation like


---------92:24----------
absolutely


---------92:26----------
yeah so you want to tackle jealousy yeah


---------92:32----------
what kind of meditation do you do for a


---------92:35----------
while i was doing zen and then


---------92:36----------
i saw you do third eye and that that was


---------92:39----------
like a really good


---------92:40----------
session for me and so i've started doing


---------92:41----------
that since so that's okay


---------92:43----------
all i've done third eye meditation is


---------92:45----------
very well suited for you


---------92:46----------
right so i would encourage you to do it


---------92:48----------
again i can teach you another third eye


---------92:50----------
practice today if you want


---------92:52----------
sure so i'm gonna combine two things


---------92:55----------
okay the first


---------92:56----------
is so i would feel the


---------93:00----------
the you can dissolve you can both


---------93:03----------
use meditation to dissolve and to


---------93:06----------
understand the jealousy


---------93:08----------
third eye is not going to be about


---------93:09----------
dissolving third eye is going to be


---------93:11----------
about understanding


---------93:12----------
okay so what i would do is put yourself


---------93:15----------
into a particular meditative state


---------93:17----------
that is cultivated by a third eye


---------93:19----------
practice and then


---------93:21----------
generally direct your intent i don't


---------93:23----------
know if that makes sense to you or not


---------93:24----------
but you know when you get into a


---------93:25----------
meditative state


---------93:26----------
you're kind of there but not there


---------93:31----------
okay and then just let the jealousy come


---------93:35----------
and from that state experience the


---------93:37----------
jealousy


---------93:39----------
i know it's kind of hard to describe but


---------93:40----------
it's like this is hard to you just have


---------93:42----------
to do it


---------93:42----------
and then you'll kind of get a sense of


---------93:44----------
it so if you've been doing you've been


---------93:46----------
doing this


---------93:46----------
charging the laser beam practice yeah


---------93:52----------
okay can you breathe in and out through


---------93:54----------
your nose


---------93:56----------
yes can you tell which of your nostrils


---------93:58----------
is more open than the other


---------94:05----------
i think my left nostril okay go ahead


---------94:08----------
and check with a finger


---------94:10----------
or you write


---------94:15----------
yeah okay so i want you to sit up


---------94:17----------
straight


---------94:24----------
okay so when you do the charging the


---------94:27----------
laser beam practice


---------94:28----------
what do you feel


---------94:32----------
like once i'm there where i'm kind of


---------94:34----------
feeling the sensation in my forehead


---------94:36----------
yeah what does the sensation feel like


---------94:39----------
it's like a tingling


---------94:42----------
pretty much just like a tingling in my


---------94:43----------
forehead feels like very exaggerated


---------94:47----------
feeling like almost a bump or something


---------94:49----------
like there's just


---------94:50----------
yeah a lot of okay so that's good


---------94:54----------
so you're awakening your third eye which


---------94:56----------
is great


---------94:58----------
brought it out there so now what i'm


---------95:00----------
going to teach you to do is just clean


---------95:01----------
out


---------95:02----------
that area so that it it'll facilitate


---------95:05----------
the growing okay okay


---------95:09----------
so it's not going to directly help but


---------95:11----------
it'll help you a little bit


---------95:12----------
and then as your third eye as you grow


---------95:15----------
in your third eye practice


---------95:16----------
you'll understand your jealousy it'll


---------95:19----------
sort it out


---------95:20----------
don't worry about it okay so i want you


---------95:22----------
to close your eyes


---------95:23----------
it's actually a pretty simple practice


---------95:26----------
and i want you to feel that


---------95:28----------
cool air in your open nostril


---------95:38----------
can you feel the coldness of the air hmm


---------95:42----------
yeah and where do you feel it


---------95:49----------
it's like right at the base of the


---------95:50----------
nostrils okay so eyes closed


---------95:53----------
and now i want you to focus sort of on


---------95:55----------
the middle of your nose


---------95:56----------
sort of the bridge of your nose and try


---------96:00----------
to feel the coldness there


---------96:14----------
can you feel it


---------96:18----------
and now i want you to follow that


---------96:20----------
coldness all the way up


---------96:22----------
to your third eye the center of your


---------96:24----------
forehead


---------96:26----------
can you feel the coolness there


---------96:33----------
yeah so what i want you to do is just


---------96:36----------
sort of imagine


---------96:38----------
that you're cleaning out that area


---------96:42----------
with that breath so that cool air


---------96:45----------
travels


---------96:46----------
up


---------96:51----------
and then out


---------97:03----------
and we'll do this for about 30 to 60


---------97:05----------
seconds


---------97:06----------
just follow each breath as it travels


---------97:10----------
up into your the middle of your forehead


---------97:45----------
if you get distracted just return to


---------97:47----------
that sensation of coolness in your


---------97:49----------
forehead


---------97:51----------
that fresh air kind of traveling in


---------97:54----------
cleaning it out


---------97:59----------
and now we're gonna go to uh our


---------98:02----------
charging the laser beam practice


---------98:05----------
so take your right hand your middle


---------98:07----------
finger


---------98:08----------
and hover it above the point


---------98:15----------
and just focus on the sensation you want


---------98:18----------
to be about


---------98:19----------
a quarter inch to half an inch away from


---------98:22----------
your skin


---------98:29----------
you can move closer and just focus on


---------98:31----------
the sensation of your forehead


---------98:44----------
we'll do this for about a minute or two


---------99:23----------
go ahead and let your hand rest and


---------99:26----------
continue focusing on the sensation


---------99:35----------
you feeling it yeah


---------99:39----------
now we're going to go to the third phase


---------99:41----------
of the practice


---------99:43----------
so what i want you to do is take your


---------99:45----------
eyes


---------99:46----------
and with your lids closed look towards


---------99:49----------
that point on your forehead where you


---------99:51----------
feel the sensation


---------99:53----------
so you're almost going to be looking up


---------99:54----------
and cross side


---------100:01----------
drive your attention towards your third


---------100:06----------
eye


---------100:10----------
you may feel a strain or a dizziness


---------100:15----------
so you need to relax your eyes


---------100:18----------
and then return again


---------100:23----------
don't hold it too long


---------100:27----------
drive your attention towards that point


---------100:29----------
with your vision


---------100:41----------
you can hold the gaze for about five to


---------100:44----------
ten seconds at a time and then relax


---------101:31----------
now let yourself relax


---------101:44----------
good


---------101:47----------
bask in the person that you are


---------101:56----------
and now notice how foreign


---------102:00----------
jealousy may feel


---------102:09----------
and if it arises for you let it arise


---------102:27----------
when you're ready go ahead and open your


---------102:29----------
eyes


---------102:39----------
hello hey man how you feeling


---------102:43----------
i feel very good what was it like when


---------102:47----------
you


---------102:47----------
were looking cross-eyed at


---------102:51----------
the third eye i'd never done that part


---------102:55----------
it felt it didn't really feel dizzying


---------102:57----------
it just felt like i was focusing extra


---------102:59----------
hard


---------103:00----------
and i found that that tranquil spot


---------103:03----------
just like pure joy


---------103:06----------
yes great fantastic


---------103:10----------
pure joy and connected is ultimately you


---------103:13----------
know you can't be doing it wrong if


---------103:14----------
that's how you feel


---------103:16----------
but um yeah so so focusing extra hard


---------103:19----------
is the point so another thing that you


---------103:20----------
guys should understand is you all should


---------103:22----------
not do that third part


---------103:24----------
unless you've been doing the other parts


---------103:25----------
first


---------103:27----------
so in your case uh it doesn't surprise


---------103:30----------
me


---------103:30----------
ryan that you've been doing third eye


---------103:31----------
meditation and now you can


---------103:33----------
you can push harder towards it


---------103:36----------
so should i be doing that that eye thing


---------103:39----------
like you do it in phases like first


---------103:41----------
get like the sensation and then start


---------103:43----------
looking up there yep


---------103:44----------
you can do it in that sequence so you


---------103:46----------
can do the should be practice first


---------103:48----------
which is breathing into it and then out


---------103:51----------
and then


---------103:52----------
using the charging of the laser beam and


---------103:54----------
then then


---------103:55----------
you can i mean the charging laser beam


---------103:57----------
you actually you may not even need to do


---------103:58----------
that anymore at all


---------104:00----------
yeah um and and then you can direct your


---------104:03----------
attention with your gaze


---------104:04----------
but that too you want to be careful you


---------104:06----------
don't want to strain your eyes or


---------104:07----------
anything like that


---------104:08----------
it's just i don't know how to describe


---------104:09----------
it but for me it feels like


---------104:12----------
you know i'm turning the hose on high


---------104:14----------
and then i turn it down to low


---------104:16----------
does that make sense uh not entirely


---------104:19----------
okay


---------104:20----------
i mean yeah don't worry about it


---------104:23----------
okay it's just different different


---------104:26----------
explanations for


---------104:27----------
i mean someone in chat came up with


---------104:28----------
charging the laser beam


---------104:30----------
which i think is actually a pretty good


---------104:31----------
description of what it feels like


---------104:33----------
that's how it feels yeah and so you know


---------104:36----------
different words for these strange


---------104:37----------
sensations that we don't know how to


---------104:38----------
describe


---------104:39----------
but overall


---------104:42----------
um thanks for coming on man thank you


---------104:45----------
for having me


---------104:46----------
yeah of course i've been following since


---------104:48----------
um i saw reckful's video first and


---------104:51----------
your videos have done a lot for me and


---------104:53----------
i'm sure you're helping a lot of people


---------104:54----------
so thank you very much for having me on


---------104:56----------
and you definitely helped me


---------104:58----------
cool good luck to you man and thank you


---------105:00----------
and you know i i i'm


---------105:02----------
hopeful about this next phase i think


---------105:05----------
you can handle it but i don't think it's


---------105:06----------
going to be easy it's going to be hard


---------105:08----------
in a subtle way


---------105:10----------
yeah that makes sense definitely yeah so


---------105:13----------
good luck to you dude


---------105:14----------
thank you and congrats on the world


---------105:16----------
