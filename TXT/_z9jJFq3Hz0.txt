---------00:00----------
so yesterday


---------00:02----------
there was a post on our subreddit


---------00:05----------
about how there's a misogyny problem in


---------00:07----------
our community


---------00:09----------
and so i really appreciate the


---------00:11----------
the post it was um the most upvoted post


---------00:14----------
for you know a while uh there's some


---------00:17----------
upvoted posts like if you look


---------00:18----------
historically the most upvoted posts are


---------00:20----------
memes


---------00:22----------
the most upvoted substantial post we've


---------00:24----------
ever had on our subreddit i think was


---------00:26----------
this post


---------00:28----------
and


---------00:29----------
in it people were sort of saying like


---------00:31----------
misogyny is a problem in the community


---------00:32----------
and dr k should use his platform to


---------00:34----------
address it


---------00:36----------
and then i got kind of confused because


---------00:38----------
i was like i don't know what that means


---------00:40----------
i don't know people i hear this a lot


---------00:43----------
like people toss around this phrase use


---------00:45----------
your platform to address the problem and


---------00:48----------
literally like i don't know what that


---------00:50----------
means like i don't know how to do that


---------00:53----------
do i just show up here and say misogyny


---------00:55----------
is bad y'all should stop doing it is


---------00:58----------
that what people are looking for


---------01:01----------
so i asked the question and thankfully i


---------01:03----------
got some awesome answers so i was like i


---------01:04----------
think they figured out what my username


---------01:07----------
is so i think they knew it was me


---------01:09----------
but i you know i don't identify myself


---------01:11----------
but i was just like what would that


---------01:13----------
practically look like like what what


---------01:14----------
would that mean


---------01:16----------
using the like i don't know how to do


---------01:18----------
that


---------01:18----------
and so i got some really awesome answers


---------01:20----------
and i really appreciate everyone who


---------01:22----------
posted i read the entire thread in


---------01:23----------
basically every comment


---------01:25----------
uh so the first thing that i'm gonna do


---------01:27----------
is share a little bit about


---------01:28----------
you know what we do and how we approach


---------01:31----------
misogyny and then


---------01:32----------
i'm gonna


---------01:34----------
change gears a little bit so the first


---------01:35----------
thing is that you know we try to address


---------01:38----------
misogyny


---------01:40----------
through


---------01:41----------
things like we have like you know women


---------01:42----------
in gaming streams and stuff like that


---------01:44----------
we interview a lot of female streamers


---------01:46----------
who will talk about their experiences


---------01:48----------
for example or just women in our


---------01:49----------
community who talk about their


---------01:51----------
experiences


---------01:53----------
so that's one way that we address it um


---------01:56----------
so i you know i thought we were doing


---------01:58----------
okay there


---------01:59----------
um the other thing is that i i tend to


---------02:02----------
not


---------02:04----------
sometimes address it directly because


---------02:08----------
i think that the real way to address


---------02:09----------
misogyny is by like addressing the human


---------02:11----------
being underneath and understanding where


---------02:13----------
it comes from and sort of helping people


---------02:15----------
so for example shunya meditations i


---------02:17----------
think are actually my way of addressing


---------02:18----------
misogyny because the more that you


---------02:21----------
practice shunya meditation the less


---------02:23----------
misogynistic or misandristic you will


---------02:25----------
become


---------02:27----------
so i think there's a lot of stuff that i


---------02:28----------
try to do


---------02:30----------
and there was also like another part of


---------02:32----------
me that was kind of confused because you


---------02:34----------
know i was sort of thinking like if this


---------02:35----------
is a misogynistic community like why is


---------02:38----------
this like one of the most upvoted posts


---------02:40----------
of all time


---------02:42----------
right so it's kind of interesting


---------02:43----------
because i was like looking at that and i


---------02:44----------
was like oh it's people are actually


---------02:46----------
responding really well and i was


---------02:47----------
imagining if someone had posted that in


---------02:49----------
the red pill subreddit for example like


---------02:51----------
that would get down voted into oblivion


---------02:55----------
and then i also kind of thought about it


---------02:56----------
a little bit more and i was like but


---------02:57----------
wait it's the most upvoted post so that


---------02:59----------
means that everyone does think it's a


---------03:00----------
problem so that was like kind of


---------03:01----------
confusing for me so i tend to first of


---------03:04----------
all address things somewhat indirectly


---------03:06----------
and the reason for that is um


---------03:10----------
i just think it's more effective


---------03:12----------
so this is where i get concerned about


---------03:14----------
things like virtue signaling so if i


---------03:16----------
show up on stream and i say misogyny is


---------03:17----------
bad


---------03:19----------
i think that the people who suffer from


---------03:21----------
being on the receiving end will really


---------03:22----------
appreciate that and they'll be like dr k


---------03:24----------
is using his platform to address


---------03:25----------
misogyny


---------03:26----------
but i don't know that the person who is


---------03:29----------
misogynistic will actually change so


---------03:32----------
this is where i kind of struggle a


---------03:34----------
little bit with like


---------03:36----------
is fixing misogyny validating the


---------03:38----------
victims of it or is it like trying to


---------03:40----------
change the minds of the perpetrators


---------03:43----------
and so that's sort of why we've done


---------03:44----------
what we've done we try to raise


---------03:46----------
awareness of it and things like that and


---------03:47----------
i'm directly addressing it now


---------03:50----------
so this is what i'm going to say to my


---------03:52----------
strategy


---------03:53----------
right and so this is like this is my


---------03:55----------
first thing to say to people who are not


---------03:57----------
just misogynist because i don't know if


---------03:59----------
you identify as a misogynist


---------04:02----------
so here i am


---------04:03----------
and i have a strategy right like i like


---------04:06----------
we have women in gaming like what's your


---------04:08----------
experience like we interview female


---------04:09----------
streamers and hey look at all this logic


---------04:11----------
that i'm using i'm saying it's the most


---------04:13----------
upvoted post


---------04:14----------
right our community is like they


---------04:16----------
appreciate this if it was truly a


---------04:18----------
misogynistic community they would


---------04:19----------
downvote into oblivion


---------04:21----------
so there's a lot of like beliefs that i


---------04:23----------
have about how to address the problem


---------04:25----------
there are a lot of things that i do to


---------04:27----------
try to address the problem


---------04:28----------
and despite all of my efforts and


---------04:31----------
despite all of my logic and despite all


---------04:33----------
of my idea that i think i'm doing a


---------04:35----------
decent job


---------04:37----------
someone out there is telling me that hey


---------04:39----------
this is a problem


---------04:41----------
so here's the first thing


---------04:42----------
if you think you're doing a good job at


---------04:44----------
something and someone tells you hey


---------04:47----------
this is a problem you should start by


---------04:49----------
listening


---------04:50----------
so this is kind of weird but like in my


---------04:53----------
experience


---------04:55----------
the more that you think you know about


---------04:56----------
something and the more


---------04:58----------
surprised you are by someone's opinion


---------05:02----------
you shouldn't double down on what you


---------05:04----------
believe you should actually listen to


---------05:06----------
that person even more


---------05:08----------
so if you saw that post and you thought


---------05:11----------
sort of like i did that like oh look at


---------05:13----------
how much this is getting upvoted it must


---------05:15----------
not be a problem


---------05:16----------
you have to understand that like the


---------05:17----------
more logic that you have to discount


---------05:20----------
their perspective the more


---------05:22----------
catastrophically incorrect you are


---------05:25----------
right because they're not stupid i mean


---------05:27----------
you can assume that other people around


---------05:28----------
you are stupid but despite every all of


---------05:31----------
the reasons why i think we're doing a


---------05:33----------
good job of addressing misogyny the fact


---------05:35----------
that there is a group of people who


---------05:37----------
strongly feel this way means that


---------05:39----------
there's a blind spot so if you have a


---------05:41----------
lot of logic about something and people


---------05:44----------
are saying things that are contrary to


---------05:46----------
that that is actually an indication that


---------05:48----------
there's a blind spot


---------05:50----------
so here's what i'm gonna do because


---------05:54----------
here's my way of trying to address the


---------05:55----------
blind spot okay so i don't know exactly


---------05:58----------
what to say or how to fix that i'm gonna


---------06:00----------
do my best right now and we'll see


---------06:03----------
whether it moves the needle in the right


---------06:05----------
direction or not


---------06:06----------
okay so the first thing that i want to


---------06:07----------
say is like i acknowledge that if people


---------06:10----------
think this is a problem


---------06:11----------
even though there are a lot of signs


---------06:13----------
that we're moving in the right direction


---------06:14----------
if you think it's a problem i'm just


---------06:16----------
going to accept that at face value and


---------06:18----------
if you all think it's a problem okay so


---------06:20----------
then the question becomes okay what are


---------06:21----------
we gonna do about it


---------06:23----------
so i'm just gonna share with y'all what


---------06:25----------
i have learned about the experience of


---------06:28----------
women


---------06:29----------
so understand that this has a couple of


---------06:31----------
caveats the first is that i'm not a


---------06:32----------
woman so i'm not ever going to truly


---------06:35----------
understand what it's like to be a woman


---------06:39----------
thankfully i've had a lot of experiences


---------06:41----------
so i have a profession in which it is my


---------06:44----------
job to try to understand people's


---------06:46----------
experiences that are different from what


---------06:47----------
i've


---------06:48----------
what my own


---------06:50----------
and so i'm going to share that with you


---------06:52----------
just so that i hope that


---------06:54----------
men out there


---------06:56----------
will like


---------06:57----------
hopefully understand like a little bit


---------06:59----------
of what i've learned


---------07:01----------
it's not my place to say that this is


---------07:03----------
right or wrong it's not my place to say


---------07:05----------
that you know that's i can't judge that


---------07:07----------
i'm just going to share what i've


---------07:08----------
learned


---------07:09----------
so


---------07:11----------
basically


---------07:14----------
before you're born


---------07:16----------
presuming you're not like a test tube


---------07:17----------
baby or something like that


---------07:19----------
your dad


---------07:20----------
has


---------07:22----------
testes and in these testes they produce


---------07:25----------
sperm


---------07:26----------
and sperm


---------07:27----------
are have either an x chromosome


---------07:30----------
or a y chromosome and then that sperm


---------07:32----------
travels to the egg which has an x


---------07:35----------
chromosome and then depending on whether


---------07:38----------
it gets fertilized by an x chromosome or


---------07:40----------
y chromosome you're [ __ ] in life


---------07:43----------
so if you get fertilized by the y


---------07:45----------
chromosome you start to play life i know


---------07:48----------
it sounds kind of weird and this is


---------07:49----------
going to be controversial we'll get to


---------07:50----------
this in a second


---------07:51----------
you start to play life on easy mode


---------07:54----------
and if you get fertilized with an x


---------07:55----------
chromosome you start to


---------07:57----------
uh get you start to life on hard mode


---------08:00----------
like it happens then like in the embryo


---------08:02----------
and then there's gonna be a lot of


---------08:03----------
people we're gonna get to this in a


---------08:04----------
second but what about all the


---------08:05----------
difficulties that men face so we'll talk


---------08:07----------
about that in a second and men do face a


---------08:09----------
lot of difficulties i think we've done a


---------08:10----------
good job of addressing those and


---------08:11----------
validating those we'll talk about that a


---------08:12----------
little bit more so if you reject that


---------08:14----------
statement that's totally fine just


---------08:16----------
listen till the end okay so you may


---------08:19----------
wonder like what do you mean dr k like


---------08:22----------
men commit suicide women commit suicide


---------08:24----------
like men struggle women's struggle like


---------08:26----------
how are like how are you able to say


---------08:27----------
that and this is where i'd say like go


---------08:29----------
back to the first thing that i said is


---------08:31----------
if people are telling you this even if


---------08:33----------
it goes against your experience maybe


---------08:35----------
that's a sign of a blind spot so here's


---------08:37----------
what i've learned so the first thing


---------08:40----------
people talk about circumcision now


---------08:41----------
circumcision is a problem right so like


---------08:43----------
sure circumcision is a problem but there


---------08:45----------
are literally parts of the world where


---------08:46----------
when women are born they will cut off


---------08:48----------
their clitoris


---------08:49----------
like this happens


---------08:51----------
right female genital mutilation like


---------08:52----------
circumcision sure i'm not saying that


---------08:54----------
circumcision isn't a problem as well but


---------08:56----------
they're like literally parts in the


---------08:57----------
world just think about that for a second


---------09:00----------
so like if you want to understand why


---------09:02----------
being a woman is on like being born a


---------09:04----------
woman is on hard mode it's like there's


---------09:06----------
maybe like a 10 chance that they're just


---------09:08----------
gonna lop off the end of your deck when


---------09:10----------
you're born


---------09:11----------
that is why it's hard mode this happens


---------09:15----------
right so there are lots of developing


---------09:16----------
countries where like you don't get to go


---------09:18----------
to school


---------09:19----------
you're told to wear particular things


---------09:21----------
you're forced into marrying particular


---------09:23----------
people you may be abused you may be


---------09:26----------
gang-raped like there are all kinds of


---------09:27----------
things that happen primarily like to


---------09:30----------
women right so this is a bad experience


---------09:32----------
to have


---------09:34----------
and people will say like okay that's


---------09:35----------
developing countries like what about the


---------09:37----------
women here


---------09:38----------
and so that's where i also say like it's


---------09:40----------
hard mode for them like that's been my


---------09:42----------
experience being married to a woman like


---------09:44----------
i think things are like harder for my


---------09:45----------
wife than they are for me and this is


---------09:47----------
where once again a lot of y'all may be


---------09:49----------
like uh simp cuck whatever


---------09:51----------
but just think about this for a second


---------09:52----------
okay


---------09:53----------
so here's what i think is hard being


---------09:55----------
like a modern woman which is that the


---------09:56----------
default responsibility is yours


---------09:59----------
and if you know what that means you know


---------10:01----------
what that means and if you don't know


---------10:02----------
what that means like that shows you the


---------10:04----------
problem


---------10:06----------
so what do i mean by that so it's like


---------10:09----------
if a dude so if i'm married for example


---------10:12----------
and i play dota for like four hours a


---------10:15----------
day at night


---------10:16----------
stuff still gets done


---------10:18----------
my kids will be put to get bed my kids


---------10:20----------
will be fed


---------10:22----------
they'll wake up the next day they'll


---------10:24----------
have clean clothes like stuff just gets


---------10:26----------
done


---------10:29----------
but the reason it gets done is because


---------10:31----------
it's the default responsibility of women


---------10:34----------
to take care of all that crap who does


---------10:36----------
pta meetings


---------10:38----------
right who who makes pediatrician


---------10:39----------
appointments and so as a man like i help


---------10:42----------
out around the house right so we say


---------10:44----------
help out which also like one person is


---------10:47----------
doing the helping and one person holds


---------10:49----------
the default responsibility you guys get


---------10:50----------
that it's even in the language that we


---------10:52----------
do


---------10:53----------
like we use like shows the dynamic


---------10:56----------
so i think the hardest thing one of the


---------10:57----------
hardest things about being a woman is


---------10:59----------
that the default responsibility falls to


---------11:01----------
you


---------11:01----------
now i i'm not saying that men out there


---------11:03----------
don't accept responsibility there are


---------11:05----------
default responsibilities that men have


---------11:06----------
as well so for example if there's a


---------11:08----------
clogged toilet like i take care of that


---------11:10----------
right the default like i just think in


---------11:12----------
my mind if there's a clogged toilet like


---------11:13----------
i have to take care of it


---------11:16----------
so there's a lot of default


---------11:17----------
responsibility that falls onto women


---------11:20----------
um


---------11:22----------
so like here's kind of another example


---------11:24----------
of


---------11:24----------
so i saw this post recently


---------11:27----------
we're gonna just you know i don't want


---------11:28----------
to get too much into it but


---------11:31----------
because i


---------11:34----------
so my husband is the moderator for a few


---------11:35----------
different subreddits and he genuinely


---------11:37----------
thinks it's his job


---------11:38----------
my husband refuses to look for a job


---------11:40----------
even though i think it would be good for


---------11:42----------
him


---------11:43----------
and we could use the additional income


---------11:44----------
but he says he's got too much on his


---------11:45----------
plate already


---------11:47----------
that being monitoring monitoring these


---------11:49----------
stupid subreddits every time i bring it


---------11:50----------
up he claims what he's doing is unpaid


---------11:52----------
lamers labor similar to that of a


---------11:54----------
homemaker but he doesn't cook or clean


---------11:55----------
or do any of that the way he used to he


---------11:57----------
just monitors his stupid subreddits i


---------11:59----------
don't know what to do sometimes i want


---------12:00----------
to leave him because i believe i may not


---------12:02----------
be able to reach him


---------12:04----------
so this is where


---------12:06----------
a lot of people will react


---------12:08----------
right and so what reactions are people


---------12:10----------
gonna have they're gonna be like that's


---------12:12----------
a bad


---------12:13----------
characterization of a man that not all


---------12:16----------
men are like this


---------12:17----------
that women do this too


---------12:19----------
i'm married or i my girlfriend sits


---------12:21----------
around and doesn't do anything all day


---------12:23----------
as well


---------12:24----------
so i want you guys to notice if your


---------12:26----------
mind had that reaction i want you to


---------12:29----------
notice what just happened


---------12:31----------
someone shared with you an experience


---------12:33----------
and the first thing that your mind did


---------12:35----------
is reject it and provide logic this is


---------12:38----------
the problem


---------12:40----------
right so if you guys want to understand


---------12:41----------
why misogyny exists this is the problem


---------12:44----------
it is because when someone speaks


---------12:46----------
your default mode is to reject them


---------12:49----------
this is the reasons you're wrong this


---------12:51----------
paints a bad light to men and all of


---------12:54----------
those things are logical i'm not saying


---------12:56----------
that it it paints men as deadbeats it


---------12:59----------
does that the question is is it [ __ ]


---------13:02----------
true


---------13:03----------
are these the experiences that this


---------13:05----------
group of people has experienced like is


---------13:07----------
this what they live through


---------13:09----------
is it a solo experience or a shared


---------13:11----------
experience why do you all think that had


---------13:13----------
78 000 upvotes


---------13:15----------
it's because that's a shared experience


---------13:18----------
so i'm not saying that any of the


---------13:20----------
criticisms or responses to that post are


---------13:24----------
invalid i think their chances are


---------13:26----------
they're all valid


---------13:28----------
and at the same time if your mind


---------13:29----------
defaults to rejecting someone else's


---------13:32----------
opinion just because you have some piece


---------13:34----------
of information that doesn't line up with


---------13:36----------
their experience that's the problem


---------13:38----------
that's the blind spot so start by


---------13:40----------
listening


---------13:42----------
the last thing that i want to do is


---------13:44----------
share with y'all a little bit of what


---------13:45----------
i've understood


---------13:46----------
about what being a woman is like okay


---------13:50----------
so generally speaking life can suck


---------13:52----------
right


---------13:53----------
we just talked about you know trauma and


---------13:55----------
school shootings and coping and stuff


---------13:56----------
like that so like what do we especially


---------13:58----------
on twitch and as gamers and things like


---------14:00----------
that what do we do when life sucks


---------14:02----------
we go play video games


---------14:04----------
here's the here's the worst thing is


---------14:06----------
like


---------14:08----------
women don't get to do that


---------14:11----------
freely


---------14:12----------
right so when you show up in a game and


---------14:14----------
you use voice chat


---------14:17----------
people either start hitting on you or


---------14:21----------
they


---------14:22----------
troll you or start insulting you


---------14:25----------
or tell you to go back into the kitchen


---------14:26----------
it's like the things that you should be


---------14:28----------
doing


---------14:29----------
to have fun suddenly have these random


---------14:32----------
people in it that are ruining your


---------14:33----------
experience


---------14:34----------
there's no escape so i saw a post like


---------14:37----------
just the other day about


---------14:39----------
some woman like ordered doordash and so


---------14:42----------
the dude knows her address shows up and


---------14:44----------
starts hitting on her when he's like


---------14:45----------
delivering food like what the [ __ ]


---------14:47----------
like


---------14:48----------
how is that fair like have you guys ever


---------14:50----------
been hit on by someone who's delivering


---------14:52----------
food it's not something that i even


---------14:54----------
think about


---------14:55----------
like when i get food deliveries i don't


---------14:57----------
worry about this person like


---------14:58----------
you know i don't have to worry about


---------15:00----------
feeling self-conscious


---------15:03----------
whether you go to the gym whether you


---------15:05----------
like go to like a coffee shop like


---------15:07----------
whether you play a video game


---------15:09----------
it's like there are gonna be people out


---------15:10----------
there that's like the vagina apocalypse


---------15:13----------
where it's like all these zombies out


---------15:15----------
there that are like vagina vagina vagina


---------15:19----------
and you just can't go anywhere without


---------15:21----------
like this [ __ ] happening to you and if


---------15:23----------
you want to understand what this is like


---------15:24----------
as a man this is what i'd say imagine


---------15:26----------
your mom was everywhere that every


---------15:29----------
person you ran into was your mom every


---------15:31----------
time you join a video game or you're in


---------15:33----------
a voice chat lobby your mom is there and


---------15:36----------
she's like have you taken out the


---------15:37----------
laundry


---------15:38----------
did you do your homework imagine that no


---------15:40----------
matter where you go


---------15:42----------
your mom is there you go to the coffee


---------15:43----------
shop you pick up a coffee your mom's


---------15:45----------
behind the counter and she's like hey


---------15:47----------
did you do the laundry


---------15:48----------
did you do your homework


---------15:50----------
and then you're like ah i hate this


---------15:52----------
you're walking down the street you


---------15:53----------
decide to go work out


---------15:55----------
your mom walks up to you and she's like


---------15:56----------
hey did you do the laundry


---------15:58----------
did you do your homework and you're like


---------16:00----------
[ __ ] hey leave me alone then you go


---------16:02----------
home and you're like i'm gonna play


---------16:03----------
games with my friends your mom hops into


---------16:05----------
discord and she's like hey


---------16:07----------
did you do your laundry did you do your


---------16:09----------
homework


---------16:10----------
there's no escape


---------16:11----------
wherever you go you log on to twitch


---------16:14----------
chat


---------16:15----------
and someone else like says something and


---------16:16----------
then your mom shows up in twitch chat


---------16:18----------
and she's like low noob did you do your


---------16:20----------
laundry did you do your homework


---------16:23----------
there's no escape


---------16:24----------
it sucks


---------16:27----------
i don't know like what to say besides


---------16:29----------
that


---------16:31----------
it's like everywhere you go like you're


---------16:32----------
getting aggroed by your mom


---------16:35----------
that's the closest analogy like is i've


---------16:37----------
tried to understand this because this


---------16:38----------
just hasn't happened to me


---------16:41----------
the closest analogy i can think of is it


---------16:42----------
sounds like these people are being


---------16:44----------
hounded by their moms like that's that's


---------16:46----------
what it feels like wherever you go it's


---------16:48----------
the same [ __ ] it's just zombies wanting


---------16:50----------
vagina like that's all they want it's


---------16:52----------
like you know that's just


---------16:53----------
and you can't escape it now to be clear


---------16:55----------
i don't want to say that the majority of


---------16:57----------
people are like this because there's


---------16:58----------
some interesting statistical stuff going


---------17:00----------
on here so for example like when when


---------17:02----------
women say all men are [ __ ] i don't


---------17:03----------
think all men are [ __ ] i don't think


---------17:04----------
the majority of men are [ __ ] i think


---------17:06----------
what happens is if you're a dude who's


---------17:08----------
an [ __ ]


---------17:09----------
you move around a lot more right so like


---------17:11----------
if you have like like let's say you have


---------17:13----------
10 women


---------17:15----------
and five dudes


---------17:16----------
like if four of the dudes are decent the


---------17:19----------
sh the [ __ ] is gonna move from


---------17:21----------
relationship to relationship


---------17:22----------
and then like eventually you're gonna


---------17:24----------
have like


---------17:25----------
you know all 10 women have dated an


---------17:27----------
[ __ ] and they ended up with like one


---------17:28----------
decent human being but like the sample


---------17:30----------
size is highly skewed by the fact that


---------17:32----------
[ __ ] move around


---------17:34----------
so it's not that the majority of men are


---------17:35----------
like this


---------17:36----------
it's just that like you know what


---------17:38----------
happens is some guy who shows up on the


---------17:40----------
discord server in his misogynistic there


---------17:42----------
and is an [ __ ] gets banned from


---------17:44----------
discord and then he shows up somewhere


---------17:45----------
else and he gets banned from the next


---------17:47----------
one he shows up somewhere else he gets


---------17:48----------
banned from the next one gets banned


---------17:50----------
from this chat gets banned from this


---------17:51----------
video game and so like the people who


---------17:53----------
are like you know getting banned are the


---------17:55----------
ones that are moving around and exposing


---------17:57----------
themselves to more people so i think


---------18:00----------
it's unfair for women to sort of assume


---------18:02----------
that most men or all men are like this


---------18:05----------
and at the same time i think like as a


---------18:07----------
dude you've got to be super careful


---------18:09----------
because you don't understand really what


---------18:11----------
their experience is like


---------18:13----------
and like the next time that you are in a


---------18:16----------
lobby


---------18:17----------
with a woman


---------18:19----------
like


---------18:20----------
and someone is mean to them just like


---------18:22----------
just tell


---------18:23----------
your mom to go [ __ ] off


---------18:26----------
right and then that person is going to


---------18:27----------
get mad at you too they're going to call


---------18:28----------
you a simp they're like oh soup it's


---------18:31----------
like no bro like i'm not a sim like you


---------18:32----------
can call me a simp if you want to it's


---------18:34----------
called being a decent human being maybe


---------18:35----------
that's being a simp okay fine whatever


---------18:37----------
and here's the next thing if you are


---------18:39----------
like nice to a woman online


---------18:41----------
don't friend them afterward just go on


---------18:44----------
your [ __ ] day


---------18:45----------
just


---------18:46----------
be nice to them stand up for them call


---------18:49----------
out [ __ ] where you see it and then don't


---------18:50----------
try to form a relationship


---------18:52----------
they don't owe you [ __ ] just that's the


---------18:54----------
end of it the best thing you can do is


---------18:56----------
just move on with your day there's just


---------18:57----------
another human being


---------18:59----------
you don't need to form anything you


---------19:01----------
don't need to emotionally support them


---------19:03----------
you don't need to like help them feel


---------19:05----------
validated you just need to be a decent


---------19:06----------
human being move on with your day


---------19:09----------
do you guys get that


---------19:11----------
because this is what happens like


---------19:12----------
there's the people the the dharma chats


---------19:14----------
right like i'mma make the world a better


---------19:16----------
place let me friend this person


---------19:18----------
and help them with all of the things


---------19:20----------
that they need help with


---------19:21----------
i shall force them i shall much like the


---------19:24----------
therapists who are pro post-traumatic


---------19:26----------
i'm gonna fix it and in doing so you


---------19:28----------
just make it worse


---------19:30----------
so being a decent human being does not


---------19:32----------
mean you need to form a relationship


---------19:34----------
it's like you know the next time you if


---------19:36----------
someone


---------19:37----------
drops their books


---------19:39----------
in your class


---------19:41----------
you just help them and you


---------19:42----------
go on with your day you don't expect


---------19:44----------
anything in return


---------19:47----------
that's it


---------19:50----------
right so just to kind of summarize about


---------19:52----------
misogyny so we address it a little bit


---------19:54----------
differently like i'm not a huge fan of


---------19:56----------
virtue signal signaling


---------19:58----------
like i just don't think it's effective


---------20:00----------
so i think a good example of this i


---------20:01----------
don't think people i remember having a


---------20:02----------
conversation about when trump won the


---------20:04----------
election in 2016.


---------20:06----------
and people being really shocked that by


---------20:08----------
this by the [ __ ] comment right i don't


---------20:10----------
can that get me banned if i say that


---------20:12----------
okay i won't say it again


---------20:15----------
but so you know our president i'm just


---------20:18----------
quoting the actual former president of


---------20:20----------
the united states here you know made a


---------20:21----------
comment about grabbing women by a


---------20:23----------
particular body part


---------20:24----------
and i think that like a lot of people


---------20:26----------
called him out on that but i think what


---------20:27----------
people don't understand is that he won


---------20:29----------
more votes than he lost


---------20:31----------
but but with that comment that attacking


---------20:34----------
that comment and the people who


---------20:35----------
resonated with that comment did not


---------20:37----------
change their mind it actually had the


---------20:38----------
opposite effect


---------20:40----------
so they're


---------20:41----------
i'm not saying i'm right here but this


---------20:43----------
is my justification or my reasoning


---------20:46----------
why i try like to not just attack


---------20:48----------
misogyny which there are a lot of people


---------20:50----------
out there attacking my sergeant i have


---------20:51----------
no problem with that like by all means


---------20:52----------
you all do your thing i'm gonna do my


---------20:54----------
thing


---------20:56----------
and at the same time like i think that


---------20:57----------
if you you know just to kind of


---------20:59----------
summarize like if someone is saying


---------21:01----------
something to you that does not fit that


---------21:03----------
you think is logically incorrect


---------21:05----------
understand that like your logic is not


---------21:07----------
better than theirs i mean it may be but


---------21:09----------
that doesn't you it could be a blind


---------21:11----------
spot right like you are not and it's


---------21:13----------
shocking you're not the arbiter of truth


---------21:18----------
so maybe try listening to other people


---------21:19----------
and like listen to what they say


---------21:22----------
and like pro tip like if you see


---------21:24----------
toxicity like maybe do something about


---------21:25----------
it


---------21:26----------
pro tip be aware of your own emotions


---------21:29----------
and recognize like what are you looking


---------21:30----------
for from this relationship


---------21:32----------
and what is like this person's


---------21:34----------
experience just be like a normal person


---------21:36----------
and just get on with your day


---------21:38----------
if they want to play a game like you


---------21:39----------
play a game that's totally fine you


---------21:40----------
don't have to like talk to them


---------21:41----------
afterward just


---------21:43----------
go about your business and let them go


---------21:45----------
about theirs


---------21:46----------
and if you want to understand why like


---------21:48----------
you know being a woman is living life on


---------21:49----------
hard mode


---------21:51----------
you know it starts with things like


---------21:52----------
genital mutilation


---------21:54----------
moves on to things like laundry and


---------21:56----------
things like this post


---------21:58----------
and then ends up with like even the


---------22:00----------
spaces that we as men use to chill and


---------22:03----------
relax


---------22:04----------
and


---------22:05----------
degeneracy like they don't get to do


---------22:08----------
like that sucks dude it's like being


---------22:10----------
hounded by your mom all the time


---------22:12----------
wherever you go same [ __ ] story


---------22:14----------
it's


---------22:15----------
i don't know how these people are still


---------22:17----------
saying on any level it's insane


---------22:32----------
you
