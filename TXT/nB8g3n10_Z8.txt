---------00:00----------
and this is why i'm digging into this


---------00:01----------
scara because i think that like


---------00:05----------
i know this sounds weird i think you are


---------00:07----------
attractive enough for them


---------00:10----------
and i think the real sad thing is that


---------00:13----------
it is your belief that you're not


---------00:15----------
attractive enough for them


---------00:17----------
that is actually like becoming the


---------00:19----------
self-fulfilling prophecy


---------00:21----------
of like the current romantic


---------00:24----------
state that you're in


---------00:28----------
hello scarab hello hello okay you seem


---------00:31----------
fine to me bro


---------00:33----------
so testing one two three still am i


---------00:36----------
delayed


---------00:37----------
fixed okay so little story chat


---------00:42----------
a long time ago when dr k was a tiny


---------00:45----------
little


---------00:47----------
new streamer i one day experienced lag


---------00:50----------
on stream and i talked to this


---------00:53----------
this person named felix felix xqc


---------00:57----------
we were lagging on stream and then felix


---------01:00----------
was like you know what


---------01:01----------
you know what i do to not lag on stream


---------01:03----------
i have two internets that run to my


---------01:05----------
house


---------01:06----------
and i was like that's crazy you have two


---------01:08----------
internet connections and he's like yeah


---------01:10----------
so we decided to get a second internet


---------01:12----------
connection and we just swapped them


---------01:16----------
so hopefully that's fixed anyway i think


---------01:19----------
um thanks for being patient scar i


---------01:21----------
really appreciate it man


---------01:22----------
it's no problem like i have literally


---------01:25----------
like all day


---------01:26----------
i've been looking forward to this talk


---------01:27----------
for a while oh really what what have you


---------01:30----------
been


---------01:30----------
looking forward to i think it's that


---------01:33----------
i hear a lot of people speak highly of


---------01:36----------
you


---------01:36----------
i watch stuff that you do and i think


---------01:38----------
that you're kind


---------01:40----------
of a very interesting person especially


---------01:42----------
in this


---------01:43----------
in this space and so uh


---------01:46----------
i think it's something that it's like a


---------01:48----------
very unique


---------01:50----------
you know i guess moment for me to be


---------01:53----------
able to


---------01:54----------
talk to you sure well i i hope you get


---------01:57----------
something out of it man


---------01:59----------
oh i'm sure i will um is there something


---------02:03----------
in particular that you were thinking


---------02:04----------
about talking about


---------02:06----------
um well i have a bunch of things i think


---------02:09----------
sure


---------02:09----------
there's a lot of things that are easy


---------02:11----------
and some things that could be like a


---------02:13----------
little bit harder


---------02:14----------
but the easiest things might be like the


---------02:15----------
problems you have generally streaming


---------02:17----------
for such a long period of time


---------02:19----------
uh stuff about like um you know


---------02:22----------
self-fulfillment uh about like creative


---------02:26----------
and uh like i guess finding a creative


---------02:29----------
outlet


---------02:30----------
uh especially if your job or your


---------02:32----------
doesn't provide that


---------02:34----------
yeah um i have i and on that same note


---------02:37----------
like maybe the idea of happiness


---------02:39----------
and satisfaction both as a long and


---------02:41----------
short term


---------02:42----------
uh also uh maybe some stuff to deal with


---------02:46----------
either


---------02:46----------
with uh the fear of failure okay and


---------02:50----------
uh how and this is something that's


---------02:53----------
maybe the overall thing is like i


---------02:57----------
i saw you had to talk with h june and


---------03:00----------
you guys talked about


---------03:01----------
uh low empathy and um


---------03:04----------
a lot of times i feel like uh


---------03:08----------
that's common for me as well


---------03:11----------
where but rather than focusing on the


---------03:13----------
lower empathy part which is something


---------03:14----------
that i feel like


---------03:16----------
is is okay and i feel more


---------03:19----------
like talking more on the sides of like


---------03:21----------
being highly logical


---------03:23----------
and how that's like kind of a detriment


---------03:25----------
toward


---------03:27----------
maybe pushing yourself for your goals


---------03:31----------
oh that sounds really interesting to me


---------03:35----------
so uh yeah any of those that you're


---------03:38----------
interested in like


---------03:39----------
i am kind of able to talk on any of


---------03:41----------
those topics


---------03:42----------
yeah so that's that's really great um


---------03:44----------
scar


---------03:45----------
and i'm you know i know i know you had


---------03:47----------
nightmares about


---------03:48----------
being late and and maybe not sure what


---------03:50----------
you wanted to talk about but i i think


---------03:52----------
that that's like so


---------03:53----------
let me just repeat back what i heard so


---------03:55----------
like i think a lot of this comes with


---------03:56----------
what i would call kind of stream or


---------03:58----------
burnout


---------03:59----------
this unfortunately or fortunately


---------04:01----------
depending on how on you


---------04:02----------
how you look at it i think is something


---------04:04----------
that we've had to become experts in


---------04:06----------
with our um you know supporting content


---------04:09----------
creators on twitch like which we like


---------04:11----------
now do as an organization


---------04:12----------
but you know there's a lot of stuff we


---------04:14----------
can certainly i think i've learned a ton


---------04:17----------
um about you know this like kind of like


---------04:20----------
tension between


---------04:21----------
doing what works and following the


---------04:23----------
metrics


---------04:24----------
and like giving you know the internet


---------04:27----------
what it wants


---------04:28----------
versus doing work that you find like


---------04:30----------
creatively fulfilling but is risky


---------04:33----------
uh okay so on that end i feel like i've


---------04:36----------
already


---------04:37----------
fully accepted that i don't give a [ __ ]


---------04:39----------
about doing


---------04:40----------
what the internet wants um


---------04:43----------
as long as i understand i'm doing it


---------04:45----------
that way yep


---------04:47----------
that's really good so that's my sense


---------04:49----------
yeah it makes a lot of sense i think the


---------04:50----------
key thing there is that your


---------04:51----------
understanding of why you're doing what


---------04:53----------
you're doing


---------04:55----------
so so this is this is where like i think


---------04:57----------
a lot about making bad decisions with


---------04:59----------
eyes wide open


---------05:00----------
which sometimes when i talk to my yeah


---------05:04----------
so on that subject is that always a good


---------05:07----------
thing


---------05:07----------
so for instance if i know something is


---------05:10----------
absolutely bad for me


---------05:12----------
and bad for my brand and bad for my


---------05:14----------
stream but i still do it anyways


---------05:17----------
does that make is that a problem even if


---------05:20----------
you're i if you understand


---------05:21----------
your eyes wide open about it you


---------05:23----------
acknowledge that you're doing the


---------05:25----------
problem


---------05:26----------
but you still keep doing it is that any


---------05:28----------
better than


---------05:29----------
full ignorance what is better


---------05:35----------
what do you mean by better well like


---------05:37----------
like


---------05:39----------
is it just like a coping mechanism i


---------05:41----------
should i should say like am i just


---------05:43----------
rationalizing myself by because i can


---------05:46----------
logic my way


---------05:47----------
it out of like any situation like i'm


---------05:50----------
just rationalizing that like it's okay


---------05:52----------
to be bad at to not do what's correct


---------05:56----------
or not do what's good for my specific


---------06:00----------
situation


---------06:01----------
because i don't feel like it


---------06:05----------
okay so i i think we're going to talk


---------06:07----------
about logic


---------06:08----------
versus emotions and what drives your


---------06:11----------
actions


---------06:12----------
and rationalization and i think it's all


---------06:14----------
good it'll scar it all winds up in the


---------06:16----------
same place


---------06:17----------
because even if we talk about like


---------06:19----------
creative fulfillment like even your


---------06:20----------
question


---------06:22----------
is one of logic right you're like okay


---------06:25----------
let's think about it logically like even


---------06:27----------
if i know


---------06:29----------
that something is like if i say screw


---------06:31----------
what the internet wants and i'm going to


---------06:33----------
make what i want to do like that's a


---------06:34----------
logical question is that okay


---------06:37----------
right it's sort of like a philosophical


---------06:38----------
and logical question which i think


---------06:40----------
goes back to your your point about low


---------06:42----------
empathy versus becoming reliant on logic


---------06:45----------
because i don't think i mean just some


---------06:48----------
of the stuff i you know i've talked to


---------06:49----------
some people who i think


---------06:50----------
know you and i don't based on what they


---------06:53----------
say i don't think you have low empathy


---------06:54----------
at all i think you


---------06:56----------
you actually at least in terms of the


---------06:58----------
way that they speak about you now i


---------06:59----------
wonder if it's cognitive empathy and i'd


---------07:02----------
be really curious about what that


---------07:03----------
reaction was that you just had


---------07:05----------
i i think it's because


---------07:10----------
they don't talk to me a lot


---------07:14----------
okay i think when they interact with me


---------07:18----------
the me i put out in that scenario is


---------07:21----------
like


---------07:22----------
fully on all the time


---------07:25----------
in in the sense that i try to


---------07:28----------
always be very very like


---------07:31----------
scarra if they talk to you or what would


---------07:34----------
they discover


---------07:36----------
i feel like um there's just a lot of uh


---------07:39----------
or there's a there's some moments where


---------07:42----------
i feel like


---------07:43----------
uh i guess


---------07:48----------
um i guess it wouldn't align with with


---------07:52----------
what they think i sure like


---------07:56----------
because whenever i interact with people


---------07:58----------
especially with my friends i tend to


---------08:00----------
value their time


---------08:02----------
and the conversation very highly and


---------08:04----------
although i will make


---------08:05----------
mistakes here and there like recently


---------08:07----------
i've made one


---------08:09----------
there will be situations where like i


---------08:11----------
tend to like try to think ahead of time


---------08:13----------
and try to make it so that like when


---------08:15----------
they do meet me or interact with me like


---------08:18----------
they always


---------08:19----------
take away with that was a good moment


---------08:22----------
you know


---------08:22----------
because that's like what i try to do


---------08:23----------
with my friends i feel like that's just


---------08:25----------
really normal with everyone right


---------08:26----------
[Music]


---------08:28----------
but um for me to like a larger extent


---------08:30----------
it's like well


---------08:31----------
i value those moments quite highly


---------08:33----------
because those are the things i look


---------08:34----------
forward to


---------08:35----------
a lot of times when you're in the


---------08:37----------
streaming thing it's very routine


---------08:39----------
especially during covet right you're not


---------08:40----------
going out uh like i i'm not seeing


---------08:43----------
anyone


---------08:44----------
i'm not really like you know actively


---------08:46----------
looking and so a lot of my day by day is


---------08:48----------
actively with my friends especially with


---------08:50----------
these kind of bubble that i'm


---------08:52----------
in and that i've created or somewhat


---------08:54----------
been a part of with otb


---------08:56----------
that like realistically i never need to


---------08:58----------
collab with anyone outside of otb


---------09:01----------
um just on a sustainable level like i it


---------09:03----------
never needs to happen


---------09:04----------
because the group is so large at this


---------09:06----------
point that only collaborating within my


---------09:08----------
bubble


---------09:09----------
is enough to to like solidify my brand


---------09:12----------
my future


---------09:13----------
as well as like kara put myself and keep


---------09:15----------
myself like near the top


---------09:17----------
right not at the very very top right


---------09:20----------
because i think at


---------09:21----------
that level you'd have to lug with wick


---------09:23----------
it up right and go to like alternatives


---------09:24----------
where you go toward


---------09:26----------
uh like collaborating with a bunch of


---------09:28----------
different people yeah what's up


---------09:31----------
we're going to stop you there for a


---------09:33----------
second sorry to interrupt


---------09:36----------
you slipped away from me so you said


---------09:39----------
that you know


---------09:41----------
i i mentioned that i've talked to some


---------09:42----------
people who have who have found you to be


---------09:44----------
very


---------09:45----------
empathic and supportive you mentioned


---------09:47----------
that those are moments that you really


---------09:49----------
look forward to in value


---------09:51----------
and then you also said that like the


---------09:53----------
reason they think that way about me is


---------09:55----------
because they don't spend enough time


---------09:56----------
with me


---------09:59----------
yes i think i tend to be very objective


---------10:02----------
about my


---------10:03----------
faults sure i can kind of now look


---------10:07----------
at the mirror i'm gonna and yeah so when


---------10:09----------
you look in the mirror what do you see


---------10:12----------
uh a person is trying to work on it


---------10:16----------
work on what uh empathy


---------10:20----------
that's something that was like kind of a


---------10:21----------
goal for me in the last two years


---------10:24----------
can you help me understand that um


---------10:30----------
i think it's common when you meet


---------10:33----------
someone who's


---------10:34----------
very logical to interact with people who


---------10:36----------
are more emotional


---------10:37----------
that for instance when you approach a


---------10:39----------
problem and they approach you with a


---------10:41----------
problem


---------10:42----------
let's say their problem is that um


---------10:46----------
like they feel really bad that uh


---------10:49----------
they're


---------10:50----------
not getting enough viewers this is just


---------10:52----------
random problem okay


---------10:53----------
and immediately my mind thinks like okay


---------10:55----------
well what can i do to get more viewers i


---------10:56----------
can collab with these people


---------10:58----------
they can start streaming at these times


---------10:59----------
they can start doing this or this


---------11:01----------
this or this and like all they want is


---------11:03----------
like durant


---------11:04----------
essentially and it's been like uh


---------11:07----------
a common i feel like this is common for


---------11:09----------
a lot of people growing pain to be like


---------11:11----------
okay well


---------11:12----------
understand that like being able to


---------11:14----------
immediately understand that that's what


---------11:16----------
they're looking to do


---------11:16----------
is something that takes work to some


---------11:19----------
extent or yeah


---------11:20----------
and then when you fit when you are not


---------11:25----------
understanding of that uh


---------11:29----------
it can cause problems i feel like that's


---------11:32----------
like a very common


---------11:33----------
uh point where it's like okay well


---------11:35----------
that's


---------11:37----------
so i'm i'm hearing that you kind of


---------11:39----------
started working on it two years ago


---------11:41----------
yeah i'm hearing that your instinctual


---------11:44----------
response


---------11:45----------
is to try to fix things for them yes and


---------11:48----------
that you discovered and are working on


---------11:50----------
trying to not fix things for people when


---------11:52----------
what they really want you to do is


---------11:54----------
listen


---------11:55----------
yeah can you tell me what things were


---------11:58----------
like


---------11:58----------
before two years


---------12:02----------
i didn't interact with many people


---------12:06----------
i think the biggest thing is when i went


---------12:07----------
from oh


---------12:09----------
i guess like when i went from pro play


---------12:12----------
or i should say even before then i went


---------12:14----------
from like high school to college and i


---------12:16----------
left all my high school friends okay


---------12:18----------
so in college all i did was play video


---------12:20----------
games like that's it


---------12:22----------
so like league of legends was and i got


---------12:24----------
good at it good enough to go pro


---------12:26----------
but the thing is like i really only have


---------12:27----------
like one or two friends


---------12:29----------
on campus and like i would literally


---------12:31----------
spend my entire life


---------12:32----------
grinding the game um and then like i


---------12:35----------
left


---------12:36----------
them don't really talk to any but two


---------12:37----------
college friends anymore i went to


---------12:39----------
la so like essentially i had no friend


---------12:42----------
and so going from that moment where like


---------12:44----------
i had no friends into like meeting


---------12:45----------
dignitas people being friends with them


---------12:48----------
leaving that and still having to make


---------12:51----------
new friends it was kind of a situation


---------12:54----------
where


---------12:55----------
like yeah before those two or three


---------12:57----------
years like i just didn't talk to people


---------12:59----------
so when i started otv to like partially


---------13:03----------
uh hang out with people i thought were


---------13:04----------
cool and make content together and find


---------13:06----------
new friends


---------13:07----------
like that's i didn't have to go through


---------13:11----------
i guess some of the growing pains i


---------13:13----------
should have earlier


---------13:14----------
if you had more friends


---------13:17----------
how did it feel to not have many friends


---------13:20----------
like back in college and


---------13:23----------
uh honestly i didn't really care


---------13:26----------
because i think i was so addicted to


---------13:28----------
games


---------13:30----------
uh like it sucked sometimes where i was


---------13:31----------
like oh well you know it's not a


---------13:37----------
i i guess this is one of the things


---------13:39----------
where before then


---------13:40----------
i would like kind of logic it out and


---------13:42----------
rationalize that like


---------13:44----------
i didn't need to meet new people because


---------13:46----------
like for me it was like okay if i stay


---------13:48----------
inside


---------13:49----------
and i raid world of warcraft or i play


---------13:52----------
league of legends with my friends like


---------13:53----------
i'm always going to get like a an 8 of


---------13:55----------
10 experience for the night like i'm


---------13:57----------
going to be it's going to be sick


---------13:59----------
but i go out to drink or i go with my


---------14:01----------
friends like sometimes like the people


---------14:02----------
at me are kind of weird


---------14:04----------
like the situation is kind of lame and


---------14:06----------
like maybe the average is like a 6.5


---------14:09----------
or like a seven so like just from my


---------14:12----------
extent because at the at that point i


---------14:14----------
didn't value like new experiences very


---------14:16----------
highly


---------14:17----------
i was just like ah it's not worth it for


---------14:18----------
me because like the averages are just so


---------14:20----------
different


---------14:21----------
you know it's clear like if i just think


---------14:23----------
about it like mathematically


---------14:25----------
like i should just stay in and play


---------14:26----------
games um that's because


---------14:28----------
my evaluation in the experiences was not


---------14:31----------
worth much but


---------14:32----------
later i learned that it was worth


---------14:33----------
everything how did you learn that


---------14:37----------
uh get growing older you tend to


---------14:40----------
learn that new experiences are kind of


---------14:44----------
the way to find what you want and the


---------14:47----------
way to find


---------14:48----------
i guess grow and i think it's like


---------14:50----------
everyone knows that


---------14:52----------
they might not know know that but


---------14:54----------
they've heard people like repeat the


---------14:55----------
words even if they don't


---------14:57----------
actually how did you get to know know


---------14:59----------
that


---------15:03----------
i got a lot of new experiences so when i


---------15:06----------
played


---------15:06----------
professional play i didn't realize at


---------15:09----------
the time but


---------15:10----------
i visited multiple countries


---------15:13----------
like i went to multiple different places


---------15:17----------
experienced a lot of different food a


---------15:18----------
lot of different cultures a lot of


---------15:20----------
different people


---------15:21----------
got to meet great


---------15:24----------
people which i feel like are amazing and


---------15:27----------
are super


---------15:28----------
like funny or super like talented at


---------15:30----------
what they do


---------15:32----------
and i realized that like meeting new


---------15:33----------
people is


---------15:35----------
and having those new experiences were


---------15:38----------
things that shaped


---------15:38----------
my life so in hindsight i look back on


---------15:42----------
my


---------15:43----------
like kind of formative years when it


---------15:45----------
comes to early league of legends as like


---------15:48----------
league of legends actually made me the


---------15:50----------
person who i am


---------15:52----------
for all the good and bad


---------15:55----------
and and who did it who did league of


---------15:57----------
legends create


---------15:58----------
who is the person you are i


---------16:01----------
think uh a person


---------16:06----------
who


---------16:11----------
uh i think when i was younger i used to


---------16:14----------
always chase happy


---------16:16----------
and so i'll put it this way and this is


---------16:18----------
i i think everyone does this right this


---------16:20----------
pursuit happiness is a [ __ ] movie


---------16:22----------
right but


---------16:24----------
um when i was given those early forms in


---------16:26----------
middle school where they're what is your


---------16:28----------
future profession and you write down


---------16:29----------
your future profession


---------16:30----------
i was a little kid i wrote down happy


---------16:32----------
and i


---------16:33----------
to this day still think that small


---------16:36----------
version of me was still way smarter than


---------16:38----------
who i am now


---------16:40----------
and i think i've been trying to chase


---------16:41----------
what that means


---------16:43----------
and how that like translates


---------16:46----------
to what i do for a long time and i


---------16:49----------
realized that like


---------16:50----------
like league made me happy working with


---------16:52----------
people to a goal


---------16:54----------
made me very [ __ ] happy to the point


---------16:56----------
where like i


---------16:57----------
like not only was it um fulfilling on a


---------17:01----------
day by day it was also creatively


---------17:02----------
fulfilling as well because i feel like


---------17:04----------
team


---------17:04----------
camadri brutalized that or whatever


---------17:08----------
like being able to work together with


---------17:10----------
people who are very talented


---------17:12----------
is like um the feeling can't be measured


---------17:16----------
especially when you're looking to


---------17:17----------
compete


---------17:18----------
at the top level at least in the top of


---------17:20----------
north america right


---------17:22----------
um and so like through like that's how i


---------17:26----------
kind of learned what makes me happy both


---------17:29----------
on the short term and


---------17:31----------
as throughout the as the year stretched


---------17:33----------
later and later


---------17:34----------
i learned satisfaction which is like i


---------17:37----------
guess my definition for like long-term


---------17:39----------
happiness


---------17:39----------
and how that kind of works together


---------17:42----------
and so lee kind of formed my idea


---------17:46----------
of what happiness and satisfaction are


---------17:49----------
yeah so one way i'm going to just kind


---------17:51----------
of like explain how i understand it


---------17:54----------
so i think that a lot of times when we


---------17:55----------
think about short-term happiness it's an


---------17:57----------
emotion


---------17:59----------
so our mind is capable of producing


---------18:01----------
emotions like joy


---------18:03----------
sadness fun enjoyment relaxation


---------18:07----------
and then there's almost like a spiritual


---------18:09----------
dimension of happiness which is not


---------18:11----------
emotional in nature


---------18:13----------
so this is the axis of sukkah which


---------18:16----------
means like


---------18:16----------
peace or contentment and which means


---------18:19----------
suffering


---------18:21----------
and so sometimes like this can be


---------18:22----------
confusing because people sort of equate


---------18:24----------
suffering with sadness but if you ever


---------18:27----------
listen to sad music


---------18:30----------
like you kind of enjoy it and like why


---------18:32----------
do we


---------18:33----------
listen to sad music why do we watch sad


---------18:35----------
movies because we in those moments we


---------18:36----------
feel negative emotions


---------18:39----------
but there's like a peace or joy or


---------18:40----------
contentment which implies that actually


---------18:43----------
that the axes


---------18:44----------
like the spiritual axis of sukkah and


---------18:46----------
dukkha or contentment and suffering


---------18:48----------
is independent of the axis of emotion


---------18:51----------
and that emotions tend to fluctuate


---------18:54----------
relatively easily from day to day but


---------18:56----------
what you call


---------18:57----------
satisfaction i think is on that other


---------19:00----------
axis


---------19:01----------
of sukhanduk it's sort of a more cosmic


---------19:05----------
sense of contentment


---------19:09----------
i don't know if i'd relate cosmic


---------19:12----------
contentment


---------19:13----------
and put those words together but i do


---------19:15----------
understand the general gist of what


---------19:16----------
you're talking about and i agree


---------19:18----------
yeah um and like i still remember like


---------19:21----------
there were like i remember


---------19:24----------
my memory is really bad of just my past


---------19:27----------
i tend to be


---------19:28----------
very um just forgetful like long-term


---------19:31----------
memory rise but i remember moments in my


---------19:33----------
life where i was like


---------19:34----------
this determined something important so


---------19:37----------
like


---------19:37----------
i remember way back in middle school


---------19:39----------
when i first learned how to play tennis


---------19:40----------
i had a private instructor


---------19:42----------
and we were playing tennis and i would


---------19:44----------
and and


---------19:46----------
uh i was playing


---------19:49----------
and for me i was always just like i just


---------19:51----------
want to play


---------19:53----------
and he was trying to instill some sort


---------19:54----------
of competitive spirit in me and he just


---------19:56----------
asked like


---------19:57----------
when you play is it more fun to win or


---------20:00----------
lose


---------20:01----------
do you enjoy it more when you win or


---------20:03----------
enjoy more when you lose


---------20:04----------
and that's who my young little brain


---------20:06----------
like kind of flicked on and i was like


---------20:08----------
i do like winning you know i feel like


---------20:10----------
at some point everyone realizes that


---------20:12----------
winning is cool


---------20:13----------
you gotta love it and then in my


---------20:17----------
league of legends years i'd once talked


---------20:19----------
to the ul


---------20:20----------
coach sheepy he was in in a for


---------20:22----------
something and he kind of talked to me


---------20:24----------
about satisfaction and he used very


---------20:25----------
league of legends terms for it


---------20:27----------
he was like okay a good example of


---------20:29----------
happiness for satisfaction is


---------20:31----------
if you go to worlds like


---------20:35----------
and you're if you're playing through the


---------20:36----------
team and you're you're enjoying like the


---------20:38----------
moment you play your team the wins


---------20:40----------
losses you're making playoffs


---------20:41----------
but if you don't make it to worlds are


---------20:43----------
you satisfied at the end of the year


---------20:45----------
and i just thought about that and i'm


---------20:46----------
like i'm probably not you know


---------20:48----------
regardless about how i do at worlds if i


---------20:50----------
don't make it i'm not satisfied


---------20:52----------
and for me that was like a very easy


---------20:54----------
league of legends way of putting it


---------20:55----------
or like esports really putting it of


---------20:57----------
like how to determine between like


---------20:58----------
satisfaction and happiness for myself


---------21:01----------
i know that like yeah i feel like you


---------21:03----------
have maybe like different


---------21:04----------
rules or logic but like it makes the


---------21:07----------
same sense


---------21:08----------
i i think you know it's interesting you


---------21:10----------
you mentioned


---------21:12----------
you know like loving to win or loving to


---------21:14----------
lose


---------21:15----------
i was working a buddy of mine as a is an


---------21:18----------
olympic athlete


---------21:19----------
and she was telling me that you know


---------21:22----------
when she was like growing up or when she


---------21:24----------
was training like someone asked her the


---------21:25----------
question


---------21:26----------
do you love to win or do you hate to


---------21:28----------
lose


---------21:33----------
and so when i work with when i work with


---------21:35----------
you know competitors i think that


---------21:37----------
becomes a really really important


---------21:38----------
question it's really fascinating to see


---------21:41----------
who says what in terms of what motivates


---------21:45----------
them


---------21:45----------
you know do you do you play because you


---------21:48----------
love to win


---------21:49----------
or do you like practice because you hate


---------21:51----------
to lose


---------21:54----------
i think i've spent years breaking myself


---------21:58----------
away from


---------21:59----------
being a competitor i think


---------22:02----------
now when you look at my recent streams


---------22:04----------
or my recent play


---------22:06----------
i focus a lot about being like a more


---------22:08----------
entertaining personality


---------22:09----------
as opposed to being a more competitive


---------22:11----------
video gamer and i think


---------22:13----------
it kind of comes at the expense of the


---------22:15----------
others sometimes


---------22:16----------
at least for me it does and trying to


---------22:18----------
find the balance is the difficult


---------22:20----------
in between so scarra i'm gonna circle


---------22:23----------
back to this idea of logic and empathy


---------22:26----------
throughout our conversation if that gets


---------22:28----------
annoying to you let me know


---------22:30----------
i think we're kind of mapping out a lot


---------22:31----------
of stuff but like so let me ask you when


---------22:33----------
you kind of say that when you look in


---------22:35----------
the mirror you see someone who's working


---------22:37----------
on it


---------22:38----------
yeah can you help me understand that


---------22:40----------
sentiment


---------22:42----------
um


---------22:42----------
[Music]


---------22:45----------
it's kind of like uh


---------22:48----------
i think naturally whatever i


---------22:52----------
tend to


---------22:56----------
i think everyone does some sort of sort


---------22:58----------
of internal self review


---------22:59----------
whether they do it uh on a day by day


---------23:02----------
week by week


---------23:03----------
where they do it under like the


---------23:04----------
influence or they do it like


---------23:06----------
with friends whatever with their


---------23:08----------
therapist there is some sort of


---------23:09----------
self-review


---------23:10----------
inherent in yourself and if i i find in


---------23:12----------
competitive types of people


---------23:14----------
and i still think i somewhat am that


---------23:17----------
like i tend to be very self-reflective


---------23:19----------
of what i do


---------23:20----------
and so every month or every couple of


---------23:22----------
weeks i'll be like well how am i


---------23:24----------
doing in certain different aspects of my


---------23:26----------
life


---------23:27----------
um and so i it sounds like i'm vod


---------23:30----------
reviewing my


---------23:31----------
my real life so it's like well


---------23:34----------
uh very immediately after a situation


---------23:37----------
whether like


---------23:37----------
i hang out with people or whatever i'll


---------23:39----------
think to myself like how did that go


---------23:41----------
like was it cool was it not cool did


---------23:44----------
like did something happen that you


---------23:45----------
enjoyed that you didn't


---------23:47----------
um and sometimes i'll come away from


---------23:50----------
that like i [ __ ] up like i made that


---------23:52----------
person uncomfortable i said some bad


---------23:53----------
stuff there


---------23:54----------
like how do i make up for it what do i


---------23:56----------
do in the future is it do i just ignore


---------23:58----------
it and then


---------23:59----------
be a better like try to be a better


---------24:00----------
person later i think that for me uh


---------24:04----------
there's a lot of that kind of


---------24:05----------
self-reflection over the years and so


---------24:06----------
when it comes to empathy it's like


---------24:09----------
uh i think i've been a better listener


---------24:10----------
over years because at first i would


---------24:12----------
listen to problems


---------24:13----------
and i i'd be like oh it's so easy are


---------24:15----------
you are you serious


---------24:16----------
you just do this it's like it's like why


---------24:19----------
is this a problem


---------24:20----------
i like maybe even say those words like


---------24:23----------
what's the problem like just just do


---------24:24----------
this


---------24:25----------
and like they were coming to me for like


---------24:26----------
emotional support and i was like [ __ ]


---------24:28----------
off like are you serious this is so easy


---------24:31----------
just so do it


---------24:35----------
scarra this is gonna be tough okay


---------24:38----------
okay so i i want to share something with


---------24:42----------
you that i think will


---------24:43----------
help a lot but i think it's going to be


---------24:45----------
a slippery


---------24:46----------
slippery thing to catch okay


---------24:51----------
so i'm going to start by introducing the


---------24:52----------
concept of cognitive empathy versus


---------24:54----------
emotional empathy


---------24:56----------
okay and i think what you have a lot of


---------24:58----------
is cognitive empathy


---------25:00----------
uh yeah i can see that when you say i


---------25:02----------
can see that what does that mean to you


---------25:04----------
what do you see


---------25:05----------
tell us well it's it's more just like


---------25:08----------
that makes sense i guess because when


---------25:11----------
you're talking like cognitive


---------25:12----------
i think cognitive i think like brain


---------25:14----------
function right yeah where it's more like


---------25:16----------
logical


---------25:16----------
yeah like empathy like i could see


---------25:19----------
myself being more as like a cognitive


---------25:21----------
empathy kind of guy rather than a you


---------25:22----------
know the rever the alternative


---------25:25----------
yep or i guess the other side


---------25:29----------
so the way that you are learning to be


---------25:30----------
empathic is through logic


---------25:33----------
you do vod review right so like so if we


---------25:36----------
think about emotional empathy


---------25:37----------
and if we think about technically what


---------25:39----------
empathy means


---------25:41----------
it's the ability to like feel someone


---------25:43----------
else's


---------25:44----------
emotions right so if i'm watching a


---------25:46----------
youtube video and someone gets hit in


---------25:48----------
the nuts


---------25:49----------
i feel that instinctive pain in myself


---------25:51----------
as i watch this other person suffer


---------25:53----------
it has nothing to do with cognition it


---------25:54----------
has everything to do with


---------25:56----------
an empathic response and i'm hearing


---------25:59----------
that you're becoming


---------26:00----------
socially adept


---------26:04----------
but i'm not sure that you're becoming


---------26:06----------
more empathic


---------26:09----------
because i think what you're really


---------26:10----------
enhancing is your cognitive empathy


---------26:12----------
you're looking at this like a game that


---------26:14----------
is played that has rules


---------26:15----------
you're looking at relationships like


---------26:17----------
chess and it's like if this person makes


---------26:20----------
this move


---------26:21----------
what is the right move for me to make


---------26:23----------
problem solving


---------26:25----------
is the wrong move listening is the right


---------26:28----------
move


---------26:29----------
how do i listen okay let's listen oh


---------26:31----------
that went well


---------26:32----------
good job scarra you're working


---------26:37----------
how do you feel about that


---------26:40----------
um i feel like there's a lot of truth in


---------26:42----------
what you said and i may not agree with


---------26:44----------
everything that you said but i'm willing


---------26:46----------
to listen so


---------26:47----------
what do you disagree with um i feel like


---------26:52----------
i may have explained it to you too


---------26:53----------
logically


---------26:55----------
um because there's no way okay


---------26:58----------
i find it very hard to believe that


---------27:00----------
people think specifically like that


---------27:02----------
logically about stuff so i even though i


---------27:04----------
explain it that way i don't necessarily


---------27:07----------
think or feel that way completely


---------27:10----------
okay but i do agree with you that like


---------27:13----------
that could be the case


---------27:14----------
and highly true so now we get to the


---------27:17----------
slippery part


---------27:18----------
and this is what's gonna be hard is when


---------27:21----------
i ask you


---------27:21----------
questions your answers are logical in


---------27:24----------
explanation


---------27:25----------
but i think that we're missing something


---------27:27----------
because you skirt very quickly


---------27:29----------
over something to a logical explanation


---------27:32----------
okay okay so i i'm glad that


---------27:37----------
you recognize that you explain something


---------27:38----------
logically so i'll give you just an


---------27:40----------
example


---------27:43----------
when i mentioned that i talked to some


---------27:45----------
people who consider you


---------27:47----------
to be like a very good friend and very


---------27:50----------
empathic and emotionally supportive what


---------27:53----------
was your response


---------27:56----------
i didn't think i


---------27:59----------
i feel like it's overplayed i guess at


---------28:01----------
my my initial response but that's


---------28:03----------
because


---------28:04----------
i have very early it is again slippery


---------28:07----------
okay


---------28:08----------
slippery right that's because


---------28:13----------
so one is an emotion and then the second


---------28:15----------
you say that's because you move into a


---------28:18----------
rationalization


---------28:19----------
slippery slippery i find that the best


---------28:23----------
way to talk about these things is


---------28:25----------
relatively rationally if possible


---------28:27----------
there's some people um


---------28:31----------
i feel like it's easier to break down


---------28:34----------
and digest


---------28:35----------
when you can do that um


---------28:38----------
and i found that especially


---------28:42----------
when i approach someone like you that i


---------28:44----------
feel like does that a lot


---------28:46----------
or can do that that it becomes easier to


---------28:50----------
talk to when it's completely logical or


---------28:53----------
like


---------28:53----------
mainly logical yes so i would concur to


---------28:57----------
you


---------28:58----------
that it is the i understand why you say


---------29:01----------
the best way but i think this is what


---------29:03----------
position did you play in law


---------29:05----------
when you were playing competitively


---------29:06----------
midland okay


---------29:08----------
so like i think that's a very like if


---------29:11----------
you think about


---------29:12----------
you know winning a game you can be mid


---------29:14----------
lane centric right like you can think


---------29:16----------
about the goals you're a mid laner


---------29:18----------
and that's your strengths so when when i


---------29:20----------
ask you like


---------29:21----------
i mean i think you understand this at a


---------29:23----------
higher level because you understand


---------29:24----------
law better but like if i were to ask


---------29:26----------
like a mid-tier law player


---------29:29----------
or if i go post on the league of legends


---------29:31----------
like reddit


---------29:32----------
and i ask how do i climb and they'll say


---------29:34----------
like you've got to play mid and carry


---------29:36----------
the game


---------29:38----------
technically it isn't true but like you


---------29:40----------
can certainly see why people feel that


---------29:41----------
way right


---------29:42----------
yeah like and supports will be like yeah


---------29:44----------
i tried playing support and it didn't


---------29:46----------
work and like i didn't start climbing


---------29:47----------
until i started playing mid


---------29:49----------
so i think that when you say it's the


---------29:51----------
best way i think that's because that's


---------29:53----------
the thing that


---------29:54----------
you're the best at agreed


---------29:57----------
so i think that like where we need to


---------29:59----------
work on because i think it's like subtle


---------30:02----------
and i'm curious do you remember what you


---------30:03----------
were going to say when when i s


---------30:05----------
you were about to say that's because and


---------30:06----------
then i cut you off like a dick


---------30:08----------
but i think you were saying something


---------30:09----------
really important do you have very low


---------30:11----------
expensive my self-worth


---------30:13----------
there we go a lot of times yep


---------30:20----------
so uh


---------30:24----------
yeah i think that's normal


---------30:28----------
some a lot of times okay so


---------30:31----------
so there you go explaining it


---------30:33----------
rationalizing it it's normal to feel


---------30:35----------
this way


---------30:36----------
yeah right but like how do we so what


---------30:38----------
are you feeling right now


---------30:42----------
that i put myself out there


---------30:46----------
a little bit more than i have normally


---------30:53----------
that i usually wouldn't say that


---------30:56----------
uh without some sort of joking


---------31:00----------
connotation to it that i usually would


---------31:02----------
on stream


---------31:03----------
so i'll ask you this question i think


---------31:04----------
for the second or third time and you may


---------31:06----------
hear it a few more times


---------31:08----------
scarra what do you see when you look in


---------31:10----------
the mirror


---------31:23----------
someone who's happy about where they're


---------31:26----------
at


---------31:27----------
and maybe not too happy about what he


---------31:30----------
sees physically in the mirror


---------31:32----------
okay so


---------31:38----------
can i think for a second go ahead


---------31:47----------
[Music]


---------31:49----------
i'm figuring out how to say this


---------31:57----------
so what i'm hearing is that you work so


---------32:00----------
you look in the mirror right so we're


---------32:02----------
gonna i'm gonna put myself in scara's


---------32:04----------
head for a second okay


---------32:05----------
so hopefully we get some things that are


---------32:07----------
right here but you've done a very good


---------32:09----------
job of sort of pointing out


---------32:10----------
you know where i'm off so i'd really


---------32:12----------
appreciate that


---------32:14----------
saskara looks at himself in the mirror


---------32:16----------
and he's happy with some things and


---------32:18----------
he's unhappy with other things so then


---------32:19----------
what scarra does is scar says like let's


---------32:21----------
work on


---------32:22----------
right let's think about this let's do


---------32:24----------
some analysis like let's


---------32:25----------
draw on this skill set to make ourselves


---------32:29----------
better


---------32:30----------
and then you work on yourself and now


---------32:33----------
you can start to be like content i'm


---------32:34----------
just keep going


---------32:35----------
okay then you start to work on yourself


---------32:39----------
because that's what you know how to do


---------32:41----------
right like you know how to improve


---------32:42----------
yourself you know how to be logical


---------32:44----------
about what you can work on and what you


---------32:46----------
can't work on


---------32:47----------
and so like you work on it for a while


---------32:49----------
like two years ago you embarked on this


---------32:51----------
this thing like okay you haven't been


---------32:53----------
necessarily lonely in the past but like


---------32:55----------
now you're kind of worrying


---------32:56----------
working on like forming relationships


---------32:59----------
and having authentic experiences and


---------33:00----------
you're gonna work on it


---------33:02----------
and then you can even be proud of that


---------33:04----------
you can look at yourself in the mirror


---------33:05----------
and you can say like scar


---------33:06----------
has come a long way and i'm like living


---------33:09----------
a life that's more enriching i'm


---------33:10----------
starting to step away from like you know


---------33:12----------
being judged by the internet and like


---------33:14----------
you can make lots of progress


---------33:16----------
and so when you look in the mirror you


---------33:18----------
have this beautiful response


---------33:20----------
someone who's working on it right it's


---------33:22----------
so positive


---------33:24----------
and like that's what you've got to do


---------33:25----------
you look at yourself there's something


---------33:26----------
you're not happy with and like you work


---------33:28----------
on it that's how you become a pro league


---------33:30----------
of legends player


---------33:31----------
right because there's always something


---------33:33----------
to improve


---------33:35----------
and logic is your shield it's your tool


---------33:38----------
it's your sword it's everything


---------33:41----------
and the challenge though is that you can


---------33:43----------
work on it and you can work on it and


---------33:45----------
you can work on it and you can be


---------33:47----------
satisfied in that dimension of your life


---------33:50----------
but when you look in the mirror like


---------33:52----------
that other feeling doesn't go away


---------33:59----------
hmm


---------34:02----------
okay what do you think about that


---------34:06----------
i'm trying to figure out what you mean


---------34:08----------
when you say other feeling


---------34:13----------
so a few moments ago you got a little


---------34:17----------
bit emotional


---------34:20----------
that thing doesn't change


---------34:24----------
right and i think like what i've now i'm


---------34:26----------
i'm really going out on a whim


---------34:28----------
and i think that there's something very


---------34:30----------
dangerous that could be going on


---------34:32----------
which is that the more you work on


---------34:34----------
things


---------34:36----------
and the more that other thing doesn't


---------34:38----------
change


---------34:40----------
what do you logically conclude


---------34:49----------
the more you work on your life and the


---------34:51----------
more successful you become


---------34:54----------
yes the more you work on empathy yes


---------34:58----------
and the better you get and if you look


---------35:00----------
in the mirror


---------35:04----------
the more that that other feeling like


---------35:06----------
continues persists


---------35:11----------
i think when i look in the mirror i


---------35:12----------
think a lot of things that i


---------35:19----------
could do but i'm not doing


---------35:23----------
so whether it's like uh


---------35:27----------
working out more as a very good example


---------35:31----------
um and it's things that like


---------35:35----------
i don't know whether i should be feeling


---------35:39----------
i think i can i can rationalize some


---------35:41----------
things you know and i think that's one


---------35:43----------
of the things that like you can


---------35:44----------
find a way to kind of rationalize it in


---------35:46----------
a lot of different ways


---------35:48----------
um i don't know


---------35:51----------
[Music]


---------35:56----------
i think if foo i use the words i think a


---------35:59----------
lot now that you've brought it up


---------36:01----------
because when we're talking about my


---------36:04----------
feeling of low


---------36:05----------
self-worth i think that comes with the


---------36:09----------
fact that i


---------36:10----------
feel like i am not


---------36:17----------
flexible or good enough


---------36:20----------
as a person in every situation


---------36:24----------
but the way i've handled that feeling


---------36:28----------
is the understanding that i will never


---------36:30----------
be perfect


---------36:32----------
and to take steps slow


---------36:37----------
yep so i i think that's adaptive


---------36:41----------
right you're you could call it


---------36:43----------
acceptance


---------36:44----------
so here's what i was kind of angling


---------36:46----------
towards and i'm gonna lay it out for you


---------36:48----------
logically


---------36:49----------
so i think it's gonna be terrifying


---------36:53----------
because there are some things you can


---------36:55----------
work on and there are some things that


---------36:57----------
you can't


---------36:58----------
and the adaptive way to look at that is


---------36:59----------
that no one is perfect


---------37:01----------
but like it also like can engender i


---------37:03----------
know this sounds kind of weird


---------37:04----------
some degree of hopelessness because


---------37:07----------
despite


---------37:08----------
all your efforts despite all your growth


---------37:09----------
when you look in the mirror you still


---------37:11----------
see


---------37:11----------
like something that's a little bit ugly


---------37:14----------
yeah and then what happens is you start


---------37:16----------
to think to yourself like i could do


---------37:17----------
things to change this


---------37:20----------
i could work out more for example but


---------37:22----------
the


---------37:23----------
challenge there is as logical as that is


---------37:25----------
like it actually engenders feelings of


---------37:27----------
hopelessness and powerlessness


---------37:30----------
because who are you you're someone who


---------37:32----------
could do something


---------37:34----------
but you don't


---------37:39----------
and then how do you feel about being


---------37:41----------
that person


---------37:44----------
i feel more human that's that's good


---------37:48----------
that's actually very good like um


---------37:51----------
that's kind of what i see is like


---------37:55----------
i don't mean max my life


---------37:58----------
even though i feel like i'm fairly


---------37:59----------
logical because i


---------38:01----------
understand except that


---------38:05----------
i'll have days which i'm just don't feel


---------38:08----------
like doing it


---------38:09----------
days where it's you know you stay in bed


---------38:11----------
a little bit longer days where you


---------38:14----------
uh do chores but you put them off and i


---------38:17----------
find that i just


---------38:18----------
categorize those moments as just being


---------38:21----------
normal


---------38:22----------
that's not bad thing that's just


---------38:25----------
a normal thing okay so when we're


---------38:28----------
categorizing


---------38:29----------
what kind of part of our mind are we


---------38:31----------
using


---------38:32----------
logical part there we go so i can see


---------38:36----------
that like this is


---------38:37----------
like so logic is your mid lane right


---------38:39----------
it's like your


---------38:40----------
your strong suit and yeah that's what i


---------38:42----------
understand


---------38:43----------
absolutely so i think that this is where


---------38:46----------
if we think about like


---------38:47----------
you know that moment that you


---------38:49----------
experienced emotion do you have a sense


---------38:51----------
of how we brought that emotion out


---------38:55----------
uh yeah


---------39:04----------
i think you asked me to point out


---------39:06----------
something fairly vulnerable


---------39:07----------
something that i wouldn't be comfortable


---------39:09----------
sharing to the general public


---------39:11----------
normally okay so


---------39:15----------
let me stop there for a second because


---------39:17----------
it you don't i want to


---------39:18----------
impress upon you that you really don't


---------39:20----------
have to share anything that you don't


---------39:21----------
feel comfortable with


---------39:22----------
oh no i'm completely okay like yeah yeah


---------39:25----------
i i know most people feel that way but


---------39:27----------
here's what i


---------39:28----------
here's what i would do so here's what i


---------39:30----------
intentionally tried to do


---------39:31----------
so the first time that i asked you the


---------39:33----------
question i saw the emotion


---------39:35----------
you had a micro expression of like and


---------39:39----------
you swatted away


---------39:40----------
the praise of your friends yes


---------39:44----------
and so like why does someone swat away


---------39:46----------
the praise of of their friends it's


---------39:48----------
because like you don't


---------39:49----------
feel like you are what they think you


---------39:51----------
are they're wrong because you said if


---------39:53----------
they only spent more time with me


---------39:56----------
they would see the real me which is


---------39:58----------
uglier


---------40:00----------
right i'm not trying to focus on an


---------40:01----------
appearance thing there but like


---------40:03----------
like we like it's like you're showing


---------40:05----------
your friends like this nice


---------40:07----------
empathic supportive person that you try


---------40:10----------
really hard and you can be proud of and


---------40:12----------
worked on


---------40:13----------
but like the funny thing is there's the


---------40:15----------
flip side to that coin which is like


---------40:16----------
they're not


---------40:17----------
seeing the real me


---------40:20----------
and if they spent more time with me if


---------40:22----------
they saw me when my defenses were down


---------40:24----------
and if they got unfiltered scarra they'd


---------40:27----------
see something else


---------40:29----------
and then you launched into your logical


---------40:31----------
explanation


---------40:32----------
so i think the way that we got to the


---------40:34----------
emotion and you do it fast scarra it's


---------40:38----------
like


---------40:38----------
it's the transition is so damn quick you


---------40:41----------
touch the negative emotion and then your


---------40:43----------
mind is like categorized in logic


---------40:45----------
you skirt over it you launch into like a


---------40:48----------
feel-good story about positivity and


---------40:50----------
self-growth and learning about yourself


---------40:52----------
and then like that emotion gets left


---------40:53----------
behind and so the


---------40:55----------
the the harder i make it for you to


---------40:58----------
skirt past it the more you begin to see


---------41:01----------
your logical defense mechanisms the more


---------41:04----------
it


---------41:04----------
uncovers that emotion and then if you


---------41:07----------
start to categorize it the emotion is


---------41:09----------
going to get buried


---------41:12----------
and so what you're going to be doing is


---------41:13----------
you're going to be like grinding mid


---------41:15----------
lane


---------41:16----------
and like forgetting about the support


---------41:17----------
role


---------41:19----------
and so like you've become very


---------41:21----------
cognitively empathic it's beautiful your


---------41:23----------
analogies are great dude like you


---------41:24----------
understand it so well


---------41:27----------
replay analysis for conversations


---------41:32----------
i'll do it that well but i know what you


---------41:34----------
mean yeah right


---------41:35----------
so so that even though you sort of said


---------41:37----------
i don't do it that well i'm not


---------41:39----------
detecting any real emotion underneath


---------41:41----------
that


---------41:42----------
whereas i think that like when we get to


---------41:44----------
like you know and i genuinely don't


---------41:46----------
think that you felt lonely in college


---------41:49----------
but like there are questions that i'm


---------41:50----------
purposely avoiding asking you


---------41:53----------
like because i think that they're gonna


---------41:55----------
elicit emotional responses and like i


---------41:57----------
don't know if


---------41:58----------
like i don't know that we ever need to


---------41:59----------
ask those questions because i think the


---------42:01----------
most


---------42:02----------
important thing to i'm sure it'll be


---------42:04----------
clip worthy but like


---------42:06----------
the most important thing is to help you


---------42:08----------
understand like how to access your


---------42:10----------
emotions


---------42:11----------
because your emotions don't need to be


---------42:12----------
fixed


---------42:14----------
agreed right and and so but it's hard


---------42:17----------
because you like to fix things


---------42:19----------
uh so like you've learned how to listen


---------42:22----------
to other people


---------42:23----------
and you're starting to sort of learn how


---------42:25----------
to listen to yourself


---------42:27----------
but i think that you default to problem


---------42:28----------
solving your own life


---------42:31----------
yeah i could see that all right


---------42:36----------
so you know what i'd really like to do


---------42:38----------
is teach you


---------42:40----------
about stepping away from your logical


---------42:42----------
mind


---------42:44----------
what do you think about that uh


---------42:48----------
i think that'd be cool


---------42:52----------
okay yeah so tell me about


---------42:57----------
round four what do you see when you look


---------42:59----------
in the mirror


---------43:02----------
i don't know like if i'm gonna be a


---------43:06----------
hundred percent honest


---------43:08----------
i don't know i don't really think about


---------43:11----------
it too much


---------43:12----------
okay um aside from the fact that like i


---------43:15----------
don't like to see


---------43:16----------
the reflection that looks back


---------43:17----------
physically um


---------43:20----------
what i think i oh just like


---------43:24----------
i wish


---------43:28----------
i was skinnier i guess


---------43:33----------
like i wish i was more healthy sure so


---------43:35----------
so


---------43:36----------
so i'm gonna just repeat back to you


---------43:38----------
what you said because i think we're


---------43:39----------
getting somewhere but now i'm gonna go


---------43:40----------
the logical route


---------43:42----------
cool i don't know what i see when i look


---------43:45----------
in the mirror


---------43:45----------
except for dot dot dot


---------43:49----------
yes right so like if we think about that


---------43:50----------
response logically for a second


---------43:53----------
there's like a dominant direction


---------43:58----------
which is like something negative i think


---------44:01----------
yes and so i think i first look at the


---------44:03----------
physical appearance


---------44:05----------
okay and and what do you


---------44:10----------
yeah so and and what do you think about


---------44:12----------
your physical appearance


---------44:13----------
uh that it could be better is one way to


---------44:16----------
phrase it


---------44:17----------
yep good so now that's your positive


---------44:19----------
adaptive


---------44:21----------
version right so what's the flip side of


---------44:23----------
the coin for


---------44:24----------
it could be better uh that i


---------44:29----------
will die before i'm 40 unless i start


---------44:32----------
taking care of myself


---------44:35----------
that's still a positive there's a


---------44:37----------
dirtier version underneath


---------44:40----------
uh


---------44:45----------
how do you feel when you look in the


---------44:48----------
mirror out of shape


---------44:53----------
okay um let me know if i'm digging in


---------44:56----------
like so i like let me share with you


---------44:58----------
because i'm gonna i'm gonna do some of


---------45:00----------
the lifting for you okay


---------45:01----------
scarra yeah so i'm going to do this


---------45:03----------
because i i don't want you to feel bad


---------45:05----------
and i feel like if i keep on asking you


---------45:07----------
questions you're going to feel bad


---------45:09----------
so we're going to stay in the safety i


---------45:12----------
think you're a


---------45:13----------
pretty far away point for me feeling bad


---------45:17----------
okay but maybe that's just defensively


---------45:19----------
what i'm saying


---------45:21----------
but it's i'm okay


---------45:25----------
i think that i'm pretty sure


---------45:28----------
okay so when you look at yourself and


---------45:31----------
you feel like someone


---------45:33----------
should be someone who could be in shape


---------45:35----------
more that's the problem-solving


---------45:37----------
side right it gives you a direction to


---------45:40----------
fix


---------45:41----------
what you see in the mirror yes do you


---------45:43----------
see how like that's


---------45:44----------
intrinsically tied but


---------45:47----------
what needs to be fixed scara


---------45:52----------
from our conversation the emotional side


---------45:56----------
sure but fundamentally what kinds of


---------45:58----------
things need to be fixed


---------46:00----------
i don't know the response to this


---------46:03----------
question


---------46:04----------
things that are broken yes


---------46:07----------
right so like when you look in the


---------46:08----------
mirror


---------46:10----------
do you feel what you're looking at is


---------46:13----------
something that's


---------46:14----------
busted no okay


---------46:23----------
let me think about that response for a


---------46:25----------
second


---------46:27----------
it by the way i thought it was really


---------46:28----------
good when you told me you don't know the


---------46:29----------
answer that i'm looking for


---------46:31----------
it's very helpful i i i'm i'm trying to


---------46:35----------
do it as logically as i can


---------46:37----------
yeah that's what we need to get rid of


---------46:39----------
yeah but like i don't know how else to


---------46:41----------
do it because when you're asking me what


---------46:43----------
i see in the mirror i first think


---------46:45----------
physic like what i actually look at in


---------46:47----------
the mirror and i don't remember


---------46:49----------
what i look at okay like i almost would


---------46:52----------
go to the mirror right now and be like


---------46:54----------
who are you yeah that's a good we'll do


---------46:58----------
that for our meditation okay


---------47:01----------
so so what do you think about your


---------47:04----------
appearance


---------47:05----------
let's start with think


---------47:14----------
at the base most basic level


---------47:17----------
it's that i'm fat and i could be better


---------47:20----------
that's it okay so i want to just point


---------47:23----------
out once again that anytime something


---------47:25----------
could be better the flip side of the


---------47:27----------
coin is that it's not good enough


---------47:29----------
true but i think if i go down that route


---------47:32----------
it'll be so self-destructive


---------47:34----------
that it'll be terrible for me as a


---------47:36----------
person and


---------47:37----------
that's why and there lies your problem


---------47:40----------
yes so this is that's the road


---------47:44----------
scar that you have to walk


---------47:48----------
so like your whole problem is that you


---------47:51----------
have deviated away from that road for so


---------47:54----------
long


---------47:55----------
it come kind of comes back to like not


---------47:57----------
recognizing like the value of


---------47:58----------
experiences


---------48:01----------
and this is where like you have to walk


---------48:02----------
the dark road like you have to step away


---------48:04----------
from the adaptive road


---------48:06----------
and you know you should walk walk it


---------48:08----------
with care because you're


---------48:09----------
logically correct that oftentimes


---------48:12----------
swimming in that ocean


---------48:13----------
leads to self-destruction


---------48:17----------
yes but like you know you


---------48:20----------
you gotta you have to walk that road


---------48:23----------
and you try so hard to not walk that


---------48:25----------
road and like as long you can stay as


---------48:27----------
adaptive as you want to but that thing


---------48:29----------
will not be fixed


---------48:32----------
yes i well


---------48:35----------
usually it's like a i tell my stream


---------48:38----------
this that usually a lot of problems get


---------48:40----------
fixed because


---------48:41----------
uh self-hatred i just hate it uh my


---------48:45----------
lazy my self-hatred overcomes my


---------48:47----------
laziness so eventually like if i have a


---------48:49----------
problem


---------48:50----------
like i'll like that i hate i'll hate it


---------48:53----------
enough to where


---------48:54----------
it overcomes my want to not do anything


---------48:58----------
about it


---------48:59----------
and then i end up fixing it or trying to


---------49:02----------
fix it


---------49:03----------
or working on it i think that we rely on


---------49:06----------
negative emotions a lot to spur us


---------49:09----------
forward in life


---------49:15----------
right so when you say self-hatred to


---------49:16----------
overcome laziness that makes a lot of


---------49:18----------
sense to me


---------49:19----------
and i think that like what we've got to


---------49:21----------
do for for you to be


---------49:23----------
happy because i don't think that you can


---------49:25----------
be happy in your whole being


---------49:27----------
as long as like that darkness or that


---------49:31----------
little


---------49:32----------
ball or whatever that is is there like


---------49:34----------
you can adapt around it


---------49:36----------
like you can you know build roads around


---------49:39----------
it you can build walls around it you can


---------49:40----------
do all kinds of things


---------49:42----------
you can work on other things you can


---------49:43----------
learn how to be like proud of yourself


---------49:46----------
which i think you genuinely have


---------49:47----------
you actually come across to me as like


---------49:49----------
like a relatively like confident and


---------49:51----------
secure person


---------49:53----------
i think it's because i i know a lot i


---------49:58----------
feel like


---------49:58----------
you know when it says when a with age


---------50:01----------
comes wisdom


---------50:02----------
you tend to find out more about yourself


---------50:04----------
as you go older


---------50:05----------
and for me that means i've kind of yeah


---------50:08----------
done that i guess so my weaknesses


---------50:12----------
my strengths my faults are things that i


---------50:20----------
have a bigger understanding of as i've


---------50:23----------
gone through multiple different


---------50:25----------
situations okay i think that


---------50:28----------
understanding and wisdom are good things


---------50:30----------
do you feel angry at yourself scarra


---------50:37----------
right now or about certain things or


---------50:40----------
yeah sure uh


---------50:44----------
i usually feel i usually feel frustrated


---------50:48----------
more so than anger what are you


---------50:50----------
frustrated by


---------50:52----------
um not dealing


---------50:55----------
like uh i guess


---------51:01----------
uh a common thing will be like if people


---------51:04----------
play with me


---------51:06----------
uh i tend to want them to feel good


---------51:09----------
about


---------51:09----------
it like even if they don't say it


---------51:12----------
afterwards like i can tell


---------51:13----------
if like the mood was good or it wasn't


---------51:16----------
so if i do a poor job


---------51:19----------
i i bring like bad energy or i just


---------51:23----------
don't


---------51:26----------
accommodate them well


---------51:29----------
then i feel frustrated or bad about it


---------51:34----------
a lot of times what are you frustrated


---------51:36----------
by


---------51:37----------
my inability to make them have fun


---------51:41----------
because i think a lot of the times


---------51:44----------
i can do that i know i can do that


---------51:50----------
tell me about that um so


---------51:53----------
if i'm in the let's say it's very simple


---------51:55----------
so like oh tv has a lot of friends


---------51:57----------
okay like whatever so i bring in


---------52:00----------
let's say i bring in like just otv so we


---------52:03----------
all play together


---------52:04----------
um i i mean it's just like looking


---------52:08----------
out for people and making sure they're


---------52:09----------
having fun if you can kind of tell if


---------52:11----------
they're not having a good time


---------52:13----------
and like if that's happening usually


---------52:17----------
you'll see this very commonly uh that


---------52:20----------
like


---------52:21----------
someone reaches out and like tries to


---------52:23----------
talk to them or get them more engaged


---------52:25----------
into the game


---------52:26----------
uh or to like kind of work with them or


---------52:28----------
just like you know shoot the [ __ ]


---------52:30----------
so that they feel like they had a good


---------52:32----------
time that that's what i strive to do


---------52:34----------
when i play with friends


---------52:39----------
so what are you frustrated by when that


---------52:41----------
fails


---------52:42----------
when when it fails to happens and i


---------52:45----------
think


---------52:47----------
sometimes i'm frustrated because there


---------52:49----------
were moments where i


---------52:52----------
feel like i could have been able to do


---------52:54----------
that and sometimes it's completely


---------52:56----------
impossible like they're just having a


---------52:59----------
really [ __ ] bad day


---------53:01----------
and like it's it's like really


---------53:03----------
impossible to [ __ ] do that


---------53:05----------
but most of the times i feel like it's


---------53:08----------
possible


---------53:09----------
okay can you control the emotions of


---------53:13----------
another human being


---------53:17----------
i wish um


---------53:20----------
no but you can make it


---------53:25----------
not manipulate it but kind of guide them


---------53:28----------
towards certain emotions


---------53:30----------
kind of like what you're doing right now


---------53:34----------
okay a little bit yeah so but i mean


---------53:38----------
you try though right so here's what i'm


---------53:41----------
hearing from you


---------53:42----------
you accept responsibility for other


---------53:44----------
people's enjoyment


---------53:46----------
uh only when i feel like


---------53:50----------
i could have made it more it could have


---------53:52----------
made it better


---------53:53----------
does that make sense so


---------53:56----------
that's what's so damning so let me just


---------53:58----------
repeat back to you what you just said


---------54:00----------
i only accept responsibility for other


---------54:02----------
people's enjoyment when i don't do a


---------54:04----------
good job at making them feel joy


---------54:12----------
that's a damning way of saying it i


---------54:14----------
usually agree with most of what you


---------54:16----------
you say i think in that scenario


---------54:19----------
it's more like there are certain


---------54:22----------
scenarios that would play out like


---------54:23----------
certain


---------54:24----------
certain moments during the session where


---------54:27----------
i'm like


---------54:27----------
oh i could have said this to help out a


---------54:29----------
little bit more you know


---------54:31----------
or this i could have done this instead


---------54:34----------
to help out


---------54:34----------
a little bit more what's


---------54:38----------
yep so i think here's the here's what


---------54:40----------
i'm gonna draw for you okay scar


---------54:44----------
when i shared with you so this is like


---------54:47----------
okay i'm gonna explain it i don't know


---------54:49----------
if this is gonna go in the right


---------54:51----------
direction or the wrong


---------54:52----------
direction but instinctively i'm feeling


---------54:54----------
like


---------54:57----------
going for the throat emotionally here is


---------54:59----------
like a big mistake


---------55:00----------
okay so i'm gonna play on the rational


---------55:02----------
level okay


---------55:04----------
so um yeah i'm just not i feel like


---------55:12----------
yeah it's up to you i'm running into


---------55:14----------
your rational defense mechanisms and


---------55:16----------
there's a part of me that wants to pull


---------55:18----------
out my


---------55:18----------
sledgehammer and like smash them apart


---------55:21----------
but you can


---------55:22----------
do it i know you say that but i'm not


---------55:25----------
gonna do that


---------55:26----------
okay understandable so so here's the


---------55:28----------
thing like i


---------55:30----------
so like there's a part of you that i


---------55:31----------
think you don't feel


---------55:33----------
like you're good enough yes okay


---------55:37----------
so like and it's interesting because it


---------55:39----------
pops out in weird ways and like i think


---------55:41----------
what you've managed to do


---------55:42----------
is like adapt around it which is very


---------55:45----------
good it's like what most people do


---------55:47----------
right like you learn how to compensate


---------55:49----------
for your weaknesses


---------55:50----------
it's kind of like you've got a bum leg


---------55:52----------
so you like figure out you know like


---------55:54----------
how to you know walk with a limp and


---------55:57----------
then you grab a crotch or a cane or


---------55:59----------
whatever


---------55:59----------
you do whatever you need to to like get


---------56:01----------
by


---------56:02----------
and then what i find is that like a lot


---------56:04----------
of our adaptive behaviors


---------56:06----------
over time become maladaptive


---------56:09----------
and this is where like the question like


---------56:11----------
i'm really curious about your like


---------56:13----------
romantic experiences


---------56:15----------
it's something that i'm steering a


---------56:16----------
little bit clear of


---------56:18----------
um we'll get there i'm gonna ask you


---------56:21----------
because i've mentioned it now


---------56:25----------
what are you feeling now i'm feeling


---------56:28----------
that i commonly stir away


---------56:32----------
from relationships a lot of the times i


---------56:37----------
feel


---------56:38----------
uh scared to pursue them because


---------56:42----------
of the


---------56:47----------
i feel like there's a large part of me


---------56:49----------
that considers my


---------56:51----------
friends and my friend group like my


---------56:52----------
family and so


---------56:54----------
i feel like there's a lot of even if


---------56:57----------
they don't have this


---------56:58----------
a lot of judgment that we're going to


---------57:01----------
stop you there


---------57:02----------
right so the reason i'm going to stop


---------57:03----------
you there is because it happened


---------57:06----------
so i i mentioned romantic relationships


---------57:09----------
i didn't even ask you about it and what


---------57:10----------
was your first


---------57:12----------
response what was the first thing that


---------57:14----------
came out of your mouth


---------57:16----------
i really just do not remember it was oof


---------57:20----------
yes it's because i haven't been in the


---------57:23----------
relationship in years


---------57:25----------
yes so so like that is the emotion


---------57:28----------
and the second you skirt past that and


---------57:30----------
you go


---------57:31----------
to i i start i feel scared you can own


---------57:34----------
some emotions and then you get into the


---------57:36----------
rational explanation of i think about


---------57:38----------
them as family


---------57:39----------
that too is protective but we'll get


---------57:41----------
like we'll get to romance in a second


---------57:42----------
but we've got to take a step back and


---------57:44----------
like lay out some of this foundation


---------57:46----------
so like your window of growth is going


---------57:48----------
to be the oof


---------57:50----------
and the closer we can sit with the


---------57:52----------
that's a little tough


---------57:54----------
you're damn right it is because like you


---------57:55----------
know exactly what i'm talking about you


---------57:57----------
try


---------57:57----------
really hard to get away from it


---------58:00----------
yeah i can see that yep so we're gonna


---------58:03----------
we're gonna go there together okay


---------58:05----------
but like when you're ready we're gonna


---------58:07----------
do it very very gently kitty pool first


---------58:10----------
sure okay so i don't even remember what


---------58:13----------
the kiddie pool is now but i want um


---------58:15----------
hold on


---------58:18----------
i blinked what were you talking about uh


---------58:22----------
you said you wanted for you i could only


---------58:25----------
talk or you want to talk about the oof


---------58:27----------
portion yeah yeah and you'll get into


---------58:29----------
the kiddie pool


---------58:31----------
yeah yeah you start with the kiddie pool


---------58:32----------
and then you said


---------58:34----------
yeah yeah before like that one i just


---------58:36----------
went the whole thing was a tangent so


---------58:38----------
let me just think for a second


---------58:41----------
i have a grid oh we were talking about


---------58:44----------
adaptation and maladaptation yeah right


---------58:48----------
so like i think you've learned an


---------58:50----------
adaptive way of getting around


---------58:52----------
like some like you know the feeling not


---------58:55----------
good enough oh we were talking about


---------58:57----------
relationships and you feeling frustrated


---------58:58----------
with yourself here it is okay


---------59:00----------
so here's the thing when people are not


---------59:02----------
fully secure in who they


---------59:04----------
are and when they don't feel like


---------59:06----------
they're good enough like especially from


---------59:07----------
like an appearance standpoint or like


---------59:10----------
i know this is going to sound weird i'm


---------59:11----------
just going to put a word to it which i'm


---------59:12----------
sure you'll have some resistance to


---------59:14----------
because it's not the perfect word


---------59:15----------
lovable so i think that you bring a lot


---------59:19----------
of value


---------59:20----------
to your friends and you try really


---------59:22----------
really hard


---------59:23----------
to bring value to your friends you bring


---------59:27----------
you carry responsibility for their joy


---------59:30----------
on your shoulders


---------59:31----------
you're always thinking about enriching


---------59:33----------
their experiences


---------59:35----------
and you feel frustrated with yourself


---------59:38----------
when they don't feel enough joy when


---------59:41----------
they have a bad day


---------59:42----------
you think about what you could have done


---------59:44----------
better now


---------59:46----------
above the water that's caring it's being


---------59:49----------
a good friend


---------59:51----------
underneath the water i see this kind of


---------59:54----------
dynamic


---------59:55----------
in like i don't think that you have this


---------59:57----------
but i'm just gonna use this as an


---------59:58----------
example


---------59:59----------
in like abusive relationships where you


---------60:02----------
start to really like


---------60:03----------
feel responsible for the feelings of


---------60:05----------
other people around you i really don't


---------60:06----------
think that your friends are abusive or


---------60:08----------
anything like that


---------60:09----------
and and this is where the common element


---------60:11----------
is like worth


---------60:13----------
okay the common element is like


---------60:16----------
i have to like make these people's lives


---------60:20----------
better because


---------60:22----------
i have to try so hard to make these


---------60:24----------
people's lives better


---------60:26----------
oh it's not that hard


---------60:31----------
they're my friends for a reason you know


---------60:32----------
sure sure sure


---------60:34----------
but there's a seedy underbelly here


---------60:36----------
which like i think is unfortunately like


---------60:38----------
that


---------60:39----------
you know you can't just be yourself


---------60:46----------
like what i'm noticing about your social


---------60:48----------
interactions is that they feel very


---------60:50----------
effortful to me


---------60:51----------
and this kind of gets back to this like


---------60:54----------
and just because you've gotten good at


---------60:56----------
it


---------60:56----------
scarra gets back to like your original


---------61:00----------
statement which i'm sorry buddy but you


---------61:02----------
impaled yourself on this which is like


---------61:04----------
they only see me part of the time


---------61:07----------
which tells me that like there's front


---------61:10----------
facing scarra


---------61:12----------
and there's like back end scar yeah


---------61:16----------
uh i don't think it's that different but


---------61:19----------
i do agree


---------61:22----------
sure


---------61:24----------
right so so now what we really have to


---------61:26----------
get into is like


---------61:27----------
what is back end scara right and this is


---------61:31----------
where like when we get to romantic


---------61:32----------
relationships we're gonna find


---------61:34----------
all kinds of weird things that your mind


---------61:36----------
does


---------61:38----------
to keep you from like


---------61:42----------
protect you from like all the feelings


---------61:44----------
that you have so i'm gonna give you a


---------61:45----------
hypothetical example


---------61:46----------
i do not think that this applies to you


---------61:50----------
sometimes the reason that people think


---------61:52----------
about friends as family is because


---------61:54----------
they're afraid


---------61:55----------
of if of what would happen if they have


---------61:57----------
romantic feelings towards their friends


---------62:03----------
okay right so that's just an example


---------62:07----------
okay so there are all kinds of


---------62:09----------
adaptations that our mind will do


---------62:11----------
to keep up to protect us from some of


---------62:13----------
the feelings that we may have


---------62:15----------
not that i agree with so like


---------62:20----------
questions thoughts no


---------62:23----------
nothing i think i think it's like i


---------62:26----------
understand why you bring up


---------62:28----------
the first part i agree with you with


---------62:31----------
your statement um yeah that's


---------62:36----------
i don't have many thoughts on the matter


---------62:38----------
i guess


---------62:40----------
until we approach a different topic and


---------62:43----------
i do agree i feel


---------62:45----------
that a lot of the talk right now is like


---------62:47----------
just trying to target


---------62:50----------
uh the things i've built safety


---------62:52----------
mechanisms around to dodge


---------62:58----------
oh you're not yeah sorry um yes


---------63:01----------
so i think that i i do


---------63:04----------
spend a lot of time


---------63:08----------
i guess i built the safety mechanism a


---------63:10----------
lot earlier


---------63:11----------
because uh it was there to make it so i


---------63:16----------
guess dodged uh


---------63:19----------
negative feelings or negative points


---------63:23----------
yep um and uh


---------63:26----------
rather than focus on like a lot of my


---------63:28----------
negative stuff i would just find ways to


---------63:30----------
make it productive and focus


---------63:32----------
on how to enrich my life


---------63:36----------
um i do now understand that some of it


---------63:40----------
if not a lot of it is


---------63:43----------
uh i guess uh


---------63:47----------
built in deeply to the point where it's


---------63:50----------
difficult to


---------63:52----------
shake from yep so we're gonna start that


---------63:56----------
process today so i'm going to share a


---------63:58----------
couple of things okay


---------63:59----------
and then i want you to give me a


---------64:01----------
direction okay so


---------64:03----------
the first is that we've got two options


---------64:05----------
here and this may be like a two-parter


---------64:07----------
kind of thing but like


---------64:09----------
not it doesn't have to be but i feel


---------64:11----------
like we probably


---------64:13----------
should separate out the content of what


---------64:15----------
you're protecting


---------64:17----------
from the mechanism with which you're


---------64:19----------
protecting it


---------64:22----------
okay can i take a minute to use the


---------64:25----------
restroom i


---------64:26----------
yes literally drink the whole thing okay


---------64:28----------
i'll be right back


---------64:43----------
we doing good chat we're good scar is


---------64:46----------
knocking it out of the park


---------64:49----------
oh so for the people who are saying


---------64:52----------
almost there


---------64:53----------
that means we need to back away


---------65:03----------
yeah dude he's got some he's got some


---------65:05----------
wicked he's like a dodge tank


---------65:08----------
just watch the dodge right and like it's


---------65:12----------
really hard to be a dodge tank


---------65:14----------
and like willingly like not move when


---------65:17----------
the blow is coming


---------65:20----------
it's it goes against everything that


---------65:22----------
you've trained your body to do


---------65:32----------
so that's the thing i i don't think he's


---------65:34----------
too tanky


---------65:36----------
his evasion is through the roof oh we're


---------65:39----------
just using our video game analogies yeah


---------65:41----------
my evasions through the room yeah yeah


---------65:43----------
all right what i was explaining to chad


---------65:45----------
is that you know it's hard for you to


---------65:48----------
get hit but anyway um so here's the


---------65:50----------
thing so like the mechanism so we've got


---------65:52----------
two options we can dig into


---------65:55----------
the content of what you protect yourself


---------65:58----------
against


---------65:59----------
or we can kind of focus on that


---------66:01----------
mechanism of like forcing you to sit in


---------66:03----------
that space


---------66:05----------
and like take the hit instead of


---------66:06----------
skirting past it


---------66:09----------
so let me give you just an example okay


---------66:12----------
so you say that like


---------66:14----------
when it comes to like we could talk


---------66:16----------
about the content of romantic


---------66:17----------
relationships i'm pretty sure that what


---------66:18----------
we'll uncover is that


---------66:20----------
you have these negative emotions which


---------66:21----------
like prompt you to do certain actions


---------66:23----------
and we can kind of dig into that


---------66:25----------
or we can see like the mechanism through


---------66:27----------
which your adaptations have formed


---------66:30----------
does that make sense i think the


---------66:32----------
mechanisms might be more helpful for me


---------66:34----------
i think so too i think it'll be safer as


---------66:36----------
well


---------66:37----------
yeah so like we're still go i'm going to


---------66:40----------
ask you hard-hitting questions but like


---------66:41----------
there's a


---------66:42----------
different direction that i'm going to go


---------66:44----------
so yeah ask you a hard-hitting question


---------66:46----------
i'm not gonna follow up with another


---------66:48----------
hard-hitting question


---------66:50----------
you're gonna dodge and then i'm gonna i


---------66:52----------
could follow up with another


---------66:53----------
hard-hitting question


---------66:55----------
or we can just see how you dodged and


---------66:58----------
see what you dodged away from


---------67:00----------
that's the most important thing okay


---------67:02----------
okay


---------67:03----------
so like tell me about how you feel about


---------67:07----------
romantic relationships


---------67:09----------
uh i guess really scared i think when


---------67:11----------
you're in the public eye uh


---------67:14----------
it's you read a lot of bad things


---------67:18----------
and i constantly feel like


---------67:22----------
uh either i won't be


---------67:26----------
yeah i guess i'm i'm really worried


---------67:28----------
about what another


---------67:29----------
in the what another variable would do


---------67:32----------
introduced to my life that's already in


---------67:34----------
a good position


---------67:36----------
and then there's already a lot of


---------67:37----------
variables attached to it that could have


---------67:39----------
that i'm scared of okay what


---------67:43----------
what are you scared of


---------67:51----------
chat got it


---------67:54----------
chad just saw the dodge it was really


---------67:56----------
good so we'll get there


---------67:58----------
um putting myself out there


---------68:01----------
what does that mean i don't know


---------68:05----------
let me let me think give me a sec give


---------68:07----------
me a second


---------68:19----------
maybe being afraid


---------68:28----------
i don't know okay that's okay so


---------68:32----------
we're making progress now we're swimming


---------68:34----------
in the deep dark ocean because you can't


---------68:35----------
see it


---------68:36----------
so i think this is actually a step


---------68:37----------
forward so the more that you say i don't


---------68:39----------
know


---------68:40----------
what that certainly isn't is a logical


---------68:42----------
defense mechanism


---------68:44----------
does that make sense but when i ask you


---------68:46----------
like


---------68:48----------
just think about this for a second okay


---------68:50----------
when i ask someone why are you scared of


---------68:51----------
engaging in a relationship


---------68:53----------
and they say there are lots of variables


---------68:54----------
that could affect my life like that's


---------68:56----------
the dodge of the century


---------68:58----------
sure yeah right so i'll try asking you


---------69:02----------
the question again


---------69:03----------
what are you afraid of scar


---------69:18----------
being not good enough for someone else


---------69:24----------
when i already feel like i'm not good


---------69:27----------
enough


---------69:28----------
for myself okay


---------69:31----------
so i don't know if your cognitive


---------69:34----------
empathy is so good


---------69:35----------
that you have manufactured that response


---------69:37----------
because that's what i'm looking for that


---------69:39----------
was a good one right


---------69:40----------
it was a really good show i don't know


---------69:42----------
either i'll be honest with you


---------69:44----------
no i think it was genuine i i think what


---------69:46----------
you're learning how to do is like


---------69:48----------
vocalize how you feel right and and your


---------69:51----------
logic is working for you now


---------69:54----------
instead of like protecting you


---------69:59----------
so like you can piece things together if


---------70:00----------
you're willing to swim around in that


---------70:02----------
space


---------70:03----------
i also do not think it is a coincidence


---------70:05----------
that that statement


---------70:06----------
came after you said i don't know a


---------70:09----------
couple of times


---------70:14----------
okay something can be easier as a robot


---------70:18----------
life would be easier as a robot but yeah


---------70:20----------
so you've tried very hard to be a robot


---------70:25----------
[Music]


---------70:27----------
right so so now like let's think about


---------70:30----------
that right like so like


---------70:31----------
have you been so now we're gonna go


---------70:34----------
closer to the throat


---------70:35----------
okay it's not quite the killing blow


---------70:37----------
because i'm not gonna strike all the way


---------70:38----------
but we're gonna get close


---------70:40----------
so like have you been we're not going to


---------70:43----------
mention any names


---------70:45----------
we're going to complete anonymity okay i


---------70:48----------
strongly encourage you


---------70:49----------
even if you say i'm an open book doctor


---------70:51----------
k we're not going to do that


---------70:53----------
so have you been has there been someone


---------70:54----------
that you've been romantically interested


---------70:56----------
in the last three years


---------71:03----------
maybe but i think i do a good


---------71:07----------
way of rationalizing against it makes


---------71:11----------
yep so we're gonna say the answer is yes


---------71:14----------
when i ask you the question


---------71:16----------
instead of giving me the answer i want


---------71:17----------
you to like i'm gonna ask you did you


---------71:19----------
think about a particular person


---------71:26----------
i don't know i'm going to say that the


---------71:29----------
answer is yes


---------71:32----------
i i i don't know and that's my serious


---------71:35----------
answer let me continue to continue let


---------71:38----------
me think about it


---------71:39----------
right so like i know we said we weren't


---------71:40----------
going to say it


---------71:42----------
but i need you to think it at least


---------71:45----------
you don't have to tell a damn soul i


---------71:49----------
i've certainly crushed on someone before


---------71:52----------
sure but go ahead so like


---------71:56----------
think about the last person that you


---------71:57----------
crushed on


---------71:59----------
okay and if the last three years like i


---------72:02----------
just don't


---------72:04----------
i find it very hard to believe although


---------72:06----------
i'm willing to be wrong but we're not


---------72:08----------
gonna ask you


---------72:09----------
so we can't you know that like there's


---------72:11----------
you gotta have crushed on someone in the


---------72:13----------
last three years bro


---------72:14----------
sure yeah right so like just think about


---------72:17----------
that person


---------72:19----------
okay okay so like when you think about


---------72:23----------
that person


---------72:25----------
like did you ever entertain


---------72:29----------
thoughts of being in like a relationship


---------72:32----------
with them


---------72:33----------
no yes maybe initially but immediately


---------72:37----------
no


---------72:38----------
so how to help us understand


---------72:42----------
initially what your thoughts were


---------72:48----------
it would be complicated that's


---------72:52----------
where that's when that's where they went


---------72:55----------
where did they start


---------73:04----------
i i think they started with the simple


---------73:06----------
idea that i thought that


---------73:07----------
i wasn't attractive enough


---------73:11----------
for them okay


---------73:14----------
and then it ended at the thoughts i said


---------73:17----------
prior


---------73:19----------
yep good so so that's like i think we


---------73:22----------
all know that


---------73:23----------
by now right like i think you don't have


---------73:25----------
to be


---------73:26----------
dr k to figure out that's what's


---------73:28----------
happening so now like here's the


---------73:30----------
challenge


---------73:30----------
okay and this is why i'm digging into


---------73:32----------
this scara


---------73:34----------
because i think that like i know this


---------73:37----------
sounds weird


---------73:38----------
i think you are attractive enough for


---------73:39----------
them


---------73:41----------
and i think the real sad thing is that


---------73:44----------
it is your belief


---------73:46----------
that you're not attractive enough for


---------73:47----------
them that is


---------73:49----------
actually like becoming the


---------73:50----------
self-fulfilling prophecy


---------73:52----------
of like the current romantic state that


---------73:57----------
you're in


---------73:58----------
oh that


---------74:03----------
so like this is where like i know that


---------74:05----------
your mind goes to complications and


---------74:08----------
variables


---------74:10----------
when you don't feel good enough and this


---------74:11----------
is really important to understand


---------74:13----------
the mind loves complexity


---------74:17----------
right so like let me just ask you this


---------74:19----------
is another read my mind question


---------74:21----------
so i if i'm like working with like let's


---------74:22----------
say i'm supposed to meet a partner for a


---------74:24----------
school project


---------74:26----------
and they show up an hour late and they


---------74:29----------
give me like 15 reasons why they're


---------74:32----------
late what happens when they say the


---------74:35----------
first reason


---------74:37----------
what happens to my [ __ ] meter the


---------74:39----------
more reasons they give me for why


---------74:41----------
they're right


---------74:42----------
they're late at some point i would just


---------74:44----------
assume they didn't care


---------74:45----------
absolutely and if they give me one


---------74:47----------
reason


---------74:49----------
if they just say i overslept i'm so


---------74:51----------
sorry versus


---------74:53----------
i overslept and then my dog pooped and


---------74:55----------
then this happened and then i think it's


---------74:57----------
more


---------74:57----------
truthful yes right so like the more your


---------75:00----------
mind


---------75:01----------
comes up with variables and


---------75:03----------
complications and the more variables it


---------75:05----------
adds to the


---------75:05----------
equation the more bs that your mind is


---------75:08----------
engaging in yes


---------75:10----------
with you and so like this comes back to


---------75:14----------
like


---------75:14----------
now we get to the real problem which is


---------75:20----------
oh [ __ ] i don't even know how to ask


---------75:22----------
this


---------75:26----------
i'm trying to ask this in an open-ended


---------75:28----------
quest way


---------75:30----------
but so you don't think you're good


---------75:32----------
enough


---------75:34----------
for them right uh yes


---------75:37----------
to some extent sure sure i i feel like


---------75:40----------
if i'm not good enough for myself


---------75:42----------
there's no way i want to bring that to


---------75:45----------
someone else


---------75:47----------
yeah i'm with you there okay so like


---------75:51----------
that that makes a lot of sense to me so


---------75:53----------
so and this was where we get


---------75:56----------
back to you know what do you see when


---------75:57----------
you look in the mirror and i think you


---------75:59----------
see something that's not good enough


---------76:01----------
and and so then the question becomes


---------76:03----------
like


---------76:05----------
can you act without being good enough


---------76:10----------
absolutely wait really i don't know


---------76:14----------
how you define act so like like


---------76:17----------
what so specifically i guess what i what


---------76:20----------
i mean is like


---------76:20----------
can you ask someone out if you feel like


---------76:23----------
you're not good enough for them


---------76:29----------
confidently hell though


---------76:32----------
but you can it's possible


---------76:38----------
is it though i don't mean theoretically


---------76:41----------
i mean for you


---------76:43----------
oh no okay right wait wait i thought you


---------76:47----------
meant like theoretically because like


---------76:49----------
like yeah but but like yeah i'll be sure


---------76:52----------
but that's the problem right so like


---------76:54----------
once again we see it which is like your


---------76:55----------
mind like gets to this


---------76:57----------
like when i ask you a question it's just


---------76:58----------
like because bro at some point like


---------77:00----------
you're gonna crush on someone again


---------77:02----------
right


---------77:02----------
yeah and i want you to chase love bro


---------77:07----------
right and and this is where like like


---------77:08----------
this is where like a nice


---------77:10----------
there's emotion i can see it you're


---------77:13----------
laughing yeah like what are you feeling


---------77:15----------
i think that'd be nice i i think


---------77:19----------
there's negative emotion i don't see


---------77:21----------
niceness in your face oh


---------77:23----------
um when i tell you to chase love how do


---------77:26----------
you feel


---------77:30----------
would be nice as a projection of the


---------77:32----------
logical mind


---------77:33----------
yes it would be maybe


---------77:36----------
i feel like it will happen


---------77:46----------
hmm


---------77:49----------
i i feel like i'm taking some steps to


---------77:52----------
get there


---------77:52----------
i guess yes but i don't know


---------77:56----------
like outside of this conversation yep


---------77:58----------
yep yep so that's


---------77:59----------
dangerous yes okay because you're


---------78:02----------
taking steps yes right so like now


---------78:06----------
you're waiting for preparation


---------78:09----------
you're gonna get yourself in shape


---------78:11----------
you're going to learn to be good enough


---------78:12----------
and then you will ask


---------78:14----------
someone i don't know if you're bisexual


---------78:16----------
heterosexual homosexual


---------78:18----------
pansexual whatever so like when you ask


---------78:21----------
someone


---------78:21----------
out like you're like it'll happen one


---------78:24----------
day when you're ready


---------78:29----------
i understand the danger of that good


---------78:32----------
logic what is the alternative that's


---------78:35----------
that's also very good


---------78:36----------
because what i'm hearing in that


---------78:38----------
statement is i think when i ask you like


---------78:39----------
i want you to chase love i think what


---------78:41----------
you feel is abject


---------78:42----------
terror


---------78:46----------
fear is definitely one of the emotions


---------78:47----------
that comes up what else is there


---------78:51----------
[Music]


---------78:52----------
um


---------78:58----------
maybe disbelief a little bit like


---------79:02----------
especially during covid i uh my ability


---------79:05----------
to socialize


---------79:07----------
in fact i i think a lot with a lot a lot


---------79:09----------
of other people are similar as probably


---------79:11----------
through the floor but sure i think covet


---------79:13----------
is causing lots of problems and


---------79:15----------
if i think if covid wasn't happening


---------79:17----------
your mind would find another excuse


---------79:20----------
yes absolutely i'm really good at that


---------79:24----------
yes so this is where like you will


---------79:30----------
you know like this is where like scarra


---------79:31----------
like i want you to think back to that


---------79:33----------
early phase when you were crushing on


---------79:35----------
someone and like what


---------79:36----------
got in the way


---------79:46----------
and it's so hard because like your your


---------79:49----------
evasion is through the roof so you


---------79:50----------
quickly went to all the variables


---------79:53----------
but like yeah and i'm trying to go back


---------79:56----------
so


---------79:57----------
and that's where it becomes a little


---------79:59----------
difficult uh


---------80:06----------
can you so i i don't want to mess up


---------80:09----------
your life maybe


---------80:10----------
maybe a little bit of fear rejection but


---------80:12----------
um


---------80:14----------
i guess it's like


---------80:17----------
fear of the unknown maybe okay a little


---------80:19----------
bit


---------80:21----------
yeah i think fear of rejection makes


---------80:23----------
sense but like


---------80:24----------
i know this sounds kind of weird but


---------80:26----------
like do you feel comfortable


---------80:28----------
telling us a story about someone that


---------80:31----------
you were attracted to or crushing on


---------80:34----------
because i think this is where like if


---------80:36----------
you tell us the story we'll be able to


---------80:38----------
discover the emotion


---------80:39----------
because i you don't have to look for it


---------80:42----------
because i think it's hard for you to see


---------80:44----------
i but you may not feel comfortable and i


---------80:47----------
certainly don't want to complicate your


---------80:49----------
life if you have to like if people are


---------80:50----------
going to try to stitch together the


---------80:52----------
pieces because


---------80:53----------
i think yeah is very important here i


---------80:55----------
think


---------80:56----------
this is not something that i would say


---------80:58----------
on this show because


---------81:00----------
i don't want any kind of weird rumors


---------81:04----------
spreading or any of that it's just not


---------81:06----------
fun


---------81:07----------
yep i'm with you 100 so i i'm just


---------81:11----------
now i have to try to problem solve for


---------81:13----------
like how are we gonna access the emotion


---------81:15----------
because if you tell us the story the


---------81:16----------
emotion is gonna be there


---------81:18----------
can we go further back can we pick


---------81:20----------
someone that like


---------81:22----------
you maybe had a similar response to that


---------81:24----------
is like


---------81:25----------
older than three years like five years


---------81:27----------
seven years


---------81:28----------
that like is there any example you can


---------81:30----------
give us that will be drama free


---------81:36----------
ooh if you can't that's fine too


---------81:40----------
i don't i can't remember like that's the


---------81:42----------
thing sure sure


---------81:43----------
like i don't know if it's repressed


---------81:45----------
memory but just in general it's


---------81:47----------
difficult


---------81:48----------
okay no no no it's i know it's difficult


---------81:52----------
that's that's why like


---------81:53----------
so sometimes when people are having


---------81:54----------
trouble with memory and accessing


---------81:56----------
emotions


---------81:57----------
oftentimes they can tell a story right


---------82:00----------
so like


---------82:00----------
like you can tell a story like you


---------82:02----------
talked about you know for example like


---------82:03----------
traveling all over the world and things


---------82:05----------
like that


---------82:06----------
and then we can dig at the emotion


---------82:07----------
underneath if we can get you talking


---------82:10----------
now it's just a problem because i don't


---------82:12----------
know like i think this is


---------82:14----------
like this self-esteem not being able to


---------82:17----------
like risk


---------82:18----------
you know giving giving a shot at love is


---------82:21----------
like


---------82:22----------
i mean this we gotta fix from you're


---------82:24----------
gonna fix something it's like you gotta


---------82:26----------
you gotta like


---------82:28----------
try to love you know you gotta you gotta


---------82:31----------
take that chance and i think the problem


---------82:34----------
is that you don't wanna take the chance


---------82:36----------
because you don't even think it's a


---------82:37----------
chance you think it's


---------82:38----------
a mess


---------82:43----------
yeah i would agree with most of that


---------82:47----------
statement


---------82:50----------
so what what are we gonna do about it


---------82:52----------
scarra


---------82:53----------
i am trying to


---------82:57----------
figure it out which is why i'm


---------83:01----------
uh out loud for us think out loud


---------83:05----------
okay well currently i'm trying to


---------83:07----------
remember


---------83:10----------
if


---------83:18----------
huh


---------83:21----------
i'm trying to remember ways that don't


---------83:23----------
sound like deflection


---------83:25----------
and just feel it


---------83:28----------
apart don't worry squirrel yeah as much


---------83:32----------
as you want to just there's there's just


---------83:34----------
a bunch of


---------83:35----------
random things why i feel


---------83:39----------
good can you share them with us


---------83:42----------
um i think a lot of


---------83:46----------
the based on what i do every day


---------83:49----------
as well as the contract i signed


---------83:54----------
that i don't have it's it's


---------83:57----------
difficult to balance i guess


---------84:01----------
uh working on my relationships with my


---------84:04----------
friends


---------84:05----------
as well as working on a relationship


---------84:09----------
with myself and then with someone else


---------84:12----------
that's always sense to me yeah i agree


---------84:15----------
with you in the fact


---------84:16----------
that i'm definitely i definitely put


---------84:18----------
like


---------84:19----------
romance aside for stuff and something


---------84:21----------
i've been very frank about


---------84:22----------
with people it's like yes i did do that


---------84:24----------
to pursue like


---------84:27----------
a career like i definitely put like


---------84:29----------
first yeah


---------84:30----------
um and


---------84:33----------
the a lot of scary parts about being


---------84:36----------
like


---------84:36----------
especially kind of an older uh


---------84:40----------
person uh in this


---------84:44----------
base i would say because i a lot of my


---------84:47----------
peers are


---------84:48----------
uh in their 20s still


---------84:52----------
so i think that


---------84:56----------
a lot of the times when


---------84:59----------
i i feel like it's difficult to be it's


---------85:02----------
impossible to meet someone if you don't


---------85:04----------
put yourself out there


---------85:05----------
and


---------85:08----------
i can't it's i'm definitely not putting


---------85:12----------
myself out there by streaming every day


---------85:15----------
except for maybe to like fans that


---------85:17----------
message me and tell me they're


---------85:19----------
they're like 20 and i immediately


---------85:23----------
like blocked them or don't [ __ ]


---------85:25----------
interact with them because that's


---------85:26----------
[ __ ] weird


---------85:27----------
um what's weird yeah


---------85:30----------
i think the age gap is crazy and i think


---------85:32----------
the power dynamic is crazy


---------85:34----------
and i would not want to be in that


---------85:37----------
hole where i've seen a lot of other


---------85:40----------
people get absolutely


---------85:44----------
destroyed uh it's not something i want


---------85:47----------
for myself


---------85:48----------
not something i want for any of my peers


---------85:52----------
sure


---------85:54----------
you mentioned your age a couple of times


---------85:56----------
do you mind if i ask how old you are


---------85:58----------
oh i'm uh 31. i almost had to think for


---------86:02----------
a sec


---------86:02----------
because i'm either 30 or 31 i can never


---------86:05----------
remember


---------86:06----------
i think


---------86:13----------
yeah that doesn't make any sense but


---------86:14----------
yeah uh you don't think it makes sense


---------86:17----------
i i think it's just a random [ __ ]


---------86:19----------
role uh


---------86:21----------
let me i i think it makes as much sense


---------86:24----------
as anything else


---------86:25----------
yeah sure um it's just like i've never


---------86:28----------
heard the origin of it i've


---------86:30----------
people have just always said it to me


---------86:32----------
and i'm just like


---------86:33----------
okay what is half my age plus seven you


---------86:36----------
round up


---------86:38----------
what does that even [ __ ] mean okay so


---------86:40----------
so it's


---------86:41----------
23 for you which sounds like a little


---------86:43----------
bit young i feel like it's like 24


---------86:46----------
yeah but like sure yeah is the minimum


---------86:50----------
um hmm so i'm hearing a lot of what


---------86:54----------
you're saying scar so i'm going to


---------86:55----------
change tax


---------86:57----------
for a minute so like now we're going to


---------86:59----------
be


---------87:00----------
instead of smashing through your defense


---------87:02----------
mechanisms and being logical i'm gonna


---------87:04----------
be like


---------87:04----------
emotionally supportive okay okay i'm


---------87:07----------
gonna be on your team now


---------87:09----------
instead of the aggressor oh nice okay


---------87:12----------
so we'll see where that gets us so be


---------87:14----------
prepared for the shift


---------87:16----------
okay so what i'm hearing you say is that


---------87:18----------
like


---------87:19----------
you know there are a lot of we're going


---------87:21----------
to do a little bit of what we call


---------87:22----------
motivational interviewing


---------87:24----------
okay i've never heard this before okay


---------87:26----------
i'm ready


---------87:27----------
so this is a it's a clinical technique


---------87:29----------
this is not therapy by the way so you


---------87:30----------
can do it with other people you know it


---------87:32----------
doesn't have to be a part of like a


---------87:33----------
medical


---------87:33----------
oh nice actually i can't wait to pull


---------87:35----------
this out but


---------87:36----------
um essentially what we're going to try


---------87:38----------
to do is like help you


---------87:39----------
move one step closer to being able to


---------87:42----------
like


---------87:43----------
ask someone out okay okay


---------87:47----------
so in the way so here's how here's how


---------87:49----------
it goes so like here's what i'm hearing


---------87:51----------
from you first of all


---------87:52----------
um there are a lot of things that are


---------87:54----------
important to you right now like so i


---------87:55----------
think your career is important to you


---------87:57----------
your friendships are important to you


---------87:58----------
and working on yourself is important to


---------88:00----------
you yes absolutely


---------88:02----------
and what i'm also hearing is that like


---------88:05----------
when it comes to romantic relationships


---------88:07----------
like


---------88:09----------
i'm almost getting the sense that you're


---------88:11----------
following the advice


---------88:12----------
that most people give to people who are


---------88:15----------
lonely


---------88:15----------
which is work on yourself and it'll


---------88:17----------
happen


---------88:19----------
that does seem


---------88:22----------
at least parallel sure yeah how do you


---------88:25----------
feel about that that's okay


---------88:28----------
like i don't mind paralleling advice


---------88:32----------
i i always am hesitant to take advice


---------88:35----------
fully


---------88:36----------
but like i i mean


---------88:39----------
i think i'm pretty i think i'm pretty


---------88:46----------
i i always tend to take the approach


---------88:49----------
where you


---------88:50----------
it's better huh well [ __ ] i can't even


---------88:54----------
say this because that's not what i'm


---------88:55----------
doing


---------88:56----------
right now um so i was gonna say


---------88:59----------
it's better to try and fail because at


---------89:02----------
least you know it didn't work


---------89:04----------
which i do for some other parts of my


---------89:06----------
career


---------89:07----------
but maybe not for my romantic life


---------89:15----------
i'm confused are you now thinking about


---------89:17----------
trying and failing


---------89:19----------
um no it's more like i don't do that so


---------89:22----------
that's why i'm saying that like


---------89:23----------
i do that with a lot of other parts of


---------89:25----------
myself


---------89:26----------
so like stuff like making otv stuff like


---------89:30----------
you know a lot of my early career path


---------89:33----------
when it came toward


---------89:34----------
playing professionally dropping college


---------89:37----------
stuff like that but like it i don't


---------89:39----------
follow


---------89:40----------
that philosophy i guess when it comes to


---------89:42----------
romance well i mean it sounds like it's


---------89:44----------
a bad idea when it comes to romance and


---------89:46----------
it's a good idea when it comes to other


---------89:47----------
philosophies


---------89:48----------
like other parts um i do think the


---------89:51----------
general idea is still good which is like


---------89:53----------
putting yourself out there is good


---------89:55----------
and like that's what like we've come


---------89:57----------
kind of come to agreements that


---------89:59----------
i'm not doing well yeah but i mean i


---------90:02----------
think you've got good reasons to not do


---------90:03----------
it we just


---------90:04----------
said those right like


---------90:07----------
i mean you can't do everything at once


---------90:09----------
yes


---------90:10----------
but i feel like i are you the rational


---------90:12----------
part of me now


---------90:13----------
like i feel like now you're my defense


---------90:16----------
mechanism because what you just said is


---------90:18----------
stuff that i would say to myself


---------90:20----------
so i'm wondering like are there just two


---------90:24----------
and as i become as i become the rational


---------90:26----------
part of you what do you become


---------90:29----------
um worried


---------90:34----------
oh worried


---------90:37----------
um yeah i i mean you did say you're


---------90:40----------
switching


---------90:42----------
but i i am


---------90:45----------
now worried because i have to now take


---------90:47----------
your position


---------90:48----------
you were just in yes so now we've kind


---------90:51----------
of flip-flopped


---------90:53----------
so huh


---------90:57----------
and that's motivational interviewing ah


---------91:00----------
excellent right because here you are i


---------91:03----------
that


---------91:04----------
happened way faster than i expected it


---------91:05----------
to but well done


---------91:07----------
and you saw through it and i sort of


---------91:08----------
because it's interesting right because


---------91:09----------
like


---------91:10----------
here i am taking your side and then


---------91:12----------
suddenly you're talking about oh like


---------91:14----------
i do this in other parts of my life but


---------91:16----------
i don't do this in romance


---------91:19----------
and if i said that to you what would you


---------91:21----------
have said


---------91:24----------
why you have asked me why


---------91:27----------
no if if i said to you oh scara


---------91:30----------
you you are willing to fail in terms of


---------91:33----------
career and friendships but you're not


---------91:35----------
willing to fail in terms of romance


---------91:37----------
what would your response have been


---------91:42----------
a bunch of reasons i already gave


---------91:44----------
exactly


---------91:45----------
you would have dodged and now


---------91:48----------
you're feeling weird because i think


---------91:51----------
like


---------91:52----------
you're beginning to like gain insight


---------91:55----------
into the fact that you're not doing the


---------91:57----------
right thing


---------92:06----------
and now i've stopped being you and i've


---------92:08----------
started being me again and here comes


---------92:10----------
the resistance


---------92:14----------
so let's say yeah sorry is this when you


---------92:18----------
say statements like you're not doing the


---------92:19----------
right thing


---------92:20----------
i kind of take that as like a attack on


---------92:23----------
my personal whole


---------92:24----------
as opposed to just an attack on what


---------92:26----------
we're talking about


---------92:27----------
so i had to wait a second to kind of


---------92:31----------
disjoint the two um


---------92:34----------
and now i'm okay whereas like


---------92:37----------
have you felt personally attacked by me


---------92:39----------
before during this conversation


---------92:42----------
um


---------92:46----------
i feel like everything we've talked


---------92:47----------
about has been very personal


---------92:49----------
have you felt personally attacked by me


---------92:51----------
before in this conversation


---------92:56----------
attack is a strong word no okay


---------93:00----------
so like i know this is kind of weird but


---------93:02----------
you just felt attacked by me


---------93:04----------
right a little bit yeah


---------93:07----------
yeah so how like so now let's look at it


---------93:10----------
logically okay so this is this is a


---------93:12----------
great example of motivational


---------93:13----------
interviewing


---------93:14----------
i mean in terms of how people feel and i


---------93:16----------
think your insight


---------93:18----------
actually scarra is like really really


---------93:20----------
helpful because it's i couldn't explain


---------93:21----------
this


---------93:23----------
so like you said we're gonna just use


---------93:25----------
your statements okay


---------93:27----------
everything we've talked about is


---------93:28----------
personal now


---------93:30----------
you feel like you haven't been attacked


---------93:32----------
why do you feel like you're being


---------93:33----------
attacked


---------93:34----------
now and i think it's because


---------93:37----------
yeah go ahead you seem like you have a


---------93:39----------
hypothesis no


---------93:41----------
continue so as i take your


---------93:44----------
side as i become you


---------93:48----------
you become me and as you become me


---------93:51----------
the emotions and the vulnerability


---------93:53----------
increases


---------93:54----------
you begin to see how you're not actually


---------93:57----------
taking a chance


---------93:58----------
you begin to like feel that


---------94:00----------
vulnerability and once the vulnerability


---------94:02----------
arises


---------94:03----------
the same [ __ ] that i've been saying this


---------94:05----------
entire time


---------94:06----------
feels like an attack but why does it


---------94:08----------
feel like an attack because your


---------94:10----------
defenses are down


---------94:14----------
and you even saw it happen you were like


---------94:16----------
wait you're being me


---------94:18----------
now i'm your defense i'm holding your


---------94:21----------
shield


---------94:21----------
and so you're left without one and then


---------94:25----------
like a benign statement that i make


---------94:27----------
makes you feel attacked


---------94:31----------
yes yes somewhat yes


---------94:35----------
okay so like if you want if we could


---------94:38----------
just do it again


---------94:39----------
and see what happens like even if you


---------94:41----------
have insight it's not gonna change


---------94:43----------
so this is what happens when you work


---------94:44----------
with people empathically


---------94:46----------
awareness of the thing doesn't stop it


---------94:48----------
from happening


---------94:51----------
absolutely right so like where do you


---------94:54----------
want to go from here because now i'm


---------94:55----------
confused because i was expecting the mi


---------94:57----------
stuff to take way longer


---------94:59----------
for you to start to feel these things i


---------95:01----------
got that


---------95:02----------
i got a big brain scarra


---------95:07----------
i don't know i think that uh


---------95:12----------
when you talk to me about saying


---------95:16----------
when i at the point that i felt attacked


---------95:19----------
was when you told me um


---------95:24----------
that it was like a holistic statement


---------95:26----------
about


---------95:28----------
that everything i'm doing is wrong or


---------95:30----------
something like that


---------95:32----------
um when you were specifically targeting


---------95:35----------
like i guess we were talking about the


---------95:37----------
romance side and i immediately thought


---------95:40----------
for a second that you're talking about


---------95:42----------
me as a whole


---------95:44----------
so like i felt defensive there


---------95:47----------
because i'm at least confident enough to


---------95:50----------
be like


---------95:50----------
i got my i got my [ __ ] unlocked like i i


---------95:52----------
think some of it


---------95:54----------
i'm doing really well sure so


---------95:57----------
let me just take a step back and


---------95:58----------
apologize if i you know


---------96:00----------
if i made a statement that was an attack


---------96:03----------
on you as well oh no


---------96:04----------
i was actually thinking i was speaking


---------96:05----------
hypothetically i wasn't even talk i was


---------96:07----------
like


---------96:08----------
trying to mirror what i thought you


---------96:09----------
would think but anyway


---------96:11----------
so let's just try this one more time


---------96:13----------
okay


---------96:15----------
so what i'm hearing from you is that


---------96:17----------
like basically you kind of don't have


---------96:18----------
the bandwidth for a relationship right


---------96:20----------
now


---------96:23----------
possibly help me understand the possibly


---------96:26----------
because it sounds like it you know you


---------96:28----------
really are working on a lot of like


---------96:30----------
really important things


---------96:37----------
it's


---------96:48----------
i think on some empathetic level


---------96:52----------
when i look toward what i do with my


---------96:55----------
friends


---------96:56----------
and that sometimes i fail


---------97:01----------
i wouldn't want to bring someone i


---------97:04----------
wouldn't want to


---------97:05----------
date someone where


---------97:09----------
that could happen but maybe that's just


---------97:13----------
fear in general of the situation


---------97:17----------
sure i mean i i but i see where you're


---------97:19----------
coming from right so like


---------97:21----------
what i let me know if i i'm hearing you


---------97:23----------
correctly


---------97:24----------
so like here you are and and sometimes


---------97:27----------
your friends


---------97:28----------
like you have interactions with people


---------97:29----------
that you care about


---------97:31----------
where you end up like not being able to


---------97:34----------
give them the experience


---------97:35----------
that you really want them to have or


---------97:37----------
maybe they deserve to have


---------97:39----------
yeah i mean that's just when it comes to


---------97:40----------
games but yes yeah i mean like like you


---------97:43----------
want to care about your friends right


---------97:44----------
like you want to enrich their lives


---------97:45----------
let's put it out sure


---------97:47----------
yes and and it sounds like it sounds


---------97:49----------
kind of like premature to me to engage


---------97:52----------
in a romantic relationship if you're not


---------97:54----------
able to consistently do that


---------97:55----------
because what if you are not able to


---------97:57----------
enrich their lives


---------97:59----------
it's not my job to do that


---------98:05----------
but i i now i'm confused scar because i


---------98:08----------
thought that like


---------98:09----------
that that's that's how i feel but i


---------98:13----------
logically understand my job isn't the


---------98:16----------
fix all problem


---------98:18----------
does that make sense yeah sort of but


---------98:21----------
like i'm


---------98:21----------
now i'm confused okay no because like


---------98:25----------
yep and this is the point of


---------98:26----------
motivational interviewing oh my


---------98:28----------
[ __ ] god right so now what we're


---------98:32----------
doing is we're breaking down


---------98:33----------
all of your logical conceptions which


---------98:35----------
are no longer holding


---------98:37----------
so now you're in the question mark zone


---------98:40----------
sure


---------98:41----------
and like if we think about motivating


---------98:44----------
you to date i could give you a


---------98:46----------
thousand reasons and you would swat them


---------98:48----------
all down because you're in the no zone


---------98:50----------
and as we move from the no zone to the


---------98:52----------
yes zone what do we have to pass in the


---------98:54----------
middle


---------98:57----------
hell you're damn right which is the


---------99:00----------
question mark zone


---------99:01----------
because now you don't know


---------99:05----------
maybe you should ask someone out


---------99:10----------
because hold on a second it's not your


---------99:12----------
job to make them happy


---------99:15----------
correct but when i ask you why you don't


---------99:18----------
ask someone out you're like well when it


---------99:19----------
comes to my like


---------99:20----------
friendly relationships like i'm not able


---------99:23----------
to consistently like make them feel good


---------99:25----------
and create like positive experiences


---------99:30----------
that does sound like a weird excuse not


---------99:32----------
you mentioned that


---------99:34----------
no bro it's not a weird excuse like it


---------99:36----------
makes sense


---------99:38----------
like just like like we're training up


---------99:40----------
you're leveling your relationship skills


---------99:43----------
before you start dating someone


---------99:45----------
how is that not make sense


---------99:50----------
i think


---------99:57----------
that is just a very mechanical way of


---------99:59----------
thinking about things


---------100:00----------
i usually don't like


---------100:04----------
i when i do logic i logic stuff


---------100:07----------
robotically


---------100:08----------
but i don't actually think


---------100:12----------
completely in that regard


---------100:15----------
so help me understand how like what's


---------100:17----------
wrong with thinking logically about this


---------100:20----------
absolutely nothing but i think that it's


---------100:23----------
untrue to my own self to say that i


---------100:27----------
only think logically like that all the


---------100:29----------
time


---------100:30----------
when i present ideas to people i find it


---------100:33----------
easiest to present them


---------100:34----------
entirely logically but when i act upon


---------100:37----------
things


---------100:38----------
very rarely is it fully logical i guess


---------100:41----------
and that's something i want to make


---------100:43----------
clear because it feels like that's


---------100:45----------
maybe a little bit of a misconception


---------100:47----------
and i i completely understand why i'm


---------100:49----------
the reason that misconception exists


---------100:52----------
because of the way i i speak and the way


---------100:54----------
i communicate


---------100:55----------
can you help me understand because like


---------100:57----------
honestly bro it makes a lot of sense to


---------100:59----------
me like here's what i'm hearing


---------101:02----------
i think it makes a lot of sense but i


---------101:03----------
don't do it so like


---------101:05----------
so i don't want to come out as


---------101:06----------
disingenuous how do you


---------101:09----------
so then just please explain it like what


---------101:11----------
what about


---------101:12----------
so i'm gonna say it again okay and then


---------101:14----------
i i'd really appreciate it if you could


---------101:16----------
help me understand like what i'm missing


---------101:19----------
okay so you're working on


---------101:22----------
leveling up your relationship skill sure


---------101:25----------
before you engage in a romantic


---------101:27----------
relationship like that needs to be like


---------101:30----------
you know platinum tear oh god


---------101:33----------
let's let's let's go higher than that we


---------101:35----------
set the bar pretty low but yeah sure


---------101:38----------
okay right which


---------101:41----------
little bit of insight right there um


---------101:44----------
but but like what's wrong with like what


---------101:47----------
am i missing there because that makes


---------101:48----------
sense right like if i want to


---------101:50----------
if i want to like you know


---------101:53----------
i guess i just don't like my life being


---------101:56----------
talked about so robotically


---------101:58----------
because i i think that like i don't want


---------102:00----------
to take away


---------102:01----------
from this to be like man that guy is


---------102:03----------
really logical with everything like


---------102:05----------
like i think that like when i put myself


---------102:08----------
out that way like that


---------102:09----------
is how i i present myself and it's a


---------102:12----------
little bit


---------102:14----------
disingenuous because it's not completely


---------102:17----------
me


---------102:18----------
it's like a good example of this i don't


---------102:19----------
know how to do this um


---------102:21----------
it's like i may logically think about a


---------102:23----------
lot of scenarios and how it plays out


---------102:25----------
right but rather brian


---------102:29----------
is that my phone oh


---------102:32----------
no that's lily's phone god damn um okay


---------102:35----------
um


---------102:36----------
i think a way i can describe it


---------102:40----------
is


---------102:45----------
can i ask a question yeah


---------102:48----------
so just help us understand like i don't


---------102:50----------
think you're an all logical dude


---------102:52----------
yeah can you just fill in the


---------102:54----------
non-logical part of this


---------103:02----------
i think i logic my way up until i can


---------103:04----------
set up a framework


---------103:06----------
okay and then i just fill out the


---------103:08----------
framework


---------103:12----------
if that makes sense so i guess a good


---------103:14----------
example would be how i prepared my last


---------103:16----------
show


---------103:17----------
would be like i did


---------103:21----------
when i was doing the run of show and


---------103:23----------
breaking down the show


---------103:25----------
like the night before i it was like


---------103:28----------
all improv slash like random [ __ ] in the


---------103:31----------
middle


---------103:32----------
like i didn't fully write down like how


---------103:34----------
we're gonna do everything because i was


---------103:36----------
like [ __ ] it we could just wing this


---------103:38----------
but like uh when i present stuff i don't


---------103:41----------
present it like that i present like oh


---------103:43----------
we calculate all these we did the


---------103:44----------
[ __ ] metrics and the numbers


---------103:46----------
i converted this and i ran it through


---------103:48----------
the pythagorean theorem


---------103:50----------
i think people think that i may have


---------103:53----------
misconstrued


---------103:54----------
myself by presenting myself that way


---------103:59----------
so now it seems to me like you're


---------104:01----------
concerned about being perceived a


---------104:02----------
particular way


---------104:04----------
yes a little bit about a little bit for


---------104:08----------
the people watching


---------104:08----------
but a little bit to you because i just


---------104:10----------
don't want to come across as


---------104:11----------
disingenuous or


---------104:12----------
i don't i feel like if we're going to


---------104:14----------
try to like


---------104:16----------
talk about me i want you to know that


---------104:18----------
like that's not like


---------104:20----------
like i just want that to put that out


---------104:22----------
there okay


---------104:24----------
so how do i signal to you that i don't


---------104:26----------
think you're disingenuous


---------104:28----------
and i don't think you're a robot oh


---------104:30----------
that's fine no we're good you can keep


---------104:31----------
going


---------104:33----------
okay


---------104:36----------
i think while i was in the middle of


---------104:38----------
talking about that i was like [ __ ] it


---------104:40----------
you probably know what i mean


---------104:41----------
so like i kind of already figured it out


---------104:43----------
myself so you can keep going


---------104:45----------
okay god prank you i'm sorry


---------104:48----------
no no that's fine i think there's


---------104:50----------
something important there but we're not


---------104:52----------
going to dig into that right now


---------104:55----------
but anyway so so i'm i'm just noticing


---------104:58----------
like we could take a third stab at


---------104:59----------
motivational interviewing if you want to


---------105:01----------
but like i'm kind of


---------105:03----------
concerned a little bit about how taxed


---------105:05----------
we may be what do you think scara


---------105:07----------
i'm okay but i want to let you know that


---------105:09----------
like i have probably like


---------105:11----------
18 minutes unfortunately because i have


---------105:14----------
to go to a shoot


---------105:16----------
so i don't think that's unfortunate at


---------105:18----------
all


---------105:19----------
i think that we're given well it's


---------105:21----------
unfortunate for me


---------105:22----------
because i feel like i'd like to talk to


---------105:24----------
you more but like


---------105:25----------
uh i understand the like yeah yeah


---------105:29----------
so so if you've got a shoot i'm i'm i i


---------105:31----------
think that we've covered a lot of ground


---------105:33----------
and i also find that talking for like


---------105:36----------
longer than two hours at a stretch


---------105:38----------
tends to have people rewriting the early


---------105:41----------
part


---------105:42----------
i could see that so in my experience two


---------105:45----------
hours tends to be the limit


---------105:46----------
of like productive insight before you


---------105:49----------
start like it's like your ram capacity


---------105:52----------
and then you've got to like ride it to


---------105:53----------
the hard disk


---------105:55----------
and then you can kind of revisit so i'm


---------105:58----------
kind of curious if you've got about 18


---------106:00----------
minutes 17 minutes left


---------106:02----------
can you share with us what your


---------106:06----------
what this conversation has been like for


---------106:09----------
you and maybe like


---------106:10----------
if you've gained something what you've


---------106:12----------
gained


---------106:13----------
oh it's been nice i tend to not be able


---------106:17----------
to talk to many people who are


---------106:20----------
as ex who have your particular set of


---------106:23----------
skills i i feel like


---------106:27----------
you almost have to train to be


---------106:32----------
the level communicator at like that


---------106:34----------
you've hit


---------106:35----------
the level of communication that you've


---------106:37----------
hit like you hit like


---------106:38----------
like up here like we're talking like the


---------106:41----------
top


---------106:42----------
right um and i don't really


---------106:46----------
interact with many people that have hit


---------106:48----------
that level


---------106:49----------
especially to the point


---------106:52----------
where they can communicate to me like


---------106:54----------
this


---------106:56----------
i also think that like uh for me


---------107:00----------
uh i guess it brought


---------107:04----------
more stuff forward that i


---------107:08----------
i didn't realize i was deflecting that


---------107:09----------
hard i didn't know before going in that


---------107:12----------
i do that


---------107:13----------
but rather than saying deflecting it's


---------107:15----------
just something that like


---------107:16----------
i just put to this side because i


---------107:18----------
consider it


---------107:19----------
unproductive to focus on the negatives


---------107:22----------
and that's why


---------107:23----------
my life has never been to focus on what


---------107:25----------
i've achieved but always look toward the


---------107:27----------
present and the future


---------107:28----------
which comes at i would say


---------107:31----------
i'm i'm now learning somewhat of an


---------107:34----------
expense to myself


---------107:36----------
but i think any strategy you take is


---------107:38----------
going to come at an expense


---------107:39----------
i think that the one that i took


---------107:43----------
is like just very readily apparent here


---------107:48----------
um i


---------107:51----------
yeah um aside from that


---------107:57----------
i think


---------108:02----------
it's been fairly enlightening it's like


---------108:04----------
i'm talking to


---------108:06----------
usually when i come to these conclusions


---------108:08----------
like maybe i would have achieved this


---------108:10----------
level of clarity or this conclusion like


---------108:14----------
months from now or even years from now


---------108:16----------
uh it's usually with a conversation


---------108:18----------
for with another person like such as


---------108:20----------
yourself or i've marinated on the idea a


---------108:22----------
lot


---------108:23----------
and i've really just like got myself to


---------108:26----------
a point where


---------108:27----------
what the hell is going on um and so it's


---------108:30----------
nice that i'm able to


---------108:32----------
uh see this before earlier rather than


---------108:36----------
later


---------108:36----------
later yeah can you help me understand um


---------108:40----------
what has been enlightening about the


---------108:44----------
conversation


---------108:48----------
it's like peering into a door


---------108:52----------
that you knew


---------108:56----------
you thought you knew what was inside but


---------108:59----------
it's a little bit different than what


---------109:01----------
you originally thought like you thought


---------109:03----------
i thought that like


---------109:05----------
uh it was maybe like uh the door had


---------109:11----------
a house inside but i'm slowly starting


---------109:14----------
to realize


---------109:15----------
that the house uh it's a full damn


---------109:18----------
mansion


---------109:19----------
you know um and bigger than you expected


---------109:23----------
yeah a little bigger than i expected and


---------109:25----------
i know


---------109:26----------
i thought i knew that i locked away


---------109:28----------
behind the door


---------109:30----------
but it's a little bit more than i


---------109:32----------
originally thought


---------109:34----------
okay um so i i appreciate the


---------109:37----------
you know the the high praise in terms of


---------109:40----------
my communication skill and stuff like


---------109:42----------
that like i i think it's


---------109:44----------
um thank you very much for saying that


---------109:47----------
i don't think i would


---------109:51----------
i mean you're one of the people that


---------109:53----------
when i


---------109:57----------
i used to have this high school teacher


---------109:59----------
that would use


---------110:01----------
big words but wouldn't make me feel


---------110:03----------
small about my intelligence level


---------110:06----------
and i think she was one of the most


---------110:09----------
brilliant people i had


---------110:10----------
ever known uh she went on to do like i


---------110:13----------
want to do really good things but she


---------110:14----------
was one of my favorite teachers ever


---------110:15----------
and you remind me a lot about her in the


---------110:18----------
sense that i think


---------110:20----------
you obviously have a mastery of


---------110:22----------
vocabulary and education that your


---------110:24----------
guests do not


---------110:24----------
or i do not but you're able to kind of


---------110:28----------
talk to them in a way that doesn't make


---------110:30----------
them feel


---------110:32----------
that it doesn't feel like you're


---------110:33----------
flaunting it over them but rather you're


---------110:36----------
trying to meet them at a level where


---------110:38----------
they are understanding like


---------110:42----------
the only goal of the conversation is for


---------110:44----------
them to be


---------110:47----------
involved i should say


---------110:54----------
i need a moment to think about how i'm


---------110:56----------
going to respond to this


---------111:02----------
oh so here's my response how the [ __ ]


---------111:06----------
scarra do you think that you would not


---------111:08----------
offer something amazing in a romantic


---------111:10----------
relationship


---------111:12----------
where the [ __ ] is that


---------111:16----------
you know when you're friends because i


---------111:17----------
had heard about you


---------111:19----------
before this and i'd heard all of these


---------111:23----------
wonderful things from people who i


---------111:25----------
understand


---------111:25----------
that they are they hide me up alive yeah


---------111:29----------
boy do you have something juicy to offer


---------111:36----------
and now we get to the question of like


---------111:38----------
which one's the real you


---------111:41----------
because i think now it's my turn you're


---------111:43----------
ready


---------111:44----------
yeah okay so this is this is where you


---------111:47----------
say


---------111:48----------
like oh i may have trained a lot but i


---------111:50----------
think i think we're


---------111:51----------
in the in the same weight class when it


---------111:53----------
comes to expressing authentic


---------111:55----------
appreciation about other human beings


---------111:59----------
so here's here's what i'd say okay


---------112:02----------
to begin with you mentioned that you


---------112:04----------
know you may have gotten here on your


---------112:06----------
own if you had marinated about it


---------112:08----------
yes and i'd say that part of the reason


---------112:10----------
that this conversation has come


---------112:12----------
so far is sure i'm good at what i do


---------112:16----------
but ultimately like it depends on you


---------112:19----------
too i think the reason this conversation


---------112:21----------
came so far is because you have been


---------112:23----------
doing a lot of marinating


---------112:26----------
you are the first person all i do is


---------112:28----------
that


---------112:29----------
and i think that shows and i think it


---------112:31----------
has a lot of value


---------112:32----------
and i think that like despite whatever


---------112:34----------
education you have or don't have


---------112:37----------
you're a thinker and you're like a


---------112:39----------
critical thinker and we talked about


---------112:41----------
your intelligence as a defense mechanism


---------112:43----------
but make no mistake that it is actually


---------112:45----------
like a very powerful tool too


---------112:48----------
you're the first person that i've ever


---------112:49----------
talked to that so quickly realizes what


---------112:51----------
i'm doing to them


---------112:53----------
so even when i tell people like what i'm


---------112:55----------
gonna do to them they usually don't get


---------112:57----------
it


---------112:58----------
like it it works on them and then we


---------113:00----------
have to sit down but like you noticed


---------113:02----------
right away that like i was becoming you


---------113:04----------
and it still had its effect


---------113:08----------
and i think that like part of the reason


---------113:10----------
that you have difficulty


---------113:11----------
like i think that you're a very genuine


---------113:14----------
person i think you


---------113:15----------
bring a lot to the table i know that


---------113:18----------
there are parts that go all the way down


---------113:21----------
to the core of your being that


---------113:22----------
understand that


---------113:24----------
i think you have walked this journey of


---------113:26----------
like self-esteem and confidence and


---------113:28----------
getting to know yourself


---------113:29----------
to where you genuinely know that you


---------113:33----------
have something amazing to offer other


---------113:35----------
human beings


---------113:38----------
yes okay so


---------113:42----------
i was waiting for the resistance there


---------113:43----------
but we'll just keep go we'll just keep


---------113:46----------
going i have


---------113:47----------
confidence in parts of myself my


---------113:50----------
my self-worth is yeah yeah it's it's


---------113:52----------
it's


---------113:53----------
right so now we get to the what i'd like


---------113:55----------
to really encourage you to think about


---------113:57----------
right which is that there are parts of


---------114:00----------
yourself i just think that honestly like


---------114:03----------
it's a straight-up cognitive bias


---------114:06----------
where like like if something weird


---------114:08----------
happens in your mind where when you


---------114:09----------
start to think about romantic


---------114:11----------
relationships or not


---------114:12----------
not necessarily romantic relationships i


---------114:14----------
think it's just like


---------114:15----------
deep relationships that you care about


---------114:17----------
which don't have to be romantic


---------114:19----------
that something gets in the way of


---------114:22----------
recognizing


---------114:24----------
the value that you bring and it's not


---------114:26----------
necessarily that you don't even it maybe


---------114:28----------
recognizes the right word


---------114:30----------
it's that the value that you bring


---------114:32----------
actually this is a better word


---------114:33----------
gets contaminated by this other thing


---------114:36----------
gets contaminated by what you


---------114:40----------
think of that instinctive it's not even


---------114:42----------
what you think of the instinctive


---------114:43----------
reaction when you look at yourself in


---------114:45----------
the mirror


---------114:46----------
and then you think like i have to work


---------114:48----------
on this and all that stuff


---------114:50----------
is true and this is where we kind of get


---------114:51----------
to your adaptation like i think that


---------114:53----------
you're right


---------114:54----------
that you know you kind of said that


---------114:55----------
everyone has to grow and like everyone


---------114:58----------
has to like


---------114:58----------
adapt and that comes at a cost which is


---------115:01----------
beautifully said


---------115:02----------
damn scar you're so insightful like


---------115:04----------
people that therapists will train for


---------115:06----------
years to recognize this it took me years


---------115:08----------
to recognize


---------115:10----------
what you sort of put together in in two


---------115:12----------
hours


---------115:15----------
sit with the praise don't deflect it


---------115:25----------
awkward hard i know sit with it you take


---------115:27----------
it


---------115:28----------
[Applause]


---------115:30----------
okay now we keep going i'm not done with


---------115:33----------
you yet


---------115:34----------
i told you we're in we're in the same


---------115:36----------
weight class


---------115:38----------
so i'm you know you can authentically


---------115:41----------
praise me i'm gonna do the same to you


---------115:43----------
i'm gonna keep going here's the chaos


---------115:45----------
but but i i think i think really scar


---------115:47----------
like


---------115:48----------
you know there's some contaminant


---------115:49----------
there's something that gets in the way


---------115:51----------
of recognizing that and i i really think


---------115:53----------
that like


---------115:54----------
are you overweight probably i can't


---------115:56----------
really tell because i haven't seen you


---------115:57----------
stand up but like if you're overweight


---------115:59----------
like sure you can work on that


---------116:00----------
and this is the other thing just because


---------116:01----------
you're overweight doesn't mean that


---------116:03----------
you're


---------116:03----------
unlovable which i know logically you


---------116:06----------
understand


---------116:07----------
right i have a lot


---------116:10----------
of beautiful friends and so


---------116:14----------
they i i feel like living in l.a warps


---------116:17----------
my


---------116:17----------
sense of uh like


---------116:21----------
uh i guess self-image quite a bit


---------116:25----------
sure and something that i definitely


---------116:27----------
know happens


---------116:28----------
yep so so that's that's very logical


---------116:30----------
very neuroscientific very


---------116:32----------
psychological and at the same time this


---------116:34----------
is if there's


---------116:35----------
one thing that i would ask you to do


---------116:38----------
it's to catch yourself before you dodge


---------116:41----------
going forward to notice that the next


---------116:44----------
time you're crushing on someone


---------116:46----------
or yeah


---------116:49----------
the next time you're crushing on someone


---------116:52----------
catch yourself


---------116:53----------
and look for that contaminant look for


---------116:56----------
like the way that you wriggle


---------116:58----------
out of like not wanting to try right and


---------117:01----------
it's okay like you


---------117:02----------
you don't have to try but at least see


---------117:08----------
it


---------117:11----------
yeah i think it's a lot easier to


---------117:13----------
recognize when it gets pointed out


---------117:15----------
yep that's our goal so i definitely


---------117:18----------
think that that's my biggest takeaway


---------117:20----------
yep good that's what i would leave with


---------117:22----------
you because you don't have to fix this


---------117:23----------
overnight i'm not saying go out


---------117:25----------
and ask this person that you've been


---------117:27----------
crushing on for years


---------117:28----------
ask him out i'm not saying do that


---------117:32----------
next the next time it happens


---------117:36----------
catch yourself notice what your


---------117:40----------
adaptations are


---------117:41----------
going to do and you're right that like


---------117:43----------
you can you can only grow in one


---------117:44----------
dimension at a given time


---------117:46----------
and it's like one of these rpgs where


---------117:48----------
like in order to get like you know if


---------117:50----------
you want a min max you have to take


---------117:52----------
negative traits


---------117:53----------
and so that's what we do right as you


---------117:56----------
grow


---------117:56----------
as you become a league of legends


---------117:58----------
professional as you like you know


---------117:59----------
like do all this stuff with otv as you


---------118:02----------
value yourself and you start to put


---------118:03----------
others first like


---------118:05----------
all that kind of stuff comes at a price


---------118:07----------
and this is where like i think the next


---------118:09----------
phase of your growing is to like


---------118:12----------
you know undo some of that stuff


---------118:15----------
and start to i i know you're all for


---------118:18----------
working on yourself and that you could


---------118:19----------
be better


---------118:21----------
but like i think what you've really got


---------118:22----------
to work on is that you don't


---------118:24----------
need to be good enough to be in a


---------118:27----------
relationship


---------118:31----------
i think i logically understood that


---------118:33----------
already


---------118:34----------
but yep means you saying it does


---------118:38----------
have an impact so catch yourself because


---------118:41----------
you're not gonna that's not what you're


---------118:43----------
gonna say to yourself


---------118:45----------
the next time the opportunity for a


---------118:47----------
relationship presents itself


---------118:49----------
you're going to say to yourself that i


---------118:50----------
need to be better i need to do this i'm


---------118:52----------
not ready yet it's not ready it's not


---------118:54----------
the time there are too many variables


---------118:55----------
notice all those different things


---------119:00----------
and then maybe act another way but you


---------119:03----------
don't have to


---------119:04----------
just notice it


---------119:08----------
and then you can also say to yourself


---------119:10----------
i'm not ready yet


---------119:12----------
which is totally fine


---------119:20----------
thank you you're welcome can i give you


---------119:23----------
this one


---------119:24----------
yeah go ahead yeah one final bit of


---------119:27----------
homework because i


---------119:28----------
i know you've got to homework okay


---------119:31----------
i'm gonna give you a meditation exercise


---------119:33----------
worried about okay yeah what do you got


---------119:35----------
i'm not gonna let you slip away i see


---------119:37----------
you slipping away okay okay okay


---------119:39----------
so i i think we already talked about it


---------119:41----------
you guys can do this at home


---------119:43----------
look in the mirror and notice what you


---------119:46----------
see


---------119:47----------
notice what comes up when you look in


---------119:50----------
the mirror and just walk just look


---------119:53----------
don't judge don't change just


---------119:57----------
notice what your mind and what your


---------120:00----------
heart


---------120:00----------
produces when you look in the mirror


---------120:08----------
okay okay


---------120:12----------
your turn last words yours scaropog


---------120:18----------
i said my last words before so i just


---------120:20----------
think you might


---------120:21----------
say them again thank you i


---------120:25----------
find that it's really nice


---------120:28----------
to talk to people


---------120:32----------
and in covid it's been difficult to talk


---------120:34----------
to new people


---------120:36----------
so this has been a very enjoyable


---------120:40----------
i don't know how this is very sounding


---------120:43----------
very like


---------120:44----------
professional it's been really nice


---------120:47----------
i think


---------120:51----------
i don't know how to phrase it any better


---------120:54----------
than i have before


---------120:56----------
that's fine but i yeah i think that when


---------120:58----------
someone helps you


---------121:00----------
understand themselves better


---------121:07----------
in a way that isn't out of a destructive


---------121:10----------
act


---------121:12----------
um it's hard to give


---------121:17----------
especially in such a constructive way


---------121:19----------
it's hard to give better praise


---------121:24----------
yeah i i i think it's coming i think


---------121:26----------
what you mean to convey


---------121:28----------
i am feeling and and maybe the remainder


---------121:32----------
of it can be conveyed through a hug if


---------121:34----------
we ever meet in real life


---------121:36----------
yeah maybe you know maybe at the 2020


---------121:41----------
22 twitch con whenever it comes back


---------121:44----------
rain check range okay


---------121:49----------
take care and good luck on your show or


---------121:51----------
