hey friends dr k here a lot of people


---------00:02----------
who watch our content


---------00:03----------
are looking to find their dharma or life


---------00:05----------
purpose


---------00:06----------
it's a real challenge because a lot of


---------00:08----------
times mental health problems like


---------00:09----------
depression and anxiety


---------00:11----------
are actually symptoms of lacking a good


---------00:13----------
meaning or a good purpose in life


---------00:16----------
this is something that people work on a


---------00:17----------
lot in group coaching to find their


---------00:19----------
dharma or to find their life purpose


---------00:21----------
if you're interested in that we still


---------00:23----------
have spots open it's 24


---------00:25----------
a session and sign up with the link in


---------00:27----------
the description below


---------00:30----------
hi dr k i'm a university student and i'm


---------00:32----------
doing well


---------00:33----------
good for you i wrote an academic


---------00:35----------
textbook wow


---------00:36----------
published scientific papers presented in


---------00:39----------
symposiums


---------00:40----------
doing well in my studies etc but i


---------00:42----------
recently got into an mba


---------00:44----------
and started focusing on other things


---------00:45----------
that are more into the nba studies


---------00:48----------
and stuff and i don't think i enjoy this


---------00:50----------
i have some amazing mentors in my


---------00:52----------
department as well they know me well and


---------00:54----------
they have helped me much


---------00:55----------
i'm always doing my best to make them


---------00:57----------
proud and not just them of course my


---------00:59----------
family as well


---------01:00----------
i do my best and work hard and that


---------01:02----------
pride they have for me brings me


---------01:03----------
happiness i'd say


---------01:05----------
by the way none of them is strict or


---------01:06----------
anything like that they're all super


---------01:07----------
chill


---------01:08----------
thanks for including that detail but


---------01:10----------
someone's been paying attention


---------01:12----------
to how we would interpret that earlier


---------01:14----------
sentence


---------01:15----------
so they've see this is fantastic like so


---------01:17----------
they're they're starting to understand


---------01:18----------
like


---------01:18----------
oh maybe you know maybe your parents are


---------01:20----------
hard on you but


---------01:21----------
i believe that recently i've been doing


---------01:23----------
some things that don't make me happy at


---------01:24----------
all and


---------01:25----------
increase my suffering making me want to


---------01:27----------
just stop and give up


---------01:29----------
one of these things is the mba which i


---------01:31----------
dislike greatly


---------01:32----------
instead i like to do other stuff with


---------01:34----------
the knowledge that i have like start


---------01:35----------
something online to help people and add


---------01:37----------
value to them


---------01:38----------
i'm just doing all these things to make


---------01:40----------
people proud try to show them


---------01:42----------
that i like this do my best for them but


---------01:45----------
not for me


---------01:47----------
i'm not sure if this is the main problem


---------01:49----------
if there's something behind that


---------01:50----------
or how i should think this through and


---------01:52----------
of course i don't feel like talking to


---------01:54----------
my mentors about this i just don't want


---------01:55----------
them to think that i'm not good enough


---------01:57----------
for their mentoring


---------01:59----------
it's just that it's a bit confusing in


---------02:01----------
my mind even while writing this to be


---------02:02----------
honest i'm not sure if you'll


---------02:04----------
answer or even see this but i guess i


---------02:06----------
can take my chances by posting


---------02:08----------
this here good job and taking a chance


---------02:10----------
and it's just that i'm trying to find


---------02:11----------
answers on what i should do next thanks


---------02:13----------
for your time


---------02:14----------
lots of respect for what you do and for


---------02:16----------
your community great


---------02:17----------
ps sorry for the long message okay so


---------02:19----------
this is a this is a very good um


---------02:22----------
great question okay so let's kind of go


---------02:24----------
through some of the components so


---------02:25----------
sometimes


---------02:26----------
we're like productive right like so


---------02:27----------
we're good so this person published an


---------02:29----------
academic textbook was like you know


---------02:31----------
presenting in symposiums


---------02:32----------
seems like they were having fun and then


---------02:34----------
they ended up


---------02:36----------
like you know getting an mba or getting


---------02:38----------
into an mba program and so they find


---------02:40----------
themselves in the mba program and


---------02:41----------
they're like i'm not really enjoying


---------02:42----------
this very much


---------02:44----------
not quite sure what to do i have a lot


---------02:45----------
of mentors my family supports me i enjoy


---------02:47----------
making them proud but sometimes i want


---------02:49----------
to give up i'm kind of confused about


---------02:51----------
what i want to do


---------02:52----------
so i guess this is a common question of


---------02:54----------
like you know sometimes like we'll do


---------02:56----------
well in undergrad


---------02:58----------
and we're like really doing a good job


---------03:00----------
and we're happy with ourselves we're


---------03:01----------
making people happy


---------03:02----------
and then we will enter graduate school


---------03:04----------
and things seem a little bit different


---------03:06----------
there


---------03:06----------
and so what's going on there sometimes


---------03:08----------
we feel like dropping out of graduate


---------03:09----------
school should we or should we not


---------03:12----------
it's a great question so let's kind of


---------03:14----------
unpack things one step at a time


---------03:16----------
so the first thing is that there are a


---------03:18----------
couple of


---------03:19----------
a couple of ways to look at it the first


---------03:21----------
is that you know what is it that you


---------03:22----------
dislike


---------03:23----------
so mba is masters in business business


---------03:26----------
administration


---------03:27----------
um so


---------03:30----------
the first question is like you know


---------03:34----------
but i believe that recently i've been


---------03:36----------
doing some things that don't make me


---------03:37----------
happy at all and increase my suffering


---------03:39----------
so then the question is like what is


---------03:41----------
that right so what is it that you


---------03:43----------
dislike about your program and


---------03:46----------
things that are making you unhappy so i


---------03:48----------
think that that's an important question


---------03:50----------
to ask


---------03:50----------
this person also has like some confusing


---------03:52----------
feelings like they say


---------03:54----------
um i'm not sure if this is the main


---------03:56----------
problem or if there's something behind


---------03:58----------
that


---------03:58----------
and of course i don't feel like talking


---------04:00----------
to my mentors about this i just don't


---------04:01----------
want them to think that i'm


---------04:03----------
not good enough for their mentoring and


---------04:05----------
the person even says that they're not


---------04:06----------
even like


---------04:07----------
people like that they wouldn't judge me


---------04:08----------
that way but i i feel that way


---------04:10----------
so i think there are a couple of


---------04:11----------
different things to dig into first is is


---------04:13----------
you know why


---------04:14----------
you don't want to talk to your mentors


---------04:16----------
like what is that feeling that's keeping


---------04:18----------
you from reaching out to them


---------04:20----------
second thing is like what is it that you


---------04:22----------
dislike about getting the mba


---------04:24----------
you know why was it sounds like you were


---------04:26----------
having fun earlier and you're not having


---------04:27----------
fun now


---------04:28----------
and as far as what to so i think some


---------04:31----------
amount of self-reflection and


---------04:32----------
exploration is


---------04:33----------
definitely a good idea you can certainly


---------04:35----------
talk to your mentors you can certainly


---------04:36----------
talk to your family members


---------04:38----------
you can also try you know talking to


---------04:39----------
coach or therapist all that good stuff


---------04:42----------
but i think that there are a couple of


---------04:43----------
important things to consider here the


---------04:44----------
first is that


---------04:46----------
you know how much of you making people


---------04:48----------
proud


---------04:49----------
drives what you do


---------04:52----------
and the second thing is even if it is a


---------04:54----------
big driver that's okay


---------04:56----------
if you don't enjoy being in the mba


---------04:58----------
program if it's not fun for you i'd say


---------05:00----------
the other thing so this is where things


---------05:02----------
change a little bit for like high


---------05:03----------
potential folks


---------05:04----------
so i'm gonna pull a little bit from like


---------05:06----------
other dimensions of stuff here okay


---------05:08----------
so generally speaking at healthy game


---------05:10----------
where we talk about you know trying to


---------05:11----------
find fulfillment and being productive


---------05:13----------
and being happy


---------05:15----------
oddly enough for this person we're not


---------05:17----------
going to talk about that i'd say if


---------05:18----------
you're suffering


---------05:19----------
okay so this is where what you need to


---------05:22----------
really think about doing is


---------05:23----------
reconceptualizing the mba like why did


---------05:25----------
you get it in the first place was it to


---------05:27----------
make people happy was it because it was


---------05:28----------
a good idea


---------05:29----------
because this person says that they want


---------05:31----------
to like help people and they want to


---------05:32----------
make the world a better place


---------05:33----------
so then the other way to view your


---------05:35----------
situation is like not how to find


---------05:37----------
happiness forget about happiness for a


---------05:39----------
second i know it sounds weird


---------05:40----------
but think about what your goals are what


---------05:43----------
you want to be in the world


---------05:44----------
and whether an mba will help you with


---------05:47----------
that


---------05:47----------
and even if you dislike it like do you


---------05:50----------
need to do it


---------05:52----------
so when we talk with our hypos it's kind


---------05:54----------
of bizarre because like what we really


---------05:55----------
do is change the


---------05:56----------
the the frame a little bit and this is


---------05:59----------
where like there are


---------06:00----------
times in my life where i didn't enjoy


---------06:02----------
being on 24-hour calls


---------06:04----------
but this is where dharma comes in


---------06:06----------
because remember that dharma is what


---------06:08----------
allows you to


---------06:09----------
sacrifice happiness and tolerate


---------06:11----------
suffering for like and still find peace


---------06:14----------
so what i would say to this person is


---------06:15----------
are the skills that you're


---------06:17----------
in like developing in the mba


---------06:20----------
are those going to be important things


---------06:22----------
for you to accomplish what you want to


---------06:24----------
in life


---------06:25----------
and if the answer to that question is


---------06:26----------
yes like maybe you need to stay in it


---------06:28----------
even if you're suffering


---------06:30----------
right like this is where you need to


---------06:31----------
take a step back and really think a


---------06:33----------
little bit about what you want to


---------06:34----------
accomplish


---------06:35----------
do you want to drop out and just like


---------06:37----------
start to help random people like


---------06:39----------
you can try to do that i mean it's not


---------06:41----------
you know that's one option


---------06:43----------
but it sounds like you've done a lot of


---------06:45----------
like academic work and you're trying to


---------06:47----------
expand


---------06:48----------
you know your skill set and you may not


---------06:50----------
enjoy it so it's not so much about


---------06:52----------
enjoyment for a lot of hypos it's not


---------06:54----------
about enjoyment it's about


---------06:55----------
worth value is it worth it for you to


---------06:58----------
spend generally speaking mba programs or


---------07:00----------
two years


---------07:02----------
is it worth it for you to suffer for two


---------07:05----------
years be in this scenario you know


---------07:07----------
for the sake of acquiring particular


---------07:09----------
skills to


---------07:10----------
equip you for the next phase down the


---------07:12----------
road


---------07:14----------
that's what i'd really encourage this


---------07:16----------
person to do right so understand a


---------07:18----------
little bit about why you got the mba in


---------07:19----------
the first place


---------07:20----------
understand a little bit about what you


---------07:22----------
dislike about it understand


---------07:24----------
why you're reluctant to talk to your


---------07:25----------
mentors i'd say definitely overcome that


---------07:27----------
and also talk to your mentors


---------07:29----------
because as someone who you know has


---------07:31----------
mentored medical students and


---------07:33----------
and psychology students and stuff like


---------07:35----------
that is very common for people in


---------07:37----------
graduate school to feel like they really


---------07:39----------
don't want to be there anymore


---------07:41----------
and that's where like one of the most


---------07:42----------
important things you can do if you're in


---------07:44----------
graduate school and you don't like being


---------07:45----------
there is reaching out for support


---------07:47----------
and seeing if there are people who can


---------07:49----------
be like hey man i felt the same way


---------07:51----------
you'd be surprised what your mentors may


---------07:52----------
say you know it's kind of like it's


---------07:54----------
tricky


---------07:57----------
so reach out to them and then ultimately


---------07:59----------
ask yourself


---------08:00----------
is it worth it right why did you get


---------08:02----------
into this and even if it sucks while


---------08:04----------
you're doing it is it worth it


---------08:05----------
i mean no one enjoys being on 24-hour


---------08:08----------
calls and like i still remember


---------08:09----------
you know i used to spend like weekends


---------08:11----------
like moonlighting at a hospital because


---------08:13----------
we were starting healthy gamer and we


---------08:14----------
needed a little bit of extra money and


---------08:16----------
you know i'd like kids to support and my


---------08:18----------
wife was getting an mba and like so it


---------08:20----------
was like okay so


---------08:22----------
this is like it sucks to spend you know


---------08:24----------
i'd work one week and then i'd like


---------08:25----------
spend the weekend working


---------08:27----------
a 48-hour shift at a hospital and then


---------08:30----------
like


---------08:31----------
i'd get like a half day sunday to kind


---------08:33----------
of rest and then my kids haven't seen me


---------08:35----------
so i get home after 48 hours in the


---------08:37----------
hospital i'm feeding him breakfast and


---------08:38----------
stuff and like


---------08:39----------
then like you sleep for a little while


---------08:42----------
and then monday morning rolls around


---------08:43----------
it's like another week of work


---------08:45----------
gg weekend and the question is is it


---------08:48----------
worth it right like that's the big


---------08:52----------
question


---------08:53----------
so if you guys are struggling with


---------08:54----------
something if something is is causing you


---------08:56----------
suffering you have to ask yourself like


---------08:58----------
is this a sacrifice that is worth it for


---------09:00----------
me to make


---------09:02----------
and if the answer is yes then like by


---------09:03----------
all means make the sacrifice and if the


---------09:05----------
answer is no


---------09:06----------
then try to go chase after happiness
