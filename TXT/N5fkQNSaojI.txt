---------00:00----------
who hurt you so bad that there is no way


---------00:04----------
to apologize for what they did there's


---------00:06----------
no way to fix that hurt where did you


---------00:11----------
learn in the core of your being that


---------00:12----------
there are some wounds that will never be


---------00:15----------
healed


---------00:28----------
so sky tell me a little bit about first


---------00:30----------
of all thank you for coming on and so


---------00:34----------
tell me a little bit about what we're


---------00:35----------
talking about today and how twitch at


---------00:38----------
and I can help you if anything what are


---------00:41----------
you talking about today


---------00:43----------
well I honestly don't even really know


---------00:48----------
because I you know I I guess depression


---------00:51----------
sucks right like everybody kind of feels


---------00:54----------
that and anxiety is terrible sure um


---------00:57----------
there isn't anything really like


---------00:59----------
specific I guess I wouldn't really even


---------01:02----------
know what to target okay fine


---------01:04----------
um is it okay so we exchanged a couple


---------01:07----------
of DMS with you and and is it okay if I


---------01:10----------
share some of those because I think that


---------01:11----------
may give us a direction yeah okay yes


---------01:13----------
you kind of said like hey like I have


---------01:16----------
maybe some depression or anxiety but but


---------01:18----------
I even feel like the problems are like


---------01:20----------
unfixable there's something about this


---------01:22----------
that like that's impossible to be fixed


---------01:23----------
right and I think a lot of people feel


---------01:28----------
that way so if it's okay with you can we


---------01:30----------
just start there sure what do you think


---------01:33----------
is unfixable yeah go for it sorry oh


---------01:35----------
yeah also like yeah I'm a completely


---------01:39----------
open book so I won't struggle to talk


---------01:40----------
about any topic okay thank you for that


---------01:42----------
man just like you know


---------01:45----------
[Music]


---------01:47----------
I guess like I just feel that at this


---------01:52----------
point in my life that I've corrupted so


---------01:54----------
many people in my like close friend


---------01:56----------
group or my friend group in general that


---------01:59----------
the habits that I've picked up to


---------02:02----------
survive are so toxic that I don't know


---------02:05----------
if they could be like edged out of my


---------02:08----------
mind and it makes me feel like I just I


---------02:12----------
guess I'm just gonna be trashed now like


---------02:13----------
you know yeah you made it hard yes so if


---------02:18----------
it's okay with you that's what we're


---------02:19----------
gonna talk about okay because that


---------02:21----------
sounds that sounds you know way more


---------02:24----------
real than depression and anxiety right


---------02:28----------
so somewhere along the way like you've


---------02:30----------
realized that you have some kind of


---------02:31----------
toxic patterns and that they're so


---------02:34----------
ingrained they're so they're X so deeply


---------02:38----------
within you that you're [ __ ] you're Sol


---------02:40----------
yeah I am so I I actually think that I


---------02:45----------
think I might be one of the most toxic


---------02:48----------
people on earth I'm not even kidding


---------02:50----------
okay it's bad why why do you think that


---------02:53----------
can we talk about that is that okay sure


---------02:56----------
yeah yeah um well I I don't I don't


---------03:05----------
naturally like have empathy I'm not


---------03:09----------
really good at that sure and what does


---------03:13----------
that mean not being good at empathy like


---------03:17----------
I just don't like I whenever whenever I


---------03:24----------
need something from anyone no matter


---------03:27----------
what it is it's like my mind goes into


---------03:29----------
this mode where it's just like let me


---------03:31----------
get something from someone and then like


---------03:33----------
will save them later will help later but


---------03:36----------
I don't even know if I even believe that


---------03:37----------
and then I get what I need and then I'm


---------03:41----------
fine but then the aftermath is me just


---------03:43----------
feeling shitty about it later but I


---------03:45----------
don't know it's weird


---------03:45----------
well um why do you feel shitty about it


---------03:49----------
well normally I don't feel guilt for


---------03:52----------
many things not too many things like I


---------03:54----------
you know obviously I'm a person that


---------03:56----------
doesn't really live with regrets if I do


---------03:57----------
something bad it's like in that moment


---------03:59----------
that I did that being bad


---------04:00----------
it is what I wanted to do so it's hard


---------04:03----------
for me to regret it because it was like


---------04:05----------
well that was my choice that I made


---------04:06----------
there but I feel bad about it because


---------04:08----------
like all these people that they just


---------04:12----------
want to help me and then I take their


---------04:15----------
help and I just I just I just piss it


---------04:19----------
away and then I'm back in the same


---------04:22----------
problems over and over and over again


---------04:24----------
and that's why I feel like I'm


---------04:26----------
corrupting people like these people are


---------04:28----------
giving me their hearts and their minds


---------04:30----------
and sometimes their wallets and they


---------04:32----------
just there's there's no return they're


---------04:35----------
just trusting something happens and then


---------04:37----------
nothing happens how do you know that


---------04:39----------
nothing okay how do you know that


---------04:41----------
nothing happens I look at my youtube


---------04:45----------
channel and I I see like like devoid of


---------04:51----------
content and what's worse is that when I


---------04:54----------
do make content it's either half-ass or


---------04:56----------
it's me crying about something or it's


---------04:59----------
like a like a sponsored video and I'm


---------05:03----------
not really creating the thing that put


---------05:06----------
me on the platform in the first place


---------05:07----------
and then you know I'm in the same


---------05:09----------
situations because I'm not actually


---------05:11----------
making the proper changes in my life I'm


---------05:14----------
just taking what they give me just to


---------05:17----------
feel comfortable for even another week


---------05:19----------
it's not good okay sky I think um okay


---------05:26----------
I'm just gonna think for a second okay


---------05:28----------
that's fine yeah okay so let me


---------05:34----------
ask you this so you say that you're you


---------05:36----------
don't you're not empathic right so a lot


---------05:40----------
of things you just tossed out a lot and


---------05:42----------
I thank you for being an open book


---------05:43----------
because there are some things to me that


---------05:45----------
I can't put the puzzle pieces together


---------05:47----------
and I'd like your help with that


---------05:49----------
so you say that you're not empathic but


---------05:51----------
at the same time it seems very clear to


---------05:52----------
me that you feel like you're corrupting


---------05:55----------
people and you wouldn't feel that way


---------05:59----------
and like you feel like you're kind of


---------06:01----------
letting people down


---------06:03----------
Yeah right I mean big-time really like


---------06:06----------
yeah but but if you were truly not


---------06:09----------
empathic then you wouldn't have the


---------06:11----------
feeling of like disappointing people


---------06:13----------
that's that's true however I'm confused


---------06:17----------
in in myself because I don't know if I


---------06:20----------
actually care about that or rather I


---------06:23----------
know that I'm can get cancelled no I


---------06:25----------
think you care about that America


---------06:27----------
because it's so so here here's the


---------06:29----------
conflict okay so one is you take from


---------06:32----------
others and you don't live up to


---------06:34----------
expectations they invest in you and you


---------06:37----------
let them down right and then you have


---------06:40----------
some feeling because you talked about


---------06:42----------
feeling guilty but then like 30 or 60


---------06:45----------
seconds later you said I don't regret my


---------06:47----------
decisions because I acknowledge that


---------06:50----------
that's what I want in the moment and


---------06:51----------
that's what I needed I made the choice


---------06:53----------
that I made I'm gonna own up to my


---------06:55----------
choice and I don't regret it and I think


---------06:58----------
when when I put my head in the mindset


---------07:00----------
of someone like that I can imagine that


---------07:03----------
you feel like that is a lack of empathy


---------07:08----------
yes right I I would think so yeah so I


---------07:14----------
think that is actually something that


---------07:16----------
you do to protect yourself from the vast


---------07:21----------
amount of empathy that you have


---------07:25----------
damn yeah I mean I'm listening right so


---------07:28----------
let's just let's just let's go through


---------07:30----------
the daisy chain okay like we're gonna


---------07:31----------
connect the dots so dot number one is


---------07:34----------
that people are investing many people


---------07:37----------
care about me people do things for me I


---------07:39----------
ask them for things and they give me


---------07:41----------
things right that's not number one dot


---------07:45----------
number two is I feel like I'm letting


---------07:47----------
them down I feel guilty I feel like


---------07:49----------
they're giving me all this stuff and I'm


---------07:50----------
quote-unquote pissing it away okay


---------07:54----------
you


---------07:57----------
what are you feeling I'm about to get


---------07:59----------
bodied what does that mean it means


---------08:06----------
you're good and I'm pretty sure that I'm


---------08:10----------
already thinking about things a little


---------08:11----------
different so I just know that


---------08:13----------
i-i playfully think of everything in my


---------08:17----------
life as a contest it's really harmless


---------08:21----------
like if I get full from a burger I'll be


---------08:24----------
like damn that burger just bodied me or


---------08:26----------
I just got you know I got beat by the


---------08:27----------
burger right so it's like it seems in


---------08:30----------
this discussion you're gonna open me up


---------08:32----------
to a lot of things that I believe are


---------08:34----------
healthy and good which are things that I


---------08:36----------
haven't considered so in my head


---------08:37----------
playfully I'm just like I'm about to get


---------08:39----------
absolutely like my mind bout to get [ __ ]


---------08:41----------
on which is good it's a good thing I


---------08:42----------
really need to be taken down a lot of


---------08:44----------
notches and I don't think that's your


---------08:46----------
goal the same that I think that hearing


---------08:49----------
know accepting another no no you don't


---------08:51----------
need to be taken down a lot of notches


---------08:53----------
you need to be pumped up a lot of


---------08:54----------
notches ah that's okay we're gonna get


---------08:58----------
to this okay we're gonna get to it okay


---------09:00----------
okay so you take from other people you


---------09:04----------
feel guilty for taking because you piss


---------09:07----------
away what they give you and then that


---------09:10----------
hurts


---------09:12----------
right yes yeah does it


---------09:18----------
yeah yeah does I mean especially with


---------09:21----------
like some of the people being really


---------09:23----------
important to me if they'd like yeah yeah


---------09:27----------
yeah so if it hurts that means you're


---------09:30----------
empathic actually all right yeah so so


---------09:37----------
then comes the protection so this is


---------09:40----------
where you get the idea that you're not


---------09:41----------
empathic because then your mind tries to


---------09:43----------
protect you it steps in and says you


---------09:45----------
know what this hurts so I don't regret


---------09:48----------
my decisions because if I don't regret


---------09:50----------
my decisions that I don't have to feel


---------09:51----------
hurt


---------09:53----------
like they're a bunch of suckers like


---------09:54----------
they know I don't deliver


---------09:57----------
and they give anyway and so like that's


---------10:02----------
on them like I make my choices I live by


---------10:04----------
it I'm transparent with them they know


---------10:06----------
what they're getting themselves into is


---------10:10----------
that what you tell yourself I don't I


---------10:13----------
don't think that they're I don't think


---------10:15----------
that they're suckers I think in the


---------10:16----------
moment that I take their help I really


---------10:18----------
do believe that I can make a change and


---------10:21----------
make a difference but then the feeling


---------10:26----------
fades like before I go to bed and then


---------10:28----------
it's just the same cycle of okay it's


---------10:32----------
not channeling so so apologies if I over


---------10:34----------
spoke there maybe not that the doctors


---------10:35----------
well but that you know there's a certain


---------10:39----------
amount of like if you tell yourself that


---------10:42----------
you don't regret your decisions then


---------10:45----------
like if you if you do away with regret


---------10:48----------
like guilt goes with it


---------10:50----------
does that make sense yes so like when


---------10:54----------
you tell yourself that then it's like ah


---------10:55----------
I don't have to feel guilty because like


---------10:57----------
this is just who I am and then and then


---------11:00----------
like that I mean I I think you're


---------11:01----------
actually deeply empathic and I think


---------11:03----------
you're very worried about what you're


---------11:05----------
doing to people because you use the word


---------11:07----------
corrupt


---------11:08----------
like you feel like you're like that's


---------11:10----------
not a sociopath doesn't think that


---------11:13----------
they're corrupting anyone they just


---------11:15----------
don't give a [ __ ] right


---------11:19----------
like you're concerned of you're


---------11:20----------
concerned about what you're doing to


---------11:22----------
people


---------11:24----------
yes


---------11:26----------
[Music]


---------11:28----------
I am definitely concerned


---------11:33----------
[Music]


---------11:35----------
yeah I mean I guess that just I just I'm


---------11:37----------
thinking about this a lot so take your


---------11:39----------
time never really I think the only the


---------11:47----------
only reason why I keep I was like


---------11:50----------
diagnosed with antisocial disorder when


---------11:52----------
I was 15 and so ever since then I've


---------11:56----------
kind of had this ideas like okay well


---------11:58----------
I'm defective so and many of the things


---------12:02----------
I think about are just like not normal


---------12:05----------
I can definitely level with you on the


---------12:07----------
empathy thing and I do care but I don't


---------12:12----------
know my mind is just kind of okay that's


---------12:14----------
okay we're here sky so we're gonna work


---------12:16----------
through that okay you need a minute no


---------12:20----------
no I'm good okay so so I think that I


---------12:25----------
can understand why someone would have


---------12:27----------
diagnosed you they wouldn't have


---------12:28----------
diagnosed you with antisocial


---------12:29----------
personality disorder would've been


---------12:30----------
conduct disorder if you're 15 but I


---------12:32----------
think that there's a part of you that


---------12:34----------
feels like you take advantage of people


---------12:37----------
and that you manipulate people oh I mean


---------12:40----------
I know it yeah so so I think that's


---------12:44----------
that's what people think of that makes


---------12:48----------
you kind of antisocial or like


---------12:49----------
sociopathic because you take advantage


---------12:51----------
of other people and then you have the


---------12:53----------
best of intentions and you wake up the


---------12:54----------
next day and you don't honor your thing


---------12:56----------
so that's kind of like where the


---------12:57----------
antisocial kind of stuff comes okay yeah


---------13:00----------
I have the best of intentions for what


---------13:02----------
I'm preserving like what that's that it


---------13:07----------
means that like like I've been the


---------13:13----------
lifestyle I live is what requires all


---------13:16----------
this help which is a lifestyle of using


---------13:20----------
what now little money I have to support


---------13:23----------
all of my best friends living with me


---------13:25----------
and so it's like I've done that ever


---------13:27----------
since the beginning of YouTube even a


---------13:29----------
little before I worked like three jobs


---------13:30----------
because I don't actually spend a lot of


---------13:33----------
money on myself so I figured that you


---------13:36----------
know when YouTube first started for me


---------13:37----------
and I was making a decent amount of


---------13:40----------
money besides giving it to my mom I was


---------13:43----------
like oh let's get a place like you guys


---------13:44----------
are my friends and I don't want to live


---------13:45----------
with strangers and this is fun


---------13:47----------
um but then of course like when you just


---------13:51----------
baby them and you give them a bunch of


---------13:53----------
stuff and you pay for all their bills


---------13:54----------
they don't learn to grow and then


---------13:57----------
eventually if I get depressed they can't


---------13:59----------
help me so other people that I've met


---------14:01----------
through my field would reach out and


---------14:03----------
help but I would never really be honest


---------14:05----------
about what they were helping which was


---------14:07----------
again this terrible idea of giving my


---------14:16----------
friends everything and bringing them


---------14:18----------
with me everywhere yeah so now so let so


---------14:21----------
sky that actually makes a lot of sense


---------14:23----------
and we're gonna get into that in a


---------14:24----------
second but the first thing is I'm gonna


---------14:26----------
ask you when so when you think about


---------14:29----------
someone who works three jobs and


---------14:31----------
supports all of their best friends do


---------14:33----------
you think that that person is lacks


---------14:36----------
empathy and takes advantage of people um


---------14:39----------
I only feel that way because of what I


---------14:42----------
get out of it it's like I'm not doing I


---------14:44----------
don't think that I'm doing it for their


---------14:46----------
health because if I was doing it for


---------14:47----------
their health I feel like I would have


---------14:49----------
motivated them to be better and do more


---------14:50----------
things okay rather like more like okay I


---------14:54----------
don't really want to be in a house by


---------14:55----------
myself because I don't know how that


---------14:57----------
would be so let me just fill it with


---------14:58----------
people that I'm familiar with


---------15:00----------
so what are you looking for there I mean


---------15:04----------
at this point I don't even know I think


---------15:06----------
I think right now it's like I have no


---------15:10----------
idea what I'm looking so sky let me ask


---------15:12----------
you something


---------15:12----------
when did you learn that you are you


---------15:15----------
disappoint other people god damn I'm


---------15:24----------
okay


---------15:26----------
geez probably when I was nine


---------15:32----------
yeah that's when I knew I was a semen


---------15:34----------
demon as soon as I knew I was gay I was


---------15:36----------
like that's it like I'm my family how my


---------15:39----------
man is Indian like Guyanese and my dad


---------15:42----------
is black and he'd be like if you're gay


---------15:44----------
you can not lay with another man here


---------15:46----------
before he knew that any of us was gay so


---------15:47----------
it was like well there's step 1 and then


---------15:51----------
I don't know what I'd be a dog you know


---------15:52----------
so yes you know I want to be a comedian


---------15:54----------
that I would go to school just look like


---------15:55----------
that yeah so I think this is important


---------15:58----------
because the common thread and like I


---------15:59----------
wish I could like rewind on twitch and


---------16:01----------
show you this but the common thread and


---------16:03----------
I started like framing questions like


---------16:05----------
this is it's all about not living up to


---------16:07----------
expectations so you take from others and


---------16:09----------
you assume it's like axiomatic for you


---------16:14----------
like you accept it as true that you're


---------16:15----------
gonna let them down like what actually


---------16:17----------
tears you up inside is that you're


---------16:19----------
letting people down that like people are


---------16:22----------
donating to your YouTube channel but


---------16:24----------
you're just creating this shitty


---------16:25----------
sponsored content that like aren't even


---------16:28----------
though you stream every day and you're


---------16:29----------
actually still making content and they


---------16:31----------
keep on supporting you you just get


---------16:33----------
confused because you're just letting


---------16:35----------
them down over and over and over again


---------16:37----------
and you're taking advantage of them and


---------16:39----------
you're corrupting them because why are


---------16:41----------
they investing in you and you're just


---------16:42----------
letting them down and they're just gonna


---------16:44----------
get let down and like why don't they


---------16:47----------
stop and run away from you from your


---------16:49----------
like corrupting influence because all


---------16:50----------
you are is a disappointment


---------16:52----------
yes oh my god yeah that write that on my


---------16:55----------
gravestone so that feeling comes from


---------17:00----------
before all of this like this is very


---------17:02----------
important to understand Skype that truth


---------17:05----------
it feels a truth to you that you're just


---------17:07----------
you're just disappointment you're


---------17:09----------
disappointment walking around right like


---------17:12----------
that truth is colors everything all of


---------17:15----------
this evidence that is being thrown your


---------17:17----------
way where people are saying sky we like


---------17:18----------
you we love you like so I rated you the


---------17:20----------
other day and I was watching your stream


---------17:21----------
this [ __ ] phenomenal man no it was it


---------17:26----------
was great like people loved you you're a


---------17:28----------
likable guy and and like you just can't


---------17:32----------
sit with that that thought


---------17:36----------
it and you want these people to come and


---------17:40----------
you like you open your home to them


---------17:41----------
because like you you want them to like


---------17:43----------
not be disappointed by you yes I I see


---------17:50----------
my patterns of what I do and it's like I


---------17:55----------
now now unfortunately right because the


---------17:58----------
pattern keeps going no matter how good


---------18:00----------
you are there's going to be diminishing


---------18:02----------
returns if you keep trying to come back


---------18:04----------
to content and then leave so like


---------18:06----------
obviously I'm sure that you've heard


---------18:09----------
this a lot but when it comes to


---------18:12----------
viewership be it on stream or on YouTube


---------18:16----------
whatever you do it is so hard to like


---------18:19----------
fight off the feeling that you're just a


---------18:21----------
dying artist and a lot of people that


---------18:25----------
they if they fall off or their career


---------18:26----------
goes sour I believe that many people


---------18:28----------
might not understand what happened but


---------18:31----------
the worst thing for me is that I know


---------18:32----------
what happened I know why it happened I I


---------18:35----------
know why it happened to right so here's


---------18:37----------
why it happened because you disappointed


---------18:39----------
people because you didn't live up to


---------18:41----------
expectations you weren't good and I


---------18:43----------
didn't yeah true by not coming back and


---------18:46----------
just always saying I'm gonna come back


---------18:48----------
and then I don't like but but so the


---------18:50----------
that's the things guys so I want you to


---------18:52----------
like really like stop and think about


---------18:53----------
this for a second okay


---------18:54----------
because you have this presumption at the


---------18:57----------
beginning you have this cheat sheet


---------18:58----------
which says the answer is that sky is


---------19:00----------
going to disappoint


---------19:04----------
you've jumped to the ant-like you know


---------19:06----------
like you've watched the climax of the


---------19:08----------
movie like you've watched the end the


---------19:10----------
big reveal is that Skyy disappoints


---------19:15----------
and and so I think the biggest problem


---------19:17----------
you say you need to get knocked down a


---------19:19----------
couple of notches no man like I think


---------19:20----------
you need to understand that you have


---------19:22----------
value in that you don't like sure at


---------19:25----------
times all human beings disappoint other


---------19:27----------
human beings but twitch is actually very


---------19:31----------
good at sniffing out [ __ ] and if if


---------19:35----------
what they see in you is not the act that


---------19:38----------
you make because I know like I I think


---------19:41----------
that your authentic


---------19:43----------
I don't really have a persona yeah and


---------19:48----------
so but somewhere along the way like you


---------19:49----------
recognize that you're not your authentic


---------19:51----------
on stream and at the same time like you


---------19:54----------
don't think you're good enough when


---------19:55----------
everyone is telling you that you are


---------19:57----------
well because there's there's definitely


---------19:59----------
like there's I guess it's not it's not


---------20:02----------
tangible there's ways that we can


---------20:04----------
determine whether someone is a powerful


---------20:07----------
content creator or not by way of their


---------20:09----------
numbers and what they're pulling and who


---------20:11----------
they're entertaining like yeah I'm that


---------20:14----------
could be really good but if I'm used to


---------20:17----------
get you know like 7 9 K streams on


---------20:20----------
average and now I'm down to like 1.3 and


---------20:24----------
it's like Scott but yeah okay so like


---------20:28----------
that's fine so the the the assault on


---------20:30----------
your ego from not being as big as you


---------20:33----------
once were is actually is completely


---------20:35----------
there but I think that that is a


---------20:37----------
separate issue from the basic idea that


---------20:41----------
you do not feel like you can live up to


---------20:43----------
expectations well yeah I mean people


---------20:47----------
have given me so much [ __ ] that it's


---------20:49----------
like well that'd be Donald Glover or


---------20:53----------
else what do you mean by give get have


---------20:55----------
given you so much [ __ ] I mean I've been


---------20:58----------
gifted and granted so much to just


---------21:02----------
survive that you know if all these


---------21:07----------
people are going out of their way to


---------21:08----------
help me in the ways that they have they


---------21:11----------
must believe in me in a way that I don't


---------21:13----------
in myself so it's like [ __ ] like that's


---------21:16----------
the problem because when they look at


---------21:18----------
you they believe when I look at you I


---------21:21----------
believe I believe I don't get right and


---------21:25----------
you just don't get that but this is cool


---------21:27----------
because just think about this first


---------21:29----------
the second sky your problem is not that


---------21:32----------
you don't create good content or that


---------21:34----------
other people don't believe in you


---------21:35----------
because like how can they believe in you


---------21:38----------
they can only believe in you because


---------21:40----------
they see something like they don't just


---------21:41----------
walk down the street and they're like oh


---------21:43----------
there's some random guy let's choose


---------21:44----------
like I choose to believe in here no they


---------21:46----------
see something and their judges right


---------21:49----------
like twitch twitch is like very


---------21:52----------
judgmental and they know what they like


---------21:53----------
and they know what they don't like and


---------21:55----------
sometimes people try to minute


---------21:57----------
like twitch and twitch doesn't respond


---------21:59----------
well to that and they see something of


---------22:02----------
value they see something of real value


---------22:03----------
which is why they keep coming back the


---------22:06----------
problem here is that like your success


---------22:08----------
or failure has nothing to do with I mean


---------22:10----------
on a very objective sense of course that


---------22:11----------
has something to do with your viewership


---------22:12----------
and all that stuff but like I don't the


---------22:15----------
core of your problem is that somewhere


---------22:16----------
along the way you decided or you learned


---------22:20----------
that you can't live up to expectations


---------22:22----------
in that your core you're a [ __ ]


---------22:24----------
disappointment and until that goes away


---------22:27----------
the cool thing is if that can change all


---------22:29----------
of your corruption all of your negative


---------22:32----------
patterns they all stem from that


---------22:41----------
so


---------22:44----------
corruption is only that I feel that I'll


---------22:47----------
disappoint the people that believe in


---------22:49----------
what I can do sort of so I think the


---------22:53----------
corruption is that like people are


---------22:55----------
investing in you and they're gonna be


---------22:57----------
hurt by it that there's no way that you


---------23:01----------
can you can give them what they deserve


---------23:03----------
yeah and so their lives and their left


---------23:08----------
tainted because they made the mistake to


---------23:11----------
invest in something that is not worth


---------23:13----------
investing it in something that's always


---------23:16----------
going to come up short


---------23:18----------
and so they're hurt by association right


---------23:21----------
I mean and and and you know I don't even


---------23:24----------
know if they think that it'll ever be a


---------23:26----------
mistake


---------23:27----------
yes so good because it's not about them


---------23:31----------
sky it's about you they don't know they


---------23:35----------
don't even know that they're getting


---------23:36----------
corrupted right they don't even know


---------23:38----------
that they're like like you know they're


---------23:41----------
getting corrupted they may not they have


---------23:43----------
no clue and that's what makes you guilty


---------23:45----------
that's where the guilt comes from


---------23:47----------
because you're hurting them and they


---------23:48----------
don't realize it and they keep coming


---------23:50----------
back


---------23:50----------
and they keep supporting you and you're


---------23:53----------
hurting them and they keep coming back


---------23:55----------
like a dog that's been kicked they


---------23:57----------
[ __ ] keep coming back and you keep


---------23:59----------
kicking away


---------24:01----------
damn you gotta bring up the kick dog


---------24:06----------
except the ones that don't come back


---------24:08----------
sure so I mean there there's a whole


---------24:11----------
very real angle of like twitch streamers


---------24:14----------
and like you know sighs and subscribers


---------24:16----------
but at the end of the day I think this


---------24:18----------
all comes down to this like basic idea


---------24:20----------
that you have in your head that you're


---------24:21----------
inevitably going to disappoint


---------24:25----------
yeah um to give you a specific example I


---------24:29----------
guess something that I notice about my


---------24:32----------
youtube channel is that I have a very I


---------24:35----------
had a very very unique rise I guess in


---------24:38----------
that my channel it never blew up like


---------24:43----------
the most subs I've ever gotten in one


---------24:45----------
month was 40,000 right and of course to


---------24:48----------
people like oh yeah blow up great but it


---------24:50----------
never went over that but I made videos


---------24:52----------
every Friday and you know for three


---------24:54----------
years I was consistent and I got to 900k


---------24:57----------
and everything was whatever however


---------24:59----------
along the way there have been channels


---------25:02----------
that actually blew up the people that


---------25:04----------
are getting 200k subs a day right and


---------25:07----------
there and they're straight to a million


---------25:08----------
and there are superstars which at first


---------25:11----------
I was jealous but that at the same time


---------25:13----------
I was happy with what I had but it is


---------25:17----------
hard to believe that you're destined for


---------25:20----------
something great when you just see people


---------25:23----------
blow up in the ways that they do and


---------25:26----------
it's like oh well my blog wasn't like


---------25:27----------
that in fact my blow-up was rather slow


---------25:29----------
does this mean that I'm just slowly


---------25:33----------
approaching you know above mediocrity


---------25:35----------
like I don't know it was it was really


---------25:38----------
really hard to understand why I wasn't


---------25:40----------
why I didn't get that treatment ever I


---------25:43----------
guess


---------25:43----------
okay so sky great point so I want to


---------25:46----------
point something out to you so it's my


---------25:49----------
belief that there is the development of


---------25:51----------
this belief about yourself right which


---------25:54----------
apparently happened when you were 9 and


---------25:56----------
then there are all of the consequences


---------25:59----------
of that belief and the way that you deal


---------26:02----------
with those right so for example like


---------26:04----------
there's the feeling guilty because


---------26:06----------
you're not empathic and you're letting


---------26:07----------
people down and then there's the


---------26:09----------
protective mechanism or the response in


---------26:12----------
your mind which is that you tell


---------26:14----------
yourself that you don't regret your


---------26:15----------
decisions do you see how like there's


---------26:17----------
like a cause and there's an effect


---------26:19----------
there's like a start and there's an end


---------26:20----------
and so I think all the stuff about


---------26:22----------
YouTube is all like responses to the


---------26:26----------
complex with which you view the world


---------26:28----------
you have a lens and then all the stuff


---------26:30----------
on YouTube because I think that's all


---------26:31----------
legitimate like you can feel you know


---------26:34----------
insufficient when you compare yourself


---------26:36----------
to meteoric Rises of other youtubers and


---------26:38----------
things


---------26:38----------
I think though all those feelings are


---------26:40----------
really legitimate but I think if you


---------26:41----------
want it you're saying that there's


---------26:43----------
something fundamental about you that's


---------26:45----------
unfixable I don't think that that thing


---------26:47----------
I don't think the root of that thing is


---------26:49----------
that you're not as successful of a


---------26:50----------
youtuber is like other youtubers I think


---------26:53----------
the root of that thing is wherever you


---------26:54----------
got this idea that like you can't live


---------26:56----------
up to expectations in it and so that if


---------27:03----------
you want your patterns to change you've


---------27:05----------
got to get to the bottom of that so tell


---------27:09----------
me about gogo I don't know where to


---------27:13----------
start with that oh yeah no yes you do


---------27:15----------
because we already know where to start


---------27:17----------
with that tell me about being nine oh


---------27:19----------
God being nine oh my god there's a kid


---------27:25----------
named Travis Barrios they got he choked


---------27:27----------
out a guy named Joey Dimas and everybody


---------27:30----------
was freaking out and I just wanted to


---------27:31----------
bang him like I have no idea what I was


---------27:33----------
thinking but it was crazy like that nine


---------27:35----------
to me that was that that was the truth


---------27:38----------
like I it was a of course you know I'm


---------27:43----------
telling myself I'm not gay but then


---------27:45----------
again you know I'm just walking around a


---------27:48----------
cockney is and I I did pretty well in


---------27:51----------
school at that time once I realized I


---------27:54----------
was gay I was like well I'm not gonna


---------27:55----------
get anywhere unless straight A's and I


---------27:57----------
never I have to leave that as soon as


---------27:58----------
possible


---------28:00----------
[Music]


---------28:02----------
and I had a lot of like friends normal


---------28:06----------
friends everything was fine the only


---------28:07----------
thing that was difficult was you know


---------28:09----------
home life with my family like moving


---------28:11----------
back and forth and their divorce and


---------28:13----------
their drama but if there's one thing my


---------28:15----------
dad and mom kind of agreed on


---------28:16----------
individually is like being gay well that


---------28:19----------
might not be okay like that was hard to


---------28:22----------
kind of maneuver and then and then when


---------28:25----------
I was around I think 11 my brother


---------28:28----------
literally read my sister's diary found


---------28:32----------
out she was a lesbian and then outed her


---------28:35----------
so now yeah so now I'm like god damn NIC


---------28:39----------
like that made a lot a lot of things


---------28:43----------
harder for me because of course she's


---------28:45----------
getting chewed out and I'm just like how


---------28:46----------
could you Alex like how could you even


---------28:49----------
be that but of course I'm not telling


---------28:50----------
her this I'm just thinking in my mind


---------28:53----------
alex is your sister your brother yes my


---------28:56----------
sister my brother's name is Nick he's


---------28:58----------
the worst person so yes okay yes


---------29:06----------
oh go on so I mean I'm just you know I


---------29:10----------
think Skyy you do a you're a fantastic


---------29:13----------
storyteller and I think you know you you


---------29:17----------
talk about things in a very kind of


---------29:19----------
larger-than-life sort of way and it


---------29:22----------
sounds funny like you make it sound


---------29:25----------
funny and I found myself like enjoying


---------29:27----------
that story like right thank you yeah but


---------29:31----------
that's not an enjoyable story that story


---------29:34----------
is [ __ ] awful it's pretty bad yeah it


---------29:39----------
gets it I mean it's actually it's


---------29:42----------
actually really really really bad but


---------29:46----------
why do you think it's why are you able


---------29:49----------
to talk about it in a way that's funny


---------29:51----------
like does it hurt talk about it


---------29:53----------
now at this point now like okay it's


---------29:58----------
it's annoying like I mean I it's


---------30:02----------
annoying and it is actually genuinely


---------30:04----------
[ __ ] up beyond belief I'm not even


---------30:06----------
kidding but yeah have you said this


---------30:08----------
before by the way um


---------30:10----------
yeah when I was 15 okay this is Lady I


---------30:13----------
we just kept playing this stick game and


---------30:16----------
you have to like put the sticks on your


---------30:18----------
hand and then you drop him and you can


---------30:20----------
only pick out a certain colour the [ __ ]


---------30:23----------
is that I don't know I mean she she was


---------30:26----------
nice she would use that to ask me about


---------30:28----------
home life while I was trying to pick up


---------30:30----------
a green stick I thought she was cheating


---------30:31----------
but and then she would talk about like


---------30:34----------
my stepdad and all those problems and


---------30:36----------
[ __ ] like but that you know that only


---------30:39----------
lasted like maybe a year and a half then


---------30:42----------
I thought there I start therapy again or


---------30:44----------
my mom made me do it when I was like 19


---------30:45----------
and then now I'm 29 and you're here just


---------30:52----------
to be clear this is not therapy sure


---------30:54----------
right we're just chatting this is just


---------30:57----------
chatting on Twitch


---------30:59----------
this is just chatting that's not fair


---------31:02----------
so but I just want to so in a lot of


---------31:08----------
ways sky it seems like you've grown and


---------31:10----------
you've moved past this and you've become


---------31:11----------
caught become confident in the person


---------31:13----------
that you are like that's that's what I'm


---------31:15----------
getting from you now that's a great


---------31:18----------
thing to hear I would say that I've I've


---------31:24----------
moved past it but the damage that's been


---------31:26----------
done is just irreversible and so it's


---------31:28----------
like yeah so I agree that you've moved


---------31:32----------
past it I agree that the damage has not


---------31:35----------
been repaired


---------31:36----------
I don't think it's irreversible I think


---------31:38----------
it's completely logical for you to think


---------31:40----------
it's irreversible right because you


---------31:42----------
moved past it without fixing it did you


---------31:45----------
watch the last interview a little bit of


---------31:49----------
it okay so I don't think it's


---------31:50----------
irreversible I just don't think you've


---------31:52----------
tried to fix it in the right way because


---------31:54----------
what you've done is you've moved past it


---------31:55----------
instead of fixing it you moved on with


---------31:57----------
your life with ever actually addressing


---------31:59----------
the underlying issue and unless you've


---------32:01----------
tried to do that huh sorry it's really


---------32:04----------
bad though okay do you want it I mean I


---------32:10----------
can I can tell you I'm only warning like


---------32:12----------
even your viewers I actually don't even


---------32:14----------
I should really get your page open you


---------32:17----------
know what actually I think that I didn't


---------32:19----------
open your Twitter page because I was


---------32:20----------
absolutely terrified of chat but I


---------32:24----------
horrified actually I just I can't even -


---------32:27----------
I was gonna be fragile but anyway I I


---------32:30----------
usually give a trigger warning because


---------32:33----------
it's that bad so I was like I don't mind


---------32:34----------
talking about it I'm asking you though


---------32:36----------
like I can tell you but it's bad so so


---------32:39----------
let me okay let me so thank you for


---------32:42----------
being cautionary I really appreciate


---------32:45----------
that I actually don't know how to


---------32:46----------
navigate this kind of situation but let


---------32:49----------
me actually first ask you this or you


---------32:50----------
said you were afraid of being fragile


---------32:54----------
[ __ ] yes


---------32:57----------
damnit what do you mean by pharrell


---------33:01----------
begin


---------33:04----------
ah cuz like you know everybody's like


---------33:08----------
saying [ __ ] like oh you know um man up


---------33:13----------
toughen up like don't let them like get


---------33:15----------
thicker skin like you don't you don't


---------33:17----------
have to care people think I care about


---------33:19----------
what everyone thinks I don't care who


---------33:21----------
you are you could be an infant if you


---------33:23----------
don't like me it hurts so it was like I


---------33:25----------
and I'm not gonna lie to people like on


---------33:28----------
Twitter I'll be like ya know I care


---------33:29----------
people that hate me I'll tweet at them


---------33:31----------
would be like hey let's talk even if it


---------33:33----------
hurts I want to learn something that's


---------33:34----------
my genuine approach so in twitch chat is


---------33:37----------
like twitch that the culture I'm sure


---------33:40----------
you're aware to me I love Twitter yet


---------33:42----------
you're older because they make me laugh


---------33:43----------
but damn they could be vicious if you


---------33:46----------
are not on your [ __ ] if they don't like


---------33:49----------
you they will let you know and they will


---------33:51----------
dig in your soul and I figured that like


---------33:54----------
just for now I'm gonna just pretend that


---------33:56----------
I'm talking to you privately yeah so


---------34:00----------
Skyy what what are you afraid of them


---------34:02----------
seeing with you being fragile Oh [ __ ]


---------34:06----------
anything mister mr. Potatohead people


---------34:08----------
call me that what is that like a line


---------34:10----------
with me a lot of words they they could


---------34:13----------
say anything like literally anything


---------34:17----------
even if it's like neutral and I'll feel


---------34:20----------
odd are you sensitive are you being


---------34:25----------
fragile I think so yeah yeah I mean how


---------34:30----------
does it feel shitty in what ways I'm


---------34:34----------
also six five like I'm a big ass [ __ ]


---------34:36----------
like I'm huge so it's weird for me to be


---------34:40----------
like especially like an in person oh I'm


---------34:43----------
looked at as someone like oh walk me to


---------34:44----------
my car you know protect me from the


---------34:47----------
muggers and the rapist and I'm like I'm


---------34:49----------
I'm walking and I'm like well I hope we


---------34:52----------
don't get mugged or a plate I'm just as


---------34:54----------
scared if not more so and I will throw


---------34:56----------
you to the assailant I'll run away so


---------34:59----------
being that fragile like is not good for


---------35:02----------
people to know which is why I'm saying


---------35:04----------
in here on your stream run of all of


---------35:05----------
these people yeah but I mean so so I


---------35:08----------
don't think you come across as fragile


---------35:11----------
what a good good form even I I


---------35:14----------
definitely am so what so what is someone


---------35:17----------
who's fragile feel like look like let's


---------35:19----------
start there me yeah do you think they


---------35:23----------
smiled I think that they they will use


---------35:28----------
mechanisms that are paper-thin that what


---------35:31----------
you're doing I don't know ma'am I I feel


---------35:34----------
like maybe but I also oh I don't think


---------35:38----------
they're paper-thin oh but I think you


---------35:41----------
are using mechanisms right so I think


---------35:42----------
you laugh a lot and you come across as


---------35:45----------
confident yeah that's fine laughing I


---------35:48----------
think you laugh when you become


---------35:50----------
uncomfortable about things and it sounds


---------35:52----------
like that's actually a winning strategy


---------35:54----------
because you've sort of figured out that


---------35:55----------
every time you're on stream you're


---------35:57----------
[ __ ] terrified and you're anxious it


---------35:59----------
sounds like and that brings out after


---------36:00----------
which twitchchat loves i actually don't


---------36:03----------
think that i'm i'm never uncomfortable


---------36:07----------
like i always feel really good about


---------36:10----------
everything like everything i do when it


---------36:11----------
comes to especially with people like


---------36:13----------
i've never been shy currently in this


---------36:15----------
discussion right here like I'm not


---------36:16----------
particularly uncomfortable I wouldn't


---------36:18----------
say incredible it's more like I'm I'm


---------36:20----------
curious to see like where it goes and


---------36:23----------
I'm anxious for the result but I mean I


---------36:25----------
feel personally totally fine of course


---------36:28----------
now that is in contrast for let's say


---------36:31----------
the twitch chat was just lighten my ass


---------36:33----------
up and I'm looking at the chat if it was


---------36:36----------
here then that would bring the


---------36:38----------
uncomfortability cuz it's like damn but


---------36:41----------
currently I'm completely fine and yes I


---------36:44----------
do smile and laugh a lot about it you're


---------36:47----------
right about literally everything good or


---------36:49----------
bad in my group of my best friends we


---------36:54----------
all have a you know it's like three


---------36:56----------
three people that I live with her or my


---------36:58----------
genuine best friends great people that I


---------37:00----------
feel nothing negative about and we have


---------37:03----------
a lot of bad things that happened to us


---------37:04----------
but we joke about it like it was nothing


---------37:07----------
and we love it we don't feel any pain or


---------37:09----------
anything that's the way that I conduct


---------37:10----------
myself doesn't work for other people but


---------37:12----------
yeah so I mean I think sky


---------37:15----------
fortunately our unfortunately you know I


---------37:19----------
think for you to be


---------37:21----------
to be fixed I think you've gotta move a


---------37:24----------
little bit past the humor oh right so I


---------37:29----------
I think that like it sounds like stuff


---------37:30----------
really bad happened growing up oh yes


---------37:35----------
and and since it and there's just it's


---------37:39----------
weird like I don't know how else to


---------37:40----------
describe this but you have you know you


---------37:42----------
have this persona where like you give us


---------37:44----------
all these disclaimers and stuff and


---------37:46----------
trigger warnings and so like to me that


---------37:48----------
actually feels like misdirection like I


---------37:51----------
don't doubt that there's legitimacy to


---------37:52----------
it but like the the phrase that I latch


---------37:55----------
on to that gets you to pause and


---------37:57----------
actually makes you feel a little bit


---------38:00----------
uncomfortable is like


---------38:02----------
mentioning that you could be fragile


---------38:04----------
it's not talking about all the bad [ __ ]


---------38:06----------
that happened to you because there's


---------38:08----------
something like you've learned how to


---------38:10----------
view that in a particular way your view


---------38:13----------
of your past has become like you've


---------38:15----------
adapted to it you're resilient you've


---------38:16----------
kind of learned how to move past it


---------38:18----------
you're kind of okay with it now but I


---------38:20----------
think that that's like kind of like it's


---------38:21----------
a shell that you put over it but that's


---------38:24----------
that yeah that's why I said that it's


---------38:25----------
unfixable okay so in sometimes when you


---------38:30----------
get an infection your body forms


---------38:32----------
something called an abscess okay and an


---------38:35----------
abscess is like where you have that


---------38:36----------
infected part your body kind of like


---------38:38----------
walls off the microbes and forms like


---------38:42----------
this like sphere which has like all this


---------38:45----------
like scar tissue and [ __ ] like that and


---------38:47----------
the infection is like stuck inside and


---------38:49----------
that's a survival mechanism that your


---------38:51----------
body does to prevent the infection from


---------38:52----------
spreading the problem is that when you


---------38:55----------
have an abscess the infection is stuck


---------38:58----------
inside and so it's like running rampant


---------39:00----------
in there like nothing gets in and


---------39:02----------
nothing gets out so in order for an


---------39:05----------
abscess in order for the the infection


---------39:07----------
to truly be healed do you have any idea


---------39:09----------
what people do to an abscess right it


---------39:12----------
absolutely


---------39:14----------
right and so unless we open up the


---------39:17----------
abscess you can have an abscess well not


---------39:19----------
for years but you know you can have [ __ ]


---------39:21----------
walled off and your body's like there's


---------39:23----------
no way that's getting fixed because


---------39:25----------
we've walled it all off


---------39:27----------
and I think that's that's what you've


---------39:29----------
done because here here's what I'm


---------39:31----------
hearing from you okay that you have you


---------39:33----------
know this diagnosis of antisocial


---------39:34----------
personality disorder at the age of 15


---------39:36----------
that you have some patterns in your life


---------39:38----------
that are so intractable so unsolvable so


---------39:42----------
unfixable and that you corrupt


---------39:45----------
everything you touch


---------39:47----------
that's like a really bleak way right and


---------39:49----------
so if we think about what kind of human


---------39:52----------
can survive that it's you


---------39:55----------
it's the larger in life it's the


---------39:58----------
surrounded by friends


---------39:59----------
it's the laughing at the good and the


---------40:02----------
bad that's the only way that's the only


---------40:05----------
way you survive that [ __ ] only wait


---------40:08----------
that's your abscess and you're torn


---------40:12----------
you're torn because you feel guilty and


---------40:15----------
you don't know how to deal with those


---------40:17----------
feelings of guilt so you choose not to


---------40:18----------
regret your decisions that you tell


---------40:21----------
people you live every day without regret


---------40:24----------
yeah and you regret every day okay yeah


---------40:29----------
right right I just feel like it's kind


---------40:32----------
of I feel like I feel like sometimes


---------40:35----------
apologies are so hollow like yes I


---------40:38----------
because you can't make it right you


---------40:44----------
can't make it right because you


---------40:48----------
disappoint so you can't make yeah right


---------40:50----------
there's men I feel like I'm maybe this


---------40:53----------
is a dollar and it could be a dumb thing


---------40:55----------
to say but it's like I feel like if I do


---------40:58----------
something bad to someone it is so hard


---------41:00----------
for me to apologize because I feel


---------41:02----------
honestly that I've taken away if I do


---------41:06----------
that even though something I can't fix


---------41:08----------
if I apologize it makes me feel like I'm


---------41:11----------
taking away their bad guy and I know


---------41:14----------
that I feel about that um it might sound


---------41:17----------
weird but it's like I do feel a type of


---------41:21----------
way and I don't like the sky it but I


---------41:23----------
yeah well who who hurt you so bad that


---------41:28----------
there is no way to apologize for what


---------41:31----------
they did


---------41:31----------
oh Jesus follow the question who hurt


---------41:42----------
you so bad


---------41:44----------
that there is no way to apologize for


---------41:47----------
what they did there's no way to fix that


---------41:49----------
hurt where did you learn in the core of


---------41:53----------
your being that there are some wounds


---------41:56----------
that will never be healed


---------41:58----------
oh I have a minute yes okay okay


---------42:12----------
I'm just going to fill this with water


---------42:14----------
one second okay Jesus you were you're


---------42:18----------
good this is terrifying


---------42:21----------
take your time you also don't have to


---------42:23----------
answer no I'm gonna answer okay remember


---------42:27----------
I talked about anything I've never been


---------42:31----------
asked that question ever um okay let's


---------42:37----------
see who my my brother my mom my


---------42:45----------
stepfather and my dad and not my sister


---------42:51----------
if I were to put this in a tier list it


---------42:54----------
would be my brother up here in S Plus


---------42:57----------
tier by himself and then a critical


---------43:00----------
space and then a - tier would be my mom


---------43:04----------
and then my dad probably next to her and


---------43:07----------
then my stepdad I mean he's just he's


---------43:12----------
literal trash so whatever you can just


---------43:16----------
put him somewhere else this guy this is


---------43:18----------
important right so like I think that


---------43:22----------
so good job first of all I'm glad you


---------43:25----------
took a minute I'm glad you thought


---------43:26----------
through things yeah so I want you to


---------43:37----------
understand that like the way that you


---------43:38----------
view the world is not wrong it was


---------43:41----------
taught but like you have some


---------43:45----------
fundamental things that you think since


---------43:48----------
these things are true for you your


---------43:51----------
situation is unfixable and those things


---------43:53----------
are first of all that you disappoint and


---------43:56----------
secondly that you can hurt someone in a


---------43:58----------
way that can never be healed yeah in


---------44:02----------
that second in if that's the case so now


---------44:05----------
now we come back to the original


---------44:06----------
question right so when I asked you the


---------44:09----------
original thing what are we talking about


---------44:11----------
what is it that is unfixed what is it


---------44:14----------
that is unfixable why do you feel like


---------44:16----------
things are hopeless and now we get to it


---------44:18----------
right this is the reason because someone


---------44:21----------
not just one person but this is a lesson


---------44:23----------
that was taught to you by one person


---------44:26----------
that you love and then another person


---------44:27----------
that you love and that another person


---------44:29----------
that you love oh god yeah right so they


---------44:33----------
just rammed that into you like over and


---------44:35----------
over again that you just [ __ ] that


---------44:37----------
that there is hurt in this world that


---------44:39----------
nothing can fix and so that became truth


---------44:45----------
that became truth that became what it is


---------44:47----------
and then the world is now a place where


---------44:51----------
you are hurting people and then there's


---------44:53----------
no way to fix that you are uncurable


---------44:55----------
it's unfixable you just are gonna let


---------44:58----------
people down they're gonna invest in you


---------44:59----------
and they're gonna get corrupted like


---------45:00----------
corruption gangrene what happening oh


---------45:05----------
sorry go on


---------45:06----------
in order for that to change you've got


---------45:08----------
to start with this right you've got to


---------45:10----------
go to the root where did you how did you


---------45:12----------
learn and I mean I think it's beyond the


---------45:14----------
scope of what we can accomplish today


---------45:17----------
by oh yeah but I think this is where it


---------45:22----------
comes down to right because if you can


---------45:24----------
heal what they did to you then your


---------45:27----------
entire worldview comes tumbling down


---------45:30----------
then everything that you view about the


---------45:34----------
world is like can be rewritten


---------45:38----------
but the okay so you're you're everything


---------45:43----------
you're saying is I'm gonna assume


---------45:45----------
accurate because [ __ ] but even if I


---------45:50----------
believe that things could be fixable I


---------45:54----------
really I don't you don't believe you


---------45:58----------
don't believe that that are fixable fine


---------46:00----------
right I mean so let's just call that so


---------46:03----------
I'm gonna tell you what you actually


---------46:04----------
think which is that like in theory in


---------46:07----------
theory in theory dr. K I agree with you


---------46:10----------
but there's just no [ __ ] way you


---------46:11----------
don't know what they did to me it's not


---------46:13----------
actually fixable yeah like yeah like it


---------46:19----------
sounds but at the end of the day it's


---------46:21----------
just it's just not actually gonna happen


---------46:25----------
yeah I I feel like now it's kind of like


---------46:29----------
well just gotta try to figure out a way


---------46:32----------
to win you know while having this kind


---------46:36----------
of like baggage and I felt like it's


---------46:39----------
possible because it worked for a bit but


---------46:41----------
no I mean yes so that's the problem


---------46:45----------
right because I think if you want to win


---------46:47----------
you gotta like offload that baggage


---------46:49----------
right you gotta learn that you can be


---------46:50----------
healed and if you can be healed then you


---------46:55----------
don't have to be a corrupting influence


---------46:56----------
for others


---------46:57----------
oh I'm willing to talk about it how much


---------46:59----------
time do we have


---------47:01----------
I have a patient in about 10 minutes I


---------47:04----------
I'm happy to talk about it too it's just


---------47:06----------
in my experience sky I'm good at what I


---------47:10----------
do but this is the kind of thing that


---------47:11----------
requires more than 10 minutes or even


---------47:13----------
more than one session because it sounds


---------47:15----------
like you've had repeated insults and


---------47:17----------
it's not that I'm not willing to try or


---------47:19----------
not wanting to talk about it I just want


---------47:21----------
to set realistic expectations for like


---------47:23----------
what's gonna be accomplished okay does


---------47:26----------
that make sense yeah


---------47:29----------
like the only only thing that sucks is


---------47:31----------
that I mean and of course this is diet


---------47:33----------
it's like you have blown open my


---------47:37----------
worldview and now it's like it's like oh


---------47:40----------
well another patient got to go for it


---------47:42----------
which is fine get your own work to do


---------47:43----------
but now it's like I'm just gonna be


---------47:46----------
staring out of my overcast window like


---------47:48----------
goddamn much got bodied and I don't


---------47:50----------
never leave know what's fair enough fair


---------47:52----------
enough


---------47:53----------
so so so let me try to let me try to


---------47:56----------
let's not end here I'm not saying we


---------47:59----------
should end hmm


---------48:00----------
and and I get the sense you need to move


---------48:02----------
forward because like you said like I've


---------48:03----------
opened things up and I can't just leave


---------48:05----------
you I know you I know you can but I hear


---------48:10----------
what you're saying so so let's let's get


---------48:12----------
started right let's talk about I feel


---------48:15----------
like a whiny brat baby we got his way


---------48:17----------
like no you're you're I don't think


---------48:21----------
you're a whiny brat that that that got


---------48:23----------
your way I think you raised a very


---------48:24----------
legitimate concern which is that we


---------48:28----------
we're like halfway done and so we should


---------48:31----------
finish I've just never heard those words


---------48:33----------
out of someone's mouth like I cannot


---------48:35----------
believe you asked that god it's actually


---------48:38----------
like nuts to me like


---------48:42----------
you're really good that's yeah don't


---------48:44----------
don't mind my rambling I mind your your


---------48:50----------
rambling is Goldman and we're blurry oh


---------48:56----------
yeah yeah so tell me about your mother


---------49:00----------
so he's the s+ right so let's dive in


---------49:02----------
you want to go let's go yep tell me


---------49:06----------
about your mother


---------49:07----------
the worst human being alive one of them


---------49:11----------
um Nick


---------49:13----------
well not he wasn't always that way Nick


---------49:17----------
and I are like both extremely extremely


---------49:20----------
manipulative and we're very good at it


---------49:22----------
my brother is the more attractive one


---------49:24----------
and I'm funnier than him so like when we


---------49:26----------
were kids we just got we really ran my


---------49:29----------
aunts pockets like they was Aaron's like


---------49:31----------
we didn't care like we're trying to get


---------49:34----------
like a game we didn't steal from them


---------49:36----------
but of course like we'd just be like oh


---------49:37----------
man we would have a lot more brother


---------49:39----------
bonding time if we had that new Pokemon


---------49:41----------
League we're awful and we played a lot


---------49:44----------
of Wilder yes he's a 15 months older


---------49:47----------
okay


---------49:49----------
[Music]


---------49:51----------
had to memorize the English words he's


---------49:53----------
we're 15 months apart so that's why I


---------49:55----------
now say it


---------49:58----------
we I know Nick just sucks I can dive


---------50:02----------
into what he did is that okay


---------50:06----------
this is the trigger warning part yeah


---------50:09----------
okay reiteration of the trigger warning


---------50:12----------
everyone okay so when I was 15 a dude


---------50:19----------
came in our house and I got raped and


---------50:24----------
[Music]


---------50:27----------
it was very odd because I knew that I


---------50:31----------
was gay I was talking to this person on


---------50:33----------
AOL I knew that I was gay um he said


---------50:37----------
that he was like 17 he was actually like


---------50:40----------
40 he talks to my house and went and I


---------50:46----------
should have like thought about it more


---------50:49----------
when he asked if it was like a 2-story


---------50:52----------
home like he it was like this thing like


---------50:53----------
like trying to bait me to say like where


---------50:56----------
I live in the house but of course it was


---------50:58----------
the downstairs houses are the only room


---------50:59----------
downstairs


---------51:01----------
so when it was happening it was like my


---------51:05----------
mind was basically thinking okay well


---------51:07----------
I'm gay so I'm gonna have to like it


---------51:09----------
it was the most painful thing I've ever


---------51:10----------
on our life we know is even more [ __ ]


---------51:12----------
up though is that your body my body made


---------51:16----------
for like two seconds I enjoyed it for


---------51:18----------
two solid seconds my body put me in a


---------51:21----------
place to where this is what I wanted


---------51:23----------
that will live with me I [ __ ] hate


---------51:25----------
thinking about that but what was worse


---------51:27----------
wasn't when my brother came home when it


---------51:29----------
was done my logic was if I just don't


---------51:32----------
say or do anything and I make no noise


---------51:33----------
then he will leave and I will be able to


---------51:36----------
just keep this right so he's getting up


---------51:39----------
to leave and my brother comes home he


---------51:42----------
goes back to my room and he tries to


---------51:43----------
open the door he sees that I'm naked and


---------51:46----------
he sees those another he sends another


---------51:47----------
person in there I closed the door and I


---------51:49----------
lock it I try to distract him


---------51:50----------
the dude leave my brother goes I've been


---------51:52----------
telling my mom mom calls the cops my


---------51:56----------
brother tells the cops that I invited


---------51:58----------
someone over to get [ __ ] and that's


---------51:59----------
what happened and it's my fault the cop


---------52:02----------
pulls me aside asked me if I want to go


---------52:03----------
to a foster home my mom didn't know who


---------52:05----------
to believe


---------52:05----------
oh yeah Deanna the next day I go and get


---------52:08----------
blood test blood work my mom took the


---------52:10----------
day off work obviously who went to go do


---------52:11----------
much tests okay


---------52:14----------
[Music]


---------52:16----------
then the neck but I think it was maybe a


---------52:20----------
day after maybe two days after I went to


---------52:22----------
school cuz after the weekend and I go to


---------52:26----------
school and every single person at our


---------52:30----------
high school knows what happened oh but


---------52:33----------
they don't know the actual story they


---------52:36----------
think that I wanted it and that that


---------52:39----------
that was like like I was just a [ __ ] who


---------52:43----------
just you know went out and did all


---------52:46----------
whatever which isn't unorthodox to think


---------52:52----------
because I have in like I have in the


---------52:55----------
past out of curiosity looked at gay porn


---------52:56----------
it had been on Craigslist to try to look


---------52:58----------
for something like sure try to look for


---------53:00----------
someone but at the time I had no luck


---------53:02----------
obviously because I'm an infant but but


---------53:07----------
Nick like he knew that it wasn't he knew


---------53:09----------
that it wasn't


---------53:11----------
new but he didn't he wanted a scoop so


---------53:13----------
he


---------53:20----------
everyone in my school


---------53:22----------
I find out when I enter my class and


---------53:26----------
people are just like giggling like I'm


---------53:27----------
not even kidding like it was a [ __ ]


---------53:29----------
movie um I didn't think much of it I


---------53:31----------
just had to get through the day after I


---------53:33----------
was done I cannot believe this


---------53:35----------
I go to gamestop I go in to buy a game


---------53:38----------
and our mutual friend Alex Scott is


---------53:40----------
working and he's like oh I heard you had


---------53:43----------
a special friend last night I literally


---------53:45----------
dropped my food and my backpack and


---------53:48----------
everything cuz when he said that the


---------53:50----------
manager even looked over like they


---------53:52----------
thought it was funny and I took my mom's


---------53:54----------
I was like driving my mom's expedition


---------53:56----------
at the time cuz I you know I could drive


---------53:58----------
but my mom of course should not be in


---------54:01----------
any legal trouble even though she let me


---------54:03----------
drive alone just go ahead and just put


---------54:05----------
that out there but yeah I know then I


---------54:07----------

---------55:26----------
and I mean I just went home and locked


---------55:32----------
myself in my room and that was that I


---------55:34----------
don't know if my brother got punished


---------55:36----------
for it but I know that whatever happened


---------55:41----------
wasn't enough because in 2000 and now


---------55:44----------
this is so [ __ ] in 2016 um my brother


---------55:50----------
I guess is having a wedding and he knows


---------55:53----------
we're not on good terms he goes on my


---------55:54----------
subreddit and he makes a thing that says


---------55:56----------
Oh will you go to my wedding now all of


---------55:59----------
my fans think that I'm okay with my


---------56:01----------
brother so they're thinking it's a sweet


---------56:03----------
gesture but Nick knows that I'm not on


---------56:05----------
good terms with it but he's just I find


---------56:11----------
out that he's working at Chili's and


---------56:14----------
he's like using like oh you look like


---------56:17----------
Skye and he's like getting some of my


---------56:20----------
fans his friends on Facebook and then


---------56:23----------
when I didn't answer his wedding


---------56:24----------
proposal he put my text messages that I


---------56:26----------
sent to him during like during like


---------56:29----------
around the time where I got away like


---------56:31----------
all of my message all my business out on


---------56:33----------
his personal Facebook okay and then he


---------56:37----------
has the audacity to begin posting [ __ ]


---------56:42----------
on my reddit which I had to take down


---------56:44----------
this [ __ ] is really out here ridiculing


---------56:48----------
me for getting raped and then that's


---------56:51----------
where a lot of things went downhill in


---------56:54----------
my life for sure my mom you know yeah go


---------56:59----------
on do it


---------56:59----------
so Skyy so let me ask you something um


---------57:04----------
is I mean have you talked here like so


---------57:08----------
you say that you and your brother aren't


---------57:09----------
on good terms is there a particular way


---------57:12----------
that when you guys like when y'all


---------57:18----------
aren't on good terms


---------57:19----------
look what does what does that like have


---------57:21----------
you talked to him about what happened


---------57:24----------
and how you feel yep


---------57:27----------
and they don't care he get it he really


---------57:30----------
doesn't care at all I'm just running off


---------57:32----------
my fan okay


---------57:33----------
he does not care at all and and I he


---------57:38----------
hasn't apologized he doesn't he


---------57:41----------
definitely doesn't seem he I mean he's


---------57:44----------
again he's never changed his stance he's


---------57:47----------
blaming me for it I'm the one that got a


---------57:49----------
rape it was me it was actually not rape


---------57:51----------
because it was consensual so it's like


---------57:56----------
he hasn't even left that at all and he


---------57:58----------
would like try to get a hold of me by he


---------58:03----------
took my one of my videos and had my dad


---------58:06----------
and mom like mime it one second Scott


---------58:12----------
[Music]


---------58:16----------
this it really is in my head he's I'm


---------58:21----------
the fan okay so sky I think that uh I I


---------58:28----------
think that the challenge here is that so


---------58:32----------
I I mean I think that this has this has


---------58:34----------
to be and you you sort of have made your


---------58:37----------
peace with the situation to the extent


---------58:39----------
that you can right yeah I mean it we


---------58:47----------
just went out just cut out hello oh I


---------58:56----------
can't hear you


---------58:58----------
hello friend yep there we go you hear me


---------59:03----------
yeah so I I mean this guy I think


---------59:05----------
unfortunately I can't know I mean I


---------59:10----------
think it's just gonna be challenging


---------59:11----------
because I think this is just I mean I


---------59:13----------
recognize what you're going through and


---------59:15----------
I feel confident that you can get better


---------59:16----------
and I think this is where it starts but


---------59:19----------
like there's just no way that you know


---------59:22----------
the first thing that I can offer you is


---------59:24----------
that I do think you can get better and


---------59:26----------
if you've never seen your life in this


---------59:29----------
way let you have these patterns that


---------59:30----------
those patterns come from a place right


---------59:33----------
and they come from something terrible


---------59:35----------
that happened to you and if you can


---------59:37----------
understand where a pattern comes from


---------59:39----------
you can gain


---------59:40----------
control over it okay and and so this is


---------59:43----------
something that that's very important to


---------59:45----------
understand so the Yogi's in ancient


---------59:46----------
India said that awareness precedes


---------59:49----------
control and that like when I work with


---------59:53----------
people who have addictions or trauma or


---------59:55----------
things like that like there was a you


---------59:56----------
know kind of a I guess a you know far


---------59:58----------
less severe stream than what we're


---------60:01----------
talking about but it was someone on a


---------60:03----------
couple of weeks ago or a couple months


---------60:04----------
ago who's talking about why they date


---------60:06----------
the same kind of women like over and


---------60:08----------
over and over again and they don't


---------60:09----------
understand like why they keep on getting


---------60:10----------
and women getting with women that they


---------60:13----------
ultimately get bored of and then like


---------60:14----------
they want to break up with and so unless


---------60:17----------
you understand like what's going on


---------60:19----------
inside you like you have no ability to


---------60:22----------
control it right so this is what I what


---------60:26----------
I can offer you now which is gonna be


---------60:28----------
unsatisfying for which I apologize the


---------60:30----------
first is to understand that you are the


---------60:32----------
way that you are because you learned


---------60:34----------
some very important and crucial lessons


---------60:37----------
in life and as long as you're operating


---------60:40----------
under the assumption that those lessons


---------60:42----------
are true that you're going to those


---------60:45----------
lessons are gonna kind of like default


---------60:47----------
your plays are gonna set your default


---------60:49----------
mode network your default programming


---------60:51----------
when I go to the toilet and I like pull


---------60:54----------
the handle down it flushes like that's


---------60:56----------
just an assumption


---------60:57----------
so you're operating in life with certain


---------60:59----------
key assumptions that you can hurt people


---------61:01----------
and disappoint people in a way that's


---------61:03----------
never


---------61:06----------
repairable and in at the beginning what


---------61:09----------
I would say is just notice when that


---------61:12----------
thought or that feeling arises and


---------61:14----------
influences your behavior


---------61:17----------
because I think it happens not when you


---------61:19----------
accept someone's help but the next day


---------61:22----------
when your desire or your genuine


---------61:24----------
intention to pay them back or do right


---------61:26----------
by them or something like that when that


---------61:28----------
when that starts to fade I think


---------61:30----------
something of this feeling is going to


---------61:32----------
arise right there and is going to


---------61:35----------
actually become a self-fulfilling


---------61:36----------
prophecy and something about that


---------61:39----------
feeling in that hopelessness causes you


---------61:41----------
to abandon your promise


---------61:44----------
and the cool thing is if you can notice


---------61:46----------
that thing in that moment and say oh


---------61:48----------
this is the part of me like this is like


---------61:50----------
this is everything that happened when I


---------61:52----------
was 15


---------61:53----------
rearing its ugly head and telling me


---------61:55----------
that it doesn't [ __ ] matter and then


---------61:57----------
you can in that moment if you see it


---------61:59----------
right this is like so you play League of


---------62:01----------
Legends yeah yeah so there's like


---------62:04----------
there's like stealth units and League of


---------62:05----------
Legends right


---------62:08----------
yeah oh yeah yeah so so like like you


---------62:11----------
need like some kind of like vision like


---------62:12----------
you need some like detection to be able


---------62:14----------
to see the stealth thing otherwise you


---------62:15----------
can't do anything about it and so you've


---------62:18----------
been living your whole life without


---------62:20----------
detection and there's been something


---------62:22----------
that's just just running around in your


---------62:23----------
subconscious just [ __ ] everything up


---------62:25----------
yeah and so it starts with detection you


---------62:28----------
got to detect it first whether you can


---------62:30----------
tackle it whether you can kill it


---------62:32----------
whether you can stun it whatever that


---------62:34----------
comes later but the first thing is


---------62:35----------
detection


---------62:38----------
um if if I promise to be brief yeah I


---------62:45----------
only have one more thing to say you


---------62:48----------
should say it okay I just I this is this


---------62:55----------
is gonna be something that I know that


---------62:56----------
like it's not like trigger warning or


---------62:58----------
anything it is something that many


---------63:00----------
people are wondering about but there is


---------63:02----------
something that I want to share with you


---------63:04----------
because I think that I think ever since


---------63:06----------
you were talking about the


---------63:07----------
disappointment thing this is the first


---------63:09----------
thing that was in my mind I said it


---------63:10----------
sooner basically um Allah while ago I


---------63:14----------
wasn't very good friends with a content


---------63:16----------
creator of dunkey we had a falling out


---------63:18----------
with me and Leah had a falling out it's


---------63:20----------
terrible


---------63:21----------
that's by the way the example of someone


---------63:24----------
that I said someone that I lost that


---------63:25----------
pretty much was the worst thing like I


---------63:29----------
would do anything for your friend again


---------63:31----------
and I don't think it's repairable so


---------63:32----------
that's like Oh like that that


---------63:35----------
encompasses it but what I wanted to


---------63:36----------
touch on is I never knew that being


---------63:39----------
friends with someone that's so much more


---------63:40----------
popular than you I can't tell you how


---------63:42----------
many times I would get offers from


---------63:44----------
companies and jobs that you know would


---------63:47----------
give me deals that I believe would be


---------63:49----------
amazing but then they would end by


---------63:51----------
saying Oh would you mind like passing on


---------63:53----------
this to dunkey see if he wants to do it


---------63:55----------
and either I I mean obviously I'm not


---------63:58----------
gonna [ __ ] do that he has an email


---------64:00----------
and yeah I don't want to I don't want


---------64:03----------
that I don't want that relationship but


---------64:04----------
of course if he says no or even if I


---------64:07----------
send it and there's no response or I


---------64:08----------
don't you know whatever it is nine times


---------64:11----------
out of ten the deal stops that's fine


---------64:13----------
enough to happen so so I mean that


---------64:16----------
that's fine in the sense that so I'm


---------64:17----------
glad you shared that sky and I think


---------64:18----------
there's actually like another way


---------64:19----------
forward right so the main thing here for


---------64:22----------
you to change the way that you view the


---------64:24----------
world is to to dismantle this belief


---------64:28----------
that things are irreparable so whether


---------64:30----------
it's with your family or it's with


---------64:33----------
dunkey okay for you to like process that


---------64:37----------
and repair doesn't necessarily mean make


---------64:39----------
everything like like like like not like


---------64:43----------
that you guys have to be BFFs again or


---------64:45----------
that you and your brother are gonna like


---------64:46----------
retire together and like live in the


---------64:48----------
same house like that's not what repair


---------64:49----------
means right repair means that


---------64:51----------
like you're gonna engage with them


---------64:53----------
process grieve and then let go okay that


---------64:58----------
if you did donkey wrong or something bad


---------65:00----------
happened between the two of you guys


---------65:01----------
that that yeah yes so like that's so


---------65:10----------
that's that that's the thing is like


---------65:12----------
like that


---------65:13----------
that needs to be addressed right not


---------65:15----------
moved past not laughed past not kind of


---------65:18----------
like you know like even from an


---------65:19----------
egotistical sense because this is a


---------65:21----------
distraction to because when you compare


---------65:23----------
yourself to other people and you're like


---------65:24----------
oh they're better than I am or I'm worse


---------65:25----------
that's a pattern that your mind uses in


---------65:28----------
the same way that it uses laughter to


---------65:30----------
get away from the real thing


---------65:33----------
okay yeah so I'd say to kind of to sum


---------65:38----------
up you know just try to notice it right


---------65:40----------
like when you're about to do the thing


---------65:42----------
that you can't control the thing that is


---------65:45----------
going to corrupt others and keep you


---------65:46----------
stuck in life stop and ask yourself what


---------65:52----------
is the thing that is stealth in my mind


---------65:54----------
that is pushing me to do this like where


---------65:56----------
am I getting this from and see now that


---------65:58----------
you know what to look for there's a


---------66:00----------
decent chance you'll be able to see it


---------66:01----------
like it's kind of like I I guess do I


---------66:04----------
agree so that's that's where we start


---------66:07----------
yeah okay no yeah so remember my brain


---------66:13----------
and and then you know what you're more


---------66:17----------
than welcome to come back on and we can


---------66:19----------

---------66:21----------
