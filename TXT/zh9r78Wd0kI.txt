---------00:00----------
when you guys have a problem and you


---------00:01----------
kind of find the middle of it


---------00:03----------
right like you find that core and you


---------00:05----------
discover it and start working on it all


---------00:06----------
the other crap will come crumbling down


---------00:09----------
it's just how it works i feel like i


---------00:11----------
have no personality and i am hollow


---------00:13----------
i feel afraid of talking to people in


---------00:15----------
reality or online i feel like i'm too


---------00:17----------
boring for them and have nothing


---------00:19----------
of value to offer sometimes i muster up


---------00:22----------
the courage to message people or respond


---------00:23----------
to their messages


---------00:24----------
but then i end up ghosting them for


---------00:26----------
weeks just because i don't want to end


---------00:28----------
up having a conversation


---------00:30----------
with them and them realizing i am boring


---------00:32----------
and then stopping


---------00:33----------
talking to me i feel like i will end up


---------00:36----------
alone


---------00:36----------
even if i do or don't want to talk to


---------00:39----------
people because if i do


---------00:41----------
they will realize i have no substance as


---------00:43----------
a person or that i


---------00:44----------
i'm just uninteresting or unfunny if i


---------00:47----------
don't then i will just be alone


---------00:49----------
in the end because i never talk to


---------00:51----------
anyone


---------00:52----------
i do have a few close friends and i talk


---------00:54----------
to them regularly


---------00:55----------
but they're just too close to realize


---------00:58----------
that i'm like this they tell me that i'm


---------01:00----------
interesting and funny but i think


---------01:04----------
only they find me that way it's like


---------01:06----------
when your mom tells you you're good


---------01:08----------
looking


---------01:08----------
when you know you aren't i think the


---------01:12----------
people i've been avoiding


---------01:13----------
talking to are really cool and would be


---------01:15----------
really great friends but i just don't


---------01:17----------
think i'm on their level as a person


---------01:19----------
how do i overcome this fear of rejection


---------01:22----------
great question


---------01:23----------
okay so hold on chat


---------01:26----------
dr k needs to think for a second okay so


---------01:28----------
first thing that we're going to do chat


---------01:32----------
is we're going to map out i'm going to


---------01:33----------
just show let me just do this with y'all


---------01:35----------
so i'm going to map out what this


---------01:37----------
person's mind looks like


---------01:38----------
i'm going to share with you all how i


---------01:40----------
understand the mind of this person


---------01:43----------
and i want to show you guys if you can


---------01:44----------
relate to this how to understand your


---------01:46----------
mind okay


---------01:48----------
what i'm going to ask you all to do is


---------01:50----------
go ahead and just


---------01:51----------
open up the reddit post on a side window


---------01:53----------
because i'm gonna have it here i'm gonna


---------01:54----------
go through line by line


---------01:56----------
and i'm gonna show you guys sort of how


---------01:58----------
this mind works okay


---------02:00----------
okay so let's start with this so the


---------02:03----------
first thing to understand


---------02:04----------
is that these are the core beliefs i am


---------02:06----------
too boring


---------02:08----------
sorry guys i am actually a medical


---------02:10----------
doctor which means that my handwriting


---------02:12----------
is terrible


---------02:14----------
um i'm not valuable right and so then


---------02:17----------
sometimes what this person actually does


---------02:19----------
is builds up courage and then reaches


---------02:22----------
out


---------02:23----------
and then over time they'll end up


---------02:28----------
ghosting okay i don't want to end up


---------02:31----------
having a conversation with them


---------02:33----------
and them realizing they


---------02:36----------
will realize okay


---------02:40----------
so what this means they will realize


---------02:42----------
that i'm not valuable so


---------02:44----------
you're pretending


---------02:47----------
or being an imposter okay so there's a


---------02:49----------
touch of that you'll see that


---------02:51----------
i need to talk


---------02:55----------
to other people or i


---------02:58----------
will be alone


---------03:01----------
so what i'm sort of noticing here


---------03:04----------
is that there's like a war between these


---------03:08----------
two parts


---------03:09----------
of the mind you guys see that so like


---------03:12----------
sometimes like this part wins


---------03:14----------
and then sometimes this part wins this


---------03:16----------
part usually ends up winning


---------03:17----------
okay so then they will realize my


---------03:20----------
close friends are


---------03:24----------
too close to realize


---------03:27----------
so that's why this isn't this is i'm


---------03:29----------
gonna put like a green arrow here


---------03:30----------
because


---------03:31----------
okay so we're gonna have our realization


---------03:35----------
oriented stuff this way i know this is


---------03:38----------
like this is why i wanted to think for a


---------03:39----------
second because i don't know exactly


---------03:40----------
where i'm going with this but


---------03:42----------
okay so this is the mom example okay


---------03:46----------
and then i think i have been avoiding


---------03:47----------
talking to


---------03:49----------
are really cool and could be really


---------03:51----------
great friends but i


---------03:52----------
just don't think i'm on their level as a


---------03:55----------
person


---------03:56----------
i'm not valuable so let's look at this


---------03:59----------
mind


---------04:00----------
so this over here is the sum squad


---------04:03----------
do you guys see how like everything here


---------04:06----------
that we're talking about


---------04:08----------
revolves around this complex


---------04:12----------
as long as this is here the rest of the


---------04:15----------
stuff


---------04:15----------
will actually just you know everything


---------04:18----------
here


---------04:20----------
all of this stuff will continue to


---------04:21----------
persist


---------04:23----------
so let's look at their current pattern


---------04:24----------
of behavior so they start here


---------04:26----------
they build up the courage okay they


---------04:29----------
reach out


---------04:31----------
and then the courage goes away they lose


---------04:33----------
the courage and then they end up


---------04:34----------
ghosting


---------04:35----------
so there's almost like there's a


---------04:38----------
so really what it is is courage


---------04:42----------
versus ghosting


---------04:45----------
okay and so this is a balance and on a


---------04:48----------
given day they can use willpower


---------04:51----------
to bolster courage right they can ignore


---------04:56----------
all of these thoughts and then what's


---------04:58----------
going to happen


---------04:59----------
is courage will be greater than the


---------05:02----------
tendency to ghost and disappear


---------05:04----------
and then but the problem is that


---------05:05----------
willpower is not sustainable so over


---------05:08----------
time the willpower will decrease


---------05:10----------
will cross this threshold and then


---------05:13----------
you'll ghost


---------05:14----------
and once you ghost you're gonna feel bad


---------05:19----------
and then as you feel bad you're gonna


---------05:21----------
reinforce this


---------05:22----------
y'all with me because now you feel


---------05:24----------
guilty you're like oh my god


---------05:26----------
i'm so pathetic i can't even i can't


---------05:29----------
even


---------05:31----------
you know like i can't even like text


---------05:32----------
people back oh my god


---------05:35----------
and so this thing then gets stronger it


---------05:37----------
levels up


---------05:39----------
y'all see that this cycle gg noobs


---------05:43----------
okay so now let's now these


---------05:47----------
are rationalizations they will realize


---------05:52----------
right like i can only put on a mask for


---------05:54----------
so long


---------05:56----------
and this doesn't even make any sense


---------05:57----------
rationally my close friends are too


---------06:00----------
close to realize how pathetic i am no


---------06:02----------
dude it's the opposite


---------06:03----------
right the closer someone is to you the


---------06:05----------
more they get your authentic self


---------06:06----------
so if you're close friends really


---------06:08----------
logically if your close friends


---------06:10----------
like you they're closer to the real you


---------06:13----------
that's not usually the mask


---------06:15----------
but if i were to say that to this person


---------06:17----------
they would argue with me until they were


---------06:19----------
blue in the face like i wouldn't get


---------06:20----------
anywhere


---------06:20----------
but do y'all see chat how these are


---------06:22----------
rationalizations


---------06:24----------
they're fears it doesn't make any sense


---------06:26----------
so this is like when your mind tells you


---------06:28----------
all kinds of stuff like don't bother


---------06:32----------
it's a waste of time no point


---------06:36----------
in trying to hang out if


---------06:39----------
they are going to


---------06:44----------
you ready for a chat here's the climax


---------06:46----------
find


---------06:47----------
out eventually that's what the mind


---------06:51----------
tells you right


---------06:52----------
these are all the rationalizations these


---------06:55----------
are the responses


---------06:56----------
of your mind this is what it tells you


---------07:01----------
to protect against rejection


---------07:05----------
because what this person is trying to


---------07:06----------
avoid is this cycle


---------07:09----------
right if i never reach out in the first


---------07:12----------
place


---------07:13----------
because every time i reach out i'm going


---------07:15----------
to end up ghosting then i'm going to


---------07:16----------
feel bad and this is going to get worse


---------07:21----------
so this is what you have to understand


---------07:22----------
reaching out just makes you feel bad


---------07:25----------
and that's why we don't do it you guys


---------07:29----------
see that


---------07:30----------
so then the mind says hey buddy the mind


---------07:32----------
is smart this is a smart person right


---------07:34----------
so these thoughts come over here and


---------07:36----------
they're like hey wait a minute


---------07:38----------
this is bad every time we reach out


---------07:43----------
we end up over here and we feel worse


---------07:45----------
about ourselves


---------07:46----------
so don't bother stop doing it stop doing


---------07:48----------
it


---------07:50----------
and then this is the last part so this


---------07:51----------
is like the the warring part right


---------07:55----------
we go over here which is like i need


---------07:57----------
people this isn't healthy


---------07:59----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------08:02----------
you can tackle


---------08:03----------
any of these but i'd say that you can


---------08:05----------
tackle the


---------08:06----------
the cognitions and defense mechanisms if


---------08:08----------
you want to you can tackle this cycle if


---------08:10----------
you want to but i think this is where it


---------08:12----------
starts


---------08:14----------
and if this if you can cross this out


---------08:17----------
you can cross this out everything else


---------08:19----------
is going to come crumbling down


---------08:21----------
this is going to come crumbling down


---------08:22----------
this is going to come crumbling down


---------08:23----------
this is going to come crumbling out


---------08:24----------
it'll all just


---------08:25----------
all come crumbling down okay so there's


---------08:28----------
one question that i have for you


---------08:31----------
if this person is watching or anyone who


---------08:33----------
relates to this


---------08:35----------
is where did you learn that you're not


---------08:38----------
valuable


---------08:40----------
because as long as that belief is held


---------08:42----------
all this crap is going to persist


---------08:44----------
do you all get that like you guys see


---------08:46----------
how like as we draw it out like you can


---------08:48----------
argue with the rationalizations


---------08:50----------
and the problem that people run into


---------08:52----------
with these things


---------08:53----------
is that they'll deal with any one of


---------08:55----------
those things right so if you you go to


---------08:56----------
someone you're like


---------08:57----------
how do i stop ghosting people and it's


---------08:59----------
like that is


---------09:01----------
such a weird adaptation of an adaptation


---------09:04----------
of an adaptation it's so far from the


---------09:06----------
root


---------09:07----------
like you can work on that and it is


---------09:08----------
valuable right so what we want to do is


---------09:10----------
we want to approach it from both ends


---------09:11----------
we want to approach it like in the


---------09:12----------
moment in symptomatic relief and root


---------09:14----------
cause relief


---------09:16----------
but i would start with this is where did


---------09:19----------
you learn


---------09:19----------
that all these other people are better


---------09:21----------
than you because you can even see it


---------09:22----------
okay it's it's subtle i mean actually


---------09:24----------
it's not subtle what am i saying


---------09:27----------
it's brightest day could be really great


---------09:29----------
friends but


---------09:30----------
i just don't think i'm on their level as


---------09:32----------
a person


---------09:33----------
why not when did you stop being on their


---------09:36----------
level as a person


---------09:38----------
what level are you on how did you get on


---------09:39----------
that level why are they on a different


---------09:41----------
level


---------09:43----------
right and so you can go back to like you


---------09:45----------
know this is we see the ahm god


---------09:46----------
you guys see the sense of self the


---------09:48----------
identity the identity


---------09:50----------
is like i'm a bad person and then


---------09:52----------
everything that we talked about in terms


---------09:54----------
of like the non-traditional narcissism


---------09:55----------
actually applies here too


---------09:57----------
right because they idealize all of their


---------09:59----------
friends because their ahamkar is active


---------10:04----------
so you look up to everyone oh my god


---------10:05----------
everyone's so awesome oh my god


---------10:07----------
so where does that come from and as you


---------10:10----------
start to dismantle that belief


---------10:12----------
okay we i saw an interesting post from


---------10:15----------
um a week ago


---------10:16----------
so i'll show you guys what this so my


---------10:19----------
surprising experience with coaching


---------10:21----------
um so they've been in the self


---------10:24----------
improvement online world with books and


---------10:26----------
all this for years


---------10:27----------
so like my first session started out


---------10:30----------
with some overviews and just thinking in


---------10:32----------
the basics of what coaching is


---------10:34----------
second session i was actually planning


---------10:36----------
on cutting things short i


---------10:37----------
really felt like i had a lot of


---------10:38----------
self-awareness from therapy and


---------10:40----------
self-improvement stuff


---------10:41----------
i know i have self-value problems i know


---------10:43----------
i have anxiety about work


---------10:45----------
when i clicked the call button on


---------10:47----------
discord to have my second session i had


---------10:49----------
a mental


---------10:50----------
i made a mental note to mention to my


---------10:51----------
coach that i was considering ending


---------10:53----------
after the session


---------10:54----------
i never planned on breaking down about


---------10:56----------
20 minutes later with emotion there was


---------10:58----------
such an intense some scar that i


---------10:59----------
always felt there but and had never


---------11:02----------
accessed


---------11:03----------
in the way that i had my coach asking my


---------11:06----------
coach was asking me seemingly basic


---------11:08----------
questions and reflecting


---------11:09----------
back to me the things i said i was so


---------11:11----------
sure initially that i knew


---------11:13----------
more about myself than anyone could and


---------11:15----------
it was a waste of time to do coaching


---------11:18----------
um i identified the sum scar and where


---------11:19----------
it came from and


---------11:21----------
blah blah blah okay and so you all can


---------11:24----------
read the rest of the post i think i


---------11:25----------
i just highlight this to illustrate a


---------11:27----------
couple of things the first is that


---------11:29----------
this is how a sum scar works okay blah


---------11:31----------
blah blah they got better


---------11:32----------
sure and so the the key thing though is


---------11:36----------
that like


---------11:37----------
once you hit it and it's kind of hard to


---------11:39----------
describe but like


---------11:40----------
once you find it like stuff starts


---------11:42----------
crumbling down yeah let me drop the link


---------11:44----------
sorry i i didn't mean


---------11:45----------
i just realized you know i just felt


---------11:47----------
something i felt


---------11:48----------
like it was arrogant to show something


---------11:51----------
about a success story from like our


---------11:53----------
program


---------11:54----------
so i felt like it was that was my own


---------11:56----------
ego actually getting in the way it


---------11:57----------
happened quick


---------11:58----------
and so i felt embarrassed to share how


---------12:01----------
this person had made progress which is


---------12:02----------
silly


---------12:03----------
yeah so exactly so osterholtz is saying


---------12:05----------
coaching it just works hashtag ad that's


---------12:08----------
actually exactly what i was trying to


---------12:09----------
avoid which is why i didn't read the


---------12:11----------
rest of the post


---------12:12----------
you guys see that it's interesting like


---------12:13----------
i just got my ego


---------12:15----------
happened so i didn't want to share


---------12:18----------
because i didn't want it to come across


---------12:19----------
i was thinking about what y'all were


---------12:22----------
thinking about


---------12:23----------
and i was like oh i don't want these


---------12:24----------
people to perceive me as a narcissist so


---------12:26----------
i have to stop reading this success


---------12:28----------
story


---------12:29----------
right so it happens quick the couple of


---------12:32----------
key points though is that when you guys


---------12:33----------
have a problem


---------12:34----------
and you kind of find the middle of it


---------12:36----------
right like you find that core and you


---------12:38----------
discover it and start working on it all


---------12:39----------
the other crap will come crumbling down


---------12:42----------
it's just how it works now a couple


---------12:44----------
things to remember


---------12:46----------
so this this sounds like a wonderful ad


---------12:48----------
for coaching which i actually need to


---------12:50----------
give you guys a big caveat about


---------12:52----------
this person is like oh my god i was not


---------12:54----------
expecting this this coach was


---------12:55----------
brilliant i can guarantee you every


---------12:57----------
coach out there who's watching the


---------12:58----------
stream


---------12:59----------
is currently terrified because they're


---------13:01----------
like


---------13:02----------
i don't know if i can do that are people


---------13:04----------
gonna be expecting this emotional


---------13:05----------
catharsis


---------13:06----------
after two sessions like i can't do that


---------13:09----------
because they can't do that


---------13:10----------
this is where i want you guys to


---------13:12----------
remember that this person has been doing


---------13:13----------
self-improvement work


---------13:16----------
and therapy and stuff for years so i


---------13:17----------
think it was right under the surface


---------13:20----------
right it was ready to come out and so i


---------13:22----------
don't think the coach was i'm sure the


---------13:23----------
coach was great


---------13:24----------
like they probably did a good job and at


---------13:26----------
the same time


---------13:28----------
you have to be careful about your


---------13:29----------
expectations because this person i think


---------13:31----------
was like


---------13:31----------
it's like right underneath the surface


---------13:33----------
so it'll come out relatively easily they


---------13:35----------
were ready for it


---------13:37----------
right so our coaches do a fantastic job


---------13:39----------
don't get me wrong


---------13:40----------
and at the same time i would be really


---------13:42----------
really careful about not expecting this


---------13:45----------
so just show up try to do the best that


---------13:48----------
you can


---------13:49----------
your coach is going to show up and try


---------13:50----------
to do the best that you can we have a


---------13:52----------
big policy here at hell it's not really


---------13:53----------
a policy it's like a


---------13:55----------
ethos that you know we just show up and


---------13:58----------
we do the best that we can on a given


---------13:59----------
day


---------14:00----------
that's our dharma our dharma is to show


---------14:02----------
i'm going to show up on stream


---------14:03----------
i'm going to talk is i'm going to try to


---------14:04----------
help as much peop as many people as i


---------14:06----------
can in two hours


---------14:07----------
and that's what we're going to do maybe


---------14:10----------
y'all will like it


---------14:11----------
maybe you won't am i going to have the


---------14:13----------
answers i don't really know


---------14:15----------
we're just going to show up and we're


---------14:16----------
going to give it everything we've got


---------14:18----------
and that's kind of and that's what i


---------14:20----------
encourage you all to do as well just


---------14:21----------
show up and give it everything you've


---------14:23----------
got
