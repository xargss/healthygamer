---------00:00----------
so yeah that's really cool i just like


---------00:02----------
checked out your youtube channel for the


---------00:04----------
first time it seems really dope


---------00:05----------
thank you so tell me a little bit uh


---------00:08----------
what do you


---------00:09----------
what do you want to talk about or i


---------00:10----------
understand you have some questions about


---------00:12----------
bipolar disorder


---------00:13----------
yeah that i have two main things i want


---------00:16----------
to talk about


---------00:17----------
one about bipolar disorder and like i


---------00:20----------
had a few questions about that


---------00:21----------
i've done i haven't been really educated


---------00:25----------
on that stuff so i want to


---------00:26----------
know more about it and the second topic


---------00:29----------
is actually something that i can't find


---------00:31----------
on the internet


---------00:32----------
okay it's it's have you heard on child


---------00:35----------
on child abuse


---------00:37----------
child on child abuse yes no


---------00:40----------
it's when a child abuses another child


---------00:43----------
instead of an


---------00:44----------
adult okay so i had some questions about


---------00:47----------
that topic as well sure


---------00:49----------
so fire away okay so


---------00:53----------
i recently got diagnosed with bipolar


---------00:55----------
disorder or actually i got diagnosed


---------00:57----------
twice


---------00:58----------
one at the urgent care and one


---------01:01----------
by my like psychiatrist that i normally


---------01:03----------
go to


---------01:04----------
okay and i was curious if it's something


---------01:06----------
that's genetic or if it's


---------01:08----------
like caused by some incident or


---------01:11----------
something


---------01:12----------
because like i haven't been showing


---------01:14----------
symptoms until like


---------01:16----------
now okay that's and um do you mind if i


---------01:20----------
ask the ballpark of your age oh i'm


---------01:24----------
i'm 21. okay all right


---------01:27----------
yeah that's an excellent question man


---------01:29----------
oreo these are fantastic i love


---------01:31----------
that that we're asking so here's how i


---------01:33----------
think about mental illness


---------01:35----------
so i think about mental illness as an


---------01:37----------
intersection between genetics and


---------01:39----------
environment


---------01:41----------
so is there a genetic component to


---------01:43----------
bipolar disorder


---------01:44----------
absolutely but does it mean that you're


---------01:46----------
destined to get it or is it all genetics


---------01:49----------
usually not so i'll give you just one


---------01:52----------
example


---------01:54----------
so people who have parents who are


---------01:57----------
schizophrenic


---------01:59----------
may develop schizophrenia so there's


---------02:01----------
some amount of


---------02:02----------
like possible inheritance of


---------02:05----------
schizophrenia i don't remember exactly


---------02:07----------
what the number is


---------02:08----------
i'd ballpark around 30 or 40 percent


---------02:11----------
and then people who have a history of


---------02:13----------
schizophrenia


---------02:14----------
a family history of schizophrenia who


---------02:16----------
use marijuana


---------02:18----------
especially at a young age are far more


---------02:20----------
likely to be diagnosed


---------02:22----------
with schizophrenia now the interesting


---------02:25----------
thing there is like what is the


---------02:26----------
influence of marijuana does it cause the


---------02:28----------
schizophrenia i don't


---------02:29----------
think so um the best hypothesis that i


---------02:33----------
believe in is that it unmasks what may


---------02:36----------
have taken longer to occur


---------02:38----------
but you know it's unclear but we do know


---------02:40----------
that marijuana plus family history


---------02:42----------
is worse than family history alone and


---------02:44----------
we also know that early onset of


---------02:46----------
marijuana use


---------02:48----------
probably leads to a greater risk of


---------02:50----------
manifesting symptoms of schizophrenia


---------02:52----------
so how does that work i mean my sense is


---------02:55----------
that we each have a genetic


---------02:57----------
predisposition


---------02:58----------
and then based on certain environmental


---------03:01----------
factors like stressors


---------03:03----------
that genetic predisposition can kind of


---------03:06----------
like


---------03:06----------
activate or you're like you're halfway


---------03:10----------
so in this in cancer there's something


---------03:12----------
called the two-hit hypothesis


---------03:15----------
which which hypothesizes that in order


---------03:17----------
to get cancer you need


---------03:18----------
more than one kind of like genetic


---------03:20----------
mutation in your cell


---------03:22----------
you need to have one mutation and then


---------03:24----------
you need to have a second mutation


---------03:25----------
and those mutations together will cause


---------03:28----------
cancer


---------03:30----------
so i think that most people may have


---------03:32----------
some predisposition


---------03:34----------
or a high risk to develop a mental


---------03:36----------
illness


---------03:37----------
and then when some circumstances happen


---------03:40----------
so for bipolar


---------03:42----------
disorder for example things like


---------03:44----------
substance use or really just not


---------03:46----------
sleeping


---------03:46----------
well for a couple of weeks or even a few


---------03:49----------
days pulling a few all-nighters


---------03:52----------
can really result in the manifestation


---------03:54----------
of bipolar disorder


---------03:57----------
does that answer your question or was it


---------03:58----------
too good yeah yeah no that was really


---------04:00----------
that was really in-depth and yeah yeah


---------04:02----------
that made sense um


---------04:04----------
i i remember talking to my doctor


---------04:06----------
because i didn't want to take medication


---------04:08----------
yep and he um she said that


---------04:11----------
i had to because like if i don't sleep


---------04:14----------
then that causes like my mania even more


---------04:17----------
yeah i didn't see that as a big thing


---------04:20----------
because like all teenagers are all like


---------04:22----------
young adults sleep late i thought that


---------04:24----------
was like a normal thing it is a normal


---------04:25----------
thing


---------04:27----------
so this is it's a great point right so


---------04:29----------
here's the the thing right so this is


---------04:31----------
what i mean about the intersection


---------04:33----------
about an environmental factor and a


---------04:35----------
genetic factor


---------04:36----------
so all teenagers have screwed up sleep


---------04:38----------
schedules


---------04:40----------
the difference is that most teenagers


---------04:42----------
don't have that genetic risk


---------04:44----------
which is why they can have the


---------04:45----------
environmental influence and be


---------04:46----------
completely fine


---------04:48----------
but when you combine that environmental


---------04:50----------
influence with the genetic risk


---------04:54----------
that's when you get an illness


---------04:59----------
so i'll give you just one last example


---------05:01----------
so let's think about alcohol


---------05:03----------
right so alcohol has also gets


---------05:06----------
inherited to a certain degree so if you


---------05:08----------
have parents that are alcoholics you're


---------05:09----------
more likely to be an alcoholic


---------05:11----------
and you know people who are 21


---------05:15----------
drink a lot and not all of them become


---------05:18----------
alcoholics why


---------05:20----------
so when you have an alcoholic a strong


---------05:22----------
history of alcoholism in your family and


---------05:23----------
you start drinking a lot when you're 21


---------05:25----------
you're much more likely to become


---------05:27----------
alcoholic than someone who doesn't have


---------05:29----------
a family history of alcoholism


---------05:31----------
the other interesting thing that's also


---------05:32----------
true is that if you have a strong family


---------05:34----------
history of alcoholism and you don't


---------05:36----------
drink it all


---------05:37----------
then do you become an alcoholic


---------05:41----------
what do you think wait sorry can you say


---------05:43----------
that again i kind of felt it yeah


---------05:45----------
so if if you have a family history of


---------05:47----------
alcoholism


---------05:49----------
and you don't drink it all do you become


---------05:50----------
an alcoholic


---------05:52----------
no you become an alcoholic yeah right so


---------05:55----------
when it comes to bipolar


---------05:57----------
uh people who have a diagnosis of


---------05:59----------
bipolar disorder


---------06:02----------
if you can control your sleep then the


---------06:04----------
disease for the most part


---------06:06----------
may actually like kind of go away


---------06:08----------
because there are certain risk factors


---------06:09----------
that trigger


---------06:11----------
the disease


---------06:15----------
and um when you're diagnosed does that


---------06:18----------
usually mean for


---------06:19----------
certain or is that like because i've


---------06:21----------
been diagnosed with


---------06:22----------
so many different things and i'm not


---------06:24----------
sure like what


---------06:26----------
what i have or if like if i even have


---------06:28----------
bipolar


---------06:30----------
do you mind if i ask are you diagnosed


---------06:31----------
by polar one or bipolar ii


---------06:33----------
um did they tell you that but


---------06:36----------
yeah they said probably one but i'm not


---------06:39----------
even sure what the difference is between


---------06:40----------
one


---------06:41----------
two and cyclothymia i think that's all


---------06:43----------
okay


---------06:44----------
we'll talk about that okay so here's the


---------06:47----------
first thing


---------06:48----------
so i once had a one of my very wise


---------06:51----------
mentors


---------06:52----------
once told me that if someone has three


---------06:53----------
psychiatric diagnoses they're all wrong


---------06:57----------
okay so so what we do is psychiatrists


---------07:00----------
sometimes is we tend to like label


---------07:02----------
people


---------07:03----------
and then we don't really take label


---------07:04----------
people we don't take labels off


---------07:06----------
we tend to just slap people with more


---------07:08----------
diagnoses they're like oh you're bipolar


---------07:10----------
and you have adhd


---------07:11----------
and you have anxiety i don't think so


---------07:14----------
and so that goes to the nature of


---------07:16----------
psychiatric diagnosis which is that


---------07:18----------
it's kind of bad so like


---------07:21----------
we don't have a test right so if you


---------07:23----------
think about like cancer


---------07:25----------
or like covid we have tests that you can


---------07:29----------
objectively verify


---------07:31----------
whether this person has this illness or


---------07:33----------
not


---------07:35----------
but i can't do a blood test i can't do


---------07:36----------
an x-ray


---------07:38----------
i can't do any of that stuff to tell you


---------07:41----------
definitively that you have bipolar


---------07:42----------
disorder


---------07:44----------
so psychiatric diagnosis is one of


---------07:46----------
observation


---------07:47----------
and guesswork and so what we do


---------07:50----------
generally speaking with in psychiatric


---------07:52----------
diagnoses is that we have some criteria


---------07:54----------
and if people check those boxes they're


---------07:57----------
more


---------07:58----------
likely to have the illness but there are


---------08:00----------
some people who will check the boxes


---------08:02----------
and not have the illness like that's


---------08:03----------
possible too because it's just checking


---------08:05----------
boxes right it's like


---------08:06----------
so for depression for example changes in


---------08:09----------
sleep


---------08:11----------
um so being sad


---------08:14----------
changes in sleep feeling guilty


---------08:17----------
having changes in your energy being


---------08:20----------
either psycho


---------08:21----------
motorically agitated or depressed which


---------08:23----------
means like


---------08:24----------
you kind of like her like this or you're


---------08:27----------
like fidgety


---------08:28----------
um you know changes in concentration


---------08:32----------
suicidal thinking and the more of those


---------08:34----------
you have the more likely you are to be


---------08:35----------
depressed but


---------08:36----------
you can be sad and suicidal and actually


---------08:38----------
not have clinical depression


---------08:40----------
it's possible so it doesn't mean that


---------08:43----------
the diagnoses are right


---------08:44----------
it's really an issue in medicine what we


---------08:46----------
call clinical judgment


---------08:48----------
as opposed to objective testing


---------08:51----------
and sometimes our judgment is wrong


---------08:53----------
because like you know we don't have


---------08:55----------
perfect information


---------08:56----------
because the information that we rely on


---------08:58----------
is like what you tell us


---------09:00----------
or what your family members tell us


---------09:03----------
and that could be biased right so not


---------09:06----------
only do we have a list of check boxes


---------09:10----------
but then like you know we don't have


---------09:12----------
perfect information


---------09:13----------
so sometimes we're wrong


---------09:17----------
do you feel like your psychiatrist


---------09:18----------
understands you as a person


---------09:20----------
yes i like my psychiatrist just a lot


---------09:22----------
then i would trust what they had to say


---------09:24----------
yeah you know somebody misdiagnosed me


---------09:28----------
with other things


---------09:29----------
before so like sometimes well it's also


---------09:31----------
because i


---------09:32----------
haven't been that honest sometimes


---------09:34----------
because i wasn't very comfortable


---------09:36----------
with soda


---------09:39----------
that probably makes sense but like i


---------09:41----------
know this sounds bizarre but this


---------09:43----------
the sign of a good psychiatrist is one


---------09:46----------
who changes your diagnosis


---------09:48----------
that tells me that your psychiatrist is


---------09:50----------
being thoughtful


---------09:51----------
and is willing to accept that they were


---------09:53----------
wrong about something


---------09:55----------
and they're actively interpreting new


---------09:57----------
information


---------09:58----------
and reformulating you as a person which


---------10:02----------
is actually good


---------10:03----------
like that makes me confident in your


---------10:04----------
psychiatrist yeah i took a while for


---------10:06----------
that because like i've had a lot of


---------10:08----------
experiences with other psychiatrists


---------10:10----------
when i was like


---------10:11----------
because i i've been getting looking for


---------10:13----------
help since or getting therapy and like


---------10:16----------
and stuff since i was like 16 but


---------10:20----------
i've keep getting my case closed and


---------10:22----------
just being sent to the mental hospital


---------10:24----------
and like they didn't diagnose me and


---------10:25----------
they just give me medication


---------10:27----------
and make me take it and then yeah it was


---------10:29----------
just it was just crazy


---------10:31----------
so like i don't know if


---------10:34----------
i did anything wrong or if it was a


---------10:36----------
system that was wrong


---------10:37----------
or if i said something wrong but it's


---------10:39----------
just it was crazy


---------10:41----------
why do you assume that something wrong


---------10:43----------
happened


---------10:44----------
maybe i i said something that or i


---------10:47----------
over exaggerated my situation like


---------10:51----------
and it wasn't as bad as it was maybe but


---------10:54----------
why do you assume that you over


---------10:56----------
exaggerated why do you assume i mean the


---------10:58----------
system's not great


---------11:00----------
but yeah like sometimes i feel like i


---------11:02----------
just say things


---------11:03----------
because i want attention okay i


---------11:06----------
exaggerated just a little bit


---------11:08----------
because i want someone to like pay


---------11:10----------
attention to me


---------11:11----------
because i'm lonely or something


---------11:14----------
yep yeah i think that's very insightful


---------11:17----------
of


---------11:17----------
you to realize right most people go


---------11:20----------
their entire life without


---------11:21----------
without ever realizing that [ __ ]


---------11:24----------
and they're like 60 and cause problems


---------11:26----------
with their kids and


---------11:28----------
grandkids and become a strange because


---------11:29----------
they never recognize that there are


---------11:31----------
parts of themselves


---------11:33----------
that do things that may not be healthy


---------11:37----------
so i still think it's great that you


---------11:39----------
recognize that maybe you are doing that


---------11:40----------
and also maybe you weren't exaggerating


---------11:43----------
yeah i can't tell because like at the


---------11:45----------
time it doesn't feel like


---------11:47----------
it is but when i look back it's like oh


---------11:48----------
my god i was so


---------11:50----------
like dramatic yeah so


---------11:53----------
that sometimes happens with people who


---------11:55----------
are bipolar


---------11:57----------
is the way that you think changes


---------12:01----------
right so like you we have this


---------12:02----------
instrument of mind with which we


---------12:04----------
judge the world and part of the problem


---------12:07----------
especially with mania is that the


---------12:09----------
instrument that


---------12:10----------
we use to judge whether saying something


---------12:12----------
is okay or doing something is okay


---------12:14----------
changes


---------12:16----------
and looking back on it it seems like


---------12:18----------
kind of


---------12:20----------
nuts to other people but to us it feels


---------12:22----------
completely normal


---------12:23----------
in fact we feel very confident


---------12:26----------
yeah and that that the rest of the world


---------12:29----------
is really really wrong


---------12:31----------
yeah i feel like sometimes the rest of


---------12:32----------
the world like doesn't understand and


---------12:34----------
they don't


---------12:35----------
like i'm at a whole new level or


---------12:36----------
something yeah that sounds like my


---------12:38----------
bullet disorder


---------12:39----------
yeah cause um i don't i don't know if


---------12:43----------
you you don't own or you don't like


---------12:45----------
manage your twitter right but i was


---------12:46----------
actually spamming you guys on twitter


---------12:49----------
because i was just like oh my god like


---------12:50----------
maybe if i keep messaging this person


---------12:52----------
like i'll have like


---------12:54----------
an interview or something so i kind of


---------12:56----------
feel bad about that


---------12:57----------
i don't i don't know most of i don't


---------12:59----------
even know how to use twitter


---------13:01----------
oh but i you know


---------13:05----------
i think it's okay i apologize to whoever


---------13:07----------
is managing


---------13:09----------
yeah they must have gotten a lot of


---------13:11----------
notifications just like


---------13:12----------
on on their behalf i forgive you


---------13:16----------
thank you and and i i at the same time i


---------13:19----------
don't want to tell people that it's okay


---------13:21----------
to hammer


---------13:22----------
yeah i don't because i i don't i don't


---------13:24----------
want them to have to do


---------13:25----------
i don't want that to happen so i i don't


---------13:28----------
like i kind of feel guilty that


---------13:30----------
that actually is why i have this


---------13:33----------
interview


---------13:34----------
with you i i don't honestly honestly


---------13:38----------
oreo i don't know how any of this [ __ ]


---------13:39----------
works


---------13:40----------
i just people people tell me to show up


---------13:43----------
and then i don't know


---------13:44----------
and then so i'm glad you're here though


---------13:46----------
because i think this is these are


---------13:47----------
excellent questions


---------13:49----------
thank you um so your question was


---------13:54----------
you know are do people get psychiatric


---------13:56----------
diagnosis wrong and


---------13:58----------
i would say i certainly hope so


---------14:02----------
i think that we i certainly hope that


---------14:04----------
most


---------14:05----------
psychiatrists out there don't label


---------14:07----------
someone with one thing and then just


---------14:09----------
assume that they're right


---------14:13----------
and is it possible to have like other


---------14:15----------
symptoms


---------14:16----------
to other disorders that like while


---------14:18----------
you're like manic


---------14:19----------
because like i was strangely like really


---------14:23----------
i thought i was i was like confident i


---------14:25----------
had ocd


---------14:27----------
sure for some reason because like i had


---------14:29----------
to do things a certain way and like


---------14:31----------
i had to like say things like a certain


---------14:33----------
amount of times and do things a certain


---------14:34----------
amount of times


---------14:35----------
in order for it to be valid


---------14:38----------
yeah that was really weird yeah so i


---------14:41----------
think that too is like so mania will


---------14:43----------
uncover


---------14:45----------
other things which like your normal mind


---------14:48----------
is able to manage


---------14:50----------
but when your mind becomes manic like


---------14:52----------
you just can't manage it the way like it


---------14:54----------
sort of becomes like


---------14:54----------
you know things and and yeah so i really


---------14:57----------
think about mania as like


---------14:59----------
turning the dial up to 100 and all kinds


---------15:02----------
of stuff


---------15:03----------
so it made turn up the dial in to 100 in


---------15:05----------
terms of like ocd symptoms


---------15:07----------
it can also turn the dial up to 100 in


---------15:10----------
terms of


---------15:11----------
energy and creativity so


---------15:14----------
the interesting thing is that if you


---------15:16----------
look at even harvard college has a


---------15:18----------
higher


---------15:19----------
incidence of bipolar disorder than the


---------15:21----------
rest of the united states


---------15:23----------
and and the reason is because people who


---------15:25----------
are a little bit bipolar


---------15:27----------
can get away with only sleeping two to


---------15:30----------
four hours a night


---------15:31----------
and have lots of energy to study like


---------15:33----------
not a joke


---------15:35----------
no that's like really relatable actually


---------15:38----------
how so


---------15:39----------
i kind of now that i'm like evened out


---------15:43----------
and like calm i kind of miss being manic


---------15:45----------
because i was so productive and like


---------15:47----------
every idea that i had was like


---------15:49----------
amazing and ideas kept flowing and


---------15:52----------
that's usually when my channel started


---------15:54----------
growing as well as manic it's because i


---------15:57----------
posted a lot of videos a lot of content


---------15:59----------
on like popular things


---------16:01----------
and i didn't have any doubts yeah so


---------16:04----------
i've worked with


---------16:05----------
very successful artists


---------16:09----------
who have sometimes asked me


---------16:12----------
how can i use my bipolar disorder to


---------16:15----------
create more


---------16:17----------
and they've come to me and they've said


---------16:18----------
like hey i want to stop taking


---------16:19----------
medications for a certain amount of time


---------16:21----------
and i want to create


---------16:23----------
and then can you put me back on them


---------16:24----------
after a month because i'm not feeling my


---------16:27----------
creative energy do you ever think about


---------16:28----------
that


---------16:29----------
yeah that's why i actually wanted to


---------16:32----------
stop taking my medications because it


---------16:34----------
made me feel sleepy


---------16:35----------
but my doctor was like no yeah


---------16:38----------
and how do you feel about that um i


---------16:40----------
think


---------16:41----------
it makes sense because i even though i


---------16:43----------
felt really good


---------16:44----------
and i i was at the best state of mind in


---------16:48----------
my


---------16:49----------
or that's what i thought like other


---------16:50----------
people were having a hard time like my


---------16:52----------
parents like they were really worried


---------16:54----------
about me because


---------16:55----------
for some reason i had this strange


---------16:57----------
obsession with america's got talent


---------16:59----------
comedy and um howie mandel


---------17:04----------
and i was like i have to go to america's


---------17:06----------
got talent audition for comedy


---------17:07----------
specifically


---------17:08----------
and meet howie mandel and touch his bald


---------17:10----------
head


---------17:11----------
specifically i don't know why yeah that


---------17:14----------
certainly


---------17:15----------
does sound i mean so i understand you


---------17:17----------
already have a diagnosis and just to be


---------17:18----------
clear


---------17:19----------
clear you know so it's good that you're


---------17:20----------
in treatment because otherwise it would


---------17:21----------
terrify me


---------17:22----------
because i don't diagnose people over the


---------17:24----------
internet but this really does sound to


---------17:26----------
me like


---------17:27----------
mania like it sounds like that's an


---------17:29----------
appropriate diagnosis


---------17:30----------
um one question so one reason that


---------17:33----------
bipolar disorder gets misdiagnosed a lot


---------17:36----------
is if people are using substances so i


---------17:40----------
i would normally ask you do you use


---------17:42----------
substances but instead what i'm going to


---------17:43----------
ask you is


---------17:44----------
does your psychiatrist know truthfully


---------17:47----------
whether you use substances or not


---------17:50----------
we don't need to know what they need to


---------17:52----------
know okay


---------17:55----------
another thing is because i was


---------17:56----------
misdiagnosed with just depression


---------17:58----------
i was taking like the wrong medication


---------18:01----------
that actually made my mania even more


---------18:03----------
like


---------18:03----------
yeah so yeah unfortunately that is very


---------18:07----------
common


---------18:08----------
so the problem is that we can't diagnose


---------18:10----------
someone with bipolar so let's just talk


---------18:12----------
about depression and bipolar for a


---------18:13----------
second


---------18:14----------
people who are bipolar have periods of


---------18:16----------
depression and periods of mania


---------18:18----------
people who are depressed or may have


---------18:21----------
major depression


---------18:22----------
only have depression right does that


---------18:24----------
make sense


---------18:25----------
yeah so now like put yourself in the


---------18:27----------
shoes of a psychiatrist let's say


---------18:28----------
an 18 year old girl comes in and she is


---------18:31----------
depressed


---------18:34----------
does she have bipolar or is she does she


---------18:36----------
have depression


---------18:38----------
i guess we don't know exactly and that's


---------18:41----------
hard


---------18:42----------
yeah right so like we just don't feel


---------18:44----------
bad for my psychiatrist


---------18:47----------
i don't know i know it's their job but


---------18:48----------
it must be really difficult


---------18:50----------
it's a hard job it sounds like it is but


---------18:53----------
it's


---------18:54----------
worth it every every cent like i mean


---------18:57----------
it's worth it dude


---------18:58----------
because here's the thing like oreo


---------19:00----------
helping people like you is absolutely


---------19:02----------
worth it i don't want my job to be easy


---------19:04----------
i want you to get better i want you to


---------19:06----------
continue to create music


---------19:08----------
i want you to like live a happy and


---------19:10----------
fulfilling life where you take that


---------19:12----------
little bit of crazy deep inside you and


---------19:15----------
turn it into music which touches people


---------19:17----------
in a way that a completely sane person


---------19:18----------
cannot


---------19:20----------
so this is the other crazy thing is like


---------19:22----------
why does bipolar disorder exist


---------19:25----------
right so like why does it happen and i


---------19:27----------
i'm telling you that i think that some


---------19:28----------
of the most beautiful things that i've


---------19:30----------
seen


---------19:31----------
in terms of artistic creation happen


---------19:34----------
from people who


---------19:35----------
are on that bipolar spectrum in some way


---------19:38----------
shape or form doesn't mean that they're


---------19:39----------
actually man because i think when you're


---------19:40----------
fully manic


---------19:41----------
your mind is so like extreme that like


---------19:44----------
other people can't appreciate it


---------19:46----------
yeah but you're channeling like


---------19:49----------
something really powerful and when you


---------19:51----------
can get that under


---------19:52----------
control and like focus it on artistic


---------19:54----------
creation i genuinely think it's more


---------19:56----------
beautiful than what the average person


---------19:57----------
can make


---------20:00----------
which is


---------20:06----------
i realized i said something that is hard


---------20:08----------
to respond to


---------20:10----------
no it's just yeah i don't know if i


---------20:13----------
should take that as a compliment


---------20:14----------
or yeah like yeah


---------20:18----------
i i feel flattered okay


---------20:21----------
i mean i think it's just the truth of


---------20:22----------
your situation right it's it's


---------20:24----------
authentically like


---------20:25----------
it doesn't mean i mean on one hand


---------20:27----------
you're ill but i don't think it's all


---------20:29----------
bad


---------20:30----------
i do think that way too yeah like i


---------20:32----------
don't think it's something that people


---------20:33----------
should want


---------20:34----------
but at the same time if you have it like


---------20:36----------
i guess appreciate it


---------20:38----------
yeah yeah and i think keep it under


---------20:40----------
control because like i mean if you're


---------20:41----------
truly manic like


---------20:43----------
you're gonna make music and it's gonna


---------20:44----------
be such a mess


---------20:46----------
yeah dude i made him i made a song that


---------20:49----------
was called happy and then i just slammed


---------20:51----------
my keyboard like three times and that


---------20:53----------
was


---------20:53----------
the song it's because i'm so happy you


---------20:55----------
can't even


---------20:56----------
comprehend and they don't comprehend


---------20:59----------
right so that's actually not good music


---------21:02----------
even though in the mind of someone who's


---------21:03----------
manic it feels like good music


---------21:06----------
i thought everything was good yeah


---------21:10----------
so highly elevated mood is what mania


---------21:12----------
usually entails


---------21:14----------
like everything's perfect um


---------21:19----------
yeah i mean and uh other questions


---------21:23----------
and we're kind of bouncing around but i


---------21:25----------
have some for you but i want to make


---------21:26----------
sure we get


---------21:27----------
no i i'm pretty i got through everything


---------21:30----------
i wrote up a little doc just in case i


---------21:32----------
get


---------21:32----------
nervous and forget everything are you


---------21:35----------
feeling nervous


---------21:36----------
um at first i'm like


---------21:40----------
at first i was like really excited and


---------21:41----------
then all of a sudden i just got this


---------21:43----------
surge of nervousness you know the eminem


---------21:45----------
song like


---------21:46----------
palm sweaty knees weak mom's spaghetti


---------21:48----------
yeah that's how i feel


---------21:52----------
yeah that's just a sympathetic nervous


---------21:55----------
response that's adrenaline


---------21:58----------
yeah i feel like so much energy


---------22:01----------
okay so do you wanna should we just keep


---------22:03----------
talking through it or do you wanna like


---------22:05----------
meditate for a second or what do you


---------22:06----------
wanna do


---------22:07----------
um i i actually like talking so


---------22:10----------
okay i want to keep talking so do you


---------22:12----------
want to tell me about child on child


---------22:13----------
abuse then


---------22:15----------
uh yeah um recently or


---------22:19----------
it's gotten a lot better but i've been


---------22:21----------
having a lot of flashbacks about my


---------22:23----------
childhood


---------22:24----------
and um i know i just


---------22:28----------
want to talk more and learn more about


---------22:30----------
this because i can't find a lot of


---------22:32----------
resources


---------22:33----------
okay and i i feel like it's more common


---------22:36----------
than it is


---------22:37----------
like than i think it is okay yeah


---------22:40----------
and what are we talking about help me


---------22:42----------
understand what happened oh yeah


---------22:44----------
um so basically


---------22:48----------
when i was like nine or eight eight or


---------22:50----------
nine i moved to georgia


---------22:52----------
and i like lost all my friends because i


---------22:54----------
moved to a different state


---------22:56----------
and i met this girl who


---------23:00----------
said she'd be my friend but only if i do


---------23:03----------
certain things with her


---------23:06----------
and it was it was like a relationship


---------23:10----------
that i didn't really


---------23:13----------
want i guess okay


---------23:17----------
and she made me like there were times


---------23:19----------
where i was consensual but at the same


---------23:20----------
time it's like


---------23:22----------
aren't kids like not able to give


---------23:24----------
consent


---------23:26----------
yeah so when you say wanted to do things


---------23:29----------
do you mean like


---------23:30----------
intimate things yeah like really


---------23:32----------
inappropriate things like things like


---------23:34----------
normal kids don't do


---------23:36----------
okay and you were eight or nine and how


---------23:38----------
old was the other girl


---------23:40----------
um she was one year older okay so that's


---------23:43----------
kind of [ __ ] up


---------23:45----------
oh i've only told my close friends and


---------23:50----------
my family and they told me that


---------23:52----------
it was pretty normal and i didn't feel


---------23:54----------
that way about it


---------23:55----------
they said a lot of kids like play doctor


---------23:57----------
and stuff


---------23:58----------
but it didn't feel it felt like more


---------24:00----------
than that


---------24:02----------
okay so now i'm a little bit confused


---------24:03----------
because what you were describing to me


---------24:07----------
and because i when i said that's kind of


---------24:09----------
[ __ ] up i was expecting you to say


---------24:10----------
yeah but you seemed confused by my


---------24:12----------
answer


---------24:13----------
yeah because no one's really told me


---------24:16----------
that


---------24:16----------
or maybe a few of my friends but


---------24:19----------
everyone else is like yeah


---------24:20----------
that same stuff happened to me and they


---------24:23----------
kind of just


---------24:24----------
do you tell them what actually happened


---------24:26----------
to you


---------24:27----------
yeah in detail actually


---------24:31----------
not in detail because it's kind of


---------24:33----------
embarrassing for me for some reason


---------24:35----------
but i just say like they made me


---------24:38----------
uncomfortable


---------24:40----------
so i'm guessing what they think is


---------24:42----------
normal is not what actually happened to


---------24:44----------
you


---------24:45----------
but they're filling in so when you speak


---------24:48----------
oreo you're vague oh sorry


---------24:51----------
no no it's not it's i'm not asking you


---------24:53----------
to applaud i'm pointing it out to you


---------24:55----------
okay okay so like for example you said


---------24:57----------
there was a nine-year-old girl and she


---------24:58----------
said she would be my friend but only if


---------25:00----------
i do certain things


---------25:02----------
and i don't know if that means


---------25:06----------
so my wife used to play a game with her


---------25:08----------
sister called princess


---------25:10----------
and my wife was the older sister so she


---------25:13----------
would be the princess


---------25:14----------
and then her younger sister would be the


---------25:16----------
servant so she would just like run


---------25:18----------
around and like


---------25:18----------
get her candy and like that was the game


---------25:21----------
that they played right so


---------25:22----------
so i i don't know and i don't think i


---------25:24----------
mean i'm not trying to say that that was


---------25:25----------
anything inappropriate i think it's just


---------25:26----------
you know older sister being an older


---------25:28----------
sister but like when you say that


---------25:31----------
she said you know you can't be my friend


---------25:33----------
unless you do certain things like


---------25:35----------
i don't know if that means wear a


---------25:38----------
certain piece of clothing


---------25:39----------
or carry around her book bag or do her


---------25:42----------
homework for her


---------25:43----------
or something that's like it was like


---------25:46----------
sexual activity


---------25:47----------
yeah so that's really bizarre for eight


---------25:50----------
and nine-year-olds to engage in


---------25:52----------
so generally speaking if you take an


---------25:53----------
average nine-year-old off the street


---------25:55----------
they don't really engage in too much


---------25:56----------
sexual activity


---------25:58----------
usually engaging in sexual activity as a


---------26:00----------
nine-year-old or ten-year-old


---------26:02----------
is like the you know that sh that's a


---------26:05----------
red flag as a


---------26:06----------
is a treater for sexual abuse


---------26:10----------
because how does a nine-year-old learn


---------26:12----------
how to be sexual


---------26:15----------
through other people i guess absolutely


---------26:18----------
right that's where our kids learn


---------26:21----------
like so you know my kids want to be


---------26:24----------
princess


---------26:24----------
queen elsa because they watch frozen all


---------26:27----------
the time and that's what they run around


---------26:28----------
and that's what they pretend to be


---------26:30----------
and so what kids tend to pretend to be


---------26:32----------
is like


---------26:34----------
what they see


---------26:38----------
i had my kid recently put her sheepy in


---------26:41----------
timeout


---------26:42----------
and where did she learn to put her


---------26:44----------
stuffed animals in timeout it's because


---------26:45----------
she gets put in timeout


---------26:46----------
when she spent it so it sounds to me


---------26:49----------
like this person


---------26:51----------
you know i that's a red flag in my mind


---------26:53----------
that this person


---------26:54----------
themselves was abused


---------26:57----------
yeah i think so too but going back to


---------27:01----------
what we were talking about so i think


---------27:02----------
when people say they you know it's


---------27:04----------
normal for kids to play doctor it's also


---------27:06----------
i mean i agree it's normal for kids to


---------27:07----------
play doctor


---------27:08----------
but it sounds like what happened between


---------27:11----------
you and this girl was more than playing


---------27:13----------
doctor and if you're being vague


---------27:17----------
then what they're gonna assume is their


---------27:19----------
experience as a kid


---------27:22----------
so do you know like what words you use


---------27:24----------
to describe this when you're explaining


---------27:26----------
it to other people


---------27:28----------
probably the same thing i i'm not i


---------27:31----------
don't remember


---------27:32----------
exactly but the same way i was pretty


---------27:34----------
vague yeah yeah


---------27:35----------
right so it's like i don't know what


---------27:37----------
that means


---------27:38----------
yeah i mean so oh sorry i was just gonna


---------27:41----------
say like so in our case we have an


---------27:43----------
advantage because at the beginning of


---------27:44----------
the conversation you said


---------27:46----------
i tried to google child on child abuse


---------27:48----------
and i didn't see anything


---------27:49----------
so that sets a tone for all of the vague


---------27:52----------
stuff you say afterward right does that


---------27:53----------
make sense


---------27:54----------
so we sort of assume that think


---------27:56----------
something here is not kosher but unless


---------27:57----------
you say that


---------27:58----------
to the other people they're going to


---------28:01----------
interpret it like


---------28:03----------
in a non-threatening kind of way


---------28:07----------
do you think um yeah go ahead sorry no


---------28:10----------
it's just i've told my parents


---------28:12----------
specifically and they thought it was my


---------28:14----------
mom didn't think it was


---------28:16----------
normal but my dad was like oh that's


---------28:17----------
just what kids do you know and i was


---------28:19----------
just like


---------28:20----------
really and


---------28:23----------
yeah i think he it's also because she's


---------28:26----------
a really


---------28:26----------
close like her dad is a close friend of


---------28:29----------
my dad's


---------28:31----------
and she he didn't want anything to


---------28:32----------
happen


---------28:34----------
because i was like angry to the point


---------28:37----------
where i actually was thinking about


---------28:39----------
taking this to court


---------28:40----------
because i felt like i felt like i lost


---------28:44----------
something like in my childhood like


---------28:47----------
my innocence you know yeah


---------28:52----------
how do you feel right now saying that um


---------28:54----------
just


---------28:56----------
a little angry but at the same time i


---------29:00----------
i feel like i shouldn't feel angry


---------29:02----------
because


---------29:03----------
i don't know i i want to blame that


---------29:05----------
other person


---------29:06----------
but like i can't because she probably


---------29:09----------
went through


---------29:10----------
something too and she didn't know what


---------29:12----------
she was doing


---------29:14----------
what's wrong like she didn't know that


---------29:16----------
what she was doing was probably wrong


---------29:20----------
yeah that doesn't mean you can't blame


---------29:21----------
her


---------29:24----------
right so so like this is a weird thing


---------29:25----------
okay oreo


---------29:27----------
but like let's say that so i've worked


---------29:30----------
with you know patients who have


---------29:33----------
had suffered from abuse by their parents


---------29:37----------
and they also hope


---------29:40----------
as part of that healing process they


---------29:42----------
learn about their parents and sometimes


---------29:43----------
it involves family therapy and they


---------29:45----------
learn that


---------29:46----------
you know part of the reason why their


---------29:47----------
parents were abusive was because they in


---------29:49----------
turn were abused


---------29:50----------
and interestingly enough usually like


---------29:52----------
the abuse actually gets


---------29:54----------
better with each generation like their


---------29:57----------
parents had it way worse


---------29:58----------
than they treated their kid and so it's


---------30:02----------
it's an interesting


---------30:03----------
kind of tightrope to walk to say


---------30:06----------
i understand that you had some things in


---------30:08----------
your past which like pushed you in a


---------30:10----------
certain direction


---------30:12----------
and also like you could have not done


---------30:15----------
that


---------30:16----------
and you didn't but


---------30:19----------
i feel like she didn't understand like


---------30:22----------
what it meant


---------30:23----------
in a way sure i i don't think she did


---------30:25----------
but that doesn't mean that you can't be


---------30:27----------
angry at her


---------30:28----------
oh right so like like let me just say


---------30:32----------
like let's say that two kids are playing


---------30:34----------
and then they like


---------30:35----------
like they're gonna play mermaids


---------30:38----------
and then they decide to go into a pool


---------30:40----------
of water and then like


---------30:42----------
you know like or they fight or let's say


---------30:45----------
they fight


---------30:46----------
and then you know they don't they don't


---------30:47----------
recognize that they're fighting because


---------30:49----------
they're playing teenage mutant ninja


---------30:50----------
turtles so they like


---------30:51----------
grab two sticks and they start hitting


---------30:53----------
each other and one of them smacks the


---------30:54----------
other one across the face


---------30:56----------
because that's what they do in teenage


---------30:57----------
they're like playing martial arts


---------30:59----------
and even though they didn't intend to


---------31:01----------
hurt that doesn't change the fact that


---------31:02----------
the person who got smacked across the


---------31:04----------
face with a stick


---------31:05----------
is genuinely hurt and if they lose a


---------31:08----------
tooth


---------31:10----------
then like that hurt stays with them


---------31:14----------
even if the child didn't know what


---------31:16----------
happened


---------31:18----------
and what i'm sensing from you is that


---------31:20----------
like you lost something


---------31:23----------
and even if she didn't mean it it


---------31:25----------
doesn't mean that you didn't lose


---------31:26----------
something


---------31:31----------
and it feels okay to be to be angry that


---------31:34----------
you lost something that you shouldn't


---------31:36----------
have


---------31:38----------
feels unfair


---------31:42----------
unjust you may also be angry with your


---------31:45----------
parents


---------31:47----------
are you yeah


---------31:50----------
not my mom but more my dad because my


---------31:52----------
mom was really understanding and


---------31:54----------
she she actually apologized because she


---------31:58----------
said she didn't she thought there was


---------32:00----------
nothing


---------32:01----------
that could possibly go wrong with two


---------32:03----------
kids you know


---------32:06----------
and yeah i'm just more angry at my dad i


---------32:09----------
guess


---------32:10----------
yeah what are you angry at him for


---------32:13----------
for not understanding


---------32:17----------
yeah and


---------32:20----------
to defend someone that hurt me


---------32:27----------
yeah like i feel like he should


---------32:33----------
take my side like no matter what because


---------32:35----------
i'm his daughter


---------32:38----------
but but another thing is like i keep


---------32:40----------
comfort like


---------32:42----------
having like conflicting conflicting


---------32:44----------
thoughts because like my dad's been


---------32:46----------
through a lot


---------32:47----------
my dad's actually handicapped and he's


---------32:50----------
um he's been in the hospital for 19


---------32:52----------
years so i could understand why he's


---------32:55----------
like


---------32:56----------
really he like i don't know i feel like


---------33:00----------
my problems are like less


---------33:03----------
in a sense so maybe that's why he


---------33:07----------
can understand i don't know


---------33:13----------
can i think for a second yeah


---------33:34----------
takes a lot of courage to say this stuff


---------33:42----------
do you feel courageous not really


---------33:45----------
i just feel like i'm stating what


---------33:48----------
happened


---------33:49----------
like when i think of courageous i think


---------33:51----------
of like superheroes saving like


---------33:54----------
a cat from a like getting run over by a


---------33:58----------
truck


---------34:00----------
i can understand that and when i think


---------34:04----------
about some of the most courageous people


---------34:05----------
in the history of humanity


---------34:08----------
some of them just said what happened


---------34:12----------
right yeah so it's interesting


---------34:16----------
[Laughter]


---------34:18----------
yeah that's true it's interesting how


---------34:22----------
sometimes we can't see ourselves


---------34:24----------
the way that we deserve to be seen


---------34:30----------
maybe you should reevaluate your


---------34:32----------
diagnosis of yourself


---------34:35----------
and how awesome you are


---------34:39----------
so


---------34:43----------
oreo we have a couple of different


---------34:44----------
directions to go


---------34:48----------
um since you are thankfully in treatment


---------34:50----------
do you talk to your psychiatrist about


---------34:51----------
this stuff by the way


---------34:53----------
i'm not my psychiatrist but i'm thinking


---------34:55----------
of telling my therapist because my


---------34:57----------
i try to talk to my psychiatrist and


---------34:59----------
she's like you should talk to this


---------35:01----------
with your therapist okay so it sounds


---------35:03----------
like your psychiatrist mostly manages


---------35:05----------
your medication


---------35:06----------
yeah okay so i would highly recommend


---------35:09----------
that


---------35:10----------
so we have a couple of options so what


---------35:12----------
i'd like to do is actually teach you


---------35:14----------
something that's a little bit more


---------35:16----------
eastern because i'm noticing that your


---------35:18----------
mind is doing a couple of things


---------35:21----------
and i'd like to teach you maybe


---------35:22----------
something that's not so much talking


---------35:24----------
about


---------35:25----------
this particular thing but


---------35:30----------
you seem conflicted to me


---------35:34----------
about the way that you feel what do you


---------35:37----------
think


---------35:38----------
yeah i can see that it's very conflicted


---------35:42----------
do you feel conflicted


---------35:45----------
so what i'd like to help you do is maybe


---------35:47----------
get to some sense of peace


---------35:49----------
over that conflict and this has really


---------35:51----------
nothing to do with


---------35:53----------
what happened to you in a sense it all


---------35:54----------
has to do with how does a human being


---------35:57----------
who feels conflicted about something


---------35:59----------
come to peace with their inner conflict


---------36:03----------
or what we can do is talk more


---------36:06----------
about the actual child on child abuse


---------36:09----------
and your


---------36:10----------
your your feelings and whether they're


---------36:13----------
justified and explore those


---------36:15----------
but i think a therapist can do that


---------36:19----------
what what do you think i mean do you


---------36:21----------
wanna do you wanna i actually


---------36:23----------
do have one more thing i want to mention


---------36:25----------
because i have another incident


---------36:27----------
when i was um around 12 or 13 when i was


---------36:31----------
at korea


---------36:32----------
by another family member and


---------36:36----------
that also felt similar in a sense


---------36:38----------
because


---------36:40----------
they were my family member and i didn't


---------36:44----------
i couldn't it's just conflicting because


---------36:46----------
i couldn't tell if they were dude like


---------36:48----------
they had ill intent and they were


---------36:49----------
doing something wrong or if they were


---------36:51----------
genuinely like


---------36:53----------
just trying to help me i guess


---------36:56----------
oh sorry i was vague again good you


---------36:59----------
noticed


---------37:00----------
yeah um basically what happened was


---------37:04----------
while i was sleeping


---------37:05----------
um this was next to my mom and my


---------37:07----------
brother we all shared one bed


---------37:08----------
because there was only one room um my


---------37:11----------
uncle


---------37:11----------
came in and he


---------37:15----------
started to massage my leg and everyone


---------37:17----------
else was sleeping


---------37:18----------
he started massaging my leg and i


---------37:21----------
remembered like my parents telling me he


---------37:23----------
does this thing where he like massages


---------37:24----------
people because he's really good at it or


---------37:26----------
something but then


---------37:28----------
it made me really uncomfortable because


---------37:29----------
he he did it at night


---------37:32----------
and without telling me and then he


---------37:34----------
slowly like went up


---------37:36----------
and started touching me in places where


---------37:37----------
like made me feel really uncomfortable


---------37:43----------
yeah that doesn't sound kosher to me


---------37:46----------
yeah


---------37:47----------
but again my dad comes in place here


---------37:50----------
because my dad was like oh no he's just


---------37:52----------
massaging you like that's like


---------37:54----------
a thing he does because he's really good


---------37:57----------
at it or something and i was just like


---------37:59----------
but


---------38:00----------
i mean it didn't has he ever massaged


---------38:04----------
your dad's dick


---------38:08----------
no i don't think so but my mom told me


---------38:11----------
she had a similar experience


---------38:13----------
with me like with not with me but like


---------38:16----------
that with what happened to me the guy


---------38:20----------
sounds like he's


---------38:21----------
he's holding back and should be giving


---------38:23----------
the same service to his male clients too


---------38:32----------
like i mean i don't mean to be an


---------38:33----------
[ __ ] but like that doesn't sound like


---------38:35----------
a massage to me


---------38:41----------
right so i think that's where once again


---------38:43----------
maybe


---------38:44----------
so we're i'm noticing a couple of


---------38:46----------
disturbing patterns


---------38:48----------
one is so one is it could be vague right


---------38:52----------
so it could be the vagueness and because


---------38:54----------
like maybe he's massaged your dad's


---------38:56----------
upper thigh but never like


---------38:58----------
crossed the barrier from thigh to like


---------39:00----------
scrotum like that's


---------39:01----------
maybe right and it sounds like he really


---------39:04----------
did touch you in places that were


---------39:05----------
inappropriate and i think generally


---------39:07----------
speaking i would trust your instinct


---------39:09----------
about that


---------39:11----------
and it also sounds like it happened to


---------39:13----------
your mom


---------39:15----------
and you know so like i would trust your


---------39:18----------
instinct about that like i forget the


---------39:20----------
exact statistics but


---------39:22----------
you know most people who molest children


---------39:25----------
or people who are like close to them in


---------39:27----------
some way


---------39:28----------
it's not like strangers off the street


---------39:30----------
it's like family members and [ __ ]


---------39:32----------
and that's really sad


---------39:35----------
and then the other thing that i'm i'm


---------39:37----------
noticing is that that like you know


---------39:39----------
i'm curious oreo how did you feel when


---------39:41----------
your dad


---------39:42----------
said he does that to everyone


---------39:47----------
i cried like really


---------39:50----------
yeah it's just really upsetting because


---------39:53----------
i don't think he


---------39:54----------
maybe it's because i was vague but i


---------39:55----------
don't think he understood like


---------39:58----------
how uncomfortable it made me feel and


---------40:01----------
how like


---------40:01----------
the boundaries he crossed and what made


---------40:04----------
it hard for you to tell your dad


---------40:07----------
i think not only because he's a dude


---------40:12----------
because that's also a bit uncomfortable


---------40:16----------
but


---------40:17----------
i feel like he's been through so much


---------40:20----------
worse


---------40:20----------
and yeah i don't know i just keep


---------40:23----------
comparing


---------40:24----------
like i don't want to make it a


---------40:25----------
competition but like


---------40:27----------
that's what we're gonna get to yeah so


---------40:30----------
we'll get to


---------40:31----------
that's sort of the eastern thing that i


---------40:32----------
feel guilty because like


---------40:34----------
everything else is in my life is like


---------40:35----------
fine like i have a great family


---------40:37----------
i have a lot of friends and i have a


---------40:40----------
great job


---------40:41----------
but it's just little things i feel like


---------40:44----------
what do you feel guilty for


---------40:47----------
guilty for not being happy


---------40:51----------
sometimes when i have like


---------40:55----------
so much privilege i feel like i know


---------40:59----------
a lot of a lot of people tell me because


---------41:01----------
i'm


---------41:03----------
asian american i have a lot of privilege


---------41:07----------
even though like i'm like what the only


---------41:08----------
minority that has like privilege because


---------41:11----------
like my family's well off and no one's


---------41:13----------
really racist against


---------41:15----------
asians or something i don't know like


---------41:17----------
like


---------41:18----------
i don't know i it's just i heard a lot


---------41:20----------
of things


---------41:23----------
yeah so i how do you feel when they say


---------41:26----------
that


---------41:27----------
i think it's so wrong


---------41:31----------
because i don't it doesn't matter if


---------41:34----------
you're like whatever


---------41:35----------
what what the color of your skin is or


---------41:36----------
what race you are i think everyone has


---------41:39----------
like their own story to tell in their


---------41:41----------
own issues but


---------41:43----------
every time that gets like put down


---------41:47----------
i kind of lose hope yep


---------41:50----------
and i can understand why it's almost


---------41:52----------
like i mean it's weird because there's


---------41:53----------
an interesting parallel there between


---------41:55----------
your dad and what people tell you which


---------41:57----------
is that you're not allowed to feel the


---------41:59----------
way that you


---------42:00----------
you do you're wrong oreo


---------42:04----------
you're mistaken that your feelings of


---------42:07----------
suffering


---------42:08----------
and hurt are incorrect


---------42:12----------
you're a bad korean girl for feeling


---------42:15----------
[Laughter]


---------42:17----------
right


---------42:20----------
i think indian people are pretty similar


---------42:22----------
there


---------42:23----------
what are you complaining about um


---------42:26----------
just i don't know i don't think


---------42:30----------
i'm complaining it's just things that


---------42:33----------
upset me in the past


---------42:34----------
i mean i was i was being uh facetious i


---------42:38----------
was playing a character


---------42:39----------
oh oh okay i think you have every right


---------42:42----------
to complain


---------42:43----------
i mean i think so like this is the


---------42:44----------
challenge right with privilege which


---------42:46----------
maybe is a conversation for a different


---------42:48----------
day but so as someone who's a clinician


---------42:51----------
it's hard for me to i mean we'll talk


---------42:54----------
so i think this all actually goes back


---------42:56----------
to the central concept which i want to


---------42:58----------
teach you about


---------42:59----------
so hold on comparison


---------43:06----------
okay but i think it's like hard because


---------43:09----------
like you know you look at things like


---------43:10----------
white male privilege


---------43:12----------
and there's certainly some data to


---------43:14----------
suggest support that right like so if


---------43:15----------
you're like a white person versus a


---------43:17----------
black person you get pulled over by a


---------43:18----------
police officer


---------43:20----------
the way that the police officer like


---------43:21----------
your odds do get influenced by your race


---------43:24----------
so that's true and at the same time 68


---------43:28----------
to 69 percent


---------43:29----------
of people who kill themselves in this


---------43:31----------
country are white men


---------43:34----------
so it's like where's the privilege


---------43:37----------
there right so like people assume and


---------43:40----------
we'll get to this


---------43:42----------
so in your case like i think you do have


---------43:44----------
advantages and you do have a lot to be


---------43:45----------
grateful for


---------43:47----------
that does not somewhere along the way


---------43:49----------
like privilege became like


---------43:51----------
about one axis and that just doesn't


---------43:53----------
make sense to me


---------43:54----------
it's like sure you have a lot of


---------43:56----------
privilege and i think you should be


---------43:57----------
grateful for that i certainly have a


---------43:58----------
hell of a lot of privilege


---------43:59----------
and i'm grateful for that and at the


---------44:02----------
same time that doesn't


---------44:03----------
invalidate the fact that it sounds like


---------44:05----------
you were sexually molested by two people


---------44:07----------
have bipolar disorder and like your


---------44:09----------
family didn't take it seriously


---------44:12----------
like the fact that you're [ __ ] korean


---------44:14----------
doesn't


---------44:15----------
change that horrible truth that you have


---------44:18----------
to deal with


---------44:19----------
and in the grand scheme of things i


---------44:21----------
don't think it makes up for it either


---------44:25----------
you know like do you have particular


---------44:26----------
advantages because you're korean like


---------44:28----------
absolutely sure


---------44:30----------
should you be grateful for those


---------44:31----------
absolutely sure should you help other


---------44:34----------
people who don't have those kinds of


---------44:35----------
advantages


---------44:36----------
absolutely sure but it doesn't mean that


---------44:39----------
you don't get to suffer too


---------44:43----------
right your privilege does not give


---------44:46----------
other people the license to invalidate


---------44:50----------
who you are as a person which is i think


---------44:53----------
one of the saddest things that's


---------44:54----------
happened to you


---------44:56----------
like the really crushing thing if i can


---------44:59----------
just go there for a second


---------45:02----------
what happened to you is bad but what


---------45:05----------
really i think is the loss of innocence


---------45:07----------
is not what happened to you it's the way


---------45:08----------
that your dad responded


---------45:11----------
right because like what a dad is


---------45:13----------
supposed to do in that situation is


---------45:14----------
protect his little girl


---------45:16----------
and that didn't happen and that's what


---------45:18----------
hurts


---------45:20----------
like that's what hurts me it's like i


---------45:21----------
know [ __ ] happens but like


---------45:23----------
when someone who's supposed to take care


---------45:25----------
of you doesn't take care of you and in


---------45:26----------
fact


---------45:27----------
protects your abuser that's what feels


---------45:30----------
bad to me


---------45:33----------
and i would hate myself for the rest of


---------45:35----------
my life if i ever did that to one of my


---------45:37----------
daughters


---------45:38----------
i think it's the shittiest thing you can


---------45:39----------
possibly do


---------45:42----------
anyway i'm going to need a moment


---------45:43----------
because now i have


---------45:51----------
but i didn't think i'd get emotional


---------45:53----------
because it's usually hard to crack me


---------45:56----------
i mean it's easy to crack me


---------46:03----------
thoughts questions


---------46:06----------
no everything you said made sense it's


---------46:08----------
just all coming together


---------46:09----------
like i'm really glad i brought this


---------46:11----------
topic up i was like debating because


---------46:15----------
i i guess i was kind of afraid i'd hear


---------46:17----------
the same thing


---------46:18----------
other people told me or like what my dad


---------46:21----------
told me


---------46:21----------
but i'm relieved


---------46:24----------
what are you really what's relieving to


---------46:26----------
hear


---------46:28----------
that what i went through wasn't


---------46:32----------
good but like yeah it wasn't good at all


---------46:36----------
and i don't know just but


---------46:41----------
just to hear someone that can understand


---------46:43----------
like the pain that i went through


---------46:45----------
it's just really relieving refreshing


---------46:49----------
yeah i'm i'm happy you feel that way and


---------46:51----------
it's it's interesting that you feel like


---------46:53----------
i understand your pain because i


---------46:54----------
i really don't i don't know it's just no


---------46:57----------
i i feel


---------46:58----------
like yeah yeah i mean because but i i


---------47:02----------
think that's


---------47:02----------
that's actually the amazing thing right


---------47:04----------
is that like human beings can connect


---------47:06----------
and support each other without


---------47:10----------
know without truly understanding


---------47:13----------
and and i think it's really really sad


---------47:15----------
what happened to you and i don't think


---------47:16----------
it's fair


---------47:18----------
and i do think you lost something


---------47:23----------
i do however think that you're gonna be


---------47:26----------
okay


---------47:28----------
and i do think i'm gonna be okay too


---------47:30----------
yeah i i do think that just because you


---------47:32----------
lost something


---------47:33----------
i gave this this five-minute rant before


---------47:36----------
we started talking about how instead of


---------47:40----------
you know avoiding taking damage what you


---------47:42----------
need to learn how to do is heal


---------47:45----------
because then you can take damage and


---------47:46----------
this is a great example right so i think


---------47:49----------
oreo everything that i see tells me that


---------47:51----------
you're


---------47:52----------
an intelligent capable caring


---------47:56----------
and talented young woman who has a lot


---------47:59----------
to give to the world


---------48:00----------
and most of it is positive


---------48:04----------
and i'm you know i think i'm in your


---------48:06----------
corner


---------48:11----------
um yeah that's another one of those


---------48:13----------
things that i don't know how you're


---------48:14----------
supposed to respond to


---------48:15----------
yeah thank you


---------48:20----------
okay so let's talk about you have other


---------48:22----------
thoughts questions can i


---------48:23----------
teach you something yeah teach me


---------48:25----------
something okay so i want to teach you


---------48:27----------
something called


---------48:28----------
advice so this is a sanskrit word


---------48:32----------
that means non-dual


---------48:35----------
so if we look at human beings and why


---------48:37----------
they have conflict


---------48:38----------
right so like let's take the conflict


---------48:40----------
that you have over your dad where you


---------48:41----------
want to blame him for something


---------48:43----------
because let's be fair he [ __ ] up


---------48:47----------
and and then what you but you all you


---------48:50----------
also want to do is like


---------48:52----------
kind of acknowledge that it's not


---------48:54----------
entirely his fault right so there's a


---------48:56----------
part of you that's like


---------48:57----------
damn it dad you know you did something


---------49:00----------
really bad to me and there's another


---------49:02----------
part of you that's like he's been in a


---------49:03----------
hospital for 19 years


---------49:05----------
you know he suffers a lot too it's sort


---------49:08----------
of like not


---------49:09----------
fair to blame him so there's like to


---------49:11----------
blame him


---------49:12----------
and there's like the let's feel sorry


---------49:14----------
for him and it's not his fault


---------49:16----------
right and we can see that with that


---------49:17----------
other girl that you were talking about


---------49:18----------
as well where it's like there's a part


---------49:20----------
of you that's like


---------49:22----------
i want to blame her because she hurt me


---------49:24----------
and also like she was only a young girl


---------49:26----------
too she didn't know what she was doing


---------49:28----------
and that's the conflict so sometimes in


---------49:30----------
life we have a part of us that


---------49:33----------
you know has black and a part of us that


---------49:34----------
has white so you can see this kind of


---------49:37----------
concept in the yin yang


---------49:39----------
and so what advaith means is that the


---------49:41----------
way to get to peace


---------49:43----------
is to be non-doom so to not


---------49:46----------
separate two things and choose one over


---------49:48----------
the other


---------49:49----------
because generally speaking as human


---------49:51----------
beings what we try to do


---------49:53----------
is we try to like we think about the


---------49:54----------
resolution of conflict as one winning


---------49:58----------
right and like you think through it


---------49:59----------
you're like okay i'm not going to blame


---------50:01----------
him at the end of the day and then my


---------50:02----------
mind will it be at peace


---------50:03----------
if i stop blaming my dad or it'll also


---------50:06----------
be at peace if you do blame him and then


---------50:08----------
it's like conflict complete


---------50:10----------
you with me there's like a battle and


---------50:12----------
one needs to win


---------50:14----------
so the concept of advaith is actually


---------50:17----------
that like


---------50:19----------
neither one needs to win and what you


---------50:21----------
need to learn


---------50:22----------
is how to sit with both conflicting


---------50:25----------
truths


---------50:26----------
at the same time so and it's kind of


---------50:28----------
weird but like


---------50:29----------
for you to say that my dad suffers a lot


---------50:34----------
and and maybe he deserves some amount of


---------50:37----------
forgiveness or leeway


---------50:40----------
and instead of using but you use and


---------50:44----------
so we say like oh like what he did was


---------50:47----------
really bad


---------50:48----------
but he suffers a lot too and so what but


---------50:50----------
does what the word but does


---------50:52----------
is it invalidates the first part of the


---------50:54----------
statement


---------50:56----------
like i think you're a really wonderful


---------50:57----------
person but


---------50:59----------
you know and then it's like it doesn't


---------51:01----------
doesn't matter what you said first right


---------51:04----------
and and so what i i'd like to try to


---------51:06----------
teach you how to start


---------51:08----------
to do today is to replace the word but


---------51:10----------
in your mind with and


---------51:13----------
that he suffered a lot and at the same


---------51:16----------
time


---------51:18----------
he really should have done something


---------51:20----------
differently


---------51:22----------
that and this is kind of what i was


---------51:23----------
saying about you know the kids who were


---------51:25----------
fighting that like


---------51:27----------
what that girl did to you hurt you a lot


---------51:31----------
and at the same time if you can sit with


---------51:33----------
that that that wasn't fair to you


---------51:36----------
and at the same reason she didn't know


---------51:38----------
what she was doing


---------51:39----------
which doesn't really absolve like it's


---------51:41----------
sort of like we're not gonna blame her


---------51:42----------
but we still


---------51:44----------
allow ourselves to feel hurt at the same


---------51:46----------
time


---------51:47----------
you know because maybe on some level she


---------51:49----------
did know what she was doing


---------51:52----------
right like like it sounded like she was


---------51:56----------
sociopathic and she understood that you


---------51:59----------
were lonely


---------52:00----------
and she used that loneliness against you


---------52:03----------
in a malevolent


---------52:04----------
way and i don't know where we got off


---------52:06----------
thinking that children aren't malevolent


---------52:08----------
because children are some of the biggest


---------52:09----------
[ __ ] on the planet like seriously


---------52:11----------
i'm not kidding it's not a joke it's


---------52:13----------
like they're some of the most


---------52:15----------
spiteful and hurtful people out there i


---------52:17----------
know it sounds funny


---------52:18----------
i laugh too yeah but i mean children can


---------52:21----------
be very cruel


---------52:23----------
like i remember when i was growing up


---------52:26----------
some of


---------52:27----------
the people in my school like we had a


---------52:28----------
handicapped teacher


---------52:30----------
who was in a wheelchair and like a group


---------52:33----------
of 10 year old kids like they were


---------52:35----------
[ __ ] relentless


---------52:37----------
and it's like one of the saddest things


---------52:39----------
to see like how cruel children can be


---------52:43----------
and sometimes kids are good and


---------52:45----------
sometimes kids are bad and do we give


---------52:46----------
them excuses sure


---------52:47----------
but so i i think the the goal here is to


---------52:50----------
like think about advaith which is like


---------52:52----------
how can you sit with both of these


---------52:54----------
truths at the same time


---------52:57----------
that something did happen to you that


---------52:58----------
was bad and that people hurt you


---------53:00----------
and that people who should have


---------53:01----------
protected you didn't protect you


---------53:04----------
and that pain is there like it's done


---------53:08----------
and at the same time


---------53:11----------
how can you also forgive


---------53:15----------
and how can you continue to love your


---------53:17----------
dad it sounds to me like you love your


---------53:18----------
dad


---------53:20----------
right and so how can you sit with the


---------53:22----------
feeling of like


---------53:24----------
he wasn't there for me and love him at


---------53:26----------
the same time


---------53:28----------
because those two things appear to


---------53:29----------
conflict


---------53:31----------
and what i'm what i'm sensing you in you


---------53:33----------
is that your love is trying to


---------53:35----------
overcome your anger with him


---------53:39----------
and there's a war am i pissed at dad or


---------53:41----------
do i love dad


---------53:44----------
does that make sense and who do you


---------53:47----------
think is winning the war right now


---------53:48----------
love or anger for me


---------53:52----------
love because my dad's been there for me


---------53:55----------
through like really tough times too


---------53:59----------
like he makes mistakes as well so


---------54:03----------
yeah so so that's what i sense in you


---------54:07----------
and at the same time for you to really


---------54:08----------
be at peace


---------54:10----------
so we can understand that if love wins


---------54:11----------
like that's good right


---------54:13----------
love triumphing over anger is good but i


---------54:16----------
actually don't think it's


---------54:17----------
the best i think what's the best is to


---------54:20----------
have


---------54:20----------
love in your heart and to have anger


---------54:24----------
and to acknowledge that like i do


---------54:26----------
deserve to feel this way and i can love


---------54:28----------
my dad


---------54:29----------
and and he can [ __ ] up just because i


---------54:31----------
love him doesn't mean that he can't [ __ ]


---------54:32----------
up


---------54:33----------
and when you say it like that it's like


---------54:34----------
duh but that's not how we feel


---------54:37----------
right because then when you feel angry


---------54:39----------
at your dad how do you feel about


---------54:41----------
feeling angry


---------54:47----------
what do you tell yourself you scream


---------54:52----------
okay so what do you tell yourself when


---------54:54----------
you feel angry with him


---------54:56----------
um it's kind of a read my mind question


---------54:59----------
but i'm digging for a particular answer


---------55:01----------
which


---------55:01----------
i'm gonna see if i can phrase the


---------55:03----------
questions properly but


---------55:07----------
like when you yeah so so like when you


---------55:10----------
feel angry at your dad


---------55:12----------
later on how do you feel about being


---------55:14----------
angry with him


---------55:21----------
i don't know why i feel like this is a


---------55:23----------
trick question yeah yeah it's weird i'm


---------55:24----------
asking it in a bad way so that's my


---------55:26----------
fault


---------55:26----------
so i would guess that you feel guilty


---------55:28----------
for feeling angry with him


---------55:30----------
yeah right it's like weird like you and


---------55:33----------
and like what is that guilt like what


---------55:35----------
kind of thoughts do you have


---------55:37----------
when you get like i should have known


---------55:39----------
better like he's been through a lot


---------55:41----------
and yeah right and and so what are you


---------55:45----------
doing there like i know it's kind of


---------55:47----------
that's kind of a weird question too but


---------55:49----------
what are you doing to the angry part of


---------55:51----------
you


---------55:53----------
i'm invalidating it absolutely


---------55:56----------
right so you're telling and you're in a


---------55:58----------
bizarre way that's exactly what your dad


---------56:00----------
did


---------56:02----------
right he was like oh it's not that big


---------56:05----------
of a deal


---------56:06----------
you shouldn't feel that way that's the


---------56:07----------
wrong way to feel oreo


---------56:12----------
does that make sense


---------56:15----------
and and so i think what you've got to do


---------56:16----------
is like learn how to sit with all of


---------56:18----------
those things


---------56:19----------
all at the same time and the the way to


---------56:23----------
not feel guilty is to actually like be


---------56:25----------
able to be angry with him


---------56:27----------
and is there any part of you tiny tiny


---------56:30----------
part of you that hates your dad


---------56:32----------
yeah right so so that


---------56:35----------
that deserves to be there too what do


---------56:37----------
you hate him for


---------56:40----------
for just brushing off my problems


---------56:44----------
yeah and do you think that's a


---------56:47----------
reasonable way to feel


---------56:50----------
do you love your dad how do you love and


---------56:53----------
hate him at the same time


---------56:58----------
um rather than hate i guess it's okay to


---------57:01----------
be


---------57:01----------
angry and love my dad


---------57:05----------
can you feel those at the same time


---------57:10----------
and so do you feel like yeah so so i i


---------57:12----------
think the interesting thing is that the


---------57:14----------
more you do that i suspect the less


---------57:16----------
guilty you'll start to feel


---------57:18----------
and if we really think about the guilt


---------57:20----------
the guilt is i think what


---------57:21----------
causes the most conflict


---------57:24----------
does that make sense like i think it's


---------57:26----------
the guilt that


---------57:28----------
that's you fighting against yourself


---------57:31----------
because you have the anger and the


---------57:32----------
guilt's like no oreo


---------57:33----------
wrong don't feel that way and that's the


---------57:37----------
conflict so if we want you to be at


---------57:38----------
peace we have to let you feel the love


---------57:41----------
with one hand


---------57:41----------
and let you feel the anger with the


---------57:43----------
other


---------57:45----------
what do you does that do you know how to


---------57:47----------
do that do you can you imagine how to do


---------57:52----------
that


---------57:56----------
i guess when i'm angry you just be angry


---------57:58----------
but when i feel better


---------58:00----------
feel better yeah that's i it's


---------58:03----------
interesting or your your


---------58:04----------
some of your answers are vague and the


---------58:07----------
ones that


---------58:08----------
aren't are simply beautiful because they


---------58:10----------
capture the essence of it


---------58:12----------
it's like a zen master kind of thing you


---------58:14----------
know because the zen masters are like


---------58:16----------
when you are angry be angry


---------58:18----------
and when you are done be done it's like


---------58:20----------
said


---------58:23----------
it's really like simple kind of [ __ ]


---------58:24----------
that's like super profound


---------58:28----------
yeah quotes and and i i think so right


---------58:31----------
so let yourself feel what you feel


---------58:33----------
and acknowledge that you don't have to


---------58:35----------
have one win over the other that you can


---------58:37----------
have both


---------58:39----------
that can you can say like oh i'm a good


---------58:41----------
person


---------58:42----------
and i'm a bad person


---------58:46----------
and even when it comes to something like


---------58:48----------
bipolar disorder like it sucks to have


---------58:50----------
bipolar disorder


---------58:52----------
and it's part of what makes me who i am


---------58:56----------
and some of that energy is going to help


---------58:58----------
me create or has helped


---------59:00----------
me create and even if you're not


---------59:02----------
actively manic or actively


---------59:04----------
depressed you're still going to be


---------59:06----------
creating


---------59:07----------
that bipolar is still down there


---------59:08----------
underneath the surface and it's fueling


---------59:10----------
you a little bit


---------59:11----------
and i think it's just about finding that


---------59:13----------
balance


---------59:16----------
all right i feel like i've been talking


---------59:18----------
at you for a while what do you think


---------59:23----------
i learned a lot good i'm glad


---------59:26----------
do you have that was that was kind of my


---------59:29----------
spiel


---------59:30----------
how do you feel about you know today's


---------59:33----------
conversation


---------59:35----------
it was really nice like i was i actually


---------59:37----------
had a nightmare


---------59:38----------
about how this conversation would go i


---------59:41----------
had a dream


---------59:43----------
where you were like at my house and we


---------59:44----------
were having like we were talking


---------59:46----------
and then you made me throw away


---------59:48----------
everything that i liked


---------59:52----------
you were just like you like this throw


---------59:54----------
it away it's a problem and you like


---------59:55----------
throw it you did it across the window


---------59:57----------
and then the window would break and then


---------59:59----------
everything else would break and i'm just


---------60:00----------
like no


---------60:01----------
my nintendo ds


---------60:04----------
that's scary man


---------60:08----------
for some reason i had this fear that you


---------60:09----------
would like i think i was nervous because


---------60:11----------
i thought you would jump out of the


---------60:12----------
screen and like grab my nintendo ds and


---------60:14----------
mute it out the window


---------60:16----------
yeah that sounds really scary you know


---------60:20----------
it's interesting because you know being


---------60:23----------
a streamer i understand that sometimes


---------60:25----------
streamers find their ways into people's


---------60:27----------
dreams


---------60:28----------
but this is not what i expect


---------60:31----------
the representation of dr k in in


---------60:35----------
dreams is is someone who throws away


---------60:37----------
things


---------60:39----------
what i expect is that you know when dr k


---------60:40----------
finds his way into a young woman's


---------60:42----------
dreams that that


---------60:43----------
that means something else but


---------60:46----------
[Laughter]


---------60:48----------
but yeah i mean i'm glad that it sounds


---------60:50----------
like that's not what we're doing here


---------60:52----------
today


---------60:55----------
so yeah i mean it's sound


---------60:59----------
you know good i'm i'm glad that i didn't


---------61:01----------
make you throw out your nintendo ds


---------61:04----------
yes i'm very glad to what do you play on


---------61:07----------
ds


---------61:07----------
by the way pokemon and chrono trigger


---------61:12----------
really wow chrono trigger is amazing


---------61:16----------
oh i just i played it for the first time


---------61:18----------
so like i'm


---------61:19----------
like halfway finished so it's really


---------61:22----------
good i love it so much yeah


---------61:23----------
it's like one of these boomer games that


---------61:26----------
i'm i'm happy that the younger


---------61:27----------
generation is playing photographer


---------61:29----------
because it's


---------61:30----------
one of the greatest games that's ever


---------61:31----------
been made


---------61:33----------
it was very revolutionary in a lot of


---------61:35----------
ways


---------61:36----------
i won't say now because you're halfway


---------61:38----------
through


---------61:40----------
yeah don't spoil yeah no spoiler you


---------61:42----------
know do you have a switch


---------61:44----------
yes i have a switch light


---------61:47----------
what's the difference between the switch


---------61:48----------
light and the switch um the switch you


---------61:50----------
could actually like


---------61:53----------
to connect it to the tv and take the


---------61:54----------
controllers out but the switch light is


---------61:56----------
like a console like


---------61:58----------
it's like oh it's like a handheld a ds


---------61:59----------
but without yeah it's a handheld okay so


---------62:01----------
you can't


---------62:02----------
take the things out yeah and you can't


---------62:05----------
plug it to the tv either


---------62:06----------
oh interesting okay yeah cool


---------62:10----------
all right so we anything else i mean it


---------62:13----------
feels to me like we're kind of done


---------62:15----------
yeah i i think we talked about


---------62:18----------
everything i wanted to talk about


---------62:20----------
yeah are you okay with the amount that


---------62:22----------
we got into it like


---------62:24----------
do you feel like you wanna okay felt


---------62:26----------
okay to me too


---------62:28----------
um yeah did you have any other questions


---------62:32----------
you mentioned cyclothymia earlier do you


---------62:34----------
understand like bipolar 1 bipolar 2 and


---------62:36----------
cyclothymia


---------62:37----------
oh yeah i don't think you got through


---------62:39----------
that yeah yet


---------62:41----------
so we'll do that very quickly so bipolar


---------62:43----------
disorder has


---------62:44----------
two variants and


---------62:47----------
one is like depression with something


---------62:49----------
called hypomania and the other one is


---------62:51----------
depression with


---------62:53----------
full mania so hypomania is like this


---------62:56----------
kind of like middle level


---------62:58----------
of elevated energy so people sleep a


---------63:01----------
little bit less they tend to be


---------63:02----------
super productive this is the thing that


---------63:04----------
all the kids at harvard college


---------63:06----------
don't want to get rid of because it


---------63:07----------
actually is like helps them perform


---------63:09----------
so they can study for 12 hours a day


---------63:11----------
sleep four hours a night


---------63:13----------
they feel generally pretty good the


---------63:15----------
problem is that most


---------63:16----------
periods of mania and hypomania have this


---------63:19----------
kind of like


---------63:20----------
crash afterward which feels like


---------63:22----------
depression


---------63:24----------
true mania is when you know generally


---------63:26----------
speaking i think about like periods of


---------63:28----------
time without going


---------63:29----------
really with very little to no sleep very


---------63:32----------
high energy level


---------63:34----------
very high positive mood and a mind that


---------63:38----------
is super super active and like is not


---------63:41----------
operating with the same set of rules


---------63:43----------
that


---------63:44----------
normal minds operate with so you know


---------63:47----------
people will think that they like


---------63:49----------
like they'll like really believe that


---------63:50----------
they've come up with the cure for cancer


---------63:52----------
or solved the problem for like you know


---------63:56----------
endless energy and figured out how to


---------63:58----------
harness a hundred percent of the energy


---------64:00----------
from the sun


---------64:02----------
and like these other kinds of like ideas


---------64:04----------
that seem quite extreme


---------64:06----------
um and mania especially can be quite


---------64:09----------
dangerous because sometimes people can


---------64:11----------
actually become like psychotic


---------64:13----------
and by psychotic they can start to have


---------64:15----------
very distorted perceptions of reality


---------64:18----------
like sometimes they'll start to think


---------64:19----------
that they're like the incarnation of


---------64:20----------
jesus or things like that


---------64:24----------
and so that's bipolar one and bipolar


---------64:26----------
two both of them have depression and


---------64:27----------
then one has like


---------64:28----------
mania and then one has maniolite


---------64:32----------
and which then has bipolar one is true


---------64:35----------
mania


---------64:36----------
uh bipolar two is mania white


---------64:40----------
there is some confusion in terms of


---------64:41----------
diagnosis so the interesting thing about


---------64:43----------
bipolar disorder is that most people


---------64:45----------
have their first manic episode like


---------64:47----------
before the age of 23. so reason i ask


---------64:50----------
you your age


---------64:51----------
is because you know when i have a 17


---------64:53----------
year old who i diagnose with depression


---------64:55----------
in the back of my mind there's a clock


---------64:57----------
that's ticking


---------64:59----------
and it's that if they're going to become


---------65:00----------
manic it'll happen in the next couple of


---------65:03----------
years


---------65:04----------
and so i tend to look out for it but i'm


---------65:07----------
not gonna put people


---------65:08----------
on bipolar medication until i know


---------65:11----------
they're bipolar


---------65:13----------
um you know just a couple and so


---------65:15----------
cyclothymia is sort of a low level of


---------65:17----------
both i


---------65:18----------
memory serves i'm a bit rusty on that


---------65:20----------
because i don't work with a whole lot of


---------65:21----------
people with psychothemia


---------65:23----------
um and the last thing is you know when


---------65:26----------
it comes to


---------65:27----------
to medication with bipolar disorder uh


---------65:30----------
you know i think that it can be very


---------65:32----------
helpful but i also don't think it's like


---------65:34----------
a lifelong sentence


---------65:36----------
so this i disagree with many of my


---------65:37----------
colleagues so i've had


---------65:39----------
other people i've had patients who have


---------65:41----------
bipolar disorder


---------65:42----------
who have taken off of all medication and


---------65:44----------
they're doing fine


---------65:45----------
i would not recommend that for you so i


---------65:48----------
would trust your psychiatrist but i


---------65:49----------
think those people


---------65:50----------
your brain is still developing and like


---------65:52----------
you said teenagers have messed up sleep


---------65:54----------
schedules


---------65:55----------
so in your case sleep is actually like a


---------65:59----------
risk factor


---------66:00----------
for your mental illness so if you don't


---------66:04----------
sleep well you can literally become


---------66:08----------
manic or depressed so in the cases of


---------66:10----------
people who don't need medication


---------66:14----------
usually it's full adults whose brains


---------66:16----------
have developed


---------66:17----------
and then also like being very very


---------66:19----------
careful about


---------66:21----------
so for example i worked with one person


---------66:22----------
who was a physician


---------66:24----------
and they would travel internationally to


---------66:26----------
present their research


---------66:28----------
and every time they traveled


---------66:29----------
internationally and if they dealt with


---------66:30----------
jet lag


---------66:31----------
we would put them on medication before


---------66:33----------
they traveled


---------66:34----------
they would go go to the conference have


---------66:36----------
the medication on board


---------66:38----------
speak at the conference be jet lagged


---------66:40----------
come back and then taper off of the


---------66:42----------
medication


---------66:43----------
right so the real risk factor is like


---------66:45----------
messed up sleep so i do think that you


---------66:47----------
can sort of manage it


---------66:49----------
at some point but like trust your doctor


---------66:51----------
and i think in your case specifically


---------66:53----------
especially for students


---------66:54----------
i'm very hesitant if they need


---------66:55----------
medication i keep them on it


---------66:57----------
because you're at a stage of your life


---------66:58----------
where you can't afford to like go manic


---------67:00----------
and [ __ ] up your life


---------67:03----------
and and people can really [ __ ] up their


---------67:05----------
lives like in in bad ways


---------67:08----------
um but but you know i do think that it's


---------67:11----------
possible to do


---------67:12----------
pretty well with low levels of


---------67:13----------
medication or even no medication in some


---------67:15----------
cases it just depends on the person


---------67:18----------
but it sounds to me like you have a very


---------67:21----------
good psychiatrist and it sounds like you


---------67:23----------
trust them and i would really trust them


---------67:26----------
because the hard thing is that you don't


---------67:28----------
remember what you're like when you're


---------67:30----------
manic


---------67:31----------
yeah whereas the people who see you are


---------67:34----------
like


---------67:34----------
you really can't be doing that it seems


---------67:36----------
less bad to you than


---------67:38----------
when you sit with a truly manic person


---------67:39----------
it's like


---------67:41----------
they can't do anything and what i see in


---------67:44----------
you oreo is someone who has a


---------67:46----------
budding or successful music career and


---------67:48----------
what you need more than anything else is


---------67:50----------
stability of growth


---------67:52----------
because if you go awol and disappear for


---------67:54----------
like six months like i don't know what's


---------67:56----------
going to happen to your career


---------67:58----------
but generally speaking you know stable


---------67:59----------
production is the most important thing


---------68:01----------
for you right now


---------68:03----------
so i'd stick with the medicine that's


---------68:04----------
what your psychiatrist tells you to do


---------68:08----------
okay


---------68:11----------
how do you feel about meditation uh


---------68:14----------
i think it's pretty cool i'd be down to


---------68:16----------
try it


---------68:18----------
what are we going to teach you is the


---------68:19----------
question


---------68:23----------
i've done like breathing meditation


---------68:26----------
do you want to do something else


---------68:36----------
sure


---------68:38----------
what do you want to change about your


---------68:40----------
life


---------68:41----------
in what way do you want to grow um


---------68:45----------
[Music]


---------68:46----------
i want to ex expand


---------68:49----------
from music and like make more things


---------68:53----------
i guess create more like different


---------68:56----------
things like i eventually want to make a


---------68:58----------
game


---------68:58----------
so i want to learn things that i'm not


---------69:00----------
comfortable with


---------69:02----------
like programming okay


---------69:12----------
do you still feel like you have a lot of


---------69:13----------
energy in you


---------69:15----------
um no i feel pretty normal


---------69:19----------
okay


---------69:22----------
so i'm going to teach you something i


---------69:24----------
haven't taught on in a while but i think


---------69:25----------
it's going to be a good practice for you


---------69:28----------
it's actually a cleansing practice and i


---------69:30----------
think it's going to help you manage


---------69:33----------
hyperactivity and calmness


---------69:37----------
uh it's also a practice that works


---------69:38----------
really well for anxiety so


---------69:40----------
i'm gonna teach you a practice called


---------69:42----------
bellows breathing


---------69:44----------
it's another breathing practice


---------69:48----------
me just double check with myself


---------69:57----------
yeah so i'm gonna tack on something at


---------69:58----------
the end okay


---------70:00----------
so we're gonna we're gonna sort of sit


---------70:02----------
with this idea of advice


---------70:04----------
towards the end of our practice okay but


---------70:07----------
what i want to help you do


---------70:08----------
is teach you a technique


---------70:12----------
oh one second


---------70:15----------
hello


---------70:20----------
no dude you can't teach her quindalin


---------70:22----------
that's bad for people


---------70:23----------
yeah nope okay


---------70:28----------
nope


---------70:35----------
someone tried to give me a suggestion as


---------70:37----------
to what to teach you but i think that


---------70:39----------
that is dangerous for people who have


---------70:40----------
bipolar disorder


---------70:42----------
okay at least not yet


---------70:45----------
you need to be purified before you do


---------70:47----------
this


---------70:48----------
um okay so


---------70:52----------
so i think this will be good so what i


---------70:54----------
want you to do is sit up straight


---------70:57----------
and do you know how to abdominally


---------70:59----------
breathe


---------71:00----------
do you know how to do belly breathing


---------71:03----------
it's like


---------71:03----------
for singing breathing through your


---------71:05----------
diaphragm yep very good


---------71:07----------
so like when you breathe in your stomach


---------71:09----------
goes out


---------71:11----------
and when you breathe out your stomach


---------71:12----------
goes in


---------71:15----------
does that make sense so let's just try


---------71:16----------
that so i want you to just do


---------71:18----------
three belly breaths so breathe your


---------71:20----------
timer so breathe in


---------71:23----------
and then out


---------71:27----------
through your nose


---------71:34----------
good so for people who are watching when


---------71:36----------
you breathe in your stomach should


---------71:37----------
expand so make your belly big


---------71:40----------
and when you breathe out pull your navel


---------71:42----------
towards your spine


---------71:44----------
so suck in your navel and pull it all


---------71:46----------
the way towards your spine and breathe


---------71:47----------
out very good


---------71:49----------
so now what i'm going to teach you oreo


---------71:52----------
is


---------71:53----------
is forceful exhalations with passive


---------71:55----------
inhalations


---------71:57----------
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to


---------71:58----------
do like nine breaths


---------72:00----------
where what i'm going to focus on is like


---------72:02----------
a sharp exhalation


---------72:04----------
and as quickly as i can another sharp


---------72:06----------
exhalation


---------72:07----------
there's going to be a very small


---------72:09----------
inhalation in between


---------72:10----------
but i'll demonstrate okay okay


---------72:20----------
could you tell what i was doing inhaling


---------72:23----------
like really quickly exhaling really


---------72:25----------
quickly oh exhaling


---------72:27----------
yeah so it's like a you're like pushing


---------72:29----------
all the air out


---------72:33----------
yeah so push all the air out fast


---------72:39----------
good now try to try to do nine breaths


---------72:42----------
in a row


---------72:44----------
as large and as forceful as you can do


---------72:48----------
so breathe in so take one big deep


---------72:51----------
breath and then go


---------72:52----------
boom boom boom okay boom boom


---------72:57----------
okay go ahead let's see


---------73:02----------
okay good so now so sit up straight


---------73:06----------
and now we're gonna do 15 okay so we're


---------73:08----------
going to close our eyes


---------73:09----------
and we're going to do 15 hard


---------73:12----------
exhalations


---------73:13----------
and you'll kind of feel that recoil of


---------73:15----------
the inhalation afterward and try to push


---------73:17----------
it out again


---------73:18----------
okay okay so deep breath in and 15


---------73:30----------
breaths


---------73:38----------
okay good so now we're going to do the


---------73:40----------
next phase we're going to do 15 more


---------73:42----------
breaths


---------73:43----------
and after you finish the 15 i want you


---------73:46----------
to just


---------73:47----------
notice like how chill you feel


---------73:51----------
so you're gonna take one really long


---------73:53----------
super slow breath


---------73:55----------
and just sit in that space so there's


---------73:57----------
gonna be the frenzied breathing followed


---------74:00----------
by like the post


---------74:01----------
calm okay so after i


---------74:05----------
exhale then i breathe in again and then


---------74:08----------
so


---------74:09----------
15 sharp no no 15 sharp exhalations


---------74:13----------
and then just stop and do whatever your


---------74:15----------
breath naturally wants to do


---------74:17----------
and just chill in the space of mind


---------74:20----------
that you create through those 15


---------74:22----------
exhalations


---------74:23----------
and so we're going to be in kind of


---------74:24----------
silent meditation afterward for like a


---------74:26----------
minute


---------74:27----------
okay okay so eyes closed sit up straight


---------74:30----------
and begin 15 breaths go


---------75:24----------
now i want you to feel your heartbeat


---------75:27----------
eyes closed


---------75:29----------
or listen to it with headphones you may


---------75:32----------
be able to hear it


---------75:37----------
can you feel it or hear it


---------75:40----------
i feel it okay so i want you to


---------75:44----------
notice that the feeling has


---------75:48----------
has two thumps you feel both of the


---------75:50----------
thumps


---------75:53----------
okay so now we're going to do the third


---------75:57----------
phase of the practice so you can open


---------75:58----------
your eyes


---------76:00----------
so what i'm going to do is have you do


---------76:02----------
30 breaths 30 exhalations


---------76:05----------
followed by a period of silent


---------76:07----------
meditation and i want you to pay


---------76:08----------
attention to the feel of your heartbeat


---------76:11----------
and what i'm going to do after maybe


---------76:13----------
about 30 seconds of silent meditation is


---------76:15----------
i want you to keep your eyes closed


---------76:17----------
and then i'm going to guide you in some


---------76:19----------
ways and just listen to what i say maybe


---------76:21----------
it'll make sense maybe it won't


---------76:22----------
no big deal okay and the total practice


---------76:26----------
will


---------76:26----------
last about two or three minutes of


---------76:28----------
silent meditation


---------76:30----------
after you do the 30 breaths so the whole


---------76:32----------
thing will take maybe about


---------76:34----------
five minutes you good any questions


---------76:37----------
okay sit up straight


---------76:40----------
take a deep breath in and begin 30


---------76:46----------
breaths


---------77:51----------
and now i want you to think a little bit


---------77:53----------
about your father


---------77:57----------
and find within yourself


---------78:00----------
all of the love all of the affection


---------78:06----------
all of the caring all of the compassion


---------78:15----------
and then at the same time


---------78:19----------
find the anger


---------78:22----------
the hatred the sense of loss of


---------78:26----------
innocence and just like the beating of


---------78:29----------
your heart i want you to feel


---------78:31----------
both of those things together


---------78:38----------
there's


---------78:40----------
that you can have both of those within


---------78:42----------
you and that's actually how it's


---------78:44----------
supposed to be


---------78:57----------
that you can love him and be


---------79:00----------
disappointed


---------79:03----------
that he can be a wonderful father and


---------79:07----------
could have done better


---------79:18----------
that you're lucky to have him in your


---------79:20----------
life


---------79:22----------
and you're unlucky


---------79:28----------
that you can be grateful for many things


---------79:30----------
in life


---------79:36----------
and you can be resentful


---------79:47----------
as you as you swim between these two


---------79:50----------
poles of feeling


---------79:52----------
return to the feeling of your heartbeat


---------79:58----------
and notice that within your body there


---------80:00----------
is never just one thing


---------80:04----------
there's always a balance


---------80:08----------
the two thumps of your heartbeat


---------80:12----------
the inhalation and the exhalation


---------80:17----------
the contractions squeeze your fists


---------80:19----------
together


---------80:21----------
and then relax them


---------80:26----------
that eyes can open and close


---------80:30----------
and that our most basic sense of self


---------80:35----------
involves two things


---------80:38----------
and so it's perfectly okay for you to


---------80:41----------
feel both of those things with your dad


---------80:44----------
and that there's no need to feel guilty


---------80:46----------
for feeling angry


---------80:49----------
that you deserve to feel both of those


---------80:52----------
ways and that's okay


---------80:53----------
one doesn't need to win


---------80:59----------
and the more that you focus on your


---------81:00----------
heartbeat


---------81:02----------
the deeper this principle will sink into


---------81:05----------
your mind


---------81:07----------
all you have to do is focus on the


---------81:09----------
heartbeat and you'll learn this on your


---------81:12----------
own


---------81:20----------
and now for nine beats i want you to


---------81:23----------
feel your heart


---------81:33----------
when you're done open your eyes


---------81:46----------
how do you feel relaxed


---------81:51----------
that's what we want to do so i think


---------81:54----------
relaxed is an interesting word


---------81:56----------
but i think that um


---------82:00----------
yeah practice it if you


---------82:04----------
are interested i think the rapid


---------82:07----------
breathing if you're feeling anxious or


---------82:08----------
overly energetic


---------82:10----------
it can also calm down your mind so that


---------82:12----------
breathing technique since it involves a


---------82:14----------
lot of activity


---------82:16----------
is going to let you get energy out and


---------82:18----------
then you're


---------82:19----------
left with a calm mind naturally


---------82:23----------
right it's like if you're fidgety and


---------82:25----------
you run like a bunch of


---------82:27----------
like if you do a bunch of sprints you're


---------82:28----------
not going to be fidget anymore


---------82:30----------
so you need a technique that's going to


---------82:32----------
let you get the excess energy of your


---------82:34----------
mind out and leave you


---------82:36----------
in a calm space and then find something


---------82:39----------
sensory within you to kind of like


---------82:41----------
zero in on this principle of like yin


---------82:44----------
and yank


---------82:45----------
in breath and out breath heartbeat


---------82:51----------
and since you're a musician i i decided


---------82:53----------
to go with the heart


---------82:55----------
because it's got a rhythm to it it's got


---------82:57----------
a you know


---------83:01----------
