---------00:00----------
so tell me a little bit what am i how


---------00:03----------
would you like me to refer to you by the


---------00:04----------
way uh Ingrid is fine Ingrid mine okay


---------00:08----------
Ingrid yeah Ingrid thank you very much


---------00:11----------
for coming on today can you tell me a


---------00:12----------
little bit about what we're talking


---------00:14----------
about yeah thank you for having me um so


---------00:19----------
body dysmorphia um


---------00:22----------
just general strong anxiety about


---------00:25----------
appearance okay yeah that's it is okay


---------00:32----------
sure so can you help us understand what


---------00:34----------
you mean by body dysmorphia um so but it


---------00:39----------
is more yeah I know there's like


---------00:41----------
different kinds of it like transsexual


---------00:43----------
people have one kind of it I don't have


---------00:46----------
that kind my kind is that I am I see my


---------00:53----------
body my whole appearance as a lot worse


---------00:57----------
than it actually is okay and so like the


---------01:02----------
definition is something like overly


---------01:04----------
focused on a flaw in the physical


---------01:07----------
appearance that isn't necessarily there


---------01:10----------
or is so insignificant that no one else


---------01:13----------
can see it okay and you're like you're


---------01:15----------
so focused on it that it takes up so


---------01:18----------
much time of your life and gives you so


---------01:20----------
much stress okay and do you have a


---------01:23----------
particular feature in your body that you


---------01:27----------
spend a lot of your time thinking about


---------01:31----------
basically all of it


---------01:33----------
okay I I just I I am there's not like


---------01:37----------
one feature that's like I wish I could


---------01:40----------
change that it's it's it's basically


---------01:44----------
like I can't have a objective view of my


---------01:49----------
body it's like I don't know I explain it


---------01:54----------
it's I see my voice cute like distorted


---------02:00----------
sure wait how do they know that what you


---------02:03----------
see is distorted and I I don't think


---------02:08----------
it's distorted okay so people told me


---------02:14----------
professionals I'm talking doc told me so


---------02:17----------
I guess it is I mean it doesn't seem


---------02:23----------
like thinking that your view is of your


---------02:25----------
body as a distorted does you much good


---------02:28----------
no that's a problem okay so I'm gonna


---------02:33----------
start from kind of a weird place okay


---------02:36----------
let's just assume for a moment that


---------02:38----------
you're right instead of wrong so just my


---------02:42----------
experience being a mental health


---------02:43----------
professional comes I've come to


---------02:45----------
appreciate that


---------02:48----------
even though sometimes our mind can think


---------02:50----------
wrong things so let's think about


---------02:52----------
something like suicide


---------02:53----------
like if someone wants to kill themselves


---------02:55----------
I find that the most effective way to


---------02:59----------
help that person is to not assume that


---------03:03----------
they're wrong and like that life is


---------03:06----------
worth living it's to actually recognize


---------03:07----------
for that person in that moment life is


---------03:10----------
not worth living


---------03:11----------
does that make sense yeah and and the


---------03:14----------
cool thing is that it paradoxically like


---------03:16----------
you may think that you know telling to


---------03:18----------
sua slike talking to a suicidal person


---------03:20----------
about why their life isn't worth living


---------03:22----------
is like the wrong thing to do because


---------03:24----------
then like oh my god what if they kill


---------03:25----------
themselves it's absolutely a possibility


---------03:27----------
but strangely enough I think telling


---------03:30----------
people things that are contrary to what


---------03:32----------
they believe like doesn't help what are


---------03:35----------
you thinking about that I agree with


---------03:41----------
that it's like it doesn't help when


---------03:44----------
people tell me oh no you are pretty or


---------03:48----------
you look normal


---------03:49----------
it's like thanks but doesn't change


---------03:52----------
anything okay yeah so that's not what I


---------03:55----------
want to hear what do you want to hear I


---------03:56----------
don't know it's you I don't know what I


---------04:00----------
want to hear okay


---------04:01----------
so what I kind of I guess I kind of like


---------04:05----------
it would always be nice if someone just


---------04:08----------
told me straight to my face that I look


---------04:10----------
terrible what is it another hassle yeah


---------04:14----------
then I don't have to worry about it okay


---------04:17----------
so Ingrid right yeah Ingrid I'm so glad


---------04:22----------
you came on today can I just share some


---------04:26----------
random thoughts so


---------04:27----------
I feel optimistic and I'm grateful to


---------04:29----------
you I feel optimistic because I don't


---------04:33----------
know why I just do I can't make sense of


---------04:36----------
it it sounds like you've seen


---------04:38----------
professionals before and it hasn't


---------04:40----------
really helped much so I think every


---------04:42----------
every logical thought in my mind is that


---------04:44----------
I'm not going to be able to help you and


---------04:46----------
yet I feel optimistic today and I'm


---------04:49----------
grateful to you because I think this is


---------04:51----------
something that is not talked about and


---------04:53----------
not understood and I think it's


---------04:54----------
incredibly courageous for you to come in


---------04:57----------
you know and like let's just think about


---------04:59----------
what you're doing in to what degree


---------05:01----------
you're courageous because you're someone


---------05:02----------
who has body dysmorphia you think you


---------05:04----------
look terrible and we're actually doing a


---------05:06----------
video chat I I actually wanted to not be


---------05:11----------
on camera I can imagine so when I first


---------05:14----------
got a message but I didn't really want


---------05:16----------
to say no because like you have everyone


---------05:18----------
on cameras yeah but why the


---------05:20----------
wouldn't you why why are you on camera


---------05:22----------
like what's up with that don't you is it


---------05:24----------
that awful for you kind of like I was


---------05:28----------
literally shaking before like the 20


---------05:31----------
minutes of delay I was just sitting oh


---------05:33----------
I'm so sorry but I was gonna say I just


---------05:45----------
I don't know it doesn't really matter


---------05:48----------
because I I never have to talk to you


---------05:50----------
again or like no one in chat so it's


---------05:53----------
good yeah doesn't really matter and also


---------05:56----------
I wanted to just try yes yes good for


---------06:00----------
you and I think it's it's really


---------06:02----------
important I know this is gonna sound


---------06:03----------
bizarre but it doesn't really matter is


---------06:06----------
I think a wonderful way to live your


---------06:09----------
life I think so much of the torture that


---------06:13----------
we give ourselves is because we think


---------06:15----------
Matt things matter we're like oh my god


---------06:17----------
if I go to this party and people don't


---------06:19----------
like me then like oh my god it's gonna


---------06:21----------
be the end of the world no it doesn't


---------06:22----------
matter hmm


---------06:23----------
and and I think that you've actually


---------06:24----------
taken a huge step forward by


---------06:26----------
acknowledging that you don't have to let


---------06:29----------
your perceptions of your body or your


---------06:32----------
what you really believe


---------06:33----------
like I say perception applies it's not


---------06:35----------
real you don't have to let being ugly


---------06:38----------
get in the way of what


---------06:40----------
you do mmm and that's what we got that


---------06:44----------
in and of itself is like amazing


---------06:46----------
right let's forget for a moment about


---------06:48----------
whether you are ugly but I'm just gonna


---------06:50----------
step into your shoes and that's pretty


---------06:52----------
cool what do you think about that I'm


---------06:56----------
proud of myself


---------06:57----------
like damn straight I am I would never


---------07:01----------
carry on I don't know I don't like being


---------07:04----------
on camera at all sure and like right now


---------07:07----------
you have 2,000 people watching this so


---------07:11----------
let's make things boring so that it


---------07:13----------
drops down to a thousand yeah yeah so it


---------07:18----------
how does it feel to be on camera and on


---------07:20----------
stream you said you were nervous for the


---------07:22----------
20 minutes before but how about now it's


---------07:25----------
fine now


---------07:26----------
yes I don't know but I'm I'm just


---------07:30----------
actually seeing you now I haven't read


---------07:34----------
the chaps so it's that you should stay


---------07:38----------
away from


---------07:38----------
chatez don't really get that but why do


---------07:41----------
you so let's just try to so Ingrid there


---------07:43----------
are two things that I'd like to talk to


---------07:45----------
you about today one is to help us


---------07:47----------
understand a little bit about where and


---------07:49----------
how these feelings and perceptions come


---------07:52----------
from and the second is to forget about


---------07:54----------
all that stuff and just focus on like


---------07:57----------
why is it that the thought of being on


---------07:58----------
camera and actually being on camera is


---------08:01----------
like two different things right why


---------08:04----------
isn't the thought of coming on stream


---------08:05----------
actually more terrifying than actually


---------08:08----------
being on scene because that's weird


---------08:10----------
yeah that's right and if we can


---------08:13----------
understand that and we can understand


---------08:15----------
how the body dysmorphia occupies your


---------08:17----------
mind and shapes your mind maybe we can


---------08:20----------
get some power over it not by addressing


---------08:22----------
it directly not by telling you that


---------08:23----------
you're a beautiful person because that's


---------08:24----------
like that's like the content of your


---------08:26----------
mind


---------08:27----------
if that makes sense but what I'm talking


---------08:30----------
about is the process of your mind so how


---------08:32----------
is your mind like how does it come up


---------08:34----------
with anxieties and then when you


---------08:35----------
actually do the thing it's like easier


---------08:38----------
than thinking about doing the thing yeah


---------08:42----------
because I can imagine that your your


---------08:44----------
perceptions of how you look keep you


---------08:47----------
from doing things yeah and I can imagine


---------08:50----------
that if they keep you from doing things


---------08:53----------
that may make life


---------08:54----------
harder from you not just because you


---------08:56----------
feel a certain way about yourself but


---------08:57----------
then because then you're not doing those


---------08:58----------
things that make sense so yeah in a


---------09:02----------
weird way we may be able to help you out


---------09:04----------
by like not even talking about the body


---------09:07----------
of morphia but just teaching you how to


---------09:10----------
not necessarily ignore it but like how


---------09:12----------
you can sort of outmaneuver it maybe


---------09:14----------
it's a better way to put it hmm is that


---------09:19----------
sound okay yeah okay definitely so let's


---------09:22----------
start with if it's okay with you we'll


---------09:24----------
start with like where these thoughts


---------09:25----------
come from and what you think about


---------09:27----------
yourself is that okay well I don't I


---------09:33----------
don't know it comes from actually it's


---------09:35----------
like it's just kind of like something


---------09:40----------
that's manifested itself in my mind as


---------09:42----------
true sure


---------09:43----------
of course um I'm not really like trying


---------09:49----------
to tell myself anything else yep so I


---------09:54----------
spent a lot of time just looking at


---------09:57----------
myself in there's or hmm how much time


---------10:03----------
depends on the day sometimes hours like


---------10:08----------
in front of mirror or photos like I


---------10:14----------
think that you're so myself for hours


---------10:16----------
maybe I'm like watching TV or something


---------10:18----------
and I just take pictures but I delete


---------10:22----------
them all afterwards and it's like what


---------10:24----------
are you looking for when you take a


---------10:25----------
picture mm-hmm I always try to take nice


---------10:33----------
pictures so pictures were like like good


---------10:37----------
angles good lighting and such apps I


---------10:40----------
guess I'm just like looking for a


---------10:41----------
picture outlook Nisan do you ever find


---------10:43----------
one I do that's the weird thing like I


---------10:49----------
find a lot actually really but the thing


---------10:54----------
is like I just tell myself like that


---------10:56----------
that's not how I look like because this


---------10:58----------
is a photo I see interesting I'm just


---------11:02----------
telling myself that like because you


---------11:03----------
know how much can be like influenced by


---------11:06----------
lighting and angles


---------11:07----------
such yeah I'm just telling myself like


---------11:09----------
like it's not what I look like because


---------11:12----------
it's a photo sure so so it's kind of


---------11:17----------
strange right so like there's it sounds


---------11:19----------
like you actually take good pictures of


---------11:22----------
yourself and and you're happy with the


---------11:24----------
way that you look sometimes right maybe


---------11:30----------
for like one second when I look at the


---------11:33----------
photo right and keep in mind I'm like


---------11:36----------
I'm taking maybe like five hundred


---------11:37----------
pictures for myself maybe four of them


---------11:41----------
yeah so okay so what I'm what I'm


---------11:44----------
hearing you say is that you have a


---------11:46----------
couple of pictures that look okay and


---------11:48----------
when I repeat that back to you you


---------11:50----------
respond with yeah but that's like four


---------11:52----------
out of five hundred so it's like you see


---------11:54----------
what you're doing is you're kind of


---------11:55----------
invalidating what your observations are


---------11:57----------
you're arguing against the idea that


---------12:01----------
you're actually capable of looking


---------12:03----------
normal or attractive in a photo yeah do


---------12:06----------
you see how your mind does that yeah so


---------12:08----------
you said hmm sorry go ahead


---------12:12----------
it'll so like even those four pictures I


---------12:16----------
do find it's an hour later I don't think


---------12:20----------
I look nice anymore okay fine right so


---------12:23----------
let's think about that right so you say


---------12:25----------
that for a second you're like oh that's


---------12:26----------
a decent photo and then what happens in


---------12:28----------
your mind when I see a decent photo yeah


---------12:33----------
it wakes up and says what like that


---------12:38----------
split second is like oh maybe my nose


---------12:42----------
look okay there but then I'll just start


---------12:47----------
thinking no that's because the lighting


---------12:50----------
hits oh well something like that I'm


---------12:52----------
just trying to tell myself that it's not


---------12:57----------
not what I look like because it's yeah


---------13:01----------
so that's kind of so I just want you to


---------13:03----------
notice that sometimes your mind is able


---------13:06----------
to appreciate a picture of you and


---------13:08----------
anytime you start to appreciate a


---------13:11----------
picture of you this other part of your


---------13:12----------
mind wakes up and activates and it says


---------13:16----------
no no no no no no no no Ingrid no no no


---------13:20----------
it's just the lighting


---------13:21----------
you're not attractive it's just you


---------13:24----------
tricked you tricked people into thinking


---------13:26----------
that photo was decent it's all trickery


---------13:28----------
it's not the real you the real you is


---------13:30----------
what ingrate how do you feel about


---------13:33----------
yourself what do you think you look like


---------13:37----------
I just feel I just look I don't know


---------13:45----------
abortion okay I feel like I don't have


---------13:54----------
like a specific picture in my head of


---------13:56----------
what I look like it's just I have I feel


---------13:59----------
I am my proportions are unnatural like


---------14:05----------
almost as if I had a disease that's what


---------14:12----------
I think about everything and everything


---------14:16----------
meaning yourself what are my appearance


---------14:20----------
your nerves okay that you're just out of


---------14:22----------
proportion yes I I feel like I look like


---------14:26----------
a goblin resulting like some creature


---------14:30----------
from Lord of the Rings or sure like a


---------14:31----------
caricature like it's not like normal


---------14:33----------
looking yeah yeah yeah like you have all


---------14:36----------
the pieces that a normal human has but


---------14:38----------
you don't look like a normal human is


---------14:40----------
that how you mmm how long have you is it


---------14:44----------
okay if I ask you a few questions about


---------14:45----------
that yeah okay and by the way you know


---------14:48----------
just a disclaimer that you can choose


---------14:51----------
not to answer anything hmm


---------14:53----------
also you can tell me to go myself


---------14:55----------
at any point okay so can I rely on you


---------15:00----------
to exercise both of those options if you


---------15:04----------
feel that like they're appropriate okay


---------15:05----------
awesome yes


---------15:07----------
all right so how long have you been


---------15:10----------
feeling like you were out of proportion


---------15:13----------
um since high school I'm 20 now so three


---------15:22----------
years ago no one else three or six years


---------15:24----------
six years ago okay yeah but it's been


---------15:27----------
kind of up and down but it's been a lot


---------15:30----------
the last two years can you tell me a


---------15:33----------
little bit about


---------15:34----------
high school I always loved school


---------15:39----------
so the actual like classes in such work


---------15:43----------
I don't know I loved learning and just


---------15:47----------
reading stuff


---------15:50----------
that's rare I I miss high school for the


---------15:55----------
learning I didn't really have so before


---------16:02----------
high school I had two best friends and


---------16:04----------
they all they went to another high


---------16:08----------
school me so I didn't really have any


---------16:10----------
friends when I started there I didn't


---------16:12----------
know anyone and I didn't really get to


---------16:16----------
know anyone in those three years um so


---------16:20----------
it kind of just I kind of just woke up


---------16:23----------
went to school did school which was


---------16:25----------
super fun and went home and did my thing


---------16:31----------
and I was fine with that I didn't really


---------16:34----------
feel the need to have friends there did


---------16:41----------
you feel lonely sometimes but usually


---------16:46----------
not do what what kinds of thoughts did


---------16:50----------
you have about your appearance in high


---------16:52----------
school it wasn't as badass as now it was


---------17:00----------
I always thought that it didn't look


---------17:04----------
feminine at all


---------17:06----------
I always thought and I still do that I


---------17:09----------
look like totally oh boy or something


---------17:12----------
and I know I didn't look like a girl


---------17:19----------
okay


---------17:20----------
and it didn't help that everyone in my


---------17:23----------
class had kind of this joke too that


---------17:25----------
everyone thought I was a lesbian which


---------17:30----------
I'm not like but they're not that


---------17:32----------
there's anything wrong with being a


---------17:33----------
lesbian but the reason they thought I


---------17:35----------
was a lesbian was because first of all I


---------17:39----------
was into like more boy stuff sure but


---------17:44----------
and second gaming


---------17:47----------
right off yeah and poor games like


---------17:53----------
fantasy the Indians such I like football


---------17:58----------
yeah more boy stuff so I I never really


---------18:04----------
felt like I felt like a woman but I


---------18:09----------
didn't feel feminine you know sure and I


---------18:12----------
didn't really feel the need to defend


---------18:13----------
millions but now I do but I can't do you


---------18:19----------
feel like you kind of missed the boat on


---------18:21----------
that yeah like you could have if you had


---------18:25----------
been if you had acted differently or


---------18:27----------
behaved differently maybe you would be


---------18:28----------
more feminine than you are today yeah


---------18:32----------
like I say this my my two friends from


---------18:40----------
before my school I'm still friends with


---------18:42----------
them today like my whole life I've known


---------18:45----------
one of them my whole life and my whole


---------18:48----------
life I've always been very boyish you


---------18:52----------
know sure and I am I was fine with that


---------18:56----------
I kind of liked it because I was like I


---------19:00----------
always got to play with play football


---------19:02----------
with the guys and such and yeah so I


---------19:08----------
feel like now I can't go in the feminine


---------19:10----------
cuz everyone I know including my best


---------19:14----------
friends as always it was always like


---------19:17----------
they we always had inside jokes about


---------19:19----------
how I can't wear a dress they would


---------19:21----------
always say it they would hurt a little


---------19:24----------
bit but I wouldn't really care but now I


---------19:27----------
care


---------19:27----------
there's all the inside jokes about how I


---------19:30----------
cannot be feminine because that's not me


---------19:33----------
and how weird that would be if I did


---------19:35----------
anything feminine hmm can I think for a


---------19:42----------
second yeah


---------19:55----------
I'm gonna need a few seconds okay like


---------19:57----------
maybe like a minute so of course I'm


---------20:01----------
trying to think there was something in


---------20:02----------
my head


---------20:18----------
that's very helpful


---------20:20----------
I'm just not quite sure how okay so what


---------20:25----------
I don't I don't know how it relates to


---------20:26----------
the dysmorphia but I this yeah so maybe


---------20:30----------
it doesn't maybe it doesn't but what I'm


---------20:33----------
hearing you say is that essentially


---------20:35----------
you're not really you haven't been


---------20:37----------
allowed to be feminine I don't feel like


---------20:42----------
it right and it starts like it's not


---------20:45----------
started pretty early where you started


---------20:47----------
to conceptualize yourself as like more


---------20:49----------
masculine and then I guess like when I


---------20:55----------
was 40 and I felt it was kind of cool if


---------20:57----------
I was a tomboy or something


---------20:59----------
sure cuz every other girl I knew in my


---------21:03----------
class was very feminine yeah so I got to


---------21:08----------
hang play football with the guys and


---------21:09----------
such in that that used to be kind of


---------21:12----------
cool but what I'm hearing you kind of


---------21:14----------
it's almost like at some point other


---------21:16----------
people haven't allowed you to be


---------21:18----------
feminine or haven't encouraged you to be


---------21:20----------
feminine at some point you stopped


---------21:22----------
allowing yourself to be found on oh yeah


---------21:27----------
so I noticed you're wearing a t-shirt


---------21:29----------
yeah do you wear more like t-shirts like


---------21:34----------
you wear dresses or more traditionally


---------21:36----------
feminine clothing I own a lot of it but


---------21:41----------
I don't wear it yeah so let's think what


---------21:44----------
happens when you try to put it on or you


---------21:46----------
think about putting it off I


---------21:50----------
just on I just can't I just I can't wear


---------21:58----------
it yeah what happened I just can't


---------22:01----------
it's put it on and it's can you put it


---------22:07----------
on or you can't even put it on I'm not


---------22:09----------
talking about in public I'm talking


---------22:11----------
about like can you even try a dress on


---------22:13----------
and in the privacy of your own home or a


---------22:15----------
room we can um but not the law how do


---------22:22----------
you feel when you put it on


---------22:24----------
I feel stupid like I say to myself like


---------22:33----------
almost like how dare you believe you can


---------22:35----------
actually wear this absolutely yeah


---------22:41----------
right so the funny thing here is I I


---------22:43----------
don't even know and just so that that


---------22:46----------
sounds like that kind of relates to the


---------22:48----------
body dysmorphia to me what do you think


---------22:53----------
yeah I guess it does I mean I understand


---------22:57----------
that body dysmorphia has a particular


---------22:59----------
representation in your mind but I find


---------23:01----------
it hard to believe that having a


---------23:04----------
particular view of how you look and


---------23:06----------
being unable to wear a dress like I find


---------23:10----------
it hard to believe that those are fully


---------23:11----------
independent so you know it's it they're


---------23:16----------
probably connected yeah yeah and and I


---------23:18----------
can understand why it's hard to connect


---------23:20----------
them because the way that those thoughts


---------23:23----------
look and feel are like very different


---------23:25----------
right if you look in a mirror and you


---------23:27----------
say I'm disproportional or my from


---------23:31----------
Martians aren't correct and you put on a


---------23:32----------
dress and you you say how dare you like


---------23:37----------
those feel like different thoughts but I


---------23:38----------
think there's something about it's so


---------23:45----------
hard it's like right on the edge of my


---------23:47----------
understanding it's like at some point


---------23:49----------
you didn't no one allowed you to be


---------23:52----------
feminine and then you didn't allow


---------23:54----------
yourself to be feminine and then instead


---------23:56----------
of not allowing it it became true does


---------24:01----------
that make sense like something shifted


---------24:02----------
I'm getting the sense of a shift where


---------24:04----------
you used to be like how dare you and now


---------24:06----------
you're like I can't does that make sense


---------24:12----------
like it became like a fact instead of


---------24:15----------
like a choice feel like it would mean I


---------24:20----------
would be comfortable with wearing maybe


---------24:23----------
a men's jacket the nurse yeah that makes


---------24:27----------
a lot of sense and I know it's like it's


---------24:30----------
pretty normal for girls to wear male


---------24:31----------
t-shirts and such so I don't know maybe


---------24:36----------
doesn't count but


---------24:37----------
I would feel more comfortable wearing


---------24:40----------
men's yeah so you know oddly enough I'm


---------24:45----------
not getting any sense of gender identity


---------24:49----------
confusion from you


---------24:51----------
no right right I am yeah


---------24:55----------
so that I'm pretty clear on that I also


---------24:58----------
don't get the sense that you're actually


---------25:01----------
a transvestite if that makes do you know


---------25:03----------
what a transvestite is yeah yeah so just


---------25:06----------
the way that I remember it is


---------25:07----------
transvestites or someone of a particular


---------25:09----------
gender who wears another genders


---------25:12----------
clothing but it doesn't mean that they


---------25:14----------
think that they are like so that I then


---------25:17----------
the world citizen huh yeah it's


---------25:19----------
cross-dressing so it's not actually like


---------25:21----------
you know a man who wears women's


---------25:23----------
clothing is not doesn't think that


---------25:25----------
they're a woman and they're not


---------25:26----------
homosexual has nothing to do with like


---------25:28----------
sexuality or gender identity it's just I


---------25:30----------
you know the trick that I use to


---------25:32----------
remember or when I was learning this


---------25:34----------
stuff is you know transvestite has the


---------25:37----------
word vest in it and so it's about


---------25:39----------
clothing it's about what you wear on the


---------25:40----------
outside it's about nothing about who you


---------25:42----------
are on the inside but I'm not getting


---------25:45----------
the sense that you're a transvestite


---------25:46----------
either I think no yeah I like to put it


---------25:50----------
another way it's like I want to I want


---------25:53----------
to wear female feminine clothes that I


---------25:56----------
can't so I wear I don't really wear


---------26:00----------
men's clothes I don't but I would be


---------26:03----------
more comfortable wearing it but not


---------26:04----------
because I want to write you know because


---------26:07----------
it's it's uncomfortable for you to wear


---------26:09----------
I don't I don't want to wear men's


---------26:11----------
clothes but I would rather wear men's


---------26:13----------
clothes no okay I think yeah yeah oh god


---------26:19----------
sorry please III so I rather where I I


---------26:23----------
wear clothes maids for women but like


---------26:26----------
not particularly feminine of course like


---------26:29----------
this t-shirt yeah


---------26:31----------
it's the questions how to help you


---------26:34----------
do you want help yeah what do you want


---------26:38----------
to help


---------26:40----------
[Music]


---------26:45----------
I don't know it's it's just too I wish


---------26:52----------
there was like some way I could just


---------26:53----------
realize that like I don't even need to


---------26:55----------
feel pretty I just need to feel normal


---------26:57----------
you know so I don't know actually cuz


---------27:03----------
like I don't know and if you realize


---------27:08----------
that what would change about your mind


---------27:10----------
what would change about the person that


---------27:12----------
you are well I definitely wouldn't spend


---------27:16----------
as much time worrying about it worrying


---------27:20----------
about what about how I look like if I


---------27:26----------
could just settle with I'm normal true


---------27:31----------
then I probably wouldn't spend as much


---------27:35----------
time thinking pictures and looking in


---------27:37----------
there yeah it's it's kind of sad


---------27:42----------
actually to think that you would be


---------27:43----------
happy with just being normal


---------27:45----------
you know yes I mean I feel sad when I


---------27:51----------
hear you say that I I remember even


---------27:55----------
feelings to some degree that way myself


---------27:58----------
not so much about appearance but that I


---------27:59----------
was less than human in a lot of ways and


---------28:04----------
I didn't want to be exceptional or the


---------28:06----------
best I just wanted to be normal


---------28:09----------
yeah I don't I don't need to be I don't


---------28:15----------
need to like feel like I'm gorgeous but


---------28:20----------
how do you want this a normal one


---------28:22----------
I just want to feel not terrible


---------28:27----------
like not like a goblin hmm and when did


---------28:31----------
you start to feel like a goblin


---------28:33----------
I haven't actually thought about it that


---------28:36----------
way before but uh that's what we're here


---------28:39----------
for


---------28:40----------
think about things but um I guess the


---------28:48----------
last year has been very like yes peached


---------28:52----------
okay yeah so we're not talking about the


---------28:54----------
peak right so you said you played D&D


---------28:57----------
yeah a little bit more


---------28:59----------
okay yeah you like fantasy stuff yeah


---------29:02----------
like do you remember you know looking at


---------29:06----------
something from the fantasy genre whether


---------29:08----------
it be a video game or book or movie or


---------29:10----------
whatever and like looking at a picture


---------29:12----------
of like a monster or goblin and thinking


---------29:15----------
like oh that's what I look like


---------29:17----------
that's me well clearly no it's never


---------29:29----------
wouldn't I'm actually looked at them


---------29:31----------
I've never related to it but it's more


---------29:32----------
like in my mind


---------29:34----------
sure okay and what about when so you


---------29:39----------
said high school is when you started you


---------29:42----------
didn't have many friends in high school


---------29:43----------
I had I I was neutral everyone so no I


---------29:49----------
didn't really have friends I didn't have


---------29:51----------
anyone any outfit and how did you feel


---------29:54----------
about that it was actually it's okay


---------29:59----------
actually because I still had my two best


---------30:03----------
friends in the other school that I saw


---------30:06----------
in my spare time sometimes and are your


---------30:09----------
best friend's girls or boys girls and


---------30:13----------
are you still close with them yeah not


---------30:16----------
so much one of them but missing Newt but


---------30:19----------
the other one I'm still close with hmm


---------30:22----------
can you tell me a little bit about your


---------30:25----------
parents and what growing up was like I


---------30:28----------
hadn't I probably had the ideal


---------30:32----------
childhood so parents are there they've


---------30:38----------
stayed together are we're we never


---------30:41----------
struggled with money my parents has


---------30:44----------
always been supportive they've always


---------30:47----------
kind of kind of their whole idea of how


---------30:52----------
to raise children is just let them


---------30:53----------
figure things out and it'll be okay you


---------30:56----------
know so like they didn't let me do


---------31:01----------
dangerous stuff but they left me kind of


---------31:04----------
lets me take risks they let me do


---------31:06----------
whatever what I wanted and felt like and


---------31:11----------
if that went bad


---------31:13----------
to learn the consequences you know


---------31:14----------
mm-hmm


---------31:16----------
some would say that's not ideal but I


---------31:19----------
would say it's pretty good because the


---------31:23----------
the their their philosophy philosophy


---------31:26----------
was that as long as you're honest we


---------31:32----------
won't be mad and as long as as long as


---------31:38----------
you ask you if you do something wrong or


---------31:42----------
bad as long as you take responsibility


---------31:44----------
it's fine what with limit limitations of


---------31:50----------
course so it sounds like you you you're


---------31:53----------
very grateful for the childhood you've


---------31:54----------
had I am everything was fine


---------32:00----------
is your mom feminine yeah she's not


---------32:06----------
super feminine but she wears dresses and


---------32:10----------
she doesn't wear makeup she's she has


---------32:15----------
like a very feminine personality and she


---------32:19----------
dresses feminine but she's also very how


---------32:25----------
do I say this


---------32:26----------
she has characteristics of more like a


---------32:29----------
masculine like she's handy and mm-hmm


---------32:33----------
yeah so it sounds like you had a pretty


---------32:38----------
you know like a role model in your life


---------32:40----------
in terms of your mom that was a little


---------32:42----------
bit more on the masculine side yeah same


---------32:48----------
with my sister she has always been very


---------32:50----------
feminine has has always been very


---------32:53----------
feminine yes


---------32:54----------
older or younger older three years old


---------32:58----------
do you remember what it was like if you


---------33:01----------
had thoughts about when you were in high


---------33:03----------
school so when you were 14 and she was


---------33:05----------
17


---------33:06----------
do you remember thinking about the


---------33:09----------
difference between you and her but not


---------33:13----------
in a negative way yeah just that we were


---------33:17----------
different very different she was very


---------33:23----------
like


---------33:25----------
she wore makeup she wore feminine things


---------33:30----------
she explored a lot with fashion and just


---------33:36----------
ways of expressing herself through


---------33:38----------
clothes and makeup and such she liked


---------33:43----------
more feminine things when she was 15 she


---------33:47----------
loves Twilight yeah all that stuff how


---------33:52----------
do you feel about Twilight I don't like


---------33:57----------
it but I feel like Who am I to say it's


---------34:00----------
bad because I'm not the target audience


---------34:02----------
it's it's good for 12 year olds I guess


---------34:05----------
so I work you don't like Twilight that


---------34:07----------
just means you have good taste I guess I


---------34:13----------
don't like it but I I can see how a


---------34:16----------
fourteen-year-old girl would like it I


---------34:18----------
can't even see how a 14 year old girl


---------34:20----------
would like it long but and and so what


---------34:28----------
I'm hearing you say Ingrid is that you


---------34:30----------
know when you were in early high school


---------34:32----------
he started


---------34:34----------
I mean you've known that you aren't very


---------34:35----------
feminine but it really wasn't a problem


---------34:37----------
for you when did it start to become a


---------34:38----------
problem


---------34:45----------
I guess when when most people around me


---------34:51----------
started when people like when people you


---------34:58----------
know just reach a certain point where


---------34:59----------
there's suddenly a difference between


---------35:00----------
boys and girls like there's not much


---------35:05----------
different difference when you're eight


---------35:07----------
years old you know but I'll explain it


---------35:14----------
when when all the girls in my class we


---------35:20----------
weren't a lot of girls in my class but


---------35:22----------
when all the girls in my class suddenly


---------35:23----------
were so focused on all the feminine hmm


---------35:26----------
and the guys were more masculine it's


---------35:31----------
like I had all the same interests as as


---------35:39----------
guys in my class but I kind of wanted to


---------35:43----------
hang out with the girls you know but you


---------35:46----------
kind of didn't know how to yeah I


---------35:48----------
remember there was I was invited to a


---------35:52----------
birthday party once in a girl in my


---------35:54----------
class I think the reason she invited me


---------35:58----------
like she didn't want to be mean or


---------35:59----------
anything but we didn't really know each


---------36:02----------
other


---------36:02----------
the like we were only seven girls in my


---------36:04----------
class and she was inviting everyone else


---------36:06----------
so she invited me too and I remember


---------36:10----------
just sitting there and did not know what


---------36:13----------
to do or talk about because I couldn't


---------36:16----------
relate to anything I did not know how to


---------36:21----------
join the conversation how did you feel


---------36:23----------
last year I felt awkward I wanted to


---------36:28----------
leave because it was boring boring yeah


---------36:36----------
I said I I didn't really care about


---------36:45----------
anything they were talking about and


---------36:48----------
everything they were talking about kind


---------36:50----------
of seeing that I don't know the word in


---------36:54----------
English


---------36:55----------
like what's the working language


---------36:58----------
over flawless which is they only talk to


---------37:05----------
things that don't matter and I'm not


---------37:10----------
saying you have to talk about important


---------37:12----------
stuff all the time like you can


---------37:13----------
obviously talk and small


---------37:15----------
stuff they talked about things that are


---------37:17----------
like so insignificant that I don't even


---------37:24----------
know what to add yeah there's there's


---------37:27----------
nothing for me to grab you know do I


---------37:34----------
think for another second


---------37:46----------
I Ingrid I'm sensing a lot of tension


---------37:52----------
between judging something and wanting


---------37:55----------
that thing like I can almost sense like


---------37:59----------
in your mind like a sense of you don't


---------38:02----------
really want to be feminine like you want


---------38:04----------
to be feminine but you don't really care


---------38:06----------
to be found them you know it's like


---------38:08----------
there's a part of you that like wants to


---------38:09----------
wear dresses and there's a part of you


---------38:11----------
that's like completely happy being


---------38:12----------
masculine and like it's kind of shallow


---------38:14----------
and like makeup is sort of silly but at


---------38:17----------
the same time you want it yeah it's it's


---------38:23----------
I kind of disagree with you on that


---------38:27----------
because um I'm sure he didn't mean it


---------38:31----------
like that but I feel like the way you


---------38:34----------
said that sounds like more important


---------38:39----------
thoughts are more like masculine while


---------38:43----------
shallow things are feminine that's what


---------38:45----------
I heard I know I didn't mean it like


---------38:46----------
that


---------38:46----------
that's it interesting let me just think


---------38:48----------
about that for a second yeah do you feel


---------38:55----------
that way though no I don't okay do you


---------39:06----------
do you judge yourself for wanting to be


---------39:08----------
more feminine


---------39:18----------
kind of but kind of not yes just kind of


---------39:23----------
not because I feel like it's it's a


---------39:26----------
normal thing like when you are happy


---------39:29----------
with the gender you are I I guess it's


---------39:37----------
normal to feel like you want to look


---------39:39----------
like that genders sure no of course let


---------39:43----------
me ask you something when you were at


---------39:44----------
that birthday party did you feel left


---------39:47----------
out yeah that did you feel I know this


---------39:54----------
is gonna sound kind of weird but


---------39:56----------
disproportionate mm-hmm did you feel


---------40:00----------
like a goblin not physically at that


---------40:07----------
time but I guess like mentally I felt


---------40:12----------
like I didn't wasn't supposed to be


---------40:13----------
there didn't belong - yeah


---------40:16----------
so when I when I think about not so I


---------40:19----------
don't I'm not supposed to be here and


---------40:22----------
and like I can almost envision when you


---------40:25----------
put on a dress there's a part of your


---------40:27----------
mind that says I'm not supposed to wear


---------40:28----------
this like this isn't me well yeah it's I


---------40:36----------
don't know how to describe it it's uh it


---------40:39----------
is what you're saying it's true okay so


---------40:42----------
yeah so so I think it's kind of


---------40:44----------
interesting because you know I guess


---------40:47----------
this is this is where I sort of I didn't


---------40:50----------
use good words and thank you for


---------40:51----------
pointing out you know where you disagree


---------40:53----------
but I guess I get a sense of like


---------40:55----------
there's a part of you that wants this


---------40:57----------
and there's a part of you that judges


---------40:59----------
that that's what I'm sensing that you


---------41:01----------
want to wear a dress


---------41:02----------
I get that you're sensing that that's


---------41:07----------
not what I meant


---------41:08----------
um I'm not saying like femininities


---------41:10----------
shallow because they're not it is I know


---------41:13----------
so so I think that wasn't a good example


---------41:14----------
so so I'm trying to clarify so I think


---------41:16----------
that like you want to wear a gendered


---------41:18----------
dress but you also judge yourself for


---------41:20----------
wearing a dress


---------41:21----------
all right let's forget about shallowness


---------41:23----------
and femininity for a moment but just


---------41:26----------
that there's a part of you that like


---------41:27----------
wants it and there's a part of you that


---------41:29----------
blames you for like trying to have it


---------41:31----------
Hey


---------41:32----------
that's a better way to put it hmm is


---------41:35----------
that fair


---------41:36----------
oh yeah I want to I want to feel okay


---------41:41----------
wearing feminine stuff yep and when did


---------41:49----------
you start judging yourself or when did


---------41:55----------
you start thinking that it's not like


---------41:57----------
it's awkward or it's not you to wear or


---------42:00----------
be feminine wear feminine things are to


---------42:03----------
be feminine when did that start kind of


---------42:07----------
always been like that it's it's always


---------42:10----------
been like that that I it's just been


---------42:12----------
it's been always been a part of my


---------42:14----------
personality to not be feminine right and


---------42:17----------
not just good not just to me


---------42:19----------
so everyone yeah fine so I'm not talking


---------42:22----------
about whether it's been a part I'm


---------42:23----------
asking when did you start judging


---------42:25----------
yourself for it oh right because you're


---------42:28----------
also saying that used to be perfectly


---------42:30----------
fine like being a tomboy but at some


---------42:33----------
point that changed right at some point


---------42:36----------
you started to become less okay with


---------42:38----------
like being more masculine and less


---------42:41----------
feminine is that basically around


---------42:45----------
puberty no I guess it was last year of


---------42:54----------
high school


---------42:55----------
maybe second-year high school


---------42:57----------
we're taking her 30 what happened then


---------42:59----------
what happened tell me about that I don't


---------43:01----------
know watch it I I don't know um I just I


---------43:07----------
remember its it kind of went like slow I


---------43:09----------
what I thought I remember one day I


---------43:11----------
thought maybe I want to wear makeup


---------43:14----------
today


---------43:15----------
to school just because I think makeup


---------43:19----------
can be can it looks like it can be fun


---------43:22----------
you know I didn't do it but and it's


---------43:28----------
just like my thoughts like I just


---------43:29----------
started coming yeah why didn't you do it


---------43:31----------
I think it's very helpful tell me why


---------43:33----------
didn't you do it because I didn't first


---------43:38----------
of all I knew everyone in class well not


---------43:40----------
everyone people in class and my friend


---------43:43----------
would comment on it


---------43:47----------
like doesn't matter if it was positive


---------43:49----------
or negative they would notice it and


---------43:53----------
comment on it if I showed up at school


---------43:56----------
with Mike what does that mean to you


---------43:58----------
they kind of wished I just wish they


---------44:01----------
wouldn't have said anything they just


---------44:04----------
let me wear makeup and not say anything


---------44:08----------
about it I didn't want I didn't want


---------44:10----------
people wouldn't notice it why did you


---------44:12----------
want to be noticed why do you want to be


---------44:16----------
invisible


---------44:16----------
I never I've never liked it


---------44:21----------
I don't like being noticed


---------44:25----------
well I a lot of being noticed by people


---------44:29----------
very close to me but everyone else is I


---------44:33----------
don't I don't want to be noticed by


---------44:35----------
people I'm fine with just like walking


---------44:38----------
through and not be noticed yeah that is


---------44:41----------
queer question is what does it mean to


---------44:44----------
be notice to you what happens when


---------44:47----------
people notice you I get embarrassed why


---------44:53----------
what where did you where did you learn


---------44:56----------
that noticing comes with it being


---------44:59----------
noticed


---------44:59----------
comes with embarrassment it's just like


---------45:05----------
I've thought about this before and like


---------45:07----------
I can't put it into words


---------45:09----------
but best way I can describe it is like


---------45:12----------
if I enter a room you know how when if


---------45:15----------
you're in a room and someone else enters


---------45:17----------
room you immediately like look at them


---------45:18----------
just because that's what you do I just


---------45:24----------
hate the thought of entering a room and


---------45:28----------
being aware that other people in the


---------45:31----------
room is aware that I just entered the


---------45:33----------
room even if they don't care I entered


---------45:35----------
the room even if it don't look I mean I


---------45:37----------
just hate thought of the people being


---------45:40----------
aware of me how long have you been like


---------45:47----------
that


---------45:50----------
since I was like I don't remember


---------45:54----------
exactly like 12 13 14 maybe did you have


---------45:59----------
a crush on anyone in high school not


---------46:03----------
really I never really thought about


---------46:08----------
stuff like that have you ever had a


---------46:09----------
crush on anyone well okay now gonna say


---------46:14----------
something but I have a boyfriend so it's


---------46:24----------
yeah that's a whole other story but like


---------46:28----------
before him I never had any interest in


---------46:31----------
anyone romantically I never even had a


---------46:35----------
celebrity crush how do you understand


---------46:41----------
that what do you mean how does one


---------46:46----------
understand like so like most people you


---------46:50----------
know tend to have a crush at some point


---------46:52----------
during high school hmm right so if


---------46:55----------
you're not if you don't have a crush


---------46:56----------
during high school then what do you


---------47:00----------
think is up with that I think it's


---------47:03----------
because when I notice in my relationship


---------47:09----------
now I how do I say this I don't I


---------47:17----------
honestly think my boyfriend is handsome


---------47:19----------
but I really really care about looks


---------47:22----------
this arm that looks thing cares about


---------47:27----------
looks like a normal person like do you


---------47:29----------
ever know why he's with you yeah all the


---------47:32----------
time


---------47:33----------
I ask him all the time what is he saying


---------47:38----------
he say cuz I love you what is that how


---------47:44----------
do you feel when he says that


---------47:51----------
I mean it makes me feel happy because


---------48:01----------
cuz like personality-wise why it's sure


---------48:05----------
but looks I don't know why he stays


---------48:10----------
doesn't do better yeah so I mean does


---------48:15----------
that doesn't sort of make sense that he


---------48:18----------
says because I love you not because


---------48:19----------
you're beautiful


---------48:23----------
what do you mean like so does he ever


---------48:26----------
does he ever comment on your appearance


---------48:28----------
do you know and how do you feel when he


---------48:31----------
does that he does seat a lot and I I say


---------48:39----------
he's a good boyfriend well yeah he I say


---------48:51----------
thank you but it's like I I don't


---------48:53----------
believe it it's like he's just saying it


---------48:58----------
because he has to because it's my


---------49:01----------
boyfriend


---------49:03----------
[Music]


---------49:14----------
how are you feeling right now talking


---------49:16----------
about this I hate calm like I was so


---------49:22----------
stressed before the stream but it's it's


---------49:25----------
fine now what is it like talking about


---------49:27----------
it I've done it so many times with


---------49:32----------
professionals that I just I've said


---------49:37----------
these sentences before so it's it's fine


---------49:43----------
what's I don't working with


---------49:45----------
professionals I don't notice I've been


---------49:49----------
unlucky with the professionals I've been


---------49:51----------
set up with but I it's been terrible


---------49:54----------
what's been terrible about it


---------49:56----------
it's they will I've never felt like that


---------50:09----------
actually try to understand what it feels


---------50:15----------
like it's been more like they've I


---------50:18----------
almost felt like a test subject that


---------50:22----------
like Adam no which is one of the reasons


---------50:27----------
why I applied to be on stream because I


---------50:30----------
feel like you talk differently than the


---------50:33----------
ones I found him so you're saying it


---------50:38----------
feels like a being a test object how so


---------50:41----------
[Music]


---------50:43----------
because they and they've told me so many


---------50:48----------
times like this is the way that we have


---------50:49----------
seen is working and etc that's why we're


---------50:52----------
doing this but it's it's they asked me


---------50:56----------
tons of questions that I feel like


---------50:59----------
doesn't get me thinking at all because


---------51:02----------
they're just asking questions I've


---------51:04----------
already asked told them the answer to


---------51:08----------
but they're not they're not connecting


---------51:12----------
that together so I just feel like I'm


---------51:15----------
repeating what I've already said I feel


---------51:17----------
like I am explaining I I'm explaining


---------51:21----------
how I feel to them and then they are


---------51:23----------
trying to understand it but they're not


---------51:31----------
our state they're not it feels like I'm


---------51:37----------
the one you're the expert in the room


---------51:40----------
yeah if you look on the expert I'm gonna


---------51:45----------
be getting anything from you sure yeah


---------51:49----------
that's what it's been with the


---------51:52----------
professional stuffing gravy are you ugly


---------51:53----------
I think I am wasn't the coin I think I


---------51:59----------
am what is there doubt oh really


---------52:05----------
so I'll ask you again are you ugly yeah


---------52:08----------
how long have you been ugly I guess


---------52:13----------
since puberty


---------52:14----------
I feel like children aren't Oakley


---------52:16----------
there's children oh sure what are we


---------52:19----------
gonna do about that I don't know I have


---------52:25----------
no idea


---------52:31----------
hmm


---------52:34----------
do you think it's possible for me to


---------52:36----------
convince you that you're not ugly I


---------52:45----------
think it's possible to feel less ugly


---------52:47----------
but not no not not ugly okay


---------52:50----------
do you think you can live a happy life


---------52:53----------
if you are ugly yeah do you are you


---------52:58----------
happy usually not but what gets in the


---------53:03----------
way of your happiness like I've um


---------53:12----------
during this whole quarantine thing I've


---------53:15----------
felt a bit better because I don't have


---------53:17----------
to go out but um I don't know it's as I


---------53:32----------
said before just the thought of people


---------53:33----------
are aware of me you know did you have a


---------53:37----------
problem being noticed when you were a


---------53:39----------
kid like I didn't get attention or


---------53:42----------
something no you didn't like attention I


---------53:46----------
never liked the tension so do you really


---------53:51----------
think your problem do you wish that your


---------53:52----------
mom had taught you how to put on makeup


---------53:54----------
or your sister time you put on makeup


---------53:56----------
when you were in high school no not


---------54:01----------
really


---------54:02----------
it's um I don't know how to answer that


---------54:07----------
because I wish I had just done it and I


---------54:15----------
thought that they had pushed it on me


---------54:17----------
perfect that makes sense


---------54:23----------
okay Ingrid I'm gonna share a couple of


---------54:29----------
thoughts with you if that's okay I feel


---------54:32----------
like I could ask you more questions but


---------54:34----------
I'm not so sure that they would get


---------54:35----------
anywhere so I'd like to share some


---------54:36----------
thoughts with you and then get a sense


---------54:38----------
of whether you think we're on the right


---------54:39----------
track or not and then we can try to


---------54:41----------
figure out where to go from here hmm


---------54:43----------
so the first is I think it's very


---------54:45----------
strange that you the way that you


---------54:48----------
describe your high school experience


---------54:51----------
like and maybe this is just me


---------54:53----------
projecting my own high school experience


---------54:55----------
but I think it's very strange that you


---------54:56----------
were not attracted or had a crush on a


---------54:58----------
single person during high school what do


---------55:01----------
you think about that I know it's strange


---------55:04----------
because like even if you don't have a


---------55:07----------
huge crush on someone people usually


---------55:09----------
have like people day


---------55:11----------
absolutely hormones right yeah I


---------55:14----------
never really liked that you you started


---------55:18----------
getting your period and stuff sometime


---------55:19----------
around high school well way earlier than


---------55:23----------
that but really do you know when girls


---------55:28----------
get their periods


---------55:29----------
yeah well how old were you when you got


---------55:31----------
your period sirki okay so but a high


---------55:35----------
school is 14 right oh no my country is


---------55:39----------
16 so oh god okay so so you got your


---------55:43----------
period when you were 13 and then did you


---------55:45----------
notice changes in your body around that


---------55:48----------
time too I'm yeah did people treat you


---------55:52----------
differently around that time no did


---------55:56----------
people treat other girls differently


---------55:57----------
around that time like did the boys treat


---------55:59----------
other girls differently around that time


---------56:13----------
I don't I don't really know okay I don't


---------56:17----------
know okay it's I don't think so okay so


---------56:20----------
let's kind of go back to high school and


---------56:22----------
let's let's kind of toss in what ever


---------56:24----------
was before high school too so I just


---------56:27----------
think it's a little bit strange also


---------56:28----------
that you said that like during high


---------56:30----------
school you really didn't have any


---------56:31----------
friends and you were okay with in high


---------56:34----------
school or before in high school yeah


---------56:36----------
that also strikes me as a little bit


---------56:38----------
strange okay because my understanding is


---------56:47----------
that most people so it's not that


---------56:49----------
strange to not have friends in high


---------56:51----------
school what strikes me is a little bit


---------56:53----------
stranger is to not want friends in high


---------56:56----------
school I was just I was just have been


---------57:03----------
doing my school work that's I understand


---------57:06----------
that you were happy doing your school


---------57:07----------
work but I think that you were let me


---------57:09----------
put it a different way would you say


---------57:11----------
that you are comfortable doing your


---------57:12----------
school work comfortable yes yeah in high


---------57:18----------
school would you say you were


---------57:19----------
uncomfortable on interacting with other


---------57:21----------
people yeah usually yeah yeah right so


---------57:30----------
yeah so I mean that also is not like a


---------57:33----------
like you know that applies to pretty


---------57:35----------
much everyone but what I'm noticing in


---------57:38----------
you in grid and and just try to take a


---------57:39----------
step back and just like like try it as


---------57:42----------
best as you can to listen to what I'm


---------57:43----------
saying pull yourself out of your own


---------57:44----------
shoes for a second and what it sounds to


---------57:48----------
me like is you actually have you


---------57:49----------
probably have things going on within you


---------57:51----------
that you're not really aware of or don't


---------57:53----------
remember so I think that this comes down


---------57:58----------
to comfort and discomfort and that you


---------58:01----------
let yourself you you're kind of like you


---------58:03----------
strike me as somewhat avoidant right


---------58:07----------
like if things make you uncomfortable


---------58:08----------
it's like really hard which is why I


---------58:10----------
think it's so awesome that you actually


---------58:11----------
came on stream that's insane but


---------58:14----------
that that you know you tend to shy away


---------58:16----------
from things that make you uncomfortable


---------58:17----------
which is a completely normal thing for


---------58:19----------
human beings to do but in your case I


---------58:22----------
think you've even shied away from some


---------58:24----------
of your thoughts and feelings from a


---------58:26----------
young


---------58:26----------
and that like I don't think that you


---------58:29----------
suddenly develop body dysmorphia at the


---------58:31----------
age of like seven I mean people do you


---------58:33----------
get diagnosed with it because it becomes


---------58:35----------
it becomes like problematic like you


---------58:38----------
said a year or two ago like that's when


---------58:40----------
it you use the word Pete right like when


---------58:42----------
you talked about bodies this morphe you


---------58:44----------
said it peaked like a year ago


---------58:45----------
but that still implies that it started


---------58:48----------
way before that but whenever I ask you


---------58:52----------
questions about like you know how did


---------58:53----------
you feel about your appearance and


---------58:55----------
sometimes you can give me answers that


---------58:57----------
maybe are the ones that I'm looking for


---------58:58----------
like when we think about that party in


---------59:00----------
high school that you got invited to


---------59:01----------
there's so much laced into there the


---------59:04----------
first is that like and I want you to


---------59:06----------
notice like you even have such a low


---------59:08----------
opinion of yourself that you say the


---------59:12----------
only reason she invited me is because


---------59:13----------
she invited everyone else do you see


---------59:17----------
that like it's like you're not even


---------59:19----------
worth inviting does that make sense like


---------59:23----------
in your mind as you tell the story it's


---------59:25----------
like there's no reason she would want to


---------59:27----------
invite me you're not worth and great and


---------59:32----------
you kind of say well we weren't really


---------59:33----------
friends but she invited everyone else so


---------59:35----------
she must have invited me and like that


---------59:37----------
may be true but the point here and this


---------59:39----------
is the really interesting thing is that


---------59:41----------
some people who are most people who find


---------59:44----------
themselves being unhappy or like not


---------59:47----------
something in their life isn't going well


---------59:49----------
they usually blame someone else right


---------59:54----------
mm-hmm and and so but then when I ask


---------59:56----------
you a question and it's kind of


---------59:58----------
interesting that you know your mom isn't


---------59:59----------
so feminine and your sister is like


---------60:00----------
pretty feminine that you don't really


---------60:02----------
blame them you blame yourself


---------60:04----------
and so what I'm detecting at the bar at


---------60:07----------
the bottom of all of this whether you


---------60:08----------
call it body dysmorphia are not being


---------60:10----------
feminine or whatever is a sense that


---------60:12----------
like you are not like worthwhile in some


---------60:15----------
fundamental way that you are not worth


---------60:18----------
inviting to a party that you recognize


---------60:22----------
and I think the cool thing is that there


---------60:24----------
are parts of you that recognize that


---------60:25----------
like you have Worth is a human being and


---------60:27----------
I doesn't seem it seems like I get the


---------60:31----------
sense that it's not alien that there's


---------60:33----------
there's a guy out there who loves you


---------60:35----------
that's not alien to you right like that


---------60:38----------
doesn't feel weird or does it


---------60:40----------
well no um what feels alien to you is


---------60:44----------
that there's a guy who's attracted to


---------60:46----------
you physically yeah and and so it's kind


---------60:51----------
of interesting because I think you have


---------60:52----------
parts of you that recognized that like


---------60:54----------
you're a decent person and you're you're


---------60:55----------
fine and stuff like that but there's


---------60:57----------
this undercurrent of like assumption


---------60:59----------
that you're not gonna get invited to a


---------61:00----------
birthday party like unless they're


---------61:02----------
inviting they're just doing it to be


---------61:03----------
polite and and I think that that this is


---------61:08----------
where we've gotta really like I'm


---------61:09----------
wondering what other so as we try to


---------61:12----------
understand why you have these feelings


---------61:14----------
or where these feelings come from by the


---------61:17----------
way do you want to jump in or comment


---------61:19----------
listen I'm on the right track wrong


---------61:21----------
track makes sense doesn't make sense it


---------61:24----------
makes sense yeah so the basic issue is


---------61:28----------
we talk to you about like body


---------61:29----------
dysmorphia and feminism not feminism but


---------61:33----------
like feminist femininity femininity


---------61:36----------
thank you


---------61:40----------
you know like it's like I feel like


---------61:42----------
we're missing some piece of the puzzle


---------61:44----------
here like you could describe certain


---------61:46----------
feelings and you can say okay but like


---------61:48----------
there's just some things that seem like


---------61:49----------
gaps to me and what I think is going on


---------61:51----------
is that you're probably moving away from


---------61:54----------
certain thoughts or feelings because


---------61:56----------
they make you uncomfortable which is


---------61:59----------
bizarre because like you wouldn't expect


---------62:00----------
that right because like now you're


---------62:02----------
you're telling us things like when I


---------62:04----------
look in the mirror I feel


---------62:05----------
disproportionate I feel like I'm a


---------62:07----------
goblin like I feel like I like you know


---------62:09----------
you're because you're saying lots of


---------62:10----------
stuff that makes us makes it appear like


---------62:13----------
you're giving us a transparent look at


---------62:15----------
your mind which you are but I think


---------62:17----------
what's missing is that you didn't always


---------62:19----------
know how to do that right like as as the


---------62:23----------
body dysmorphia crystallizes in your


---------62:25----------
mind you can give us a more transparent


---------62:26----------
view of what's going on in your mind


---------62:29----------
make sense so I don't think you're


---------62:31----------
hiding things from us it's just that I


---------62:33----------
think this started a long time ago and


---------62:35----------
you have like very little awareness of


---------62:37----------
it like in high school yeah so in a


---------62:42----------
bizarre way I think the way forward is


---------62:44----------
to really tunnel down because I think


---------62:46----------
there's there are some things that


---------62:48----------
somewhere along the way like people made


---------62:50----------
you feel like you do not you're not


---------62:53----------
feminine like I don't think and I think


---------62:57----------
some of it was tomboyish but I would


---------62:58----------
guess that there is some insignificant


---------63:01----------
events in your mind that actually were


---------63:03----------
quite significant


---------63:04----------
I should also probably say I forgot to


---------63:09----------
said I have had comments said to me in


---------63:13----------
high school schools about my appearance


---------63:16----------
negatively yeah so but here's the


---------63:19----------
question so I think here's the turning


---------63:21----------
point Ingrid when so at some point those


---------63:24----------
comments I think hurt you because you


---------63:26----------
didn't believe it that about yourself


---------63:28----------
and at some point you started to believe


---------63:31----------
those things about yourself does that


---------63:35----------
make sense like it's bizarre because at


---------63:37----------
one point those probably hurt you but


---------63:39----------
now if someone tries to tell you the


---------63:41----------
opposite it's hurtful it flipped yeah


---------63:45----------
that's exactly cuz I remember I didn't


---------63:49----------
really care that much when they told me


---------63:51----------
the things but somewhere along the way


---------63:54----------
something flipped and I think if you


---------63:55----------
want to get free of all the that's


---------63:57----------
where you have to find you have to find


---------63:58----------
that point it's like I'm gonna just say


---------64:01----------
this again because I think it may be


---------64:03----------
just to clarify and think out loud so


---------64:05----------
like now when someone calls you pretty


---------64:07----------
you're like you you're wrong but


---------64:10----------
there used to be a time where someone


---------64:12----------
called you ugly and you said you


---------64:13----------
you're wrong yeah and so I wouldn't say


---------64:18----------
I wouldn't say that I didn't think that


---------64:20----------
they were wrong I just didn't really


---------64:22----------
care so much so that two strikes me as


---------64:26----------
somewhat like numb right so uh so I I


---------64:31----------
find it hard to believe like you say


---------64:33----------
that you don't care about a lot of stuff


---------64:34----------
that's very surprising to me like you


---------64:38----------
said you didn't care I mean you don't


---------64:39----------
and it's possible you don't care but I


---------64:41----------
think oftentimes not caring is a sign of


---------64:44----------
numbness right like not caring is not


---------64:47----------
feeling and so I think that that too is


---------64:50----------
like a protective mechanism that you


---------64:51----------
numb that part of you you suppress those


---------64:53----------
feelings and then you end up with the


---------64:55----------
words I don't care because if something


---------64:57----------
hurts us one of the best ways we can


---------64:59----------
protect ourselves is to not care yeah


---------65:04----------
but my sense is that every time you say


---------65:07----------
I don't care


---------65:07----------
there's actually a little bit of hurt


---------65:09----------
and that if you want to get free from


---------65:11----------
the body dysmorphia you have to start by


---------65:13----------
like figuring out in what ways that


---------65:16----------
actually did hurt because not caring is


---------65:18----------
the way that you protect yourself right


---------65:20----------
like oh like when my dad was supposed to


---------65:23----------
pick me up on the weekend and we were


---------65:24----------
supposed to go to a baseball game


---------65:25----------
together he didn't show up


---------65:27----------
oh I don't care right hmm when my


---------65:34----------
parents picked me up an hour late and I


---------65:36----------
was the last kid at school every day I


---------65:38----------
didn't care I was fine with that and


---------65:42----------
this is where like it really bizarrely


---------65:43----------
like you know I mean not to you know


---------65:47----------
 things up even more but even the


---------65:49----------
way that you approach your feelings is


---------65:51----------
incredibly masculine how what do you


---------65:55----------
mean because you your standard answer is


---------65:58----------
I don't care well yeah I I I'm admitted


---------66:06----------
that I care now yeah yeah I get that I'm


---------66:10----------
not trying to blame you for saying I


---------66:11----------
don't care I'm I'm pointing out that


---------66:13----------
like somewhere along the way how are you


---------66:16----------
feeling right now am i attacking you no


---------66:18----------
it's fine okay you sure yeah I don't


---------66:22----------
care there it is again so now now Ingrid


---------66:27----------
we're gonna do a little bit of work I


---------66:28----------
want you to tunnel down because I don't


---------66:29----------
think you 100% don't care okay I think


---------66:33----------
something that I'm saying is creating a


---------66:35----------
little bit of negative emotion in you I


---------66:37----------
don't know if you're angry at me I don't


---------66:38----------
know if you're frustrated if you're sad


---------66:39----------
if you think I'm wrong I think there's


---------66:41----------
something there I can see something in


---------66:43----------
your face okay what do you what do you


---------66:48----------
think that could be do you really not


---------66:50----------
care are you are you asking me if I care


---------66:59----------
about how you just said my way of


---------67:02----------
approaching feelings are masculine just


---------67:04----------
all of it well yeah I care I don't


---------67:10----------
really care about what you just said but


---------67:12----------
okay else I care are you four pence on


---------67:17----------
what we're talking about sure very very


---------67:20----------
fair


---------67:21----------
sir as I've been speaking to you have


---------67:25----------
you noticed any kinds of emotions um I


---------67:35----------
can't even like name them I don't yep


---------67:39----------
I don't I guess I have but I I they're


---------67:44----------
not being like super strong yeah yeah so


---------67:47----------
that so Ingrid I think that in that's


---------67:50----------
where you need to go right because I


---------67:54----------
think what's going on is you have


---------67:56----------
actually a lot of stuff you have a very


---------67:58----------
rich internal environment but the


---------68:01----------
problem is that when I listen to your


---------68:03----------
description of your internal environment


---------68:05----------
it's very like it has a couple of


---------68:08----------
different colors one is that Ingrid like


---------68:10----------
looks weird right


---------68:13----------
and then like Angra doesn't care about a


---------68:16----------
lot of things and Ingrid want certain


---------68:17----------
things and then it makes you feel


---------68:19----------
uncomfortable when you put on the dress


---------68:20----------
like what does that mean discomfort is


---------68:24----------
not actually an emotion no so when you


---------68:29----------
put on a dress do you feel ashamed of


---------68:31----------
yourself mm-hmm


---------68:34----------
is that like something that you're kind


---------68:38----------
of like do you know so what else like


---------68:42----------
why do you feel ashamed of yourself when


---------68:44----------
you put on a dress well I feel ashamed


---------68:48----------
yeah well where's one thing is as I said


---------68:55----------
earlier like how dare you young and so


---------69:00----------
what is that emotion it's just like I'm


---------69:05----------
not I can't


---------69:08----------
me I can't wear a dress because I am me


---------69:11----------
and who are you I'm I'm a girl I can't


---------69:18----------
wear feminine stuff I think there's more


---------69:22----------
to it than that the problem is that I


---------69:25----------
don't I can't name it yeah right like


---------69:30----------
there's there's some kind of like


---------69:32----------
loathing there


---------69:36----------
does that word make sense or fit at all


---------69:41----------
I'm not sure with loathing means


---------69:44----------
loathing is almost like hatred okay yeah


---------69:51----------
do you have some degree of like hatred


---------69:54----------
towards yourself well yeah okay this is


---------70:04----------
the way said well like obviously is that


---------70:09----------
is that new for you or like you've


---------70:11----------
always known that all along it's it's


---------70:18----------
not new but it hasn't been there okay


---------70:21----------
when did you start hating yourself


---------70:28----------
probably a high school like second year


---------70:31----------
maybe see it like it's interesting


---------70:33----------
because you can give me specific answers


---------70:35----------
you can say this happened to the third


---------70:37----------
or fourth year this happened in the


---------70:39----------
first year this happened in the second


---------70:40----------
year and so what happened to your second


---------70:43----------
year of high school what happened that


---------70:44----------
you started hating yourself don't know


---------70:50----------
if it's I um I was like in high school I


---------71:00----------
was I was scribed I guess I was kind of


---------71:08----------
arrogant high school absolutely and I


---------71:16----------
knew that wasn't a thing and I didn't


---------71:20----------
like that why were you Merrigan why are


---------71:24----------
people arrogant because I think they're


---------71:28----------
better than others that's why I don't


---------71:30----------
know no no


---------71:32----------
so people that's what arrogance looks


---------71:34----------
like but people are arrogant because


---------71:35----------
they're afraid they're not better than


---------71:37----------
others they're afraid they're not normal


---------71:40----------
right so arrogance actually comes from a


---------71:44----------
lack of self confidence


---------71:47----------
okay I did not move yeah so so generally


---------71:52----------
speaking the way that I view arrogant


---------71:54----------
said I don't know if you've seen me talk


---------71:55----------
about Vedic psychology have you seen me


---------71:57----------
in any of that stuff I probably have so


---------72:00----------
I think you're a very classic case of


---------72:02----------
like Vedic psychology to like understand


---------72:05----------
you so I'll try to give you a very quick


---------72:07----------
primer so we have three parts of our


---------72:09----------
mind five


---------72:11----------
but let's explain three so one is your


---------72:13----------
emotional mind one is your ego and one


---------72:16----------
is your rational mind so your emotional


---------72:19----------
mind experiences emotions and then your


---------72:21----------
ego usually steps in to try to protect


---------72:24----------
you from your emotions so like your ego


---------72:27----------
will do things like oh you know if I


---------72:29----------
fail a test I'm gonna call the teacher a


---------72:33----------
dumbass for writing such a poorly


---------72:35----------
written test does that make sense like


---------72:38----------
I'm not going to just because the idea


---------72:40----------
that oh I actually failed or unstopping


---------72:42----------
is so painful my ego kind of turns on


---------72:45----------
and starts blaming other people now in


---------72:49----------
your case I think that your arrogance


---------72:51----------
like if you were arrogant in high school


---------72:53----------
like that's strange right like I'm just


---------72:55----------
I want I want to just paint you the


---------72:57----------
picture that we have a view Ingrid and


---------72:59----------
maybe I'm assuming but I would imagine


---------73:01----------
to echad has this like you're like shy


---------73:03----------
you're like the sort of like the quiet


---------73:05----------
kid like you don't really have a whole


---------73:07----------
lot of friends you spend you enjoy


---------73:08----------
studying you're kind of a tomboy


---------73:10----------
you're not very feminine you're not


---------73:12----------
flirtatious you're not confident you're


---------73:14----------
kind of the kid that's invisible and


---------73:16----------
it's strange to think of the kid who's


---------73:18----------
invisible is arrogant but the kid who's


---------73:21----------
invisible absolutely is arrogant right


---------73:23----------
because most of twitch at is invisible


---------73:25----------
in school and arrogant all the


---------73:28----------
way the most arrogant they have very


---------73:30----------
very strongly held opinions they're


---------73:32----------
smarter than everyone else they have


---------73:34----------
super high IQs and they're


---------73:36----------
arrogant and they judge other people and


---------73:38----------
they feel left out and they're invisible


---------73:40----------
and people don't invite them to parties


---------73:42----------
and they just get invited to parties


---------73:43----------
because like they're a person who's


---------73:45----------
inviting you is being polite making


---------73:48----------
sense so that arrogance is protective


---------73:53----------
because like the alternative is if


---------73:55----------
you're not arrogant in those situations


---------73:57----------
then you just feel awful because it


---------74:01----------
like I'm a no one no one likes me like


---------74:03----------
you can either be arrogant and and sort


---------74:06----------
of say like oh these people all suck at


---------74:07----------
life I'm smarter than they are or you


---------74:09----------
can say no one really likes me and I


---------74:11----------
don't have any friends


---------74:13----------
so that makes sense it's really mundane


---------74:16----------
read your facial expressions right now


---------74:17----------
oh sorry no no it's okay I mean I'm not


---------74:20----------
blaming you I'm just commenting so I I


---------74:23----------
don't know like if I'm I don't know if


---------74:25----------
I'm you're buying what I'm selling I


---------74:28----------
can't tell but I am because it's


---------74:32----------
illogical it's not yeah but I mean


---------74:37----------
buying what I'm selling is not about


---------74:38----------
logic is it resonating with you it's


---------74:45----------
okay to say not really um a little bit


---------74:49----------
I'm not sure actually you're not sure if


---------74:53----------
it's resonating uh no no you're not sure


---------75:01----------
or I'm not sure if you're not sure okay


---------75:04----------
yeah hmm so that so I don't know if I'm


---------75:09----------
off the mark or whether you're just numb


---------75:11----------
to whether things are resonating it's


---------75:13----------
hard for me to tell but I'd guess that


---------75:15----------
I'm off the mark no it's more like um no


---------75:20----------
more like you're numb yeah yeah


---------75:25----------
so let me just kind of let me take a


---------75:29----------
step back and just think for a second so


---------75:30----------
Ingrid it so first of all I think that


---------75:33----------
you can I don't think so commenting on


---------75:37----------
your appearance I think is like how can


---------75:40----------
I say this


---------75:41----------
so I think you can start to feel better


---------75:43----------
about yourself I absolutely think it's


---------75:45----------
possible and I think it's because this I


---------75:47----------
I don't know I mean maybe you can do


---------75:49----------
some kind of like CVT kind of stuff or


---------75:52----------
something like that there appear tickly


---------75:53----------
and I have one or two suggestions for


---------75:56----------
you from from a very practical


---------75:58----------
standpoint about how the process of your


---------76:01----------
mind works and how thoughts function in


---------76:02----------
your mind but the first thing is that if


---------76:04----------
you want to not feel this way and you


---------76:06----------
want to feel comfortable wearing a dress


---------76:08----------
you've got a couple of options one is to


---------76:11----------
do exactly what you did today which is


---------76:12----------
that today you want it to be invisible


---------76:15----------
your concern that you are


---------76:16----------
disproportionate when you came on stream


---------76:18----------
and you showed your face and somehow you


---------76:22----------
were able to like take those feelings


---------76:24----------
that you have and essentially say it


---------76:26----------
doesn't matter


---------76:28----------
so like the question is when you're with


---------76:30----------
your boyfriend can you come to a place


---------76:33----------
of peace and kind of accept that it


---------76:35----------
doesn't matter whether he finds you


---------76:36----------
attractive or not are you okay with that


---------76:41----------
no not yet no right so so this is this


---------76:49----------
is the kind this is one solution is that


---------76:51----------
you can you can start to learn


---------76:53----------
detachment and like to not let your


---------76:55----------
feelings dictate how you behave what do


---------77:02----------
you feel well I feel like you're


---------77:03----------
shutting down kind of M yeah what's that


---------77:08----------
I don't know let's talk about that this


---------77:11----------
is exactly what we're talking about I've


---------77:15----------
been losing you for a little while now


---------77:18----------
right yeah I don't know how to put it


---------77:27----------
into words I guess it's uh I I'm just I


---------77:38----------
don't know it's


---------77:45----------
I'm listening to you and sure what


---------77:49----------
you're saying is true but okay what


---------77:55----------
about it


---------77:56----------
so what it what is that Ingrid I think


---------78:00----------
this is very important


---------78:02----------
and we have to understand what what is


---------78:05----------
what is the but I I don't know it


---------78:16----------
doesn't do anything it's okay it's like


---------78:23----------
okay now I know this cool I know this


---------78:29----------
yeah so what I'm curious about is like


---------78:33----------
when did that change when it when I


---------78:35----------
started explaining things maybe yeah I


---------78:43----------
think so I don't know why because it's


---------78:49----------
not like I'm not I'm not


---------78:50----------
it's not like I'm disagreeing with what


---------78:52----------
you're saying I get that you're not


---------78:53----------
disagreeing I just don't think you're


---------78:55----------
buying what I'm selling which is fine


---------78:58----------
I'm not I think we need to understand


---------79:00----------
why that is so what am I missing Ingrid


---------79:03----------
what is it that I don't know like here's


---------79:07----------
what I'm sensing from you now you can


---------79:09----------
say whatever you want it's completely


---------79:10----------
logical but it doesn't apply to me


---------79:12----------
because what what do you mean like like


---------79:20----------
I'm envisioning in your mind the the the


---------79:23----------
body language and facial expressions


---------79:25----------
that you're sending my way tell me in my


---------79:29----------
in my mind I'm imagining the thought in


---------79:32----------
your mind is all this is fantastic but


---------79:35----------
it doesn't apply to me because something


---------79:38----------
well yeah because


---------79:44----------
I'm not really allowing myself to have a


---------79:52----------
problem I guess I'm not really it feels


---------80:04----------
like you are describing someone with


---------80:06----------
body dysmorphia that it doesn't apply to


---------80:08----------
me


---------80:08----------
yep and like that's making me doubt like


---------80:11----------
do I have bought a dysmorphia but why


---------80:15----------
doesn't that apply to you what's


---------80:16----------
different about the people that I'm


---------80:17----------
talking about the person that you are I


---------80:31----------
wish I could answer better I don't um


---------80:38----------
take take your time


---------80:41----------
[Music]


---------80:47----------
like I'm just me and I'm me and garden


---------80:53----------
stuff that's going to be absolutely why


---------80:56----------
not what's different about you what's


---------81:00----------
special about you tell me about how


---------81:05----------
you're different from other people I


---------81:08----------
wouldn't say I'm different I would sound


---------81:11----------
very average no I don't think so oh


---------81:17----------
because you're saying that what I'm


---------81:19----------
saying applies to other people but


---------81:20----------
doesn't apply to use there's got to be


---------81:22----------
something different about you see this


---------81:23----------
is what your mind does it jumps in and


---------81:26----------
logically discounts whatever you're


---------81:28----------
feeling like how are you feeling you're


---------81:31----------
different because you're just telling me


---------81:32----------
that like you're you just told me that


---------81:34----------
everything I'm saying applies to people


---------81:36----------
with body dysmorphia but it doesn't


---------81:38----------
apply to you and then when I asked you


---------81:39----------
in what way are you different you say


---------81:40----------
I'm just average fine but like what how


---------81:43----------
are you different why does why does


---------81:48----------
everything that I have to say not help


---------81:50----------
you at all


---------82:02----------
I feel like you're expecting me to have


---------82:03----------
some answer and I'll explain it but I


---------82:08----------
don't I just don't feel like it applies


---------82:12----------
to me because


---------82:14----------
[Music]


---------82:23----------
I guess maybe because I'm never really


---------82:29----------
maybe it's because I've never been like


---------82:31----------
a part of like I've never been a part of


---------82:36----------
the girls and I've never been a part


---------82:39----------
with the guys so like if I have a


---------82:42----------
problem with not fitting in then that's


---------82:49----------
just like normal I don't know let me try


---------82:55----------
to put your dude good Ingrid you're


---------82:57----------
doing good you feeling frustrated yes


---------83:00----------
okay good so I think you're doing


---------83:04----------
fantastic I'm letting you flounder by


---------83:06----------
the way because a lot of the a lot of


---------83:09----------
times when you said that you you haven't


---------83:11----------
had words I don't know if you notice but


---------83:12----------
I jump in and I offer you explanations


---------83:14----------
but I don't think that's actually


---------83:15----------
helping us so I think you've got to


---------83:17----------
learn how to flounder and I know it


---------83:19----------
makes you feel uncomfortable and now I'm


---------83:21----------
gonna reflect back what I heard from you


---------83:23----------
what I can say sounds wonderful and


---------83:26----------
logical but it applies to normal people


---------83:28----------
it applies to people who have body


---------83:30----------
dysmorphia and or women or body


---------83:32----------
dysmorphia and or men but like I'm an


---------83:35----------
outsider


---------83:36----------
everything that you say applies to the


---------83:38----------
insiders and I'm an outsider what do you


---------83:42----------
think about that is that fair I'd mean


---------83:46----------
fair like is that act like a fair


---------83:48----------
representation of how you feel yeah I


---------83:53----------
think so so would it be fair to say that


---------83:58----------
like I just can't really help you or


---------84:01----------
understand because I've worked with a


---------84:04----------
bunch of people who are insiders or I


---------84:06----------
myself in an insider and I just won't be


---------84:09----------
able to understand you so can you repeat


---------84:13----------
that


---------84:13----------
yeah like would it be fair to say that


---------84:15----------
and I notice it's gonna sound weird so I


---------84:16----------
really want you to think before you


---------84:18----------
answer okay that like I'm not going to


---------84:20----------
be able to help you because I'm just not


---------84:21----------
going to be able to understand you


---------84:23----------
because you're just an outsider


---------84:30----------
it's


---------84:39----------
I mean I first of all I think like


---------84:43----------
unless you had a unless you've had body


---------84:48----------
dysmorphia you never truly understand I


---------84:50----------
completely agree everything but that


---------84:52----------
goes without saying I guess I'm gonna


---------84:57----------
but um I completely lost maternal


---------85:04----------
that's okay


---------85:05----------
ah I think you've been working hard


---------85:07----------
cognitively for the last hour or more


---------85:11----------
yeah and how do you feel about just sort


---------85:19----------
of I know it's gonna be kind of


---------85:20----------
unsatisfying but how do you feel about


---------85:22----------
kind of winding down sure okay if if you


---------85:30----------
if you don't have anything more to add


---------85:32----------
then I guess it's no point


---------85:48----------
I can try to share some closing thoughts


---------85:50----------
I just don't think that we're gonna


---------85:52----------
crack this today because that's what


---------85:55----------
body dysmorphia is like so here's Ingrid


---------85:58----------
here's what I would suggest to you if


---------86:00----------
you're interested in suggestions the


---------86:02----------
first is that like I think you've got to


---------86:05----------
go back to high school and try to really


---------86:06----------
figure out why if there were things that


---------86:09----------
you felt which you weren't aware of yeah


---------86:13----------
and and i think that something about


---------86:16----------
that is because i think it comes down to


---------86:19----------
this idea of like one thing swept right


---------86:22----------
when did when did other people when did


---------86:25----------
you have a view of yourself that was not


---------86:26----------
ugly let's not focus on pretty for a


---------86:28----------
second but just there was a time at


---------86:31----------
which you didn't really think about


---------86:33----------
ugliness versus prettiness right and


---------86:35----------
then there was a time where you started


---------86:37----------
believing that you were ugly or


---------86:38----------
disproportionate right hmm and so I


---------86:41----------
think if you want to be free of this


---------86:43----------
thing which I think it's possible and I


---------86:45----------
know you


---------86:46----------
I imagine you disagree then you have to


---------86:51----------
go back to like that point and try to


---------86:53----------
explore where the flip happened because


---------86:58----------
now you are sure like you kind of talked


---------87:00----------
about when you say I talk about people


---------87:02----------
with body dysmorphia you don't even


---------87:03----------
think you have body dysmorphia right


---------87:09----------
it goes up yeah officials have told me


---------87:14----------
and when I feel like even is it like


---------87:18----------
I've had a good day today


---------87:19----------
I haven't been fun at all today good so


---------87:28----------
this has been a good day but when I have


---------87:32----------
those bad days which is a lot I


---------87:38----------
definitely think I have it but it's like


---------87:42----------
I definitely think I have it then but


---------87:45----------
it's I'm still kind of not allowing


---------87:49----------
myself to have it so that also like is


---------87:53----------
that something you were aware of like


---------87:56----------
they're not allowing yourself to have it


---------88:00----------
I a little bit okay because I think


---------88:06----------
that's huge - because I think this comes


---------88:08----------
back to judgement and allowing yourself


---------88:10----------
to feel certain ways which also kind of


---------88:13----------
goes back to high school but I think


---------88:14----------
that this is really really important


---------88:16----------
that you you know you're not willing to


---------88:20----------
cut yourself a break does that make


---------88:23----------
sense like you're not willing to say


---------88:25----------
like this is not okay because there's a


---------88:27----------
part of you that doesn't believe that


---------88:29----------
this is an illness there's a part of you


---------88:30----------
just that just believes that the rest of


---------88:32----------
the world is wrong they just don't


---------88:34----------
understand right like it's not yet


---------88:39----------
anyone sick here it's just that they


---------88:41----------
just can't use their eyes yeah


---------88:46----------
right and and that's how you feel right


---------88:50----------
it's like like well even when I say oh


---------88:53----------
you can be free of this one day there's


---------88:55----------
a part of you that I think rebels


---------88:56----------
against that and says this guy doesn't


---------89:00----------
if I the second I say that I've lost you


---------89:02----------
because you're like there's no way to be


---------89:04----------
free of this because it's fact it's like


---------89:05----------
how can you be free of gravity you can't


---------89:07----------
ever be free of gravity and start flying


---------89:09----------
there's no there's no universe in which


---------89:11----------
I'm gonna wake up one day and I'm not


---------89:13----------
gonna feel this way about myself because


---------89:14----------
this is true hmm and that's the not


---------89:19----------
allowing and it's very very dangerous


---------89:23----------
and I think this kind of comes back to


---------89:25----------
comfort and discomfort because if you


---------89:27----------
don't allow yourself to be better then


---------89:31----------
you don't ever have to face the dress


---------89:36----------
yeah and so I think the real challenge


---------89:39----------
here is like like because when you when


---------89:42----------
you when you when you accept that you're


---------89:45----------
ugly and you're not feminine sure it


---------89:47----------
hurts but like you can deal with that


---------89:51----------
the possibility that you could be


---------89:53----------
beautiful and if you put on a dress and


---------89:56----------
you put on makeup and and did your hair


---------89:58----------
or whatever like whatever feminine ideal


---------90:01----------
of beauty that you have the possibility


---------90:03----------
that you're actually beautiful like what


---------90:04----------
do you think about that does that


---------90:05----------
thought scare you


---------90:13----------
not really I feel like I feel like what


---------90:17----------
you're thinking right now is like I


---------90:18----------
would I would just be happy if I was


---------90:20----------
just content with being ugly but if I


---------90:26----------
could feel beautiful then yeah that


---------90:28----------
would be great I don't think that I


---------90:30----------
don't think you would be content I mean


---------90:31----------
you can learn to be content being ugly


---------90:33----------
that's one path but I I think that


---------90:35----------
there's a part of you that's not


---------90:37----------
allowing yourself to be beautiful


---------90:40----------
because something about that is like


---------90:42----------
frightening to you and like well it's


---------90:45----------
it's frightening in the sense that I um


---------90:47----------
I have worn a dress like in public and


---------90:53----------
recently but like last year and that was


---------90:57----------
scary what's scary about it I feel out


---------91:05----------
of place


---------91:06----------
it's uh no one said anything negative no


---------91:14----------
one really said anything about it at all


---------91:15----------
except my boyfriend you almost became


---------91:25----------
invisible yeah yeah so Ingrid I I think


---------91:31----------
it's gonna be hard like I think you have


---------91:33----------
to allow yourself the possibility of


---------91:37----------
being pretty but I don't think you want


---------91:43----------
to do that right


---------91:47----------
like I think there are two pieces one is


---------91:50----------
that you there's a part of you that


---------91:51----------
thinks that it's impossible to be pretty


---------91:53----------
and I think there's another part of you


---------91:56----------
that doesn't allow yourself to try to be


---------92:00----------
pretty I've tried to feel pretty but it


---------92:10----------
hasn't worked and if I go on I just feel


---------92:18----------
so anxious yeah so very practically have


---------92:24----------
you done exposure therapy before No


---------92:27----------
so very practically you may want to try


---------92:29----------
that right so like just because you go


---------92:32----------
out and you don't feel pretty like what


---------92:34----------
happens the next day like could you wear


---------92:39----------
a dress like what would happen if you I


---------92:40----------
mean I think you should consider seeing


---------92:42----------
a therapist because I think this is in I


---------92:44----------
mean this is tough so having worked with


---------92:47----------
people with body dysmorphia I can tell


---------92:49----------
you that it's probably the most


---------92:52----------
challenging patient population I've ever


---------92:55----------
worked with


---------92:56----------
okay why is it because I think in their


---------93:03----------
minds things are not flexible like it's


---------93:08----------
not it's not an issue of like there's no


---------93:11----------
exploration it's just facts so I was I


---------93:17----------
worked with some like body builders and


---------93:19----------
boy that's just really hard yeah they


---------93:23----------
are they're the most in-shape people


---------93:26----------
they look artificial like they don't


---------93:29----------
even look like real humans and yet it's


---------93:31----------
not good enough and it takes a long long


---------93:35----------
time to figure out like where to date


---------93:38----------
like so in Ingrid which you've got to


---------93:39----------
figure out it's like I'm not disputing


---------93:41----------
the fact that you're ugly I'm not


---------93:43----------
disputing that because that doesn't do


---------93:44----------
you any good


---------93:45----------
my question is when did that start when


---------93:48----------
did you learn because what you've really


---------93:50----------
got to do is go back to the point where


---------93:52----------
like you when you say you didn't care


---------93:55----------
like there was like sure you like the


---------93:57----------
reason you didn't care is because it


---------93:58----------
hurt you to hear that


---------94:01----------
right so I want you to translate I don't


---------94:03----------
care into I'm suppressing this emotion


---------94:06----------
and it's numbing me like there's no


---------94:09----------
 way that you can tell a


---------94:10----------
thirteen-year-old that they're ugly or


---------94:12----------
make fun of them or like call them not


---------94:14----------
feminine and that they don't care so


---------94:17----------
that make sense yeah like it hurts them


---------94:19----------
hmm


---------94:20----------
but you're not aware of that hurt and so


---------94:24----------
this thing this body dysmorphia has been


---------94:26----------
growing within you for a long time and


---------94:29----------
you only noticed it when it became very


---------94:31----------
very severe but it started a long time


---------94:33----------
ago and what I can tell you is that if


---------94:37----------
you can understand like if you can go


---------94:38----------
back to an Ingrid who did actually feel


---------94:42----------
not even pretty but like could just


---------94:44----------
completely neutral about her appearance


---------94:46----------
didn't care


---------94:47----------
didn't think about other people when she


---------94:48----------
went on in public with a dress because


---------94:50----------
that part of you exists right like you


---------94:52----------
did that one day and try to figure out


---------94:56----------
like how did you like when you were 9


---------94:58----------
years old like did you wear dresses and


---------95:00----------
go outside no when I was 9 when I was


---------95:06----------
younger because my mom picked my clothes


---------95:08----------
so right so like this may go even


---------95:11----------
further back than high school so part of


---------95:13----------
the reason that we may not find the


---------95:14----------
answer there is like when did use when


---------95:16----------
did you start to like really give up


---------95:17----------
your femininity and this when you say


---------95:27----------
like that I think like it was very early


---------95:29----------
but when I did it it it when I did it it


---------95:40----------
didn't really matter because like it was


---------95:44----------
a mix of like I it's fine and also it's


---------95:49----------
a bit cool to be a tomboy fine yeah so


---------95:52----------
so I I don't know that like so my point


---------95:55----------
is that I think you got a lore of this


---------95:57----------
stuff and if you're willing to see a


---------95:58----------
therapist again I think the main thing


---------96:00----------
to look for is to try to find like you


---------96:04----------
know all these times when you say you


---------96:05----------
didn't care because someone said


---------96:07----------
something to you I think it was actually


---------96:08----------
hurtful


---------96:09----------
and then at some point they didn't need


---------96:10----------
to say it to you and the reason it hurts


---------96:13----------
is because like


---------96:15----------
you didn't believe that about yourself


---------96:17----------
mm-hmm


---------96:18----------
and once you started believing yourself


---------96:20----------
about yourself then it no longer hurts


---------96:22----------
when people call you I go right like


---------96:24----------
even when you say you just wish your


---------96:26----------
boyfriend would call you ugly and get it


---------96:27----------
over with yeah I tell him that right so


---------96:32----------
at some point like my point is that


---------96:34----------
there was one point in your life where


---------96:35----------
you when someone insulted your


---------96:37----------
appearance and you said I don't care but


---------96:39----------
you did care you were just suppressing


---------96:41----------
the hurt and then at some point that


---------96:43----------
changed and it was no longer like but in


---------96:45----------
order for you to be hurt by someone


---------96:46----------
calling you ugly you have to have a


---------96:48----------
belief about yourself that you're not


---------96:49----------
going with me


---------96:51----------
hmm and then at some point that belief


---------96:54----------
about yourself changed and you have to


---------96:57----------
undo whatever that damages yeah and I


---------97:00----------
think that's something that you probably


---------97:02----------
need to work with someone like a


---------97:04----------
therapist but in a targeted fashion


---------97:07----------
where you need to steer them instead of


---------97:10----------
listening to all their about


---------97:11----------
body dysmorphia that's I did try and do


---------97:18----------
because I've been talking to a therapist


---------97:21----------
but I stopped because I didn't want to


---------97:24----------
she was terrible and I did try to go to


---------97:30----------
like an up an organization for students


---------97:34----------
that offers very cheap therapy sessions


---------97:38----------
and I waited there and I waited there


---------97:41----------
for like 40 minutes he called me in he


---------97:46----------
asked me like what what do you what's up


---------97:48----------
and I explained it to him and five


---------97:53----------
minutes later he just said not we can't


---------97:57----------
help you and he said no way so I I don't


---------98:02----------
know where to go okay well I mean we


---------98:06----------
don't offer therapy but our recovery


---------98:08----------
coach program is about to launch in a


---------98:10----------
week or two and if you're interested you


---------98:11----------
can try to work with one of our coaches


---------98:13----------
I wonder if they'll be able to help you


---------98:15----------
I mean I don't think they'll be able to


---------98:17----------
help you with their body dysmorphia but


---------98:18----------
I wonder if they'll be able to help you


---------98:20----------
in some other ways like in terms of


---------98:21----------
understanding the way your mind works


---------98:23----------
and things like that but I would also


---------98:26----------
give therapy another shot


---------98:28----------
it sounds really really awful I don't


---------98:30----------
know why someone would say after five


---------98:31----------
minutes we can't help you like I don't


---------98:33----------
know what did you tell that I I told


---------98:38----------
them that I hope body dysmorphia and I


---------98:43----------
spend a lot of time worrying about my


---------98:48----------
parents and it's exhausting


---------98:51----------
and I don't know what to do and the


---------98:56----------
thing is like I think he was very busy


---------99:00----------
real in a hurry so it like it almost


---------99:02----------
felt like he just wanted to like as


---------99:05----------
quickly as possible just like getting


---------99:07----------
out that's awful


---------99:10----------
yeah because he he he was 40 minutes


---------99:14----------
late when I got there I explained he


---------99:18----------
just he just he didn't do anything he


---------99:21----------
just he looked so he was just waiting


---------99:26----------
for me to leave and when I was finished


---------99:29----------
I was like ya know that we don't do that


---------99:31----------
Ingrid knew something yep how did that


---------99:33----------
make you feel


---------99:34----------
I was shocked cuz like even though I


---------99:40----------
haven't been happy with the therapist


---------99:42----------
earlier they have never just dismiss me


---------99:44----------
like that how does it feel to be


---------99:46----------
dismissed it feels like what I'm


---------99:51----------
thinking it's not valid at all so I


---------99:58----------
called my boyfriend and told him and he


---------100:01----------
gave them an angry call and yeah I was


---------100:07----------
thinking how does it feel to have your


---------100:11----------
thoughts and your feelings not be taken


---------100:13----------
seriously you're suffering to not be


---------100:17----------
taken seriously it's


---------100:23----------
it's kind of demoralizing like


---------100:26----------
absolutely I'm really in a weird way


---------100:30----------
Ingrid I'm really happy to hear you say


---------100:32----------
that because the answer can you guess


---------100:34----------
what answer I was afraid of I don't care


---------100:38----------
it's beautiful


---------100:40----------
so I think that's a step in the right


---------100:42----------
direction to be completely honest I


---------100:45----------
think to be rejected and to recognize


---------100:48----------
that you were hurt by rejection is


---------100:49----------
actually like really really important


---------100:51----------
cuz I think the point here is that like


---------100:53----------
you started to develop a view about


---------100:55----------
yourself because just think about this


---------100:56----------
for a second you got rejected time and


---------100:58----------
time and time again in all manner of


---------101:00----------
tiny tiny ways about your appearance


---------101:03----------
about your femininity about not being


---------101:05----------
invited to birthday parties parties and


---------101:07----------
each of those points something started


---------101:09----------
to grow within you it was like this evil


---------101:12----------
evil seed of body dysmorphia and since


---------101:15----------
you were so good at ignoring it all the


---------101:17----------
time it just continued to grow and grow


---------101:20----------
and grow and grow and grow until at this


---------101:22----------
point can't ignore it anymore it's


---------101:25----------
gigantic


---------101:26----------
it's blocking out all of your windows


---------101:28----------
and you can't get out of your house


---------101:30----------
because it's there it's all around you


---------101:32----------
and it feels so real to you because this


---------101:34----------
 is it's like it's in every part


---------101:37----------
of your mind and you have good days and


---------101:39----------
you have bad days and the good days you


---------101:41----------
forget but the tree is still there it's


---------101:44----------
like just because I choose not to look


---------101:45----------
out the window and I don't see the tree


---------101:46----------
doesn't mean the tree has gone away but


---------101:51----------
I do think that there's hope for you I


---------101:52----------
think it just involves going back to


---------101:54----------
like understanding each time that you


---------101:57----------
you know felt those little injuries and


---------102:00----------
you let that tree grow going back and


---------102:03----------
undoing that a little bit can I can I


---------102:07----------
hear your opinion on something else I


---------102:09----------
don't know if it relates to this go for


---------102:12----------
it


---------102:12----------
but I was I served in the Navy uh-huh


---------102:15----------
and during that time it was like first I


---------102:21----------
went to boot camp and so obviously like


---------102:24----------
we got up at 5:00 worked so hard all day


---------102:28----------
done at 8 p.m. mm-hm


---------102:31----------
so like what I experienced there


---------102:35----------
[Music]


---------102:38----------
what I experienced there was I during


---------102:43----------
the day when we were like things were


---------102:46----------
constantly happening there was no brakes


---------102:48----------
I did not think about any of this hmm


---------102:56----------
and I didn't feel numb but I don't feel


---------103:00----------
like I changed how I interact sure


---------103:05----------
beautiful so but once like we we were


---------103:10----------
done for the day and we got to do


---------103:12----------
whatever we want I just broke down just


---------103:17----------
cried in the bathroom and in the bed


---------103:20----------
avoided people and I don't know why yeah


---------103:25----------
it's uh yeah so what do you remember


---------103:31----------
what yeah I can see you even getting


---------103:32----------
emotional thinking about it yeah I


---------103:38----------
started having panic attacks like pretty


---------103:41----------
frequently during that time hmm do you


---------103:47----------
still have panic attacks not really um


---------103:52----------
not lately


---------103:55----------
okay so Ingrid I think that makes a lot


---------104:00----------
of sense to me but I think it's maybe


---------104:05----------
hard to explain so in the past on stream


---------104:12----------
I've talked about this principle of


---------104:14----------
whack-a-mole with mental health issues


---------104:16----------
so I'm gonna have to explain a little


---------104:18----------
bit of context is that okay mm-hmm so in


---------104:21----------
my work with people with borderline


---------104:23----------
personality disorders so this is a


---------104:25----------
particular condition where people don't


---------104:27----------
have a clear sense of their internal


---------104:29----------
sense of self they don't know who they


---------104:32----------
are on the inside and so what happens is


---------104:35----------
the way that they feel about themselves


---------104:37----------
is the way that they're treated so if


---------104:40----------
I'm empty on the inside when I look on


---------104:42----------
the outside the way that other people


---------104:43----------
treat me determines Who I am as a person


---------104:45----------
does that make sense with me so people


---------104:49----------
with BPD tend to


---------104:50----------
have three behaviors sometimes that all


---------104:53----------
kind of it's hard because they'll


---------104:56----------
they'll have drug problems so they'll


---------105:00----------
drink alcohol or use drugs they'll do


---------105:03----------
self injurious behavior like cutting so


---------105:06----------
they'll cut themselves or burn


---------105:07----------
themselves with cigarettes or things


---------105:08----------
like that


---------105:09----------
or they'll have very restricted eating


---------105:13----------
behaviors so they'll you know they'll be


---------105:17----------
had that's it by the way okay so we're


---------105:22----------
gonna get to that okay so why what


---------105:25----------
happens with BPD is that anytime you try


---------105:27----------
to treat one of these problems the other


---------105:29----------
ones get worse so when they go to like


---------105:33----------
when they get into eating disorder


---------105:34----------
treatment their drug use and their


---------105:36----------
cutting gets worse if you hospitalized


---------105:39----------
them where they can't cut and you take


---------105:41----------
away all their razor blades and they


---------105:43----------
don't have access to drugs they stop


---------105:45----------
eating their food in the hospital so


---------105:48----------
it's almost like anything that you fix


---------105:51----------
makes the other ones worse so the ways


---------105:54----------
and I want huh it's Lakmal so I think


---------105:57----------
what's going on with you Ingrid is oddly


---------105:59----------
enough it doesn't surprise me that you


---------106:01----------
have restrictive eating and other that


---------106:05----------
does Navy experience because I think


---------106:06----------
your mind has a particular way of like


---------106:10----------
processing and managing your emotions


---------106:12----------
and what it does is it beats the


---------106:15----------
out of you that's what it does so you


---------106:18----------
have some like thoughts and feelings


---------106:20----------
which like the only way that you know


---------106:22----------
and I want you to think about this for a


---------106:23----------
second


---------106:24----------
when you take pictures of yourself you


---------106:27----------
are feeding the Beast right like even


---------106:30----------
though you feel terrible about yourself


---------106:32----------
there's something incredibly satisfying


---------106:33----------
about feeding that hunger you're sitting


---------106:36----------
there and you're watching TV and then


---------106:38----------
you get hungry and then you start to


---------106:40----------
snack you pull out your phone and you


---------106:41----------
take a picture of yourself and then it's


---------106:43----------
like ooh that was a delicious chip let


---------106:45----------
me take another one and then another


---------106:47----------
chip and another chip and another chip


---------106:48----------
and another chip and even though you


---------106:50----------
feel on the surface on some degree


---------106:52----------
terrible about yourself there's


---------106:54----------
something that feels very satisfying


---------106:55----------
about it right and then what happens is


---------107:00----------
you go to boot camp and then


---------107:03----------
what don't you have


---------107:04----------
time to do it boot camp is feed this


---------107:06----------
beast and then you've got these emotions


---------107:09----------
that are like piled up inside that don't


---------107:10----------
know what the to do because they're


---------107:12----------
like hey Ingrid we had a deal we were


---------107:15----------
gonna beat ourselves up for hours and


---------107:16----------
hours and hours a day and look in the


---------107:18----------
mirror so that we can feel these things


---------107:19----------
and now you're taking that away from us


---------107:21----------
and then stuff comes flooding back and I


---------107:26----------
wouldn't be surprised if your eating


---------107:28----------
behaviors were bad when some other this


---------107:31----------
 was good well yeah yeah so I mean


---------107:44----------
like going forward I think this still


---------107:46----------
goes back to this like Ingrid do you get


---------107:48----------
that like when you were in the Navy like


---------107:50----------
you didn't have the place to feel those


---------107:52----------
feelings so they came out it all goes


---------107:55----------
back to like not really understanding


---------107:56----------
what you feel you've got all the


---------107:58----------
that's going on inside you like you know


---------108:01----------
you have all of these like it's just


---------108:04----------
stuff that's going on inside you have no


---------108:06----------
way of dealing with it so you've got to


---------108:10----------
find someplace to start digging into


---------108:12----------
that and understanding how you feel


---------108:14----------
you're incredibly Alexa thymic if you've


---------108:16----------
heard me talk about that before well


---------108:19----------
inability to tell what your internal


---------108:21----------
emotional status okay right and like


---------108:25----------
half of them huh that doesn't sound good


---------108:27----------
I mean it's it's a protective mechanism


---------108:30----------
and video games makeup turn do that to


---------108:33----------
us too so they're like when you you know


---------108:35----------
like so let me ask you this when you


---------108:37----------
play a video game how do you feel I I


---------108:43----------
don't exactly I just play and have it's


---------108:49----------
fun exactly right so like like you you


---------108:54----------
have your video games are a way to get


---------108:56----------
away from that hungry beast right yeah


---------109:01----------
yeah so I mean like that's why we played


---------109:04----------
so I think you're like I think you've


---------109:05----------
got to start by understanding what your


---------109:07----------
feelings are and you got to start by


---------109:10----------
understanding that it's not true it's


---------109:12----------
just that truth comes from like all of


---------109:14----------
this pile of you know little like how


---------109:17----------
does someone


---------109:17----------
something to be true right they have


---------109:20----------
experiences over and over and over and


---------109:22----------
over again until one day you walk


---------109:24----------
outside and you know how gravity works


---------109:27----------
hmm so in your case you had a thousand


---------109:30----------
or 10,000 experiences telling you that


---------109:32----------
you're an ugly person does that make


---------109:35----------
sense like you don't just wake up one


---------109:36----------
day and believe that you're ugly that's


---------109:38----------
not how it happens no so you were taught


---------109:41----------
to believe that about yourself in some


---------109:43----------
way maybe you taught it to yourself and


---------109:45----------
if you want to be different if you want


---------109:47----------
to be able to wear a dress again you've


---------109:49----------
got to like go back and and undo some of


---------109:51----------
that stuff but it's it's it's weird cuz


---------109:55----------
I don't know how long are you talking


---------109:59----------
about yeah I don't know either


---------110:00----------
I've been hour and a half I've had


---------110:05----------
comments said to me quite a lot in high


---------110:10----------
school but like as I said I felt like I


---------110:18----------
didn't care I probably did care but


---------110:19----------
abside felt like I didn't care so we're


---------110:23----------
looking for so sometimes on stream it's


---------110:26----------
like one thing right one moment in your


---------110:29----------
case I don't think that you are aware


---------110:32----------
they still could be one moment but each


---------110:35----------
one of those things is like a little


---------110:37----------
like strengthens that beast within you


---------110:40----------
gives you the idea that Ingrid is like


---------110:43----------
Ingrid is an ugly person hmm I think


---------110:48----------
it's gonna take time I mean it's not


---------110:50----------
like a one one stream kind of thing you


---------110:53----------
know it's like you got to really dig


---------110:55----------
into this and you're welcome to join our


---------110:57----------
programs and stuff we try to teach


---------110:59----------
people out of meditate and things like


---------111:00----------
that it's complimentary to therapy if


---------111:03----------
you decide to engage with a therapist I


---------111:05----------
would give it another shot I'm sorry


---------111:06----------
you've had bad experiences unfortunately


---------111:08----------
that's what we what I hear over and over


---------111:10----------
and over again


---------111:10----------
is that mental health resources suck ass


---------111:13----------
I'm sorry about that yeah yeah I can't


---------111:18----------
really afford a private one either so it


---------111:23----------
would be someone the doctor it would be


---------111:28----------
someone like the doctor set me up with


---------111:29----------
like one


---------111:31----------
by the government sure what country


---------111:33----------
you're on it Norway okay so it's free


---------111:37----------
here but in my experience they're not


---------111:41----------
good yeah I'm sorry about that so I mean


---------111:48----------
we have I mean hopefully we'll be able


---------111:50----------
to help you out a little bit but anyway


---------111:53----------
I mean coaching isn't therapy but you


---------111:55----------
know we can try to teach you some things


---------111:56----------
like meditation and stuff like that but


---------111:58----------
by the way do you want to meditate today


---------112:03----------
sure you can try I don't believe in it


---------112:08----------
but I can try what do you believe it I


---------112:14----------
don't even mean well first of all like


---------112:19----------
it's not really like the way you do the


---------112:21----------
meditation thing but like we've had a


---------112:24----------
lot of meditation gym class for some


---------112:27----------
reason okay and I hate it


---------112:30----------
what do you I can't sit still I can't I


---------112:33----------
feel like a physical feeling tingling in


---------112:35----------
my whole body that's not good


---------112:37----------
it can't sit still I was excused from


---------112:42----------
doing it in the end because like I it


---------112:43----------
hurt it's not great I don't know what's


---------112:46----------
up with that


---------112:47----------
yeah buddy that's all suppressed emotion


---------112:50----------
my friend


---------112:50----------
oh okay so I want you to understand when


---------112:54----------
you meditate so I want you to think


---------112:57----------
about what are you feeling


---------112:58----------
Ingrid you know what are you feeling


---------113:00----------
right now yeah I can't put it into words


---------113:08----------
okay Oh Ingrid okay


---------113:13----------
sorry no no problem it's I mean it's


---------113:16----------
just what are we gonna do with you we're


---------113:19----------
gonna have to do something I'm just


---------113:20----------
trying to figure out how I'm trying to


---------113:21----------
think about how to help you and I don't


---------113:23----------
think and I had something else yes I


---------113:25----------
thought about when you explained you'll


---------113:26----------
see so when I take the pictures I


---------113:31----------
sometimes post the nice one on Instagram


---------113:34----------
I have a few followers in this room and


---------113:38----------
I shouldn't do it but I do it cuz


---------113:43----------
and when I do not I get a lot of


---------113:45----------
positive response but I don't even


---------113:50----------
believe that yep so I don't know why I


---------113:53----------
do why do I do it


---------113:58----------
like my whole Instagram page with


---------114:00----------
pictures or like me or what I'm wearing


---------114:03----------
what I'm doing it like it doesn't feel


---------114:04----------
like me it doesn't look like me why do


---------114:10----------
you do it I don't know I've thought


---------114:13----------
about quitting quitting so many times


---------114:14----------
but but you can't yeah I always come


---------114:18----------
back to it I've got an answer for you I


---------114:22----------
don't know if it's if you're able to


---------114:24----------
hear it or not because I think Ingrid


---------114:26----------
you know like there's a war going on in


---------114:29----------
you one in which you know you're an ugly


---------114:32----------
person and wonder which you may not be


---------114:34----------
an ugly person right and and you want


---------114:39----------
people you're the part of you that knows


---------114:42----------
that you're not an ugly person is


---------114:43----------
looking for looking for ammo to continue


---------114:48----------
fighting yeah but it's hard


---------114:56----------
yeah what do you think when people will


---------115:01----------
head us in every night how does your


---------115:03----------
mind react when you post something


---------115:04----------
why do you post things on Instagram let


---------115:06----------
me just ask you what are you looking


---------115:07----------
like it's hunger right like it's hunger


---------115:09----------
you feel hungry when you post things on


---------115:11----------
Instagram I feel hungry and then I feel


---------115:21----------
ashamed because I I don't I don't really


---------115:27----------
want to post those pictures cuz I don't


---------115:28----------
I'm I'm not gonna say I don't care but


---------115:33----------
like I feel like I don't I don't care


---------115:36----------
about posting stuff about myself there


---------115:38----------
it is so very good I want you to really


---------115:40----------
pay attention to your words right I feel


---------115:42----------
like I don't care like you don't want to


---------115:47----------
care but you do care yeah this is thing


---------115:52----------
you've always cared Ingrid even in high


---------115:57----------
school you've always cared


---------116:00----------
you just didn't watch it and you were


---------116:02----------
better at deluding yourself then because


---------116:04----------
you had the brain of a 13 year old but


---------116:08----------
you have always cared and you're just


---------116:11----------
bursting at the seams in emotion like


---------116:13----------
now that I'm trying to get off the


---------116:15----------
stream and end it you're keep on you're


---------116:18----------
telling me more and more things well


---------116:20----------
sorry


---------116:21----------
yeah no no it's okay like I see this too


---------116:26----------
I think this is part of your pattern


---------116:27----------
actually that like in a sense like we've


---------116:31----------
talked for a while and now like I'm


---------116:34----------
pushing you out the door


---------116:35----------
right just like that other guy who is


---------116:38----------
late and you actually have a lot to say


---------116:41----------
and it's very helpful it's very valuable


---------116:44----------
I think it just takes some time to get


---------116:46----------
there in everything that you're telling


---------116:49----------
me is like reinforcing my idea that you


---------116:51----------
just have a lot inside you that you just


---------116:53----------
don't understand hmm


---------116:56----------
this whole business with the Navy this


---------116:58----------
whole business of like so when you


---------116:59----------
meditate I want you to think about this


---------117:02----------
right now youyou are keeping a lot of


---------117:04----------
stuff down with pressure in your mind


---------117:08----------
your mind is working it's


---------117:10----------
sauce ting being you right I feel like


---------117:14----------
it it's like so much work to just sit


---------117:18----------
anywhere for any amount of time doing


---------117:21----------
anything the only relief that you get is


---------117:24----------
through distraction but even keeping


---------117:28----------
those negative feelings down is like


---------117:30----------
it's like you're pushing and pushing and


---------117:32----------
pushing and all meditation is is it's


---------117:34----------
taking the pressure off so whatever is


---------117:37----------
down there it comes up so when I


---------117:40----------
meditate with people with a history of


---------117:42----------
PTSD I'm very careful with how I


---------117:44----------
meditate with them because if you just


---------117:46----------
empty their mind it's like a vacuum and


---------117:48----------
all the trauma comes rushing out in your


---------117:50----------
case you literally cannot sit still and


---------117:53----------
you feel physically uncomfortable


---------117:54----------
because those emotions are coming


---------117:56----------
rushing out those emotions come out any


---------118:01----------
which way you can call it body


---------118:02----------
dysmorphia you can call it shame you


---------118:04----------
could call it playing excessive video


---------118:06----------
games this whole thing about taking


---------118:08----------
pictures of yourself uploading it to


---------118:10----------
Instagram it's all one thing man


---------118:13----------
and you've got to like dig into that


---------118:16----------
somehow I mean I think therapy is a good


---------118:18----------
way to do it if you want to try to


---------118:19----------
meditate we can try that cancer one more


---------118:22----------
thing


---------118:29----------
yep photo how that's happening huh


---------118:31----------
things just get up now for an hour you


---------118:34----------
don't have an answer now it's like oh


---------118:35----------
what about this good keep going yeah do


---------118:40----------
you think like I don't want to call it


---------118:45----------
some sort of like physical trauma can


---------118:55----------
have anything to do with it you haven't


---------118:57----------
it's nothing pretty recently like you've


---------119:00----------
been saying like how all this stuff go


---------119:05----------
way back you know I'm just like


---------119:09----------
wondering if something I don't know if


---------119:13----------
I'll call it traumatic something kind of


---------119:15----------
traumatic happened recently like how


---------119:17----------
easily last year did your body


---------119:23----------
be a peek before this happened no good


---------119:28----------
piece after it happened


---------119:33----------
mm-hmm


---------119:34----------
do you feel comfortable sharing what


---------119:36----------
happened sure if I don't have to go into


---------119:40----------
detail sure or you don't have to share


---------119:44----------
anything I can just comment on what I


---------119:46----------
think without that but I'd love to hear


---------119:48----------
you think it'll help if I share because


---------119:50----------
I can share but well so I tend to do


---------119:53----------
best when people give me raw data hmm


---------119:57----------
but I can try to give you a theoretical


---------119:59----------
answer which may or may not help but so


---------120:04----------
what I'm so like what we're talking


---------120:06----------
about is some kind of flip right like


---------120:09----------
and I don't know where that flip is but


---------120:12----------
that flip could have been recent so the


---------120:17----------
point here is that Lane and sometimes


---------120:18----------
physical trauma can do that so like


---------120:20----------
there was something that was the way


---------120:22----------
that I want you to think about this is


---------120:23----------
like you had a you had a predisposition


---------120:26----------
or a risk factor for body dysmorphia for


---------120:30----------
maybe a long time but generally when we


---------120:32----------
think about mental illness and


---------120:34----------
diagnosing someone it's usually


---------120:36----------
something that catalyzes that change so


---------120:40----------
someone have always been like a little


---------120:42----------
bit depressed but then when they went


---------120:44----------
through the divorce is when like the


---------120:46----------
depression really hits them but you can


---------120:48----------
kind of see the signs and risk factors


---------120:50----------
in the the cracks that the divorce that


---------120:54----------
the depression kind of like breaks


---------120:55----------
through like you can see the cracks


---------120:57----------
start to form the weaknesses start to


---------120:59----------
form early on and then oftentimes it is


---------121:03----------
an event that sort of like really like


---------121:06----------
lays people oh yeah and when you say


---------121:09----------
peak like I'm assuming that that that


---------121:13----------
that sort of you know that curve started


---------121:16----------
a long time ago but absolutely you can


---------121:19----------
kind of be going like this and then go


---------121:21----------
like this hmm so and we see that like a


---------121:26----------
lot of times like you know mental


---------121:28----------
illness gets more severe under a


---------121:30----------
particular stressor but all of the


---------121:33----------
foundation of it was there before if


---------121:37----------
that makes sense


---------121:38----------
so I do think that a physical trauma


---------121:40----------
could have a lot to do with it now the


---------121:43----------
thing that's confusing to me about


---------121:44----------
physical trauma is that I'm getting a


---------121:47----------
sense of Worth and value and sense of


---------121:51----------
self and hatred and shame about you


---------121:55----------
which I'm surprised to hear relate to


---------121:59----------
physical trauma unless the physical


---------122:01----------
trauma was like malevolent in some way


---------122:04----------
like if someone got into a car accident


---------122:06----------
I would be really surprised to see this


---------122:10----------
kind of manifestation I don't I don't


---------122:12----------
think I should call it physical trauma


---------122:14----------
actually it wasn't Mormon people but


---------122:20----------
yeah abso-fucking-lutely yeah it wasn't


---------122:24----------
it it wasn't like a car crash or


---------122:26----------
anything yeah so if if it was a physical


---------122:30----------
I look you can say what you want to or


---------122:32----------
not say what you don't want to but I'm


---------122:34----------
just saying I would be surprised if it


---------122:36----------
was purely a physical trauma seems like


---------122:37----------
it's not really a physical trauma no I


---------122:41----------
realize now it wasn't I just I thought


---------122:43----------
that was the way to describe it but it's


---------122:45----------
okay sure do you want to tell us what


---------122:48----------
happened so me and my boyfriend was at a


---------122:56----------
party and and we were a party with one


---------123:01----------
of his friends and we all got very drunk


---------123:09----------
like I never been so drunk in my life


---------123:13----------
and my boyfriend passed out on because


---------123:19----------
we were sleeping there we passed out on


---------123:21----------
the bed and I just I joined him because


---------123:26----------
I didn't want to be alone in like I


---------123:29----------
didn't want to be in the party without


---------123:30----------
him and I I just laid down and I like I


---------123:39----------
got undressed in a way down and then


---------123:49----------
and he's my boyfriend's friend came in


---------123:52----------
the one who was hosting the party and he


---------123:59----------
started touching me


---------124:10----------
yeah I think that could be related


---------124:18----------
have you told anyone that before


---------124:24----------
I'll just move away


---------124:31----------
when you think about that what do you


---------124:33----------
what are you feeling now


---------124:47----------
I


---------124:52----------
I sometimes think that I should be happy


---------124:57----------
hmm


---------124:58----------
because like he found you desirable but


---------125:05----------
I didn't want to drop him


---------125:10----------
you said you sometimes think you should


---------125:13----------
be happy but how do you feel about that


---------125:19----------
any of it because when I ask you how you


---------125:23----------
feel your answer is I should dot dot dot


---------125:31----------
but I feel girls about it I feel like I


---------125:38----------
feel disgusting about it yeah and I did


---------125:42----------
the day after slope because I woke up


---------125:47----------
and like fill up and say click in my


---------125:51----------
stomach when you put on a dress


---------125:58----------
does any of that feeling come up


---------126:10----------
maybe I haven't really noticed it a


---------126:14----------
little bit


---------126:23----------
and good I'm really sorry that that


---------126:25----------
happened to you it sounds awful


---------126:34----------
and sorry for laughing in a moment like


---------126:38----------
this but sometimes that's the word I


---------126:40----------
deal with negative emotions didn't feel


---------126:42----------
but yeah I think that could be related


---------126:44----------
my friend right I mean we can talk about


---------126:49----------
foundations and that sort of makes sense


---------126:51----------
like you know earlier when I started


---------126:54----------
offering answers and we noticed that


---------126:57----------
something was missing and now I think


---------127:02----------
you've given us a lot to help us


---------127:04----------
understand like I mean I didn't even


---------127:06----------
know how to put all this together but it


---------127:08----------
sure is how every one of those things


---------127:10----------
that you shared with me feels very


---------127:11----------
significant mm-hmm I think it's really


---------127:18----------
hard once again I can't believe I


---------127:21----------
sometimes I forget we're on twitch oh


---------127:23----------
I'm sorry I brought it up because like


---------127:25----------
that what are you sorry about because


---------127:28----------
we've been going for so long now and I


---------127:31----------
don't bring that up then actually really


---------127:33----------
short so yeah but that's okay I think I


---------127:38----------
think the reason that you so ingred


---------127:40----------
things happen at their time in in their


---------127:43----------
place and part of what we have to do is


---------127:48----------
like let go of some expectations of how


---------127:51----------
and when things are supposed to happen


---------127:53----------
in my sense is that you just needed some


---------127:58----------
time to kind of let this stuff out


---------128:25----------
very smiling I'm just hopeful for you no


---------128:30----------
it's good I know may seem weird but I


---------128:36----------
think that you know if you're able to


---------128:38----------
talk about it here and reach out for


---------128:40----------
help and and I think that I'm hopeful


---------128:45----------
for people where I can see a problem and


---------128:47----------
like this is absolutely a problem in


---------128:49----------
Europe like if you feel the way that you


---------128:53----------
feel about yourself and something like


---------128:54----------
this happened then you know I think that


---------128:58----------
that gives me hope in a weird way


---------128:59----------
because what what gives me no hope is


---------129:04----------
like when we don't understand where the


---------129:05----------
problem comes from but I think in your


---------129:09----------
case there's all this like little stuff


---------129:11----------
that was kind of building up and then


---------129:12----------
there's like this feeling of being like


---------129:15----------
dirty right hmm of being disgusting and


---------129:21----------
and sometimes things happen to us that


---------129:23----------
make us make us feel though that way but


---------129:27----------
I'm hopeful that with the same courage


---------129:29----------
that you displayed today cuz like I'm


---------129:31----------
basing this on you yeah which is that at


---------129:34----------
the end of the day I think you're


---------129:35----------
incredibly courageous and I think you're


---------129:37----------
incredibly intelligent I think you're


---------129:38----------
awesome got some pretty sweet lights in


---------129:41----------
your PC and and I think that you know


---------129:46----------
you've got a lot of stuff that seems


---------129:47----------
unrelated but I think at the end of the


---------129:49----------
day you really only got like a couple of


---------129:52----------
things holding you back


---------129:53----------
and the reason I'm hopeful is because I


---------129:55----------
think you've started to take huge


---------129:57----------
strides in those directions today and at


---------130:01----------
the top of the list is is like


---------130:02----------
understanding what you feel right


---------130:09----------
because here we are I'm asking you


---------130:10----------
questions for like and out and I don't


---------130:11----------
mean to keep on beating you up about


---------130:13----------
this but listen I just tend to be a dick


---------130:15----------
you could tell me to go yourself


---------130:16----------
remember well that'll do that one day


---------130:20----------
angry one day you'll have the courage


---------130:23----------
but I was saying going to you'll have


---------130:28----------
the courage to tell me to go myself


---------130:29----------
but but because I think you you have


---------130:35----------
been incredibly courageous today and you


---------130:37----------
faced a lot of feelings and I think it's


---------130:38----------
hard to know what you feel because


---------130:40----------
you're not used to feeling it it's like


---------130:43----------
new territory for you so I taught my


---------130:46----------
wife I had her play if you heard of this


---------130:48----------
game called deep rock galactic mm-hmm so


---------130:52----------
like I had her played deep rock galactic


---------130:53----------
for the first time a few days ago and I


---------130:55----------
realized she's never played an FPS oh


---------130:59----------
and then I realized like how


---------131:01----------
disorienting it is to play an FPS for


---------131:03----------
the first time she's played games like


---------131:06----------
Mario and like Mario Kart yeah there was


---------131:11----------
like two different and like I just take


---------131:13----------
it for granted that I know how to


---------131:14----------
control an FPS but actually it's really


---------131:16----------
really bizarre to have like character


---------131:19----------
movement that's half keyboard and a half


---------131:21----------
Mouse like that's just strange hmm you


---------131:23----------
know and and so like the in your case I


---------131:27----------
think this is like your first I mean


---------131:29----------
maybe not first but you're new at this


---------131:31----------
like you just don't know how these


---------131:33----------
controls work yet in terms of feeling


---------131:36----------
what you feel understanding your


---------131:38----------
emotions tying things together putting


---------131:40----------
words to how you feel you're new at that


---------131:44----------
system of control and so just give


---------131:47----------
yourself some time and hopefully you'll


---------131:49----------
find a decent therapist who's not an


---------131:50----------
 and pushes you out the door


---------131:51----------
after five minutes and and you know be


---------131:56----------
patient with them and let them be


---------131:57----------
patient with you because I think if the


---------132:00----------
only thing that you needed for me is


---------132:01----------
like not my brilliance that doesn't


---------132:04----------
actually help by the way but yeah well


---------132:07----------
all you all you've really needed a space


---------132:09----------
and you're gonna I mean you're a capable


---------132:11----------
of doing the work on your own you just


---------132:12----------
need space and if you can find it I


---------132:17----------
think you're gonna start to feel better


---------132:19----------
about yourself


---------132:20----------
and I really hope so because if I didn't


---------132:22----------
if I couldn't have hope for you then I


---------132:24----------
couldn't do my job like I couldn't do


---------132:26----------
this next yeah how are you feeling now


---------132:36----------
probably relieved yeah takes a while to


---------132:40----------
get there I don't know why I said


---------132:44----------
lighting from five thousand people I


---------132:47----------
think you said because you needed to say


---------132:49----------
it and it needed to come out yeah yes


---------132:56----------
and I think you need to talk more about


---------132:58----------
it maybe not in front of 5,000 people


---------133:02----------
you know four thousand next time


---------133:06----------
[Laughter]


---------133:08----------
but seriously fine find a space to talk


---------133:11----------
about I'm dead serious about that in


---------133:12----------
grid like you know you don't need to be


---------133:14----------
carrying that around all by yourself


---------133:16----------
it's not fair to you and you don't


---------133:18----------
deserve it and you're not burdening


---------133:19----------
anyone by doing that talk about it with


---------133:23----------
my boyfriend oh sure


---------133:26----------
so I think that's good but also your


---------133:29----------
boyfriend is gonna support you in some


---------133:31----------
ways and not be able to support you in


---------133:34----------
other ways too hmm I mean it's it sounds


---------133:40----------
like you have a really good boyfriend


---------133:41----------
y'all have a good relationship yeah he's


---------133:44----------
great that sounds like it sounds like


---------133:46----------
he's a real keeper


---------133:47----------
yeah and and so I think you owe it to


---------133:51----------
yourself and you owe it to him and you


---------133:53----------
owe it to the your relationship to try


---------133:55----------
to help yourself


---------133:57----------
get through some of this stuff so that


---------133:59----------
you guys can do what you guys are


---------134:00----------
actually supposed to do we'll just be


---------134:03----------
happy together hmm


---------134:07----------
and no meditation write it we don't have


---------134:14----------
to suit though I think we've done enough


---------134:19----------
I think we add do anything else so


---------134:23----------
thanks a lot for coming on thanks for


---------134:26----------
having me


---------134:27----------
you're very welcome any last thoughts or


---------134:29----------
questions and you asked a bomb's you


---------134:31----------

---------134:33----------

---------134:38----------
you all the best and I'm really hopeful


---------134:40----------
for you and you know you deserve you


---------134:42----------
deserve to feel better and you deserve


---------134:44----------
to not have to carry this around


---------134:46----------
anymore


---------134:47----------
thank you so deuce


---------134:49----------
about that okay that's right all right


---------134:52----------
take care kid but okay now I'm confused


---------134:57----------
oh all right well hmm give me a


---------135:15----------
second


---------135:15----------
chat dr. K on boomer on boomer boys and


---------135:37----------
girls fixed saved etc oh man yeah so I


---------135:49----------
don't know if you guys know this but you


---------135:51----------
could teach an old boomer new tricks you


---------135:54----------
can unleash the plebs yeah that was a


---------135:58----------
raid boss whoo anyway so we are you know


---------136:03----------
we started late but we're also over time


---------136:05----------
I've got to run so I don't think we're


---------136:08----------
gonna have time for Q&A or anything else


---------136:11----------
dude the raid boss is getting the


---------136:13----------
screams this launched like that's the


---------136:15----------
raid boss see like the problem with like


---------136:17----------
are screams that like it's not it's not


---------136:20----------
like you could clear a bunch of trash


---------136:22----------
mobs and then then it's the it's the


---------136:24----------
raid boss it's like the raid boss is at


---------136:26----------
the very beginning with when the stream


---------136:28----------
actually launches or not and then it's


---------136:32----------
like yeah so listen guys thank you guys


---------136:37----------
very much I think I've got a I just want


---------136:40----------
to share a couple of things which we


---------136:41----------
didn't really get around to so first of


---------136:43----------
all you know I hope that was hopeful for


---------136:45----------
you guys and I think that oh yeah it's


---------136:52----------
so weird I think the most important


---------136:56----------
thing was thing was actually recognizing


---------136:58----------
that nothing we were saying was actually


---------137:00----------
helping like


---------137:02----------
it's really the turning point of that


---------137:04----------
interview for me isn't kind of


---------137:06----------
acknowledging that you could come up


---------137:07----------
with it however many theories you want


---------137:09----------
to and all this other and believe


---------137:12----------
you know everything in them like if it


---------137:14----------
doesn't fit like you gotta trust the


---------137:16----------
person that you're talking to and what I


---------137:18----------
want you guys to do is like trust


---------137:20----------
yourself right because like Ingrid in


---------137:22----------
that moment like you have to trust


---------137:24----------
yourself that these guys don't know what


---------137:26----------
they're talking about because we


---------137:27----------
don't know what the I'm talking


---------137:28----------
about because we don't have the whole


---------137:29----------
story


---------137:30----------
and that's not her fault necessarily


---------137:32----------
because you know it's just trust in


---------137:35----------
yourself and trust in the way that you


---------137:36----------
feel and if people you know if you feel


---------137:39----------
something about yourself then then oddly


---------137:41----------
enough even if it's depression or


---------137:42----------
something like that even if it's


---------137:43----------
negative if you're suicidal or you know


---------137:45----------
whatever like you can have feelings and


---------137:47----------
trust in those feelings doesn't mean you


---------137:49----------
have to act on them in fact you


---------137:50----------
shouldn't especially if you're I think


---------137:51----------
you might hurt yourself but like


---------137:54----------
understand that that's coming from a


---------137:55----------
very authentic place and that you have


---------137:57----------
to like accept that and recognize that


---------137:59----------
that pain is real what the pain


---------138:02----------
translates to in your mind is not real


---------138:04----------
but the pain itself is real right that


---------138:08----------
feeling of like and I hope you guys


---------138:09----------
caught this when I was sort of saying


---------138:10----------
that she has like this belief about


---------138:13----------
herself that like the low thing like if


---------138:15----------
you go back I don't know maybe like 40


---------138:17----------
or 45 minutes ago or an hour ago like


---------138:19----------
what we were getting from her is a sense


---------138:22----------
of like self loathing and that


---------138:23----------
absolutely comes after a sexual assault


---------138:26----------
which is what happened to her right like


---------138:29----------
that sort of makes sense if we were


---------138:30----------
sniffing it but we just don't know where


---------138:32----------
it comes from and so if you have


---------138:34----------
something that you feel about yourself


---------138:36----------
recognize that that comes from a place


---------138:38----------
too but then like that doesn't have to


---------138:39----------
own you right that doesn't have to be


---------138:41----------
fact it doesn't have to be true you can


---------138:45----------
you can like let go of that but you have


---------138:47----------
to figure out where it comes from and


---------138:49----------
then like heal that so anyway I really


---------138:56----------
hope that she does okay and she gets


---------139:00----------
some decent help so a couple of things


---------139:03----------
just to let you guys know so first of


---------139:05----------
all thank you very much for all of the


---------139:07----------
support and then we're gonna have


---------139:11----------
actually a good friend of mine this guy


---------139:13----------
named will sue who is an expert in


---------139:15----------
psychic


---------139:16----------
let's seize a psychiatrist and he's


---------139:19----------
gonna be on on Friday to talk about


---------139:21----------
psychedelics because I know that we've


---------139:22----------
got a lot of interest in that he's part


---------139:26----------
of the psychedelic support network also


---------139:29----------
you know don't crucify him for this but


---------139:32----------
it is also on TV and some Netflix things


---------139:37----------
and and a couple of things like that so


---------139:41----------
he's a great big proponent of the use of


---------139:43----------
psychedelics medically and non-medically


---------139:45----------
so hopefully he'll be on and we'll talk


---------139:48----------
a little bit about that I think he's


---------139:49----------
also offered to I think do a Q&A on our


---------139:56----------
discord maybe after the stream so we may


---------139:58----------
try to set that up for Friday and Friday


---------140:01----------
is gonna kick off we're doing a whole


---------140:02----------
thing for Mental Health Awareness Month


---------140:05----------
so may is mental health awareness month


---------140:09----------
so starting on Friday we're going to


---------140:10----------
talk to will and we're also gonna be


---------140:13----------
doing some fundraising for our coaching


---------140:17----------
programs so we'd like to help people


---------140:18----------
like Ingrid and other people who have


---------140:20----------
bad experiences with psychiatrists where


---------140:22----------
we can't treat medical problems but we


---------140:24----------
can definitely you know try to support


---------140:26----------
people teach them how to meditate help


---------140:28----------
them understand Vedic psychology things


---------140:30----------
like that help them understand their ego


---------140:32----------
and so we're gonna be doing some


---------140:35----------
fundraising with some various goals


---------140:37----------
along the way and yeah so like for


---------140:42----------
example if we're hitting our goal I


---------140:43----------
think we're gonna try to raise $75,000


---------140:46----------
maybe and if we hit that you know we're


---------140:49----------
gonna have various goals and you guys


---------140:51----------
can decide like what we do so options


---------140:54----------
for like stretch goals include me I hope


---------140:57----------
I can say this can I say this hold on


---------140:58----------
let me figure this out and I talked


---------141:03----------
about


---------141:05----------
[Music]


---------141:12----------
okay so yeah so like it involves gaming


---------141:16----------
streams but then also tears again so


---------141:18----------
this gaming stream there's gaming stream


---------141:20----------
with dr. K being hopeful and positive


---------141:23----------
and then there's also gaming stream with


---------141:27----------
me doing an Indian accent and trolling


---------141:28----------
people and then there's also a gaming


---------141:31----------
stream with me being doing an Indian


---------141:34----------
accent and and being toxic as all hell


---------141:36----------
and using my powers to destroy people's


---------141:38----------
like psyches instead of rebuilding them


---------141:41----------
and so we'll just see like how toxin can


---------141:44----------
we get let that inner troll all the way


---------141:46----------
out and so we may also do like some like


---------141:51----------
some cue it like marathon kind of


---------141:52----------
streams with like QA and stuff like that


---------141:54----------
we're still trying to sort out exactly


---------141:56----------
what our what our various donation


---------141:58----------
benchmarks are and then you know if we


---------142:02----------
hit our end goal maybe that should be


---------142:05----------
the end goal I don't know you guys


---------142:06----------
decide what the end goal is but other


---------142:08----------
options are gonna be like content that's


---------142:10----------
determined by the community so you guys


---------142:12----------
give me a topic and I'll produce a


---------142:14----------
series of webinars or YouTube lectures


---------142:16----------
or whatever like on whatever you guys


---------142:18----------
want if that's dating and talking to


---------142:20----------
women that's fine if it's like


---------142:21----------
understanding procrastination better


---------142:23----------
that's fine if it's understanding trauma


---------142:25----------
or like meditation you guys pick the


---------142:27----------
topics and I'll do it


---------142:28----------
and yeah so we're gonna start so this is


---------142:35----------
gonna be for the month of May for mental


---------142:36----------
health awareness month yeah and so we


---------142:42----------
have a highlights channel too for those


---------142:44----------
of you guys so that's gonna be a long


---------142:45----------
interview people have said that they


---------142:47----------
want the whole damn thing so fine so


---------142:49----------
that's gonna be like a two-hour upload


---------142:50----------
to YouTube but we have a second channel


---------142:52----------
where we try to clip some of the more


---------142:55----------
piecemeal chunks and yeah so that's


---------143:01----------
that's what we're gonna be shooting for


---------143:02----------
so all throughout the month of May I


---------143:04----------
think we're gonna do a lot of cool stuff
