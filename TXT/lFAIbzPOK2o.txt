---------00:00----------
oh no no problem thank you so much for


---------00:02----------
having me on the show I just feel I


---------00:04----------
don't know I'm really excited to come on


---------00:06----------
I'm really nervous but I'm excited for


---------00:09----------
what I could take away from it so what


---------00:13----------
could you take away from it


---------00:14----------
um I guess but I really wanted to come


---------00:18----------
on for is sorry I'm like such a crier I


---------00:22----------
really am and some of this stuff is kind


---------00:24----------
of hard for me to talk about um but I


---------00:27----------
feel like I would say 2012 to 2016 17


---------00:33----------
were really horrible points in my life


---------00:37----------
there was just like kind of like the


---------00:39----------
series of events that happened and it


---------00:43----------
was really long last time yeah um it was


---------00:48----------
I don't know it was really difficult and


---------00:51----------
I feel like I came to a point where I


---------00:53----------
feel like the dust has kind of settled I


---------00:56----------
guess and I'm ready to kind of process


---------01:01----------
which is good scary for me but I don't


---------01:04----------
know okay


---------01:07----------
I know this sounds I I know I ask people


---------01:11----------
to sometimes like can I think for a


---------01:13----------
second but can I just can I pull that


---------01:14----------
card out now can i play that card


---------01:16----------
because you just actually just shared a


---------01:18----------
lot and I need a moment to think about


---------01:20----------
because I'm hearing a lot of different


---------01:21----------
stuff from you so let me think out loud


---------01:23----------
so the first thing is that I'm hearing


---------01:25----------
you facing something by coming on here


---------01:27----------
today yeah I'm hearing that it's hard


---------01:32----------
for you in some ways I'm hearing that


---------01:34----------
also like I just have to just take a


---------01:36----------
step back and think about you said 2012


---------01:38----------
the two thousand sixteen or seventeen


---------01:39----------
was a hard period that's years yeah yeah


---------01:43----------
I um I guess I could go into detail okay


---------01:48----------
you know I'm ready to go into detail


---------01:49----------
okay go for it oh god I mean it was like


---------01:53----------
a lot of years it's a long story um but


---------01:57----------
I feel like it all kind of started out


---------02:00----------
and this is like particularly sorry I'm


---------02:03----------
such a crier so why do you apologize for


---------02:06----------
being a crier let's talk about that um I


---------02:09----------
don't know I feel like I'm kind of um


---------02:13----------
I'm like I can't believe I'm already


---------02:15----------
getting emotional I was gonna try to


---------02:16----------
hold it together uh can we talk about


---------02:20----------
that for a moment yeah okay I understand


---------02:24----------
that you want to tell the story but


---------02:25----------
let's stop and just look at so you're


---------02:27----------
having an emotional reaction and I'd


---------02:29----------
like to understand what about holding it


---------02:33----------
together is important why can't you come


---------02:36----------
on and be a shitshow from second twenty


---------02:39----------
nine I guess I'm just like afraid that


---------02:42----------
it'll like kind of spiral like I feel


---------02:44----------
like a lot of it has been kind of stuff


---------02:47----------
that I've been suppressing for a long


---------02:50----------
time because I'm afraid of like that


---------02:52----------
outcome I guess what's the outcome that


---------02:55----------
you're afraid of um I don't know I feel


---------02:59----------
like kind of like processing it is just


---------03:01----------
going to put me out for a while you know


---------03:05----------
like mentally yeah that's gonna happen


---------03:09----------
and I guess the idea of like you know


---------03:12----------
like being put out and maybe not being


---------03:14----------
able


---------03:15----------
to do my job you know my job since I'm a


---------03:18----------
streamer as well as I could


---------03:19----------
it's scary to me sure so I so in it gets


---------03:25----------
kaceytron yeah okay so kaceytron I think


---------03:30----------
that all of those are really valid


---------03:31----------
concerns and I do think that you know at


---------03:35----------
the end of an emotional conversation or


---------03:37----------
dealing with your emotions you're gonna


---------03:39----------
be exhausted and it may impact your


---------03:42----------
ability to stream and that's normal and


---------03:46----------
in my overwhelming experience generally


---------03:49----------
speaking like a week or two from now


---------03:51----------
your people tend to be in a better place


---------03:53----------
although sometimes they aren't and if


---------03:55----------
they aren't you know if if this if your


---------03:59----------
conversation today has ripple effects


---------04:02----------
that you're having difficulty dealing


---------04:04----------
with please let us know and we'll try to


---------04:07----------
either support you ourselves or like


---------04:09----------
connect you with the appropriate support


---------04:11----------
so that you can kind of get through that


---------04:13----------
because I don't want to like you know I


---------04:15----------
don't want to like you know if you open


---------04:17----------
a can of worms then you have to deal


---------04:18----------
with that [ __ ] I don't want to leave you


---------04:19----------
hanging does that make sense yeah no but


---------04:24----------
I you know I think I think it could


---------04:26----------
spiral that I'm here yes so so we'll try


---------04:29----------
to help you with that spiral also so


---------04:33----------
twitch chat right they can actually


---------04:36----------
surprise you from time to time if you


---------04:37----------
lean on them oh and you know they really


---------04:40----------
do and I guess like that's one of the


---------04:42----------
other things that I wanted to say is


---------04:44----------
like you know like you said it was like


---------04:46----------
such a kind of long period of time and


---------04:48----------
really during this time like the only


---------04:50----------
positive thing I had was twitch she know


---------04:53----------
that was kind of my escape I guess so I


---------04:57----------
I don't know I always just like think of


---------05:00----------
twitch very fondly oh yeah me too so you


---------05:06----------
aren't you and dive in yeah um so I feel


---------05:10----------
like it all kind of starts out and it


---------05:13----------
doesn't really start out in 2012 but um


---------05:16----------
so I don't know I guess to summarize um


---------05:20----------
I was with my boyfriend for a long time


---------05:24----------
I was really close with his family like


---------05:26----------
I had even moved in with them and


---------05:29----------
his younger brother was diagnosed with a


---------05:31----------
really bad form of childhood cancer and


---------05:34----------
he passed away in 2012 it was this is


---------05:40----------
probably like one of the harder things


---------05:42----------
for me to talk about but it was really


---------05:43----------
hard sometimes the visuals from it is I


---------05:48----------
don't really bothersome to me mm-hmm


---------05:53----------
sounds like they really burned an image


---------05:56----------
in your mind yeah um it was just you


---------06:01----------
know like I've had I've had family


---------06:04----------
members passed away from cancer you know


---------06:06----------
we all have that just something about it


---------06:08----------
being a child was just especially like a


---------06:11----------
child that I was really close to I was


---------06:13----------
one of his main caregivers you know we


---------06:16----------
were very involved he was very sick you


---------06:18----------
know they needed as much help as


---------06:20----------
possible I was actually I was actually


---------06:23----------
holding his hand whenever he passed away


---------06:27----------
and just like the way that he the way


---------06:33----------
the cancer had just eaten him alive


---------06:37----------
uh it was really really hard yeah


---------06:41----------
so that's I feel like kind of where the


---------06:44----------
turmoil starts and during this time my


---------06:49----------
mom had relapsed on meth and it was like


---------06:55----------
after this had happened I never really


---------06:57----------
was able to process it because my mom


---------07:02----------
along with my stepdad who was extremely


---------07:05----------
extremely abusive to her had both


---------07:07----------
relapsed on meth and this went on for it


---------07:11----------
was like a very abusive relationship for


---------07:14----------
three or four years like I thought he


---------07:16----------
was gonna kill my mom


---------07:18----------
and he didn't um but yeah I guess that's


---------07:22----------
like kind of really summarizing it [ __ ]


---------07:26----------
that's a lot any one of those is hmm so


---------07:34----------
kaceytron how do you what do you think


---------07:36----------
about all that stuff I mean that's a lot


---------07:40----------
um it's really weird looking back on it


---------07:45----------
now because I remembered then feeling


---------07:48----------
like so um I don't know like so grown up


---------07:53----------
like such an adult and whenever I like


---------07:56----------
think back at it now you know whenever


---------07:58----------
I'm almost 30 like I think like I was in


---------08:01----------
my early 20s


---------08:03----------
you know whenever they said sure started


---------08:06----------
happening and


---------08:11----------
I don't know like I guess whenever I


---------08:14----------
look back at it now I just think like


---------08:15----------
how was I able to deal with it


---------08:20----------
um like I feel like I couldn't do it


---------08:23----------
again


---------08:25----------
ya know I think that that makes sense


---------08:28----------
how do you how do you feel like you were


---------08:31----------
able to deal with it um I feel like I


---------08:36----------
just wasn't really able to feel for I


---------08:40----------
don't know like several years I guess


---------08:44----------
yeah um like I feel like that was like


---------08:47----------
really the only way I could go on I


---------08:50----------
don't know like I guess I really


---------08:52----------
summarize the the abuse that my mom


---------08:55----------
dealt with but it was just God it was


---------08:58----------
just so relentless


---------09:06----------
like I don't know like I hate calling


---------09:10----------
him my stepdad I don't want to call him


---------09:13----------
by name obviously like I don't want to


---------09:14----------
say his name or anything - um is there


---------09:19----------
any is there any danger to you or your


---------09:22----------
mom or anyone else if you talk about


---------09:24----------
this more in a public setting no we


---------09:27----------
would need to think about that make sure


---------09:28----------
that no there isn't


---------09:31----------
he's been out of our lives for


---------09:34----------
completely I would say about three years


---------09:37----------
now but I guess another thing that's


---------09:41----------
kind of hard about it is he was in my


---------09:45----------
life like ever since I was five years


---------09:47----------
old you know and he had never really


---------09:52----------
been that abusive to my mom he had hit


---------09:56----------
her you know like I think me and I feel


---------09:59----------
like I'm not either


---------10:00----------
yeah I want you to listen to this


---------10:03----------
sentence he had never really been that


---------10:07----------
abusive to my mom right you know which


---------10:14----------
like that's that's something that I've


---------10:16----------
came to realize more and more since I've


---------10:18----------
been kind of processing it as you know


---------10:21----------
abuse is abuse no matter what and it's


---------10:24----------
just like I remember then it just didn't


---------10:26----------
really click


---------10:27----------
you know just even to like I guess like


---------10:30----------
other family members um you know it was


---------10:34----------
like everybody was upset about it like


---------10:36----------
the times that it had happened and it


---------10:38----------
was awful but it just you know it got


---------10:40----------
brushed off I think is like a lot of


---------10:42----------
those situations do right and then um


---------10:49----------
with the relapse it was just like it got


---------10:53----------
so bad like there was probably like I


---------10:57----------
said like a four year period where I did


---------10:59----------
not see my mom without some sort of like


---------11:03----------
bruise or concussion or stitches or


---------11:06----------
something like something like for four


---------11:08----------
years and because she was using at the


---------11:13----------
time it was really hard to get her to


---------11:16----------
leave which I don't really you know


---------11:20----------
hold any resentment why not


---------11:29----------
um I guess I hold more resentment


---------11:31----------
towards him you know because at any


---------11:34----------
point he could have left why didn't he


---------11:36----------
like why didn't he at any point you know


---------11:40----------
just leave and stop terrorizing my


---------11:42----------
family because that's what it felt like


---------11:44----------
just like three four or five years of


---------11:47----------
just like utter terror there was


---------11:55----------
it was just like it went on so much like


---------11:58----------
I can't even like begin to describe it


---------12:01----------
was like a daily thing like my mom would


---------12:03----------
call me and a lot of the time I would be


---------12:05----------
streaming and she would just hang up and


---------12:07----------
I'd be like oh [ __ ] and just turn off my


---------12:10----------
stream and drive over there it would


---------12:11----------
just be like this all the time


---------12:16----------
after my grandma passed away it got even


---------12:20----------
worse I remember literally the day of my


---------12:24----------
grandma's funeral he broke into the


---------12:28----------
house and he attacked my mom in the


---------12:30----------
shower and just beat the [ __ ] out of her


---------12:33----------
she had like a huge knife on the side of


---------12:36----------
her head at the funeral and it was like


---------12:39----------
everybody knew


---------12:42----------
um I don't know there was a time I have


---------12:47----------
a younger brother who was he wasn't


---------12:50----------
physically abused by him he was only


---------12:55----------
physically abusive to my mom because it


---------12:57----------
was the person that he could get away


---------13:01----------
with it


---------13:02----------
right um but he would be very mentally


---------13:05----------
abusive to my younger brother my younger


---------13:07----------
brother has autism and it's actually his


---------13:09----------
biological son he would say things like


---------13:12----------
he was [ __ ] he wish he wouldn't have


---------13:14----------
been born and that he wasn't his


---------13:20----------
my brother still struggles with that a


---------13:22----------
lot


---------13:25----------
I don't know like I guess just in a lot


---------13:27----------
of ways it's just like it's like my


---------13:32----------
family still struggles with it every day


---------13:35----------
my mom lives with me to you and my


---------13:37----------
struggle


---------13:38----------
what is this struggle that you guys deal


---------13:40----------
with my mom has pretty severe paranoia


---------13:48----------
and it's


---------13:55----------
in a lot of ways I think it's just


---------13:57----------
because she was used to being beaten


---------14:00----------
every day for so long it's just like


---------14:03----------
she's constantly in this like kind of


---------14:05----------
fighter flight and I feel like in a lot


---------14:07----------
of ways I kind of am too we'd get to you


---------14:13----------
great and maybe notice but you're


---------14:15----------
talking about everyone else see that I


---------14:19----------
guess yeah and I guess throughout all of


---------14:22----------
this it was like I was I was the person


---------14:26----------
you know like I was the person who had


---------14:29----------
to be there for my family like I'm the


---------14:32----------
oldest um I had to take on a lot what


---------14:38----------
did you tell you now um you know my


---------14:42----------
mother and my younger brother started


---------14:44----------
living with me it was kind of back and


---------14:47----------
forth with my mom like I said she was


---------14:50----------
you know under the influence and


---------14:54----------
it was difficult because you know she


---------14:57----------
wouldn't stay clean so like during all


---------15:00----------
of this going on it was really hard not


---------15:01----------
to be angry with her because of her


---------15:04----------
constant use and I guess the other thing


---------15:08----------
that made are really difficult is


---------15:10----------
whenever my grandma passed away she got


---------15:12----------
you know like a pretty decent


---------15:14----------
inheritance so she got she got like


---------15:17----------
$100,000 so it was just like she had


---------15:20----------
limitless income so it was very


---------15:24----------
exhausting yeah it was very exhausting


---------15:27----------
what was it dealing with it was just


---------15:31----------
like he couldn't keep up it was like


---------15:34----------
here my mom was with this really


---------15:37----------
extremely abusive person and um she had


---------15:41----------
just like inherited all this money she


---------15:43----------
was a user and it was just like great


---------15:46----------
here's like you know a two three-year


---------15:49----------
amount of time where it's like she's


---------15:50----------
never going to run out of money just to


---------15:52----------
continuously abuse right I don't know I


---------15:58----------
just got couldn't stop it yeah it was


---------16:02----------
you know completely out of my control


---------16:04----------
all I could really do is just like stand


---------16:07----------
by and watch you know because during


---------16:11----------
this time I was


---------16:15----------
successful and doing well on twitch like


---------16:17----------
I earned enough to be able to take care


---------16:19----------
of my younger brother and you know my


---------16:23----------
mom was able to stay at my house


---------16:24----------
sometimes but it would get really


---------16:26----------
frustrating because


---------16:29----------
you know she would like show him where I


---------16:31----------
lived like there would always be like


---------16:33----------
this point where she you know she'd like


---------16:35----------
try to sneak him around and she would


---------16:37----------
keep seeing him which like they don't


---------16:40----------
blame her for I don't really hold any


---------16:42----------
resentment


---------16:45----------
towards her for it um not even is it um


---------16:53----------
maybe a tiny bed I guess I try not to ah


---------16:57----------
that I can get behind


---------16:59----------
try not to I can make sense to me but it


---------17:02----------
boggles my mind that


---------17:08----------
I mean it sounds like you were carrying


---------17:11----------
the world on your back and it sounds


---------17:14----------
like I mean I can just I'm just putting


---------17:16----------
myself in my shoes I would feel probably


---------17:20----------
incredibly frustrated that she didn't


---------17:24----------
help more and I can imagine I'm gonna


---------17:29----------
keep talking for a second okay and I can


---------17:32----------
imagine that I would want to try to


---------17:34----------
forgive her and I would forgive her and


---------17:36----------
I could still harbor resentment and I


---------17:38----------
would try to keep that resentment at bay


---------17:40----------
and I would try to decide that I'm gonna


---------17:41----------
be a good person and it's not her fault


---------17:43----------
and at the same time I would still in


---------17:48----------
the deepest darkest parts of my soul I


---------17:50----------
would have anger and resentment


---------17:53----------
yeah yeah I guess I would say that


---------17:56----------
that's pretty true like there's a part


---------17:58----------
of me that like really resents you know


---------18:01----------
that you know I guess during might come


---------18:05----------
up on Twitch because during this time


---------18:07----------
that all of this was happening I was you


---------18:11----------
know like kind of having my breakout


---------18:12----------
moment I guess and I couldn't really


---------18:16----------
focus on it there were times where I


---------18:18----------
remember like I would have I know you


---------18:20----------
were robbed of joy yeah yeah that's


---------18:26----------
yeah


---------18:29----------
like now that I think about a kaceytron


---------18:31----------
what I'm hearing more and more from you


---------18:33----------
is that you got robbed of so many things


---------18:42----------
yeah it's really like you said it's


---------18:45----------
really hard for me to talk about it like


---------18:47----------
in reference to myself um I think a lot


---------18:53----------
of it just has to do with me maybe being


---------18:56----------
the oldest and then like I said just


---------18:58----------
feeling like I have had to be kind of


---------19:00----------
the protector for my family mm-hmm so I


---------19:10----------
don't know what's it like to be the


---------19:12----------
protector um


---------19:16----------
exhausting


---------19:22----------
and I think for a second case trial how


---------19:25----------
you hold it up I'm starting to kind of


---------19:28----------
calm down a little I guess I'm just like


---------19:30----------
really kind of um I know I guess like a


---------19:34----------
part of me is kind of embarrassed


---------19:38----------
because I just sound so white trash you


---------19:42----------
know


---------19:47----------
and I guess like I'm kind of worried you


---------19:50----------
know what people think sure whose fault


---------19:54----------
is it that you sound the way that you do


---------19:58----------
um in what way like whose fault is it


---------20:02----------
that I sound yeah you say you sound like


---------20:06----------
you're white trash and I'm saying like


---------20:08----------
who's responsible for those


---------20:11----------
circumstances or the story that your


---------20:13----------
talent I don't know I guess my parents


---------20:18----------
yeah I think it's important to remember


---------20:21----------
that right cuz like I know in time


---------20:25----------
anyway I'll get to that in a second but


---------20:27----------
yeah yeah I think it's important to


---------20:30----------
remember that I'm not going to try it


---------20:34----------
all argue with you that you sound like


---------20:38----------
white trash but what I would encourage


---------20:41----------
you to remember is there is an infinite


---------20:44----------
amount of distance between sounding like


---------20:47----------
white trash and be white trash because


---------20:50----------
I'm not hearing any iota of you being


---------20:54----------
white trash


---------20:56----------
in fact I'm hearing quite the opposite


---------20:59----------
I'm hearing a story of courage and


---------21:02----------
dependability of resilience and pain and


---------21:07----------
ODS sacked heavily heavily against you


---------21:14----------
thank you and ultimately I'm hearing the


---------21:17----------
story of triumph with a terrible


---------21:19----------
terrible cost


---------21:23----------
what do you think about that you think


---------21:27----------
that you don't I don't know I guess I


---------21:29----------
don't give myself enough credit I can be


---------21:33----------
very critical of myself yep we're not


---------21:36----------
really seeing a whole lot of it yet but


---------21:37----------
I imagine it's down there oh god sorry


---------21:40----------
yeah like I said I'm like such a crier


---------21:42----------
and this is just like not easy I can


---------21:45----------
imagine to talk about do you want to


---------21:47----------
talk about this I do okay um I do want


---------21:52----------
to talk about it um I don't know like I


---------21:55----------
feel like one of the things that I feel


---------21:58----------
like one of the things that really helps


---------22:00----------
me is just like not that I would want


---------22:03----------
anybody to have the same sort of issues


---------22:06----------
but you know finding you know that


---------22:08----------
people can relate to it and I feel like


---------22:10----------
somebody can kind of you know relate to


---------22:13----------
my story in some way and not feel so


---------22:16----------
alone you know them that's what it's all


---------22:21----------
about right like do you feel alone


---------22:24----------
sometimes yeah I guess hmm I guess I'm


---------22:31----------
just like always felt not normal and I


---------22:37----------
don't know I wouldn't say like I don't


---------22:39----------
feel like I've had some super


---------22:42----------
unfortunate life or anything like that


---------22:44----------
why not by the way I have like this


---------22:51----------
really I think certain kaceytron I have


---------22:55----------
like this really I have this thing that


---------22:58----------
I do and I think a lot of it has to do


---------23:00----------
with um Ricky and I was who passed away


---------23:05----------
he was only 7 I think a lot of it kind


---------23:09----------
of has to do with that like I feel like


---------23:10----------
in a lot of ways that warped my reality


---------23:15----------
a lot and in a lot of ways like I just


---------23:17----------
feel like this need to feel grateful no


---------23:20----------
matter what and I feel like sometimes I


---------23:22----------
kind of use it as a cop-out and I'm kind


---------23:25----------
of you know coming to that realization


---------23:27----------
like fairly recently like I like you


---------23:30----------
said I think it's good to feel grateful


---------23:34----------
but I feel like a lot of the time I use


---------23:36----------
it as like a way of not allowing myself


---------23:40----------
to feel yeah why do you feel like you


---------23:43----------
have to be okay can I jump in can i yeah


---------23:47----------
I've been trying my best to listen yeah


---------23:50----------
but I have I have a lot of thoughts okay


---------23:54----------
so is it okay if I ask a couple of


---------23:58----------
questions yeah okay um you gotta let me


---------24:02----------
know if me asking questions makes things


---------24:04----------
easier for you or harder for you so I'm


---------24:06----------
gonna check in with back in like five to


---------24:08----------
ten minutes okay


---------24:09----------
okay so when you say you've with Ricki


---------24:14----------
when he passed away you somehow came


---------24:16----------
away with the conclusion that you have


---------24:18----------
to be grateful no matter what what's up


---------24:22----------
with that


---------24:22----------
um I guess


---------24:28----------
I guess I just feel grateful for my


---------24:32----------
health


---------24:32----------
and my family's health every day


---------24:40----------
I guess I have like a lot of like


---------24:42----------
selfish feelings sometimes but reference


---------24:45----------
to that like guilt


---------24:53----------
one of the which is kind of funny but


---------24:57----------
one of the things that I have issues


---------24:59----------
with a lot is just because he was very


---------25:02----------
into video games one of the things that


---------25:05----------
I have issues with a lot is um playing


---------25:08----------
video games sometimes which is weird


---------25:10----------
since I'm a twitch streamer right I


---------25:13----------
usually like do you have um like anytime


---------25:18----------
a game comes out that I know he would


---------25:20----------
have liked


---------25:22----------
um it's just like difficult I don't want


---------25:26----------
to play it


---------25:29----------
um sure what makes that play cuz it just


---------25:34----------
feels like he is like missing out on


---------25:36----------
something that he shouldn't have


---------25:46----------
um and and I know I've asked you a


---------25:49----------
couple of times if you're if I should


---------25:51----------
call you kaceytron I have trouble it's


---------25:53----------
just it's having I'm having trouble


---------25:55----------
getting met to role or you can call me


---------25:56----------
Casey that's fine thank you very much so


---------26:00----------
Casey I'm gonna just ask you a question


---------26:04----------
so I'm gonna ask you are you in a place


---------26:05----------
where you think you can reflect on a


---------26:06----------
statement that I make yeah okay so I'm


---------26:10----------
gonna give you a scenario let's say that


---------26:14----------
we have a 23 year old girl who has


---------26:18----------
essentially a brother who is dying of


---------26:20----------
cancer and dies of cancer at the age of


---------26:22----------
7 and then she says that based on this


---------26:26----------
experience I feel grateful and selfish


---------26:30----------
does that add up to you know what do you


---------26:37----------
imagine that person should feel like


---------26:41----------
what would you predict that person to


---------26:43----------
feel if they lose a seven-year-old


---------26:46----------
basically what sounds like brother dude


---------26:48----------
and watch them wither away to cancer sad


---------26:55----------
yep what else


---------27:00----------
I don't know I guess maybe a little bit


---------27:06----------
I don't know how they like [ __ ] up


---------27:08----------
from it


---------27:12----------
and you know what the [ __ ] up looks


---------27:14----------
like


---------27:16----------
looks like you saying that you're


---------27:18----------
grateful and selfish that's the [ __ ]


---------27:20----------
up people dying of cancer does not make


---------27:23----------
other people grateful and and what I see


---------27:27----------
within you is a war between the ocean of


---------27:30----------
negativity and the bastion of positivity


---------27:34----------
yeah right I and and I think what we're


---------27:38----------
dealing with here is like and sorry I'm


---------27:41----------
gonna jump around okay so yes and if it


---------27:43----------
I don't make sense please let me know so


---------27:45----------
what I'm hearing from you overall is


---------27:47----------
like loans and debts like you're like


---------27:50----------
how was I able to do this and you're


---------27:52----------
spiraling out of control now like


---------27:54----------
basically I think you took an emotional


---------27:55----------
loan and now you're paying back that


---------27:57----------
debt cuz that's what we do this for a


---------28:01----------
long time years it sounds like you had


---------28:04----------
to be strong but that strength doesn't


---------28:08----------
come from nowhere that's like you're


---------28:09----------
you're taking out a loan against future


---------28:12----------
earnings there's a there's an emotional


---------28:14----------
price to be paid


---------28:16----------
yeah and now the devil wants us to and


---------28:20----------
oddly enough that's a good thing because


---------28:22----------
that's what healing looks like because


---------28:25----------
there's a lot of hurt that you have


---------28:27----------
built up and kept in their weird ways


---------28:31----------
that your mind has struggled to survive


---------28:33----------
I don't blame you for that but like look


---------28:34----------
I mean come on yeah you watched a


---------28:37----------
seven-year-old die of canceled cancer


---------28:39----------
and that you're saying I'm great


---------28:40----------
like what look I get where that comes


---------28:42----------
from I think it's amazing that you could


---------28:44----------
do that I think it's the only way you


---------28:46----------
can survive that right because if you


---------28:49----------
let the damn loose and the negativity


---------28:53----------
comes you could not afford to spiral


---------28:56----------
them like how the [ __ ] are you supposed


---------28:57----------
to spiral when you have a brother with


---------29:00----------
autism


---------29:02----------
you know this kid dying of cancer in


---------29:04----------
your house and your mom is using math


---------29:06----------
like there's no that like you can't


---------29:08----------
afford to pay that emotional price then


---------29:11----------
and so you're paying it now yeah


---------29:15----------
let's come to that realization in a lot


---------29:18----------
of ways how so did you help us


---------29:21----------
understand that a little bit um I don't


---------29:23----------
know like lately I've been like I said


---------29:26----------
like I feel like I used like this I like


---------29:29----------
I'll constantly always like refer to


---------29:31----------
like you know there's people who have it


---------29:33----------
worse and you know if anything I should


---------29:36----------
just feel grateful that I'm here and I'm


---------29:38----------
in good health and you know everything's


---------29:40----------
okay um I feel like sometimes I just


---------29:44----------
don't want to ask for much more than


---------29:46----------
that I guess in a way yeah


---------29:49----------
what do they how do make yeah how does


---------29:54----------
it feel to ask for more like I'm being


---------29:57----------
selfish I don't know


---------30:01----------
I don't know I guess like I just feel


---------30:04----------
like things like there's just like a


---------30:07----------
point in my life where I just felt like


---------30:09----------
things were so bad like where I'm at now


---------30:13----------
where things are you know like not that


---------30:17----------
bad a lot better like I just feel like I


---------30:20----------
don't want to ask for much more than


---------30:22----------
that


---------30:22----------
you know so I think there's something


---------30:27----------
subtle and potentially dangerous here


---------30:30----------
first is that I think it's important to


---------30:33----------
have gratitude and I think I hear from


---------30:35----------
you genuine gratitude yeah right so it's


---------30:38----------
important to acknowledge where you come


---------30:40----------
from like I have a lot of gratitude


---------30:42----------
around where my parents came from and


---------30:44----------
what I have um I have it really really


---------30:47----------
good and my parents did it yeah and so I


---------30:51----------
think it's important to express


---------30:52----------
gratitude and acknowledge that and it


---------30:54----------
sounds like you really do have a lot of


---------30:56----------
things to be grateful for how you doing


---------30:58----------
by the way I'm doing okay I'm starting


---------31:01----------
to you know it's like like I said I'm


---------31:04----------
just like very anxious you know it's


---------31:07----------
embarrassing


---------31:09----------
when I think about


---------31:13----------
I don't know like I guess I'm just like


---------31:17----------
I know it's so like I know I shouldn't


---------31:20----------
be but it's hard not to worry what


---------31:21----------
people will think of me or how they'll


---------31:23----------
think of me differently


---------31:25----------
why shouldn't you worry what people


---------31:26----------
think about you of course you should


---------31:29----------
worry yeah okay see you make one mistake


---------31:34----------
which is that you just invalidate the


---------31:36----------
way that you feel that's a yeah right so


---------31:40----------
like of course you're gonna be like who


---------31:42----------
the [ __ ] when you come onto the Internet


---------31:46----------
and you talk about how you grew up in


---------31:48----------
your works I don't I'm sort of saying


---------31:51----------
this yeah to make a point in a white


---------31:53----------
trash household


---------31:55----------
how do people think about people who


---------31:58----------
grow up in white trash households but I


---------32:01----------
think the really cool thing about your


---------32:03----------
story


---------32:04----------
is that it is overwhelmingly clear to me


---------32:07----------
that you are not white trash


---------32:08----------
even though Khalid I'll acknowledge 100%


---------32:12----------
that it may look white trash yeah and


---------32:16----------
it's okay for you to be afraid of being


---------32:20----------
judged yeah and and this is this is the


---------32:24----------
the basic issue that I see is that like


---------32:26----------
you don't let yourself feel bad things


---------32:29----------
you're not allowed to be afraid of being


---------32:31----------
judged for white trash I shouldn't feel


---------32:33----------
that way yeah I shouldn't feel sad I


---------32:37----------
shouldn't feel angry yeah like breaking


---------32:42----------
out on Twitch is supposed to be [ __ ]


---------32:44----------
awesome yeah


---------32:46----------
and Casey I don't know how to say this


---------32:49----------
but like you got robbed yeah like I I


---------32:58----------
don't know like


---------33:00----------
I was talking about resentment earlier


---------33:02----------
and how I don't hold any resentment and


---------33:08----------
I I do you know I do to a certain degree


---------33:11----------
I try not to I think there was a time


---------33:15----------
where I felt a lot more resentment like


---------33:18----------
I feel like I've gotten a little bit


---------33:19----------
better about it in the past year or two


---------33:21----------
um but there was definitely a time where


---------33:27----------
I was really frustrated with my mom


---------33:29----------
because it did feel like I was


---------33:34----------
robbed hey Casey


---------33:38----------
you got to let me know if I'm gonna be


---------33:40----------
an [ __ ] okay yeah because I'm gonna


---------33:42----------
say something to you I think it could be


---------33:44----------
hurtful to you but at the same time I


---------33:47----------
feel like it's important to say not so


---------33:48----------
much for you but for everyone else out


---------33:50----------
there is that okay yeah okay


---------33:53----------
so do you blame your mom


---------34:01----------
um


---------34:04----------
it's hard to I don't know actually agree


---------34:07----------
it's hard hard to okay especially just


---------34:11----------
seeing how she is now it's hard to okay


---------34:16----------
um I don't know


---------34:18----------
okay so let me ask you another question


---------34:20----------
okay we're gonna think a little bit like


---------34:22----------
analytically and hopefully that'll help


---------34:25----------
from an emotional perspective yeah so


---------34:30----------
can I forgive someone who didn't do


---------34:33----------
anything wrong to me


---------34:37----------
I guess you can forgive anyone for any


---------34:39----------
reason but if they didn't do anything


---------34:41----------
wrong like can I forgive someone for


---------34:43----------
throwing me an awesome birthday party No


---------34:48----------
why not because they didn't do anything


---------34:53----------
wrong


---------34:53----------
yeah right so it's kind of interesting


---------34:57----------
because I see this a lot where like the


---------35:00----------
people that we love we try not to blame


---------35:02----------
them which is wonderful and at the same


---------35:05----------
time there's a very subtle problem here


---------35:07----------
which is like it gets you stuck yeah


---------35:10----------
right you can love her you can


---------35:13----------
appreciate what she did for you you can


---------35:15----------
acknowledge that there's a disease here


---------35:17----------
and it was like a roll of the dice and


---------35:19----------
it may not be fair to blame her but I


---------35:22----------
think you should absolutely blame her


---------35:24----------
anyway there what I what I what I would


---------35:29----------
really love I think the direction you


---------35:31----------
need to go is to not be one-sided to


---------35:36----------
acknowledge that like at the end of the


---------35:38----------
day like it sounds like you were the mom


---------35:40----------
and she was the kid that's not fair to


---------35:44----------
you and I think that as much as


---------35:46----------
addiction is a disease and like in my


---------35:48----------
day job I'm an addiction psychiatrist so


---------35:50----------
I get this but I think not holding


---------35:53----------
people who have addiction problems


---------35:55----------
accountable for their actions doesn't


---------35:59----------
actually help yeah and and the concern


---------36:02----------
that I have for you is that like I don't


---------36:04----------
think you can forgive her if you don't


---------36:06----------
admit that she did something wrong now


---------36:09----------
that's kind of interesting because maybe


---------36:11----------
she didn't do something wrong or maybe


---------36:13----------
you've already forgiven or maybe you


---------36:14----------
don't need to forgive her but generally


---------36:17----------
speaking when I hear a story like this I


---------36:19----------
think about something called Dharma


---------36:21----------
which means duty or responsibility and I


---------36:25----------
think that like the wave for this my


---------36:28----------
value system you don't have to agree


---------36:29----------
with this it's just something that I'd


---------36:31----------
like you to think about is that like


---------36:33----------
when you have a relationship where some


---------36:34----------
like you can love someone but actually


---------36:36----------
the way to move forward is to like look


---------36:39----------
at it like it is and say hey this really


---------36:43----------
sucks for me it really wasn't fair and I


---------36:47----------
forgive you for it because that's what


---------36:49----------
healing looks like it's not saying


---------36:51----------
nothing bad happened to you because


---------36:53----------
that's how you end up with gratitude for


---------36:55----------
watching a seven-year-old die of cancer


---------36:56----------
like sure there's gratitude there


---------36:58----------
there's an appreciation for life I get


---------37:00----------
all those things


---------37:01----------
I've watched seven-year-olds die of


---------37:02----------
cancer - and it's not pretty


---------37:04----------
yeah and at the same time it's given me


---------37:08----------
an appreciation for life and I'm


---------37:10----------
absolutely grateful for those


---------37:12----------
experiences because it helps you


---------37:14----------
understand the depth of suffering that's


---------37:15----------
possible in this world and it [ __ ]


---------37:19----------
sucks to go through and it's not fair


---------37:23----------
right and I felt guilty for having


---------37:26----------
health and that's not fair either it's


---------37:29----------
not my fault that I'm you know it's like


---------37:33----------
it's weird like I'm not cell I mean I


---------37:35----------
felt selfish - yeah and at the same time


---------37:39----------
how do you have my dogs it's okay


---------37:45----------
what is it like listening to me talk um


---------37:49----------
[Music]


---------37:51----------
sorry dogs


---------37:53----------
um I don't know I guess in a lot of ways


---------37:55----------
I always say that it's like I sorry my


---------37:59----------
dogs I have two beagles and they just


---------38:01----------
barked non-stop um do they need some


---------38:04----------
attention do they are they sensing a


---------38:06----------
disturbance in the force


---------38:09----------
getting them I think but I guess talking


---------38:13----------
to you is really helpful because I feel


---------38:15----------
like I've never really had like a parent


---------38:19----------
full guidance I guess like that's one of


---------38:21----------
the things that I really struggle with


---------38:22----------
is I feel like a lot of people are able


---------38:24----------
to talk to you know like my mom or their


---------38:27----------
dad about things and you know both of my


---------38:30----------
parents are like the last people I would


---------38:32----------
ever want to talk to sure yeah I mean I


---------38:36----------
I think that that makes a lot of sense


---------38:38----------
to me


---------38:38----------
and I think there are a couple of other


---------38:40----------
things to think about here which is that


---------38:42----------
oh man okay


---------38:43----------
so I'm glad so I'm happy to hear that


---------38:46----------
I'm happy to sort of fill somewhat of a


---------38:49----------
parental figure in your life I think I


---------38:54----------
do wanna let me just think about where


---------38:57----------
to take the con any thoughts that you


---------38:59----------
have or any questions or anything that


---------39:00----------
you want to kind of dig more into or


---------39:02----------
because I have a lot but


---------39:08----------
I don't know there are like just a lot


---------39:10----------
of different I feel like there's a lot


---------39:12----------
of different elements so I guess my


---------39:14----------
story that I feel like I need to dig


---------39:16----------
into okay um I guess one of the things


---------39:21----------
that I really still struggle with a lot


---------39:24----------
is just


---------39:26----------
trying to wrap my mind around all of the


---------39:31----------
really awful abuse and just how there


---------39:34----------
was like really no justice and like I


---------39:37----------
said like I feel like my family still


---------39:39----------
suffers with it actually did and it's


---------39:43----------
like he just got away with it and you


---------39:48----------
know it's like I doubt he thinks about


---------39:53----------
you know how it's affected my family


---------39:56----------
there's like a lot of anger there I


---------40:01----------
guess


---------40:06----------
imagine huh what is what happens in your


---------40:12----------
head when you think about him getting


---------40:14----------
away with it like he's left destruction


---------40:18----------
and ruin in his wake


---------40:19----------
and he gets to move on and you all are


---------40:23----------
left in a city of shambles it just feels


---------40:29----------
really unfair and unjust and


---------40:35----------
I gosh I don't want to get banned for


---------40:38----------
saying this but there were you know like


---------40:40----------
throughout the years where this went on


---------40:43----------
there were definitely times where I


---------40:44----------
would like talk to my sister and just be


---------40:46----------
like man I wish I could kill him not


---------40:48----------
that I ever would but you know of course


---------40:50----------
it's hard not to have those thoughts


---------40:52----------
whenever you just have somebody just


---------40:54----------
like relentlessly terrorizing your


---------40:58----------
family like


---------41:01----------
sure I think it's good that you didn't


---------41:04----------
give in to those thoughts right um


---------41:07----------
and I mean I never would but it was


---------41:10----------
something that sure I had you know there


---------41:15----------
was


---------41:18----------
you


---------41:21----------
it just was like everyday like I like I


---------41:26----------
like I said it was just like it went on


---------41:28----------
just like so much and it was just like


---------41:31----------
so regular like he would you know steal


---------41:34----------
money from my mom he stole my mom's car


---------41:37----------
he here's the time where he like made my


---------41:42----------
brother get in the trunk of a car and he


---------41:44----------
stabbed my mom think I was gonna kill


---------41:47----------
them he like drove for four hours and


---------41:51----------
made my brother get in the trunk of a


---------41:52----------
car and he stabbed my mom like three


---------41:55----------
times


---------41:57----------
um I don't know I just think about it


---------42:01----------
and I'm just like how did he get away


---------42:03----------
with it like how did nothing happened to


---------42:06----------
him and I know that it's it's because my


---------42:09----------
mom was too afraid to press charges or


---------42:13----------
anything but it was just there were


---------42:21----------
times where I would have to go over


---------42:23----------
there and he would usually like leave


---------42:27----------
around the time where like I showed up


---------42:30----------
he'd just like take off because he was


---------42:32----------
afraid I was gonna call the cops or


---------42:33----------
something I don't know


---------42:34----------
and my mom would just like beg me she'd


---------42:38----------
be like lady just stay here will you


---------42:41----------
just stay like if he sees you're here he


---------42:43----------
won't come he'll leave me alone and I


---------42:46----------
would just have to just stay over at my


---------42:49----------
mom's


---------42:53----------
just because I guess I'm just like some


---------42:55----------
sort of protection


---------43:05----------
what's it like to have that kind of


---------43:08----------
responsibility


---------43:11----------
whenever I look back at it now it seemed


---------43:15----------
whenever you look back at it now it


---------43:17----------
seems really scary but I remember them


---------43:19----------
not really being afraid I guess


---------43:32----------
Oh sounds unfair to me


---------43:43----------
how's that a lot on your shoulders


---------43:46----------
you


---------43:48----------
yeah


---------43:52----------
that's hard exhausting


---------43:58----------
superhuman even yeah


---------44:10----------
do you think of yourself as superhuman


---------44:14----------
I guess on a good day I go back what I


---------44:18----------
hear that I have moments where I feel I


---------44:21----------
guess like very strong and resilient but


---------44:25----------
then moments were not so much and what


---------44:29----------
do you feel in those moments like um


---------44:37----------
like I'm capable of dealing with


---------44:39----------
whatever's thrown my way I guess


---------44:44----------
like I can overcome anything


---------44:48----------
what do you feel in the moments where


---------44:50----------
you don't feel like that um really um I


---------44:58----------
guess because I have kind of had to be a


---------45:02----------
bit of a provider I'm in moments where I


---------45:06----------
don't feel like that like I just feel


---------45:08----------
like


---------45:10----------
like a complete failure like


---------45:15----------
you know like you said like I feel like


---------45:18----------
I do carry a lot in my shoulders and I


---------45:20----------
have


---------45:22----------
you know my mom and my younger brother


---------45:25----------
lived with me


---------45:31----------
like I feel stressed that I won't be


---------45:35----------
able to provide for them I guess


---------45:38----------
hmm like that's


---------45:42----------
Gary to me


---------45:45----------
yeah do you feel like you've let people


---------45:48----------
down um no


---------45:52----------
they don't really feel like that at all


---------45:55----------
I'm happy to hear that too


---------45:59----------
you know go ahead sorry I was just gonna


---------46:03----------
say like I think I do well I guess I'm


---------46:08----------
coping with things in some way but then


---------46:10----------
I just do kind of a really bad job in


---------46:12----------
other ways it's like I'm somewhat there


---------46:16----------
but I don't know like one of the things


---------46:21----------
that I always say and I didn't realize


---------46:25----------
like how wrong it was to say until I


---------46:28----------
would say like the past like five or six


---------46:31----------
months is


---------46:35----------
I always say that my mom raised me to


---------46:40----------
the best of her ability like she did the


---------46:46----------
best that she was capable of doing


---------46:50----------
and you know like I'm


---------46:55----------
grateful for that I guess and I haven't


---------46:58----------
realized until recently that that's just


---------47:00----------
like another kind of like cop-out excuse


---------47:04----------
that I kind of use


---------47:05----------
what are you excusing how are you


---------47:08----------
copying out like I don't want to say


---------47:13----------
that my mom was a bad mother but she I


---------47:17----------
see like I always say like she was the


---------47:20----------
best mother that she was capable of


---------47:22----------
being and she tried


---------47:25----------
in the ways that she could but you know


---------47:28----------
like I feel like if I'm I guess if I


---------47:31----------
were looking at it from an outside


---------47:32----------
perspective I would be like yeah that's


---------47:34----------
a pretty bad mom he said what does the


---------47:38----------
cop-out help is the cop-out that you're


---------47:40----------
not holding her responsible for yeah


---------47:42----------
yeah I would agree with that so I


---------47:47----------
actually had this precise scenario with


---------47:50----------
one of my first therapy patients where I


---------47:53----------
noticed that he said that his dad did


---------47:57----------
the best that he could yeah and then one


---------48:01----------
day I realized he never said that his


---------48:03----------
dad did a good job yeah so that he did


---------48:07----------
the best that it could yeah and I think


---------48:11----------
that there's some there's some middle


---------48:14----------
ground between understanding that she


---------48:20----------
did the best that she could and also


---------48:22----------
understanding that she didn't do a great


---------48:24----------
job and understanding that you can


---------48:28----------
forgive her because you love her and


---------48:31----------
also that like you deserved better yeah


---------48:36----------
right and I think this is the tricky


---------48:38----------
thing about the mind is that we try to


---------48:40----------
do things like it's like it's really


---------48:42----------
hard for us to not be either/or it's


---------48:44----------
like a or b it's like true/false no it's


---------48:47----------
not it's like it's free answer it's like


---------48:50----------
an essay question yeah right and and


---------48:54----------
what I'm really hearing from you and I


---------48:55----------
think what's important for you is to


---------48:57----------
really acknowledge like I mean you can


---------49:00----------
be grateful and you can be strong and


---------49:02----------
you can be all of these things but


---------49:03----------
they're also like the there's like the


---------49:05----------
underbelly to all this [ __ ] which is


---------49:07----------
Kaycee this is awful


---------49:09----------
this tire story is just it's it's bad


---------49:12----------
man and yeah and like I I'm not trying


---------49:18----------
to blame anyone I'm not blaming you I'm


---------49:19----------
just saying like objectively when I hear


---------49:21----------
this it's like you know any one of those


---------49:24----------
things is enough to really just destroy


---------49:28----------
someone watching a seven-year-old die of


---------49:31----------
cancer


---------49:31----------
that's enough having a mom who uses meth


---------49:35----------
that's


---------49:36----------
having an abusive stepdad that's enough


---------49:39----------
having a brother with autism that can be


---------49:42----------
really hard yeah right because like you


---------49:46----------
want so much for him in it and it can be


---------49:48----------
hard sometimes when people have autism


---------49:52----------
like caregivers really suffer because


---------49:54----------
you recognize that it can be hard for


---------49:59----------
him to be happy and that's really hard


---------50:00----------
to watch


---------50:02----------
yeah gosh I love you know like I love my


---------50:07----------
brother so much and I always tell him


---------50:10----------
that he's one of the strongest people I


---------50:13----------
know and it is really difficult to see


---------50:17----------
um you know how he has dealt with the


---------50:21----------
abuse as well because I don't know like


---------50:24----------
it's like my whole family has like like


---------50:27----------
my brother definitely has PTSD my mom


---------50:30----------
has PTSD I have PTSD like you guys ever


---------50:35----------
gotten treatment for it


---------50:37----------
no yeah that needs to happen at some


---------50:42----------
point yeah it's you know it's hard


---------50:45----------
because sure um you know like I do come


---------50:50----------
from like a low-income family and the


---------50:53----------
only time where my mom has been able to


---------50:56----------
get like any mental health care I guess


---------51:00----------
is whenever she hasn't been like earning


---------51:02----------
enough and it's like you know oh if you


---------51:04----------
make $12 an hour that's too much yeah


---------51:07----------
which is just a joke but you live in


---------51:10----------
that arrest yeah after we're done with


---------51:13----------
this caulk and um you know after we're


---------51:15----------
done with the stream like let me know


---------51:17----------
what state you're in and then I'd love


---------51:18----------
to have a conversation with you about


---------51:20----------
maybe had a game plan in terms of how to


---------51:24----------
get mental health treatment because I


---------51:26----------
think there's no doubt in my mind that


---------51:29----------
that would be very helpful for all of


---------51:30----------
you it's I don't know like I'm not


---------51:34----------
trying to say like it wouldn't it's just


---------51:36----------
really really difficult with my mom um


---------51:40----------
my mom is very I don't really know like


---------51:44----------
my mom


---------51:47----------
like I said she has really extreme


---------51:49----------
paranoia and she like literally thinks


---------51:53----------
that like everybody is an undercover cop


---------51:57----------
or spy she thinks that our house is


---------51:59----------
bugged


---------52:00----------
she thinks that like her phone is bugged


---------52:02----------
like if she were to go to a counselor so


---------52:05----------
there it was just like it's really hard


---------52:08----------
just I don't know she's one of those um


---------52:12----------
I think a lot of it has to do with like


---------52:14----------
all of the abuse and she'll still even


---------52:18----------
though it's been it's been like three


---------52:20----------
years she's still like acts like he's


---------52:24----------
out to get her like uh it's I don't know


---------52:30----------
it just like kind of puts another


---------52:32----------
obstacle with you know what about you


---------52:37----------
like as far as me getting late


---------52:43----------
I guess I've just always kind of like


---------52:48----------
had a hard time like


---------52:51----------
you


---------52:53----------
I don't know like I guess I it's hard


---------52:56----------
for me to talk to therapists because I


---------52:59----------
feel like there's just like with twitch


---------53:02----------
I feel like there's just this whole


---------53:03----------
element of my life that's like really


---------53:06----------
hard for them to kind of understand


---------53:09----------
yeah so okay let's talk about that for a


---------53:13----------
minute okay so the first thing is that


---------53:15----------
like you know what we're talking about


---------53:18----------
doesn't have much to do with twitch


---------53:20----------
right yeah and then the second thing is


---------53:24----------
is that that and but I get what you're


---------53:27----------
saying I don't want to invalidate what


---------53:29----------
you said because I think it's an


---------53:30----------
important statement I've heard this


---------53:31----------
story time and time and time again that


---------53:34----------
you know a lot of our community goes and


---------53:37----------
seeks mental health treatment and sure


---------53:38----------
like the you know a therapist can


---------53:41----------
understand you know growing up in an


---------53:44----------
abusive household but they can't


---------53:45----------
understand you and they absolutely need


---------53:48----------
to understand you they can't treat like


---------53:50----------
the PTSD in isolation because a good


---------53:53----------
therapist has to understand who you are


---------53:55----------
as a person and gaming culture streaming


---------53:58----------
culture twitch or a part of that so I


---------54:00----------
get what you're saying I don't think


---------54:01----------
that you can go there and just talk


---------54:03----------
about this and that's gonna actually be


---------54:05----------
effective as bizarre as that sounds what


---------54:07----------
I would encourage all of y'all to do


---------54:09----------
though is explain it to them yeah so as


---------54:13----------
a therapist there are all kinds of


---------54:15----------
things that I don't understand and at


---------54:19----------
the top of the list is I have some


---------54:20----------
clients who are women yeah I don't


---------54:24----------
understand what that's like I can't


---------54:25----------
understand that's like and if you work


---------54:29----------
with a therapist it's actually your


---------54:31----------
responsibility to try to get them to


---------54:33----------
understand and if they're a half-decent


---------54:35----------
therapist they'll do their best and one


---------54:38----------
of the most interesting things that you


---------54:40----------
can learn about this stuff is when you


---------54:43----------
start to explain streaming culture and


---------54:45----------
twitch and your life to them


---------54:47----------
you are gonna understand more about it


---------54:49----------
than you ever realized it can actually


---------54:51----------
be one of the most therapeutic things to


---------54:53----------
like explain to someone like what's


---------54:55----------
stressful about your job right teaching


---------54:58----------
is where you actually like really


---------55:00----------
solidify your understanding so I would


---------55:02----------
just strongly encourage you like I said


---------55:03----------
we can have a you know second


---------55:05----------
conversation about logistics and stuff


---------55:07----------
because I really do think Casey that you


---------55:09----------
you need like tried and true mental


---------55:10----------
health treatment and I know that a lot


---------55:12----------
of people think that this is mental


---------55:14----------
health treatment but it really isn't


---------55:15----------
it's night and day yeah um I don't know


---------55:20----------
like I said it earlier like I feel like


---------55:22----------
I'm


---------55:23----------
like at a point where I'm ready and I


---------55:25----------
feel like this is kind of just like you


---------55:27----------
like opening myself up to the idea you


---------55:31----------
know like I feel like this is kind of


---------55:32----------
like a take-off point I mean I do I


---------55:35----------
guess I do have some other things like I


---------55:38----------
I haven't mentioned this yet but my


---------55:45----------
marijuana use


---------55:47----------
um I guess a lot like um I'm a marijuana


---------55:52----------
user I and I actually do have a medical


---------55:55----------
license for it so I don't know like I


---------56:00----------
guess I do self-medicate um and I don't


---------56:04----------
think that marijuana is like a terrible


---------56:07----------
thing like honestly like I feel like in


---------56:08----------
a lot of ways that help it has helped me


---------56:10----------
a lot


---------56:11----------
um but I do acknowledge that I guess my


---------56:14----------
usage has gotten pretty bad like I


---------56:19----------
smoked too much um sure and I feel like


---------56:23----------
a lot of it has to do with anxiety like


---------56:26----------
I feel like when I struggle with the


---------56:27----------
most like from all of this is just


---------56:30----------
anxiety like I um feel Restless a lot


---------56:35----------
it's hard for me to sit down it's hard


---------56:38----------
for me to say you know like I just


---------56:40----------
constantly like have these wandering


---------56:42----------
thoughts


---------56:43----------
um I guess sometimes


---------56:50----------
I just get really really anxious about


---------56:53----------
something bad happening I guess like I


---------56:56----------
just get so anxious that something bad


---------56:59----------
is going to happen again you know to


---------57:01----------
just like bring me back to that or like


---------57:04----------
it could get like that again is what I


---------57:07----------
guess is one of my main fears


---------57:12----------
yeah so let me say something about that


---------57:16----------
so in my experience anxiety is a


---------57:18----------
chameleon yeah


---------57:20----------
actually sorry anxiety isn't a trauma is


---------57:23----------
a chameleon and it can look like all


---------57:25----------
kinds of other things it can look like


---------57:28----------
anxiety it can look like depression it


---------57:31----------
can look like substance use


---------57:34----------
but when you say I'm worried that


---------57:36----------
something bad is gonna happen again


---------57:38----------
that speaks to me more about trauma than


---------57:41----------
anxiety but I think generally speaking I


---------57:44----------
detest the term anxiety because people


---------57:46----------
use it as an umbrella term yeah it's


---------57:50----------
like you're afraid that something bad is


---------57:51----------
gonna happen again not because you have


---------57:54----------
an anxiety problem but because you live


---------57:56----------
in a world where real bad [ __ ] can


---------57:58----------
happen and so that's your brain telling


---------58:00----------
you hey this can happen so let's worry


---------58:05----------
about it because if we worry about it


---------58:07----------
then we can do something about it that


---------58:08----------
won't catch us off-guard


---------58:09----------
it's your brain trying to help you out


---------58:11----------
but that's I mean it sounds to me really


---------58:13----------
more like trauma and anxiety and there


---------58:14----------
may be anxiety in there I guess I've


---------58:17----------
never looked at it that way I guess you


---------58:20----------
know like like you said I don't know I


---------58:23----------
guess I really didn't know how to think


---------58:25----------
of what I was feeling and I guess what


---------58:28----------
made the most sense to me was anxieties


---------58:30----------
like I've never thought of it like I'm


---------58:33----------
you know like it's just trauma and I'm


---------58:36----------
scared of like reliving that I guess um


---------58:40----------
but I feel like sometimes like I'll just


---------58:44----------
be like you said like I'm constantly


---------58:46----------
kind of I don't know I guess preparing


---------58:49----------
myself for something like that like I


---------58:50----------
feel like a lot of times it can be kind


---------58:52----------
of hyper vigilant like there are just


---------58:55----------
certain things like I feel like I kind


---------58:57----------
of like the most recent thing um with


---------59:01----------
corona I was one of those people who


---------59:04----------
went out and stopped by because I was


---------59:06----------
just so afraid I was like I don't want


---------59:08----------
anything bad to happen to my family and


---------59:10----------
then I think you know just with the loss


---------59:17----------
to cancer and that just being so rare


---------59:20----------
you know it's so extremely rare that a


---------59:23----------
child dies of cancer like that it just


---------59:25----------
made it all the more real that my family


---------59:29----------
could be one of those people


---------59:31----------
oh yeah like I just feel like there's


---------59:33----------
certain like I I think that there's I


---------59:36----------
guess there's being like worried but I


---------59:38----------
feel like a lot of the time I see myself


---------59:40----------
like going the next step sure and and


---------59:45----------
that's because most people worry but the


---------59:50----------
next step is a hypothetical for them for


---------59:53----------
you unfortunately it's a reality yeah


---------59:58----------
and that's what trauma looks like so


---------60:02----------
hyper-vigilance is one of the main


---------60:05----------
diagnostic criteria for PTSD right it's


---------60:10----------
like the the plastic story that people


---------60:12----------
hear is like a war veteran who like you


---------60:16----------
know hears like a car muffler go offer


---------60:19----------
or something like that or a door slam


---------60:22----------
shot and they're like always on the


---------60:24----------
lookout and that's not they're not


---------60:26----------
mentally ill that's their brain training


---------60:30----------
them hey if this sound happens we need


---------60:33----------
to react first and think later


---------60:36----------
that's what trauma does to us right like


---------60:40----------
if I get bit by a snake


---------60:41----------
I'm gonna be paranoid about ropes that


---------60:44----------
look like snakes in dark rooms


---------60:49----------
and and what you're kind of describing I


---------60:52----------
mean like I think trauma is really like


---------60:53----------
it's the real trickster of mental health


---------60:55----------
because it can look like all kinds of


---------60:57----------
things it can look like paranoia it can


---------61:00----------
look like substance use it can look like


---------61:02----------
anxiety it can look like depression and


---------61:04----------
and this is where you know sometimes the


---------61:07----------
analogy that I use with people is like


---------61:09----------
me you can plant a seed and the seed


---------61:11----------
turns into a plant and then if I ask you


---------61:15----------
KC show me where the seed is in the


---------61:18----------
plant can you find it in the roots is


---------61:24----------
the seed in the roots I dig up the plant


---------61:25----------
I look at all the roots is there a seed


---------61:27----------
there um


---------61:31----------
I guess in the blossom it grew I don't


---------61:35----------
know the short answer is it isn't right


---------61:38----------
it used to look


---------61:39----------
it started in one way and then it turned


---------61:41----------
into something else although you can


---------61:44----------
also say that just because I can't find


---------61:46----------
the seed the plant is absolutely there


---------61:48----------
and without the seed it would have never


---------61:50----------
existed even though it looks completely


---------61:51----------
different so in your case something


---------61:56----------
happened to you where a seed was planted


---------61:58----------
and over a decade it has turned out to


---------62:01----------
look like something else yeah


---------62:04----------
but at the end of the day if you want to


---------62:06----------
go back and really free yourself of this


---------62:08----------
I think you got to go back to where it


---------62:10----------
started and there are a couple of things


---------62:11----------
here which we haven't even scratched the


---------62:13----------
surface of which I don't even know if


---------62:14----------
you've ever thought about yeah but I I


---------62:17----------
wonder long and hard about what you were


---------62:20----------
young


---------62:22----------
because you feel selfish for having


---------62:24----------
needs right yeah yeah and so like the


---------62:27----------
interesting thing is like that's not


---------62:30----------
because you're a good person in fact I


---------62:33----------
like it as like nothing - I mean sure


---------62:35----------
like you're a good person but generally


---------62:37----------
speaking people who feel like they're


---------62:40----------
selfish for having basic needs are


---------62:44----------
taught that it's selfish to have basic


---------62:48----------
needs


---------62:49----------
yeah we believe the things that we were


---------62:52----------
taught


---------62:53----------
Bret like our thoughts and our opinions


---------62:56----------
yeah god I was gonna say like I've been


---------62:59----------
thinking about this recently I don't


---------63:01----------
know I feel like it was never that


---------63:04----------
anybody like told me oh you can't have


---------63:07----------
this certain thing or you can't do this


---------63:09----------
certain thing I just remember being very


---------63:12----------
young and always just Casey like they


---------63:14----------
absolutely did but go ahead and say what


---------63:17----------
you're gonna say I was I just I guess I


---------63:21----------
just remembered being young and just


---------63:22----------
acknowledging that I was poor and my


---------63:24----------
family didn't have money for these


---------63:26----------
things so never asking yeah so I I that


---------63:30----------
I get but I think like you know if I had


---------63:34----------
to put my money down I think it's like


---------63:35----------
subtle things so like how old how old


---------63:38----------
were you when your mom started using


---------63:40----------
meth um for five I guess my dad was my


---------63:49----------
dad was in and out of prison most of my


---------63:52----------
life whenever I was younger and they


---------63:56----------
both my parents started using Ashley I


---------63:59----------
was probably more like three homes so


---------64:02----------
let me just ask you a question we're not


---------64:04----------
gonna talk about you we're gonna talk


---------64:05----------
about a three-year-old yeah okay so what


---------64:09----------
does a three-year-old do when they're


---------64:10----------
hungry cry true food sure sometimes they


---------64:15----------
cry but even before that I asked for


---------64:20----------
food absolutely right you go up to mommy


---------64:23----------
and you say mommy I'm hungry can I have


---------64:25----------
something to eat and when you have a


---------64:27----------
parent who has substance use how do they


---------64:31----------
respond to that request um I don't know


---------64:39----------
I guess I just remember my mom being


---------64:41----------
[Music]


---------64:43----------
ah I did I my grandparents were really


---------64:48----------
involved but I remember like during this


---------64:50----------
time whenever I was very young just like


---------64:52----------
my mom being incapacitated I guess you


---------64:57----------
know like you know having the highs and


---------65:01----------
then the lows where she would just like


---------65:03----------
be asleep for days mm-hmm and I remember


---------65:06----------
like I guess been very young and just


---------65:09----------
like saving my mom asleep and being like


---------65:11----------
well she's not gonna wake up


---------65:16----------
yeah did you ever feel like you were


---------65:19----------
bothering her yeah definitely right so


---------65:23----------
like what is bothering me


---------65:25----------
it means hating absolutely hey I'm a


---------65:30----------
[ __ ] three-year-old and I'm hungry


---------65:32----------
and oh [ __ ] I'm sorry to bother you mom


---------65:35----------
but can I have some food because that's


---------65:37----------
how she made you feel because that's


---------65:40----------
like that's what a three-year-old thinks


---------65:41----------
it's like oh I don't want like they just


---------65:43----------
understand like so you get taught like


---------65:45----------
at the age of three that your needs


---------65:49----------
inconvenience other people and then you


---------65:53----------
feel selfish for needing stuff and it's


---------65:58----------
like baked so deep down man it's like


---------66:02----------
why are like like literally I want you


---------66:04----------
to think about this Casey a


---------66:06----------
three-year-olds brain is building it's


---------66:10----------
like it has an architecture and deep


---------66:13----------
into the architecture of the way that


---------66:15----------
your neurons is the idea that I am not


---------66:18----------
allowed to have needs yeah and I guess


---------66:23----------
that's something that's kind of just


---------66:25----------
echoed throughout my whole life


---------66:29----------
I guess yeah and that's because you were


---------66:32----------
wired that way right like that's why


---------66:38----------
they echo through your life because like


---------66:40----------
literally this is not it's not


---------66:41----------
psychological it's like neurological and


---------66:44----------
so now like everything sort of makes


---------66:47----------
sense oh yeah I watch the seven-year-old


---------66:48----------
died of cancer and I'm grateful and I


---------66:50----------
feel selfish like what the [ __ ] because


---------66:54----------
that's the way you learned how to think


---------66:57----------
about things right like you learned like


---------67:01----------
so the three-year-old isn't allowed to


---------67:03----------
have needs the 21 year old isn't allowed


---------67:06----------
to have needs the 25 year old isn't


---------67:08----------
allowed to have needs because your mom


---------67:10----------
is using math and your brother has


---------67:11----------
autism


---------67:12----------
there's no room and like we got this


---------67:14----------
like 30 minutes in right you talk about


---------67:17----------
the impact to everyone else


---------67:19----------
where are you you don't deserve a place


---------67:22----------
in your own story


---------67:24----------
yeah there's no space for you even now


---------67:29----------
when we talk about what are you worried


---------67:31----------
about it has nothing to do with yourself


---------67:32----------
it's like what if I can't support my


---------67:34----------
family there's no room for you and and


---------67:42----------
like you know when it comes back to like


---------67:44----------
blame and being angry at your mom and


---------67:46----------
stuff like that like in order for you to


---------67:48----------
be angry at your mom you have to be a


---------67:49----------
part of the equation there's no room for


---------67:51----------
that there's only she did the best that


---------67:54----------
she could and let's give her a pass


---------67:56----------
we're just fine like I think it's good I


---------67:57----------
you know I don't in the sense like I


---------67:59----------
think you know people who suffer from


---------68:00----------
addiction they have a disease - unclear


---------68:03----------
what her upbringing was like she should


---------68:05----------
get some slack we should be


---------68:06----------
compassionate and you should be a part


---------68:08----------
of the equation I guess I'm just like I


---------68:13----------
don't even know how to yeah I don't know


---------68:17----------
it's just like I just don't even know


---------68:18----------
how to start yeah


---------68:21----------
because in that - is like not your fault


---------68:24----------
because I would just think about this


---------68:25----------
like like you're like a three-year-old


---------68:27----------
and I'm gonna let me know if I'm making


---------68:29----------
you feel like an [ __ ] or bad okay so


---------68:31----------
like I just want you to think about a


---------68:33----------
three-year-old who like was never taught


---------68:35----------
language and then they find themselves


---------68:37----------
at 25 and they're like I don't know how


---------68:39----------
to learn language and you're damn right


---------68:42----------
you weren't taught like this stuff gets


---------68:44----------
taught really really really early and it


---------68:47----------
gets taught completely subconsciously


---------68:49----------
parents don't try to teach it it's just


---------68:51----------
how kids learn like kids just learn


---------68:53----------
stuff that has never taught to them


---------68:58----------
right and my kid has been doing this


---------69:00----------
thing recently where she'll come up to


---------69:01----------
me and she'll go like this and like I


---------69:04----------
didn't teach her how to do that I didn't


---------69:06----------
be like okay hold up your hand like a


---------69:07----------
claw and trying to scare me like she


---------69:08----------
just picks that up they just pick it up


---------69:10----------
and and unfortunately Casey it's gonna


---------69:14----------
be a long road and it's gonna be


---------69:17----------
confusing it's almost more like rehab


---------69:20----------
like not like drug rehab but like like


---------69:23----------
it's like you have to rehabilitate like


---------69:25----------
some of your emotional centers and your


---------69:27----------
sense of self hey you can I know I don't


---------69:35----------
know like sometimes I just feel myself


---------69:36----------
like even like just doubting my own


---------69:41----------
emotions I guess yeah I don't know like


---------69:44----------
it's yeah of course because you've been


---------69:48----------
pushing them aside your entire life


---------69:50----------
right like how did you do that when you


---------69:54----------
were 21 you don't think you could do


---------69:56----------
that again yeah because like your


---------69:57----------
survival mechanism is to like discount


---------70:01----------
and invalidate your emotions and it's a


---------70:03----------
damn good win and I'm glad you did it


---------70:04----------
because I think that's why your family


---------70:06----------
is still in the position that it's in if


---------70:08----------
it weren't for you I can't imagine what


---------70:10----------
would have happened to your brother yeah


---------70:12----------
and so now the question here's the real


---------70:15----------
thing and I don't know I don't think you


---------70:17----------
know how to do this but can you be you


---------70:19----------
for yourself I don't know I guess it's


---------70:24----------
just hard to even know what that looks


---------70:27----------
like


---------70:28----------
absolutely cuz it's [ __ ] weird Yeah


---------70:31----------
right like can you protect yourself can


---------70:37----------
you look out for yourself like it's hard


---------70:38----------
I don't even know like in your case I


---------70:41----------
don't even know where to start like I


---------70:45----------
don't know I mean I I see I see what


---------70:47----------
needs to happen I'm not quite sure where


---------70:50----------
to begin but I think we've already begun


---------70:52----------
it's it's kind of the acknowledgement


---------70:54----------
and understanding that like you know you


---------70:56----------
don't have in


---------71:01----------
hierarchy of what you care about


---------71:05----------
you're myself yeah lower yeah beautiful


---------71:10----------
right so that's how it starts you finish


---------71:13----------
the sentence that I start and once


---------71:16----------
you're able to do that that means you


---------71:18----------
understand right and we're not saying


---------71:22----------
and I'm not advocating that you should


---------71:23----------
be number one and I don't think you're


---------71:25----------
the kind of person that can ever be


---------71:26----------
number one in new life but can't we yeah


---------71:30----------
I was I don't know like I was thinking


---------71:34----------
about it yesterday and I feel like


---------71:35----------
that's just what I am like that's what


---------71:38----------
I'm used to being I'm used to being a


---------71:39----------
provider a protector sure you know it's


---------71:42----------
like it's hard to it's hard to think of


---------71:46----------
myself being a different way I guess or


---------71:49----------
I guess like putting those guards down


---------71:51----------
and not being that for my family scares


---------71:54----------
me yeah so oddly enough I don't think


---------71:57----------
that that's what you have to do so I'm


---------71:59----------
not saying cuz I think you are a


---------72:01----------
provider I think you are a protector I


---------72:02----------
think you have a duty or the odd amount


---------72:04----------
of responsibility to your family and I


---------72:07----------
think abandoning that would destroy you


---------72:09----------
as a person that's what's kept you alive


---------72:11----------
and so if people are curious about


---------72:13----------
Dharma this is what Dharma looks like


---------72:15----------
how are you able to survive all of this


---------72:17----------
terrible stuff it's because of your duty


---------72:19----------
responsibilities to your family what I'm


---------72:22----------
asking for is can you can you stick


---------72:24----------
yourself in the top ten it's not even


---------72:27----------
top five top ten


---------72:28----------
so there's mom there's brother maybe a


---------72:31----------
romantic relationship to beagles can you


---------72:34----------
give yourself number six or number seven


---------72:37----------
yeah I guess so like I said it's just


---------72:42----------
like hard to know like what that looks


---------72:44----------
like like what are the small steps that


---------72:45----------
I can take to do that okay great


---------72:49----------
question I just don't even know how so


---------72:52----------
they're like I'll do things like I feel


---------72:53----------
like in a lot of ways like I'll spoil


---------72:55----------
myself a lot like I'll go shopping and


---------72:58----------
you know before your your dogs protest


---------73:05----------
yeah I guess so


---------73:09----------
you know like I'll take myself shopping


---------73:12----------
or get my hair done or whatever but I


---------73:14----------
guess just all material things


---------73:17----------
uh-huh um I guess I just don't know how


---------73:20----------
to aside from materialistically I guess


---------73:23----------
I'm sure yeah absolutely I think it's


---------73:26----------
trickier


---------73:27----------
I think conversations like this are


---------73:31----------
actually like a big step forward right


---------73:34----------
so giving your space the giving yourself


---------73:37----------
the time and space to think about


---------73:39----------
yourself because I don't even know if


---------73:41----------
you let yourself do that right I'm


---------73:48----------
having a dryer delivered so I'm sorry no


---------73:55----------
I was saying that conversations like


---------73:57----------
this are a great place to start I'm just


---------74:09----------
used to barking all the time do that the


---------74:14----------
only thing you used to hold on


---------74:31----------
you


---------74:45----------
okay


---------74:59----------
sorry no I'm sorry what were you saying


---------75:02----------
I was saying that I think conversations


---------75:06----------
like this are a good first step because


---------75:08----------
like you're giving yourself space and


---------75:10----------
time to think about yourself right like


---------75:13----------
you're doing something like you're doing


---------75:15----------
this like who are you doing this for


---------75:17----------
myself


---------75:19----------
is this materialistic no okay so that's


---------75:24----------
a step in the right direction right


---------75:25----------
because what we're saying is you need to


---------75:26----------
do things for yourself that are not


---------75:28----------
materialistic so great good job


---------75:30----------
you've done it high five yeah I think


---------75:35----------
the next thing that I would really


---------75:36----------
really encourage you to do is is get


---------75:38----------
really think about getting some kind of


---------75:41----------
treatment or therapy and how do you feel


---------75:44----------
about that I don't like I I have I have


---------75:50----------
seen a psychiatrist but I guess I


---------75:55----------
haven't really like explored that aside


---------75:57----------
from getting prescribes like I was


---------75:59----------
prescribed adderall for my ADHD and then


---------76:03----------
I also prescribed xanax which I don't


---------76:05----------
really like to take um I don't know like


---------76:09----------
I don't really I don't really feel like


---------76:12----------
I need to be medicated which I guess


---------76:15----------
isn't the point of therapy right yep the


---------76:18----------
exact opposite I don't know I I feel


---------76:23----------
like I could definitely benefit from it


---------76:26----------
I just I guess it's just fear of maybe


---------76:30----------
not like what if I don't


---------76:32----------
yeah yeah so that that's that's what we


---------76:35----------
got to kind of tackle head-on right


---------76:37----------
because the issue here is that like what


---------76:40----------
if you don't but like this is the thing


---------76:42----------
you only let yourself do it if it's


---------76:44----------
gonna work because you know you're not


---------76:47----------
worth trying things for


---------76:51----------
see that like you can only do it if it's


---------76:53----------
gonna help like if there was something


---------76:55----------
that could help your brother you do it


---------76:58----------
but if there's something that could help


---------77:00----------
you that's not good enough it's not


---------77:02----------
worth your time your energy your


---------77:04----------
resources if it could help which is fine


---------77:08----------
like if something could help your mom


---------77:09----------
get all four it could help your dogs


---------77:11----------
your all four it could help your brother


---------77:13----------
your all four it could help you not good


---------77:15----------
enough yeah and so that's what I would


---------77:18----------
encourage you to really tackle and think


---------77:20----------
through and just give yourself a space


---------77:21----------
to work on yourself and then you'll


---------77:28----------
you'll figure enough like I'm not


---------77:31----------
worrying about you Casey bizarrely


---------77:34----------
really yeah


---------77:40----------
I think I feel kind of relieved now I


---------77:44----------
guess


---------77:48----------
like just in talking about it all and


---------77:53----------
I feel like kind of I guess getting like


---------77:55----------
a positive response not that I was


---------77:58----------
expecting like anything bad I just I


---------78:01----------
don't know yeah I'm glad you feel that


---------78:06----------
can I tell you why I'm not worried about


---------78:08----------
you I mean I shouldn't but I'm not what


---------78:12----------
I feel is not worried


---------78:14----------
I feel optimism and here's the reason so


---------78:18----------
what games do you play by the way do you


---------78:20----------
play games um I've been mostly playing


---------78:23----------
team fight tactics okay so I'm not too


---------78:27----------
familiar League of Legends but so like


---------78:30----------
here's the thing like let's say you're


---------78:31----------
playing team fight um yeah I can't I


---------78:33----------
don't have a good analogy there so I'm


---------78:35----------
just gonna make that point um so like


---------78:37----------
here's the thing like you were dealt a


---------78:38----------
pretty shitty hand in life and yet ended


---------78:40----------
up okay yeah right


---------78:43----------
and so like I'm Way more optimistic like


---------78:47----------
what worries me and one is when people


---------78:49----------
are given a great hand in life and they


---------78:52----------
end up in a bad place because I think


---------78:55----------
like in your case you just need to you


---------78:57----------
just need like a little bit of support


---------78:59----------
and a little bit of tools and like


---------79:02----------
you're gonna you're gonna fly because if


---------79:05----------
you can get through what you've gotten


---------79:07----------
through and be the person that you are


---------79:09----------
today boy it's like it's like you're you


---------79:12----------
know you're playing a competitive game


---------79:14----------
with a potato PC on satellite internet


---------79:17----------
and you're still crushing news and it's


---------79:19----------
like if we give you an actual computer


---------79:21----------
and take the lag off it's gonna be


---------79:24----------
terrifying what you're capable of


---------79:26----------
because that's what I see and and if you


---------79:30----------
can just help yourself out a little bit


---------79:32----------
like it's gonna be ridiculous because


---------79:34----------
you're you've been playing life with a


---------79:36----------
[ __ ] handicap this whole time and so


---------79:40----------
what makes me optimistic is like if we


---------79:41----------
take off the handicap like people are


---------79:44----------
going to start whining and they're gonna


---------79:47----------
be asking the devs for a patch because


---------79:49----------
you're crushing them so hard yeah sorry


---------79:54----------
I just like I always just go back like I


---------79:57----------
don't know whenever you said that like I


---------79:59----------
just always go back to like my life


---------80:01----------
wasn't that bad yes you know like we've


---------80:04----------
been talking about this whole time it's


---------80:07----------
just like such a I don't know it's like


---------80:10----------
a defense mechanism type thing yet


---------80:14----------
defense mechanism type thing I think


---------80:16----------
that relates to the idea that like you


---------80:18----------
having needs or selfish like you just


---------80:21----------
discount yourself your life wasn't that


---------80:24----------
bad okay fine I mean so I I'm I think


---------80:28----------
it's this is the other thing is how do


---------80:30----------
you move forward you notice that right


---------80:32----------
like it's really really a huge support I


---------80:35----------
cannot overemphasize how important the


---------80:38----------
statement that you just made us and you


---------80:39----------
just have to trust me on that


---------80:41----------
just act acknowledge it to see it yeah


---------80:45----------
right because this is you're saying how


---------80:46----------
do I change my mind


---------80:48----------
you start by understanding what the [ __ ]


---------80:50----------
is going on in there that's you opening


---------80:53----------
the hood of your car and that's what


---------80:55----------
makes me optimistic because you can


---------80:56----------
notice oh there it is again like there's


---------80:58----------
that pattern that pops up right and like


---------81:02----------
if you want to know how to get rid of


---------81:03----------
that pattern or change the pattern the


---------81:05----------
first thing that you have to do is see


---------81:06----------
its action yeah you have to notice that


---------81:10----------
then you can start to change it but


---------81:12----------
noticing is where things start I'm able


---------81:16----------
to notice it I guess but yeah like the


---------81:19----------
changing it part was just like a whole


---------81:21----------
other thing because I'm just like how do


---------81:22----------
I even I guess like you were saying


---------81:25----------
earlier it's what did you say it's more


---------81:29----------
like a cycle of its neural logical than


---------81:33----------
psychological like it's like a like just


---------81:36----------
like some circuit in my brain that's


---------81:38----------
formed yeah like so like how do I it's


---------81:43----------
like I have to retrain my brain Casey


---------81:46----------
Casey okay great now I'm excited okay


---------81:49----------
and apologies if that's inappropriate


---------81:51----------
because let me tell you let me tell you


---------81:53----------
so this is cool so this is why I like


---------81:54----------
neuroscience so I'm gonna say something


---------81:56----------
that is gonna hopefully blow your mind


---------81:59----------
I find it mind-blowing the way that you


---------82:01----------
change your note neurons is actually


---------82:04----------
noticing there is overwhelming


---------82:06----------
scientific evidence that changing your


---------82:08----------
brain does not require intention it


---------82:11----------
requires attention literally to


---------82:17----------
attention is what causes neuronal


---------82:19----------
plasticity


---------82:20----------
city and frontal lobe development that


---------82:23----------
is the mechanism through which


---------82:24----------
meditation works so we have overwhelming


---------82:27----------
evidence that meditation changes your


---------82:29----------
brain like we know that I've actually


---------82:32----------
started meditation recently I've started


---------82:38----------
doing meditation recently like actually


---------82:40----------
just like this past like a couple of


---------82:43----------
weeks I would say cool that's good for


---------82:47----------
you I'm gonna get to that in a second


---------82:48----------
but I'm an academic and when I get to


---------82:50----------
talk about something that I know I like


---------82:53----------
to keep going forward can I keep plowing


---------82:55----------
so I want to just say that like


---------82:57----------
literally so Casey you're wondering how


---------82:59----------
do I change what I'm telling you


---------83:00----------
actually don't need to like literally


---------83:02----------
what what studies of meditation show


---------83:04----------
because in meditation no one is trying


---------83:06----------
to change anything they're just


---------83:07----------
observing themselves and what we see is


---------83:10----------
that observing yourself actually rewires


---------83:12----------
your brain they don't have to try to


---------83:15----------
change anything


---------83:16----------
and that's why meditation works so well


---------83:18----------
because it doesn't sort of matter what


---------83:20----------
your problem is it doesn't matter who


---------83:22----------
you are and just noticing it is


---------83:24----------
sufficient for change and if you kind of


---------83:27----------
think about it like you can see that


---------83:29----------
principle in other places because like


---------83:31----------
you know sometimes you'll be like oh why


---------83:33----------
do I do this and then you'll have like


---------83:34----------
this light bulb go off and you're like


---------83:35----------
oh that's why I do it and then you stop


---------83:37----------
doing it I never realised


---------83:40----------
dot-dot-dot that drinking water makes me


---------83:43----------
feel good and then like one day people


---------83:45----------
wake up and they're like oh I realized


---------83:46----------
that drinking water is good for me and


---------83:48----------
then I started drinking water and then


---------83:49----------
you ask people like how did you start


---------83:51----------
drinking one they're like I don't know I


---------83:51----------
just sort of realized it one day it's


---------83:54----------
weird


---------83:54----------
does that make sense like you ever just


---------83:56----------
like realize something and then sort of


---------83:58----------
like started doing it yeah but I guess I


---------84:02----------
just like it just made me think like how


---------84:04----------
I've kind of like came to this realize


---------84:06----------
realization that I you know set my


---------84:12----------
feelings aside a lot or I don't allow


---------84:15----------
myself to acknowledge my own feelings


---------84:16----------
and I feel like I have came to the


---------84:19----------
realization


---------84:21----------
and maybe it's not changing that much or


---------84:24----------
maybe it is and it's just changing very


---------84:26----------
slowly okay Casey so let me ask you a


---------84:28----------
question


---------84:29----------
do you think coming when did you come to


---------84:31----------
that realization um I would I


---------84:34----------
I think it's been fairly recent like I


---------84:37----------
would say six months okay so do you


---------84:40----------
think that has anything to do with you


---------84:42----------
coming on stream today


---------84:46----------
um yeah so that's how change happens so


---------84:52----------
you have one realization and that allows


---------84:55----------
you to take the next step which then


---------84:57----------
allows you to take the next step and


---------84:58----------
you're looking at the top of Mount


---------85:00----------
Everest and you're saying each step that


---------85:02----------
I take does it seem to be moving me


---------85:05----------
towards my destination because I have


---------85:07----------
30,000 feet to climb and I have now


---------85:09----------
moved up two inches doesn't seem to be


---------85:13----------
making a difference but that's literally


---------85:14----------
how change happens yeah one step at time


---------85:17----------
it's the only way to do it and so just


---------85:21----------
keep going on the path that you're on


---------85:22----------
and you will be amazed at where you end


---------85:25----------
up only way it can happen can't rush it


---------85:28----------
there's no magic bullet


---------85:29----------
there's certainly in a pill you're


---------85:32----------
saying how do I take care of yourself


---------85:33----------
like you realize something six months


---------85:35----------
ago


---------85:35----------
why did you realize that six months ago


---------85:37----------
because you spent the time thinking


---------85:39----------
about yourself which ten years ago or


---------85:41----------
eight years ago or seven years ago you


---------85:43----------
did not even give yourself the space in


---------85:45----------
your mind to think about yourself that's


---------85:48----------
a huge step then you have a realization


---------85:50----------
then you come on stream then we have a


---------85:52----------
conversation then you decide oh maybe I


---------85:54----------
shouldn't do therapy but like six years


---------85:56----------
ago you're like ah I'm not worth it


---------85:59----------
tiny tiny steps a house is built one


---------86:04----------
brick at a time and no brick makes the


---------86:07----------
house it's weird yeah like if I lay two


---------86:13----------
bricks am i building a house yeah really


---------86:19----------
cuz I just see two bricks where's the


---------86:21----------
house show me I don't know I guess


---------86:23----------
you're so I was just thinking you're


---------86:24----------
starting to build a house where I'm just


---------86:27----------
like so anxious like my mind's racing


---------86:30----------
it's okay sorry about that you see but


---------86:32----------
your your answer is actually the right


---------86:34----------
answer because it's the wrong answer I'm


---------86:36----------
sorry I'm freaking you out


---------86:37----------
but like because it's exactly right is


---------86:40----------
it the house sure you're starting but


---------86:41----------
it's not the house yet it sort of is and


---------86:43----------
it's sort of isn't and that's what your


---------86:44----------
growth is gonna be like yeah yeah sorry


---------86:49----------
I asked people questions and sometimes


---------86:51----------
it makes them feel self-conscious it's


---------86:52----------
that way no I just


---------86:58----------
like I said I just like I'm I'm happy


---------87:03----------
like I feel like I'm having like a lot


---------87:05----------
of realizations and stuff that you have


---------87:07----------
said you know that made sense to me and


---------87:11----------
it's just like it's it's you know like


---------87:13----------
you've just said like a few things that


---------87:15----------
have really I don't know I guess kind of


---------87:17----------
dropped a bomb on me I guess and it's


---------87:19----------
just like trying to process it all at


---------87:21----------
once right like I've been trying to


---------87:24----------
write down notes and stuff but yeah I


---------87:29----------
understand that they're good yeah yeah


---------87:32----------
so I I am yeah I can I can see that it's


---------87:35----------
overwhelming and I'm not sure if I


---------87:38----------
should say I'm sorry or you're welcome


---------87:47----------
no it's been really helpful can you just


---------87:51----------
help me understand what has been like


---------87:55----------
what you realized um I guess you know


---------88:01----------
like I said I kind of been coming to


---------88:04----------
this realization that I um you know set


---------88:08----------
aside my own feelings and needs a lot in


---------88:11----------
you know like I have a lot of self-doubt


---------88:14----------
and just hearing it from somebody else


---------88:15----------
is like okay you know it kind of makes


---------88:19----------
it more real like oh maybe I wasn't just


---------88:21----------
thinking this maybe it's true like you


---------88:24----------
know um yeah certainly sounds true to me


---------88:33----------
yeah so so actually that's it right so


---------88:36----------
there you did it you did it yeah you


---------88:39----------
validated you validated your feelings


---------88:41----------
just then I just realized that that's


---------88:43----------
pretty cool you see that I don't know if


---------88:45----------
that makes sense it's kind of abstract


---------88:46----------
but yeah like just in that


---------88:48----------
acknowledgement that sometimes you don't


---------88:51----------
acknowledge yourself you're


---------88:53----------
acknowledging yourself yeah it's weird


---------88:56----------
it's kind of like inception but anyway


---------88:58----------
oh yes I see what you're saying yeah see


---------89:02----------
you did it and you're like how do I


---------89:03----------
change in the short answer is I don't


---------89:04----------
know but just keep doing what you're


---------89:06----------
doing


---------89:06----------
I think you'll you'll be good yeah do


---------89:10----------
you have questions for me Casey


---------89:13----------
um


---------89:17----------
I guess one of the other things that I


---------89:21----------
wanted I don't know like I talked about


---------89:26----------
my marijuana use and sometimes like my


---------89:28----------
chat can just get cuz I do smoke too


---------89:31----------
much like and I guess I acknowledge that


---------89:34----------
I need to cut back but I'm like do I


---------89:37----------
have an addiction problem you know like


---------89:41----------
I do like both of my parents have


---------89:44----------
addiction issues I'm like as I don't


---------89:47----------
know I don't know but then it's really


---------89:49----------
easy for me to just be like oh marijuana


---------89:52----------
isn't a big deal he's you know like I'm


---------89:55----------
I grew up around marijuana in my whole


---------89:58----------
life like my mom smoked marijuana in


---------90:00----------
front of me my whole life and did way


---------90:02----------
worse [ __ ] and I guess like I feel like


---------90:05----------
to some degree like oh if the worst


---------90:06----------
thing that I do is smoke weed you know


---------90:09----------
like it's pretty good for me considering


---------90:11----------
um but I don't know like I guess I don't


---------90:18----------
want to cuz you know you don't know like


---------90:20----------
the full thing I guess but do you think


---------90:23----------
that I have an issue with addiction to


---------90:27----------
marijuana I know that sounds so stupid


---------90:30----------
but like sometimes like I don't know if


---------90:32----------
they're joking or C's deep do you think


---------90:34----------
you have an issue with marijuana I don't


---------90:39----------
know like I think I smoke too much but I


---------90:41----------
just don't even think that it's that bad


---------90:43----------
okay so I think I can get behind that


---------90:46----------
so do I think you have an issue with


---------90:48----------
marijuana yes because you think you have


---------90:51----------
an issue with marijuana yeah you think


---------90:54----------
you have an issue with marijuana it's


---------90:56----------
just not a very big issue that's what


---------90:58----------
I'm hearing from you is that a fair


---------90:59----------
representation I can get behind that


---------91:01----------
yeah so here's what I'll say about


---------91:04----------
marijuana and substances in general okay


---------91:07----------
yeah so I think that like you said you


---------91:09----------
kind of you it sounds like you have


---------91:11----------
medical marijuana and that a lot of


---------91:13----------
people self medicate and I do I think


---------91:15----------
that that's a problem


---------91:16----------
absolutely but I think that nodding back


---------91:20----------
is not a solution it's a consequence


---------91:26----------
and if you want to cut back on your


---------91:28----------
marijuana use you have to deal with the


---------91:30----------
reasons why you reach for it in the


---------91:32----------
first place so if there's one thing that


---------91:35----------
I've understand understood as an


---------91:37----------
addiction psychiatrist it's that telling


---------91:39----------
someone to stop drinking alcohol is not


---------91:42----------
enough you have to get to why they drink


---------91:44----------
alcohol in the first place and in your


---------91:47----------
case I think that you should reduce your


---------91:49----------
marijuana consumption absolutely even


---------91:52----------
try without smoking for like six months


---------91:55----------
and just see what that does to your


---------91:57----------
brain because I think you're gonna be


---------91:58----------
surprised yeah and but that starts with


---------92:02----------
like recognizing that the reason that


---------92:04----------
you smoke is because all the [ __ ] that


---------92:06----------
we're talking about to begin with the


---------92:09----------
anxiety which has really which started


---------92:12----------
as the seed of trauma which grew into


---------92:13----------
the plant of anxiety in which you don't


---------92:15----------
really see the the seed there anymore


---------92:18----------
and so you got to deal with all that


---------92:20----------
crap because like as long as that stuff


---------92:22----------
is going on you said I don't know how I


---------92:24----------
survived the way that you survived us


---------92:26----------
through coping mechanisms yeah and that


---------92:29----------
includes things like marijuana yeah I


---------92:33----------
guess I never I never even started


---------92:36----------
smoking marijuana until 2014 I was one


---------92:42----------
of those people I was always really


---------92:46----------
really afraid I never drank I never did


---------92:48----------
drugs because you know I saw what it did


---------92:51----------
to my parents nose genuinely afraid of


---------92:55----------
it and my sister was always kind of more


---------92:58----------
of the black sheep I guess of the family


---------93:01----------
and she um you know one night we were


---------93:04----------
hanging out and she was just you know


---------93:07----------
she got really excited because I was


---------93:09----------
like I want to try it and I tried it and


---------93:11----------
I just remember during that time I was


---------93:15----------
you know it was really terrible time and


---------93:19----------
I just remember like whenever I smoked


---------93:21----------
it being like the first time where I was


---------93:23----------
like happy and giggly and you know like


---------93:27----------
in a while and I guess maybe that's why


---------93:30----------
I've like really taken to it so much


---------93:32----------
because like you said it was a coping


---------93:36----------
mechanism during that time yeah so I


---------93:39----------
thought


---------93:41----------
yes right oh go ahead so so Casey that


---------93:45----------
makes a lot of sense to me and that's


---------93:47----------
what I tend to hear right and so the


---------93:50----------
solution there is not to just stop the


---------93:54----------
marijuana and let the awfulness of life


---------93:56----------
come rushing back the solution there is


---------93:59----------
to learn how to be happy and giggly


---------94:01----------
without it because then you won't need


---------94:03----------
it anymore


---------94:03----------
yeah and I think that there is a real


---------94:06----------
problem where people start to become


---------94:08----------
that becomes their source of happy


---------94:13----------
giggly and then it's like that doesn't


---------94:16----------
sound healthy to me at all like I think


---------94:18----------
what I really advocate for is for people


---------94:20----------
to like you know process your emotions


---------94:22----------
deal with your anger blame your parents


---------94:25----------
what have you and then get past that


---------94:28----------
stuff and then like be able to enjoy


---------94:30----------
life for what life has to offer because


---------94:32----------
life is really amazing it's really awful


---------94:35----------
and it's really amazing and that those


---------94:38----------
two don't have to be mutually exclusive


---------94:40----------
and I would love it I think the real


---------94:42----------
solution that I want for you is to live


---------94:45----------
a life where you don't need marijuana to


---------94:47----------
be happy and giggly yeah I guess the


---------94:53----------
idea of getting like I don't know the


---------94:55----------
idea is like not doing marijuana


---------94:57----------
completely I just I'm gonna be honest


---------94:59----------
they don't like like a you don't like it


---------95:02----------
I enjoy smoking you know like is it bad


---------95:08----------
to think like oh I never want to not


---------95:10----------
like I never bro I don't know course not


---------95:15----------
it's completely good it's an ordinary


---------95:17----------
box it's an understandable fire how like


---------95:21----------
how do you know like I guess it's just


---------95:23----------
in my everything in moderation type


---------95:26----------
thing and I guess I know that I'm not


---------95:28----------
moderating it very well right now how do


---------95:31----------
I that sounds like a proper reading it


---------95:33----------
well okay how do you know that you're


---------95:35----------
not moderating it well


---------95:37----------
cuz I smoke too much but how do you know


---------95:40----------
that you're asking me how do I know when


---------95:42----------
it's an okay man I'm actually I actually


---------95:45----------
don't I'm actually prescribed Casey no


---------95:48----------
there's no no no none of that [ __ ]


---------95:50----------
matters let me your answers in your


---------95:53----------
question you said how do I know when


---------95:54----------
it's okay and then my question to you is


---------95:56----------
my answer is the same way that you know


---------95:58----------
it's not okay cuz you know it's not okay


---------96:00----------
we've heard you say it's not okay like a


---------96:02----------
thousand times so whatever that sense of


---------96:04----------
you tells you hey this is okay that's


---------96:07----------
when you'll know it's okay yeah you know


---------96:11----------
and how much you've been prescribed has


---------96:14----------
nothing to do with whether it's an okay


---------96:15----------
amount or not if you want to talk about


---------96:19----------
a [ __ ] cop out I don't think you


---------96:21----------
copped out until this moment this is a


---------96:23----------
cop out


---------96:24----------
yeah and I don't think you have to give


---------96:27----------
it up today I'm not asking you to give


---------96:29----------
it up today I'm saying that I think in


---------96:31----------
my experience I think it's worth and


---------96:34----------
even that I didn't say give it up


---------96:35----------
forever I'd say take a break from it for


---------96:38----------
a couple months and what I said is see


---------96:40----------
how you feel now if you have trouble


---------96:43----------
doing that then that also is concerning


---------96:47----------
right like if I want to say like hey I


---------96:49----------
want to take a break for a meet for a


---------96:51----------
couple of months like I think it's


---------96:52----------
important to be able to try things in


---------96:55----------
your life to see if they're gonna help


---------96:57----------
you feel better and if your life is


---------96:58----------
better not asking you to make a


---------97:00----------
commitment but hey I mean you're asking


---------97:02----------
me do I think you have a problem and the


---------97:04----------
answer is damn right I think you have a


---------97:05----------
problem and what do I base that on it's


---------97:07----------
because you think you have a problem and


---------97:08----------
you know what way more about you than I


---------97:11----------
do like I I mean I just met you like an


---------97:13----------
hour ago


---------97:14----------
what the [ __ ] do I know I guess I guess


---------97:17----------
I can acknowledge I have like I said


---------97:20----------
like I acknowledge that I've been


---------97:21----------
smoking way too much and I can


---------97:24----------
acknowledge that I have a problem I just


---------97:26----------
I guess I'm just like I don't really


---------97:27----------
care to do anything about it and I I


---------97:31----------
don't know like I I guess I'm just like


---------97:36----------
ah


---------97:38----------
so that's how that's fine Casey I don't


---------97:42----------
think you should do anything about it


---------97:43----------
right now yeah like like so so here's


---------97:48----------
what I want you to just notice for a


---------97:49----------
second okay that you have a compass and


---------97:52----------
this compass is telling you hey this is


---------97:54----------
a problem but I can't deal with this


---------97:56----------
[ __ ] right now that's what I'm hearing


---------97:59----------
your compass tell you is that accurate


---------98:02----------
yeah okay I can get behind that a


---------98:05----------
hundred percent so I can say sure this


---------98:08----------
is a problem and you have bigger fish to


---------98:10----------
fry because by the way you have bigger


---------98:13----------
fish to fry you've lived a life in an


---------98:17----------
abusive household with an [ __ ]


---------98:19----------
stepfather and a mother who suffered for


---------98:21----------
substance use and you've learned how to


---------98:23----------
invalidate yourself that's what we've


---------98:25----------
been talking about and that's what I


---------98:27----------
think you should focus on


---------98:28----------
I think the marijuana is gonna be a


---------98:30----------
piece of that down the road


---------98:32----------
but I think it is completely idiotic to


---------98:35----------
ask you to like cut back or I mean I


---------98:38----------
guess you could we can ask you to try to


---------98:40----------
cut back and see how that goes but I


---------98:42----------
don't think it's reasonable for you to


---------98:44----------
stop because like I said earlier the


---------98:45----------
real solution to substance use is to not


---------98:50----------
need the ship to begin with and that's


---------98:52----------
where the real healing happens I don't


---------98:54----------
think that forcing yourself to stop


---------98:56----------
smoking pot and then having a life


---------98:58----------
that's miserable every day is like


---------99:00----------
that's not the goal that doesn't sound


---------99:02----------
good to me the way that I get people off


---------99:05----------
of substances is by helping them build a


---------99:08----------
life where they don't need them and then


---------99:10----------
if you want to use it go for it but you


---------99:13----------
shouldn't be dependent on it that I just


---------99:15----------
personally as a value system I don't


---------99:17----------
like being dependent on something I


---------99:19----------
don't like being in control of my life


---------99:21----------
and I don't like I want to help people


---------99:25----------
be in [ __ ] control of your life make


---------99:26----------
a choice don't make it a dependency


---------99:28----------
don't make it a necessity make it a


---------99:31----------
choice and that's what I would advocate


---------99:34----------
for you and then once you are in a place


---------99:38----------
where you can make a choice then you


---------99:39----------
make the choice and it's your choice to


---------99:42----------
make and I'm a judge you for it other


---------99:45----------
people may judge you for it but like let


---------99:47----------
it be your free choice without a


---------99:49----------
psychological dependence without a


---------99:51----------
neurological dependent


---------99:53----------
be free to choose what you want to do


---------99:56----------
with your life whether that be marijuana


---------99:58----------
marriage having kids living alone


---------100:01----------
traveling whatever live the life that


---------100:03----------
you want to live and give yourself the


---------100:06----------
benefit of choice yeah oh this this


---------100:12----------
really has been really helpful like I


---------100:15----------
said like I feel like this is you know


---------100:17----------
kind of like a starting off point for me


---------100:20----------
and I don't know like I'm scared to get


---------100:28----------
into therapy but I guess I'm ready for


---------100:31----------
it


---------100:33----------
you should be scared but I don't know


---------100:37----------
like I guess I'm kind of like what does


---------100:38----------
therapy even like look like for someone


---------100:41----------
like me like in the position that I'm in


---------100:44----------
like if I did like go that route like


---------100:46----------
what does that route like entail um like


---------100:51----------
how often am I gonna have to go like how


---------100:54----------
are you how often you get a chance to go


---------100:56----------
you're not happy you don't have to go at


---------100:58----------
all right so that even gives us a clue


---------101:01----------
as to what's in your head you're


---------101:02----------
thinking about a commitment you're not


---------101:04----------
laying a break you're building a house


---------101:05----------
what I'm asking you to do kc is lay one


---------101:08----------
brick go to one session lay a capo give


---------101:13----------
it like I'd give it like a month or two


---------101:15----------
and then what do you do I'm not even


---------101:20----------
sure I have no [ __ ] idea yeah


---------101:22----------
honestly I don't because when I do


---------101:24----------
therapy with someone like I don't have a


---------101:25----------
preconceived notion of like the whole


---------101:27----------
point is that it takes time to figure


---------101:29----------
out what someone needs it's gonna take


---------101:31----------
time for you to figure out what you need


---------101:32----------
but my sense is that it's gonna be a


---------101:35----------
place so here's what I think would be


---------101:37----------
helpful about it here's the only


---------101:39----------
treatment benefit that I can really see


---------101:41----------
right now it's gonna be the one place in


---------101:44----------
your life where you are at the top of


---------101:46----------
the list for one hour guaranteed no one


---------101:50----------
else is at the top of the list except


---------101:52----------
for you for one hour of your life every


---------101:55----------
week which is not that much and I think


---------101:57----------
you can open you can buy yourself one


---------101:59----------
hour week because the therapist is gonna


---------102:01----------
do their job which is putting you at the


---------102:02----------
top of the list and you're asking


---------102:05----------
yourself you're asking me how do I put


---------102:07----------
myself on the list well you go to


---------102:09----------
therapy so they you see how someone else


---------102:12----------
does it for you and then you learn how


---------102:14----------
to do it yourself


---------102:15----------
it's just like learning anything else


---------102:17----------
like how do my kids learn how to butter


---------102:20----------
bread it's like I'm like okay this is


---------102:22----------
how you butter bread so for one hour a


---------102:24----------
week you're gonna go to a place where


---------102:25----------
you're gonna come first and then you're


---------102:28----------
gonna see how they do it and cuz you're


---------102:29----------
[ __ ] smart you're gonna learn how to


---------102:31----------
do it just by watching because that's


---------102:34----------
how we learn yeah


---------102:43----------
what are you what are you thinking um I


---------102:48----------
don't know like I guess I I feel really


---------102:51----------
positive right now


---------102:57----------
I just I over all feel really positive


---------103:01----------
like I feel like this has been really


---------103:03----------
helpful to me I feel like in some ways


---------103:08----------
you kind of like


---------103:10----------
I guess like gave me confirmation of


---------103:14----------
something that I already knew but I just


---------103:15----------
needed to hear from somebody else um but


---------103:22----------
yeah I don't know I'm excited I guess


---------103:27----------
cool I'm happy to hear that do you have


---------103:30----------
any of the darker feelings concern fear


---------103:35----------
[Music]


---------103:36----------
um yeah I guess I have concern and fear


---------103:40----------
but like I've I feel like it'll be okay


---------103:45----------
so I'm not super worried about those


---------103:48----------
great that sounds very very healthy to


---------103:51----------
me yeah I would be concerned if you're


---------103:54----------
all sunshine and rainbows yeah because I


---------103:58----------
think that you should be afraid you


---------103:59----------
should be concerned you should be


---------104:01----------
worried that this may not work out that


---------104:03----------
you may not be able to do it that it may


---------104:05----------
not be helpful that you may be


---------104:07----------
unsolvable and that your problems are so


---------104:10----------
bad that nothing will ever help most of


---------104:12----------
good feelings to have yeah and just let


---------104:14----------
them have their space and you don't have


---------104:17----------
to be controlled by them


---------104:24----------
you


---------104:26----------
yeah


---------104:33----------
okay so any last thoughts questions um


---------104:41----------
not really that I can think of now like


---------104:44----------
I feel like I have a lot to think about


---------104:46----------
you know um I'm ready to just kind of


---------104:52----------
take it all in you know yeah so the last


---------104:55----------
thing that I'll say is that sometimes I


---------104:57----------
teach people how to meditate on stream I


---------105:00----------
think this is another yeah I I guess


---------105:04----------
that's like I said I started meditating


---------105:06----------
or trying to meditate recently and I


---------105:08----------
have to say like at first it just feels


---------105:11----------
really dumb like I feel really dumb


---------105:13----------
doing it or trying to do it you know


---------105:16----------
uh-huh and and when you say at first so


---------105:19----------
are you over that hump are you still in


---------105:21----------
that I filled I'm doing it huh


---------105:25----------
um I may be in between like sometimes I


---------105:30----------
feel less dumb than other times is it


---------105:32----------
normal to feel that way


---------105:34----------
solely by the way that never really goes


---------105:36----------
away I still sometimes feel dumb when I


---------105:38----------
meditate it's just part of it that's


---------105:39----------
actually part of the process is feeling


---------105:42----------
dumb and it that's actually why I think


---------105:46----------
meditation is so good because you know


---------105:49----------
when you get used to feeling dumb your


---------105:51----------
life gets a lot easier when you let


---------105:53----------
yourself feel incompetent and you're


---------105:56----------
okay with feeling into competent and you


---------105:58----------
don't let the incompetence restrict what


---------106:02----------
you do and you can go and you can sit


---------106:05----------
with yourself being dumb and you can let


---------106:07----------
yourself being dumb world becomes a


---------106:09----------
completely different place yeah yeah do


---------106:14----------
you can you tell me a little bit about


---------106:16----------
how you meditate or do you want to learn


---------106:17----------
a different technique today um are you


---------106:20----------
white I guess I've been like there's a


---------106:25----------
few different things that I've tried to


---------106:27----------
do right because there's no right way to


---------106:29----------
do it I guess like I've been listening


---------106:31----------
to a few different podcasts and stuff


---------106:34----------
about it and one of the ideas that I


---------106:37----------
liked was just trying to put yourself


---------106:42----------
like in a mindset or space where there


---------106:46----------
is limitless doubt or you know there is


---------106:53----------
no doubt and I really liked that thought


---------106:57----------
just like trying to you know think about


---------107:00----------
how my life would be like if I didn't


---------107:02----------
doubt myself hmm um this one's really


---------107:08----------
dumb but one of the other things that


---------107:10----------
I'll do is I'll just try to think of a


---------107:16----------
word like


---------107:17----------
[Music]


---------107:19----------
um


---------107:20----------
[Music]


---------107:22----------
I don't know like I'll just think of a


---------107:24----------
word like um emotion and all just like


---------107:26----------
repeatedly say it in my head and tell it


---------107:29----------
feels like it doesn't have a meaning


---------107:31----------
anymore does that sound stupid no that's


---------107:34----------
actually called Java but is a Sun


---------107:37----------
there's a Sanskrit word for them there's


---------107:40----------
a sense of it practice a meditative


---------107:42----------
practice that you have discovered all by


---------107:44----------
your lonesome okay so it's the very


---------107:48----------
opposite of stupid it's actually


---------107:50----------
brilliant weird huh yeah how do you feel


---------108:00----------
when I say that I don't know I was just


---------108:03----------
laughing it's kind of in a I don't know


---------108:05----------
if it's inappropriate to say but I had


---------108:07----------
that I I mic reduced a little bit of


---------108:11----------
mushrooms like a couple of weeks ago and


---------108:13----------
that's whenever I had that kind of


---------108:15----------
moment sure that uh that's also


---------108:19----------
completely makes sense because


---------108:21----------
meditative practices are developed yeah


---------108:24----------
by people who were in a different state


---------108:27----------
of consciousness and mushrooms MDMA


---------108:31----------
psilocybin or ways that people can sort


---------108:33----------
of like you know take the fast lane to


---------108:37----------
some of those spaces the problem is you


---------108:39----------
don't really know what you're getting


---------108:40----------
when you do that yeah yeah so do you


---------108:49----------
want to learn something today or you


---------108:50----------
feel cuz I I think especially after like


---------108:52----------
sessions like this I I don't think or


---------108:55----------
streams like this that I don't think


---------108:56----------
that you necessarily need to meditate


---------108:58----------
sometimes it's just good to sit alone


---------108:59----------
with your thoughts but if you want to


---------109:01----------
learn something I can teach you


---------109:02----------
something both into learning to


---------109:06----------
something okay so then sit up straight


---------109:08----------
okay okay so good so you're looking at


---------109:15----------
me is this yeah okay good so when you


---------109:18----------
look at so we're gonna have a little


---------109:20----------
conversation I'm gonna ask you a couple


---------109:21----------
of questions then I'm gonna ask you to


---------109:23----------
close your eyes and do some other stuff


---------109:24----------
okay so like let's start with this so


---------109:28----------
Kasey something's wrong with you right


---------109:30----------
yeah yeah right so like let's just think


---------109:33----------
about like what are some of the things


---------109:35----------

---------109:36----------
to like talk about I'm just saying let's


---------109:38----------
just acknowledge or notice like what are


---------109:40----------
some of the things that are wrong with


---------109:40----------
you um trauma sure good um I guess maybe


---------109:50----------
sense of self value great


---------109:56----------
anxiety sure


---------110:03----------
um I don't know okay great that's good


---------110:07----------
for yourself right yeah yeah yeah no no


---------110:10----------
that's perfect okay so now once you sit


---------110:12----------
up straight back straight is your back


---------110:15----------

---------110:17----------
sit up straight close your eyes I want


---------110:21----------

---------110:22----------

---------110:30----------

---------110:32----------

---------110:34----------

---------110:37----------
this in your lap yeah face up looks like


---------110:42----------

---------110:50----------

---------110:53----------

---------110:55----------
and now I want you to find so just let's


---------111:01----------

so just focus on your breath feel it


---------111:30----------
coming into your chest and out y'all can


---------111:36----------

---------111:37----------
so think about some things that are


---------111:38----------
wrong with you


---------111:41----------
okay good


---------111:45----------
head straight your spine should be


---------111:48----------
straight yeah no straight floor sit and


---------111:53----------
feel the discomfort no hunching okay


---------111:58----------
return to your breath


---------112:05----------
if your breath is hard to hold on to


---------112:07----------
focus on the sensations in your hands


---------112:11----------
feel the weight of one hand on the other


---------112:17----------
feel the sensation of this skin-on-skin


---------112:25----------
your thumb tips together and feel your


---------112:28----------
thumbs touching each other


---------112:33----------
you


---------112:35----------
and now in this place Casey find your


---------112:40----------
trauma where is it


---------112:49----------
you


---------113:04----------
and now we're gonna move on so we're not


---------113:07----------
gonna get lost in it now look for your


---------113:11----------
invalidation of self can you find that


---------113:20----------
that Tommy


---------113:25----------
you


---------113:27----------
um I don't know like I just like I guess


---------113:30----------
I just see it and like a lot of


---------113:31----------
different aspects of my life like ah


---------113:34----------
okay invalidate you know like my


---------113:41----------
mourning process I guess like I


---------113:43----------
invalidate okay okay okay okay so pause


---------113:46----------
for a second head up straight spine


---------113:48----------
straight good now


---------113:50----------
eyes closed good okay so those are


---------113:57----------
thoughts


---------113:59----------
those are recollections of the


---------114:01----------
invalidation in this moment tell me


---------114:06----------
where the invalidation exists within you


---------114:12----------
I guess I don't know my mind does it


---------114:17----------
exist because your mind thinks about the


---------114:20----------
past I'm asking you in the now where is


---------114:24----------
the invalidation


---------114:32----------
brat through the nose head up straight


---------114:36----------
good deep breath in and out and look for


---------114:40----------
it in this moment try to find it try to


---------114:44----------
pick it up you can focus on your hands


---------114:50----------
focus on your breath find the


---------114:51----------
invalidation


---------114:54----------
feel the person that you are right now


---------114:56----------
feel your weight in the chair feel the


---------115:01----------
tears on your cheeks


---------115:05----------
tension in your body breathe in expand


---------115:11----------
and relax


---------115:17----------
okay


---------115:20----------
now let your shoulders go ahead and take


---------115:22----------
a deep breath but don't move your


---------115:24----------
shoulders


---------115:31----------
and then they fly a profess okay good so


---------115:38----------
now I'm gonna ask you where is the


---------115:39----------
invalidation


---------115:45----------
um


---------115:54----------
I don't know I guess


---------116:07----------
I don't know I guess I don't understand


---------116:12----------
like can you rephrase no I'm not gonna


---------116:15----------
rephrase so I think the problem is that


---------116:17----------
I'm asking a question to which I think


---------116:19----------
you have the answer but I don't think


---------116:21----------
you think you have the answer so I think


---------116:25----------
the reason that you can't find it is


---------116:27----------
because it's not really there because


---------116:32----------
you can find the invalidation when you


---------116:35----------
think about the past and when you think


---------116:37----------
about the ways that you treat yourself


---------116:38----------
but when you stop in you're still in


---------116:42----------
you're in this moment it actually


---------116:44----------
doesn't exist it's a trick question


---------116:47----------
okay and the fact that you can't come up


---------116:51----------
with an answer I am so glad you didn't


---------116:53----------
come up with some [ __ ] answer


---------116:54----------
because it's it's hard when you're on


---------116:56----------
stream to like not come up with the


---------116:58----------
right answer but if you stop and look in


---------117:00----------
yourself like could you find it now so


---------117:07----------
just think about that for a second that


---------117:12----------
whenever you invalidate yourself you


---------117:14----------
have within you the capacity to enter a


---------117:18----------
state of being where that invalidation


---------117:21----------
no longer exists


---------117:24----------
you do it every morning in your routine


---------117:27----------
fine but if you can do what you just did


---------117:31----------
if you can put yourself in that same


---------117:33----------
state in your morning routine it won't


---------117:35----------
be able to exist there either


---------117:39----------
invalidation comes from the mind yeah


---------117:45----------
and it's the looking that you do that's


---------117:48----------
not actually mental activity that's


---------117:50----------
consciousness it's attention its


---------117:52----------
attention without thought


---------117:55----------
and if you can go there I don't know if


---------117:57----------
this is making sense or not but I think


---------117:58----------
right because if you ask me can i


---------118:00----------
rephrase that actually means you're


---------118:02----------
doing it right because you're looking


---------118:03----------
for an answer and you're not able to


---------118:05----------
find one and that's actually the answer


---------118:06----------
there's no such thing as invalidation so


---------118:09----------
now my last question for you is I don't


---------118:11----------
know if you remember this but when you


---------118:13----------
think about the person that you were


---------118:14----------
let's say 90 seconds ago what was wrong


---------118:18----------
with you


---------118:24----------
like whenever I was thinking about when


---------118:30----------
you were breathing and feeling the tears


---------118:32----------
go down your face yeah what was wrong


---------118:34----------
with you


---------118:42----------
um I guess I was just thinking a lot


---------118:44----------
about whenever Ricky passed away okay


---------118:52----------
tens I'm gonna jump in I'm gonna


---------118:54----------
interrupt you okay so that too once


---------118:57----------
again is thinking that's not actually


---------118:59----------
you those are thoughts


---------119:00----------
stay with me okay this is gonna be her


---------119:02----------
Nana so I want you to close your eyes


---------119:05----------
and focus fully on the sensation there's


---------119:08----------
a tear going down your right cheek in


---------119:10----------
this moment if we're lucky the fly's


---------119:13----------
gonna come back and he's gonna land on


---------119:15----------
your face yeah if he does I don't want


---------119:18----------
you to move him there he is right on


---------119:19----------
time he's coming coming for you okay


---------119:23----------
we'll see if he helps out he's really


---------119:25----------
here to help and I want you to just


---------119:28----------
focus on the sensation of wetness on


---------119:30----------
your face


---------119:36----------
what's wrong with you right now and I'm


---------119:38----------
not talking about thoughts I'm not


---------119:41----------
talking I'm talking about in this moment


---------119:43----------
if this is all you knew of your entire


---------119:46----------
life what would you know about this


---------119:47----------
person if you were this thing all for


---------119:52----------
every day for the rest of your life what


---------119:54----------
would be wrong with you I'm not talking


---------119:57----------
about the past I'm not talking about the


---------119:58----------
future I'm not talking about your


---------119:59----------
worries I'm not talking about you


---------120:01----------
failing to support your family I'm


---------120:03----------
talking about this thing that you are


---------120:05----------
right now what is this who are you and


---------120:07----------
what's wrong with it


---------120:19----------
not focusing on feelings at all okay


---------120:23----------
what are you focusing on I don't know


---------120:28----------
like I guess


---------120:35----------
can I focus on feelings because I just


---------120:37----------
like feel like I don't know like I guess


---------120:42----------
I just feel kind of heartbroken okay


---------120:46----------
anyway good okay so Casey this is what


---------120:49----------
you've got to do good job there no see


---------120:53----------
you screwed it up again let's see if he


---------120:56----------
comes back it's coming for you okay all


---------121:00----------
right


---------121:00----------
so yeah that's actually a really


---------121:03----------
interesting meditation technique so you


---------121:07----------
know a lot of people don't know this but


---------121:08----------
you know like sometimes Indian people


---------121:09----------
have a doc on their forehead you know


---------121:13----------
I've seen that before you know why did I


---------121:15----------
do that is it for the fly


---------121:18----------
actually honestly sort of yeah you're


---------121:25----------
you're damn right it's what I'm gonna


---------121:26----------
say so interestingly enough it's to


---------121:29----------
bring your attention of your mind to a


---------121:32----------
physical sensation on your forehead it's


---------121:34----------
to focus the attention of your mind it's


---------121:36----------
basically putting an artificial fly on


---------121:39----------
one spot in your forehead yeah I [ __ ]


---------121:42----------
you not meditation is so hard it's very


---------121:45----------
hard it's so hard so the only thing


---------121:50----------
that's hard about it is if you beat


---------121:51----------
yourself up for not doing it right


---------121:53----------
because what you did was great so what


---------121:55----------
I'm hearing from you is that when you


---------121:57----------
meditate and this happens with people


---------121:58----------
with trauma stuff is humming up and then


---------122:03----------
what happens the reason you call


---------122:04----------
meditation apart is because you think


---------122:05----------
you should do something instead of let


---------122:08----------
that stuff come up but just let it come


---------122:10----------
up feel heartbroken for a little while


---------122:12----------
and then let yourself not feel that way


---------122:14----------
return to your breath return to tears


---------122:17----------
you know grab a fly go stand in the Sun


---------122:20----------
I don't know where you live I don't know


---------122:23----------
how hot it is feel the Sun on your face


---------122:25----------
put your feet in water


---------122:29----------
drink something cold take something cold


---------122:32----------
and put it around the back of your neck


---------122:34----------
take something warm and put it around


---------122:35----------
the back of your neck when you meditate


---------122:38----------
Casey it's gonna take you a long time to


---------122:40----------
meditate right but that's not wrong you


---------122:44----------
have to you're just need to let this


---------122:45----------
[ __ ] out and then eventually you'll come


---------122:47----------
to a place and I think you got there a


---------122:49----------
little bit today but I what I'm getting


---------122:51----------
from you is that like anytime you stop


---------122:53----------
the defense mechanisms of your mind the


---------122:55----------
heartbreak arises and what I want you


---------123:00----------
what I want you to envision is like what


---------123:02----------
happens when a bubble reaches the


---------123:03----------
surface


---------123:08----------
I don't know pops absolutely so right


---------123:13----------
now you have all of these bubbles within


---------123:16----------
you and you just need to let them come


---------123:18----------
to the surface and they'll pop and


---------123:19----------
disappear and then you'll be left with


---------123:21----------
still water because right now your water


---------123:23----------
is not still its roiling with lots and


---------123:27----------
lots of bubbles and movement and


---------123:29----------
agitation it's gonna come up a little


---------123:31----------
bit at a time a little bit of time at a


---------123:33----------
little bit at a time and as much as you


---------123:36----------
can let your son let it come up but also


---------123:40----------
for the love of God do not beat the [ __ ]


---------123:42----------
out of yourself for not being able to


---------123:44----------
meditate properly because you're you


---------123:46----------
can't meditate properly and that's the


---------123:48----------
way it's supposed to be for you right


---------123:50----------
now okay


---------123:52----------
you'll meditate properly like you can't


---------123:55----------
force what happens if I have a bubble


---------123:57----------
underwater that's slowly coming up and I


---------124:00----------
stick my hand in and try to get rid of


---------124:01----------
it what happens to it it goes back down


---------124:07----------
yeah right like if I'm gonna create more


---------124:09----------
bubbles if I stick my hand in like how


---------124:11----------
do I get water to be still if I have


---------124:15----------
waves in my bathtub and I go and I


---------124:17----------
select try to force the waves down with


---------124:18----------
my hands what's gonna happen it's just


---------124:22----------
gonna cause more waves absolutely so


---------124:24----------
when you say you can't meditate right


---------124:26----------
the solution is not to try harder it's


---------124:29----------
to try less okay just let yourself sit


---------124:33----------
let that [ __ ] come up and it's not


---------124:35----------
endless this is the loan and this is the


---------124:39----------
debt you have an emotional debt that


---------124:41----------
you've been racking up for years which


---------124:44----------
was absolutely necessary and it's got to


---------124:46----------
come up a little bit at a time sorry I


---------124:50----------
know you were feeling good and then we


---------124:51----------
started meditating now we're back to


---------124:52----------
square one yeah it's just God like


---------124:58----------
it's at the right answer that's the


---------125:03----------
right answer


---------125:03----------
that's awareness that's why I'm


---------125:05----------
optimistic because sure it hurts but not


---------125:09----------
forever when you say God there's a lot


---------125:15----------
that's right because so much during


---------125:19----------
today I don't know how to say this Casey


---------125:22----------
but for so much of today you have said


---------125:24----------
the exact opposite yeah you have not


---------125:27----------
acknowledged how much there is


---------125:29----------
you have invalidated and you say how do


---------125:31----------
I learn how to validate I don't know how


---------125:33----------
the [ __ ] you did that but you just did


---------125:35----------
it god there's a lot that's absolutely


---------125:38----------
right I guess I'm just like oh I'm like


---------125:43----------
afraid I'm like is it too much


---------125:46----------
absolutely it's just like when I'm ready


---------125:48----------
to talk about it it's just like


---------125:50----------
waterworks like I just can't help it is


---------125:53----------
it too much for a single conversation


---------125:56----------
absolutely but you've been taking loans


---------126:03----------
for how old are you now 28


---------126:10----------
you've been taking loans for at least 25


---------126:13----------
years and you haven't been making


---------126:14----------
payments and when that's the way that


---------126:17----------
you live your life it can feel like the


---------126:19----------
debt is insurmountable but the second


---------126:21----------
you start making payments it turns


---------126:24----------
completely around and I think if you


---------126:26----------
give yourself honestly it's gonna take a


---------126:29----------
couple of years for you to be like


---------126:31----------
completely like kind of in a good place


---------126:32----------
like I'd say like give yourself two


---------126:36----------
years yeah but I think by the time you


---------126:39----------
turn 30 you could be you could feel like


---------126:41----------
a completely different person I tell you


---------126:43----------
Casey I've worked with people who have


---------126:45----------
had trauma on the order of magnitude


---------126:47----------
that you have and whether you call that


---------126:49----------
a lot or whether you call that a little


---------126:51----------
live what I mean is that I work with


---------126:53----------
people who have grown up in substance


---------126:54----------
use abusive households and it is amazing


---------126:59----------
if you just take care of yourself a


---------127:00----------
little bit because so far you haven't


---------127:01----------
taken care of yourself at all


---------127:07----------
and if you if you give yourself the


---------127:09----------
chance you'll be amazed at what you're


---------127:10----------
capable of yeah sorry to leave you in


---------127:15----------
shambles I feel like it's just gonna be


---------127:21----------
kind of a reality for me for a while


---------127:23----------
right you're damn right of this but


---------127:25----------
that's the important statement


---------127:27----------
beautifully said it's going to be the


---------127:29----------
reality for me for a while yeah cuz it


---------127:33----------
is but I can I can tell you from the


---------127:35----------
bottom of my heart not forever not


---------127:39----------
forever enough for today I think yeah


---------127:48----------
sorry I knew I was gonna get really


---------127:53----------
emotional so I consider the problem I


---------127:57----------
think it's just enough time I don't


---------127:59----------
blame you for saying it I'm just saying


---------128:00----------
like we got a parcel it out right we're


---------128:02----------
not gonna wipe out your debt in one day


---------128:04----------
right go do something fun what are you


---------128:07----------
gonna do today


---------128:08----------
I'm probably gonna go outside do some


---------128:13----------
yard work with my dogs


---------128:15----------
perfect just try to relax a little that


---------128:18----------
is absolute mastery big but I don't


---------128:21----------
think you know I think that that's a


---------128:23----------
good idea


---------128:23----------
do you want to know what I do after a


---------128:25----------
stream like this I go pull weeds really


---------128:29----------
I Drive around for like 32 yard work so


---------128:33----------
yeah I seriously what I do is I Drive


---------128:35----------
around for 30 minutes and then I in the


---------128:37----------
evening around like 6 or 7 p.m. I go


---------128:38----------
outside with my kids and like I said I


---------128:40----------
literally like they run around and I


---------128:42----------
pull weeds it is the best thing you


---------128:44----------
could possibly do be with your dogs yard


---------128:48----------
