---------00:00----------
you learned the very important lesson


---------00:01----------
that emotions are a [ __ ] waste of


---------00:03----------
time and that they just need to be


---------00:07----------
removed in whatever way they can


---------00:19----------
hey man how are you pretty good how are


---------00:22----------
you done good um


---------00:24----------
so I'm not quite sure what we're talking


---------00:26----------
about today but I understand that both


---------00:28----------
of our communities wanted us to speak


---------00:30----------
yeah I think so I do a lot of philosophy


---------00:34----------
politics and then I talk a lot about


---------00:35----------
like life and life related things so I


---------00:36----------
think they just thought there'd be some


---------00:38----------
kind of crossover so yeah so I think I


---------00:40----------
talk about a lot of things that maybe I


---------00:43----------
don't talk about philosophy or politics


---------00:44----------
but I do talk about life so I try to


---------00:47----------
help people understand themselves and


---------00:50----------
their minds and sort of help people


---------00:54----------
that's why I started streaming on Twitch


---------00:55----------
because I think that there's a the


---------00:59----------
mental health challenges and people's


---------01:01----------
understanding of themselves is like


---------01:03----------
becoming a real problem like in the


---------01:04----------
United States there's some very


---------01:05----------
disturbing epidemiologic data about


---------01:08----------
mental health so mental health


---------01:10----------
now causes more I think greater


---------01:13----------
morbidity in mortality than


---------01:15----------
cardiovascular disease and cancer


---------01:17----------
suicide rate has gone up by 50% I think


---------01:20----------
in teenagers over the last decade not


---------01:27----------
dad morbidity and mortality so that


---------01:30----------
includes like loss of productivity and


---------01:32----------
things like that so disease burden not


---------01:34----------
straight mortality sure and I think the


---------01:39----------
last I read I think it was like


---------01:40----------
something like 18% of women in the


---------01:42----------
United States have taken like are either


---------01:44----------
have had an SSRI within like the past


---------01:45----------
six months or something like an insane


---------01:47----------
stat and that'll ease any of that for


---------01:49----------
men yeah it's pretty crazy yeah so but


---------01:53----------
my so a lot of times people come on


---------01:55----------
streams so the main reason that people


---------01:56----------
come on my stream is to actually it was


---------01:59----------
that Soylent cocoa-y am I in trouble


---------02:03----------
they're not my mental health okay III


---------02:05----------
like I saw when I had I tried so I went


---------02:09----------
for a while it sort of did good things


---------02:11----------
and bad things for me but okay so most


---------02:16----------
people tend to come on because they're


---------02:18----------
interested in in some kind of like


---------02:20----------
understanding about themselves or help


---------02:22----------
in some way but my understanding is that


---------02:24----------
that's not some that you're pretty


---------02:26----------
content and you're pretty happy and


---------02:27----------
you're not interested in that


---------02:31----------
yeah I think or unless


---------02:32----------
I really don't have like a specific


---------02:34----------
thing to talk about to like to be 100%


---------02:37----------
blunt I think my audience wants me to


---------02:39----------
talk to somebody and then just see me


---------02:40----------
get like very emotional and cry that


---------02:42----------
seems to be like what they're all like


---------02:43----------
kind of guys right now so um but I mean


---------02:46----------
otherwise yeah but yeah whatever your my


---------02:49----------
my my my audience is calling you a raid


---------02:52----------
boss I'm night so I think that they're


---------02:56----------
looking for the same thing I think that


---------02:57----------
they're gonna be disappointed yeah


---------03:00----------
probably I consider myself to be like a


---------03:02----------
pretty I'll say grounded person which


---------03:05----------
sounds really dismissive of I've heard


---------03:07----------
that you're more into like like Eastern


---------03:09----------
or spiritual related stuff personally I


---------03:12----------
don't care for that kind of stuff but I


---------03:14----------
think that if it offers like a great


---------03:16----------
value and it can be descriptive of some


---------03:17----------
underlying truths that I think it's


---------03:19----------
totally fine so I think a lot of people


---------03:20----------
are expecting me to like go really hard


---------03:22----------
into saying like all forms of whatever


---------03:24----------
are stupid which I don't really agree


---------03:25----------
with so or yeah I don't think I would


---------03:27----------
ever say that so yeah I'm not really


---------03:28----------
sure what what what okay so please can


---------03:31----------
you tell me what you mean by grounded um


---------03:34----------
I'm I guess um there's two different


---------03:38----------
ways to go with this


---------03:41----------
I'm a very empirical kind of person I


---------03:43----------
guess when I look at stuff that I choose


---------03:46----------
to believe in when it comes to like


---------03:49----------
making statements of fact about the


---------03:50----------
world I'm very big on like what can we


---------03:53----------
observe what can we test I guess it's


---------03:55----------
kind of a boring answer but that's not


---------03:57----------
away from a lot of like yeah a lot of


---------03:59----------
light like I'm very a theistic in terms


---------04:02----------
of like my looking at like gods and


---------04:03----------
whatnot I don't really believe in the


---------04:04----------
supernatural anything like that and you


---------04:07----------
say you're empirical about sort of


---------04:08----------
looking at the external world I would


---------04:10----------
guess that you're actually empirical


---------04:11----------
about looking at yourself as well I mean


---------04:14----------
as much as you can be yeah so what do


---------04:17----------
you mean by that


---------04:18----------
um I mean like I would consider myself


---------04:21----------
to be like a materialist or like a


---------04:22----------
physicalist I don't believe in an


---------04:23----------
immaterial world but I mean obviously


---------04:24----------
consciousness is a very complicated


---------04:25----------
process and the question about something


---------04:27----------
like that can emerge from like


---------04:28----------
underlying properties is very


---------04:30----------
complicated and it's hard for me to like


---------04:32----------
say with any absolute certainty you know


---------04:34----------
what I can know about my own conscious


---------04:35----------
state in an empirical sense but I mean


---------04:37----------
I'd like to think that everything is


---------04:38----------
empirical that's the type of analysis


---------04:39----------
that I tend to occasion yeah yeah so so


---------04:42----------
you're talking about sort of


---------04:43----------
consciousness of being an emergent


---------04:44----------
property which is not anything that has


---------04:46----------
to do


---------04:46----------
you that's sort of like a scientific


---------04:48----------
view right it's a it's something that


---------04:49----------
comes from the external world it's about


---------04:53----------
the science of the origin of


---------04:55----------
consciousness sure yeah but I would


---------04:58----------
actually guess that you are empirical


---------05:00----------
within yourself so that yeah I see yeah


---------05:04----------
yeah and and when you say like so I


---------05:07----------
think you know what I mean can you just


---------05:08----------
explain for everyone what we're talking


---------05:10----------
about cuz I agree with you by the way


---------05:11----------
that I think we're a lot more similar


---------05:13----------
than people realize yeah possibly yeah I


---------05:15----------
guess when I say that I'm empirical in


---------05:17----------
my own analysis I mean what I try to say


---------05:19----------
is it like something I learned very


---------05:20----------
early on in life is that your memory and


---------05:23----------
your interpretation of events is highly


---------05:25----------
unreliable that getting external like


---------05:27----------
points of view of yourself is incredibly


---------05:29----------
important because we are very selective


---------05:31----------
in terms of what we remember about


---------05:32----------
ourselves and how we view ourselves so I


---------05:33----------
try like very hard to have these like


---------05:35----------
external cameras these communities that


---------05:37----------
I consult I'm I try to be very honest


---------05:39----------
when I look at myself to make sure that


---------05:40----------
I'm out you know like telling lies to


---------05:41----------
myself or not confronting you know a


---------05:42----------
problem I might have or something that


---------05:44----------
that's what I mean when I say I try to


---------05:46----------
be a little bit more empirical about how


---------05:47----------
I view myself yeah yeah so but so it


---------05:50----------
sounds like your empiricism the way with


---------05:52----------
with that the way that you look at


---------05:54----------
yourself is by using external lenses to


---------05:57----------
make sure that your interpretation of


---------05:59----------
things is aligned with what the external


---------06:01----------
world says yeah I guess basically yeah


---------06:03----------
I'm looking for congruence there that


---------06:05----------
doesn't result from me just selecting


---------06:07----------
groups of people that tell me what I


---------06:08----------
want to hear but yeah okay I got like a


---------06:10----------
more true view of myself sure and um


---------06:12----------
you're happy I think yeah I would say so


---------06:15----------
yeah for sure what does that feel like


---------06:17----------
um like if I wake up if I'm supposed to


---------06:22----------
like sleep for eight hours like I think


---------06:23----------
I do really well on about seven and a


---------06:25----------
half hours of sleep seven and a half


---------06:26----------
eight hours of sleep if I wake up like


---------06:27----------
two hours early I'm usually like so


---------06:29----------
looking forward to stream that I I can't


---------06:31----------
go back to bed I usually like we'll just


---------06:33----------
go downstairs and start working I really


---------06:35----------
enjoy like my day-to-day life like my


---------06:37----------
experience is pretty high I look forward


---------06:38----------
to talking people I look forward to


---------06:39----------
playing games even if they make me hate


---------06:40----------
myself because League of Legends is


---------06:41----------
horrible game but like a my general like


---------06:43----------
baseline like mental status is like very


---------06:46----------
excited about like everything I can do


---------06:47----------
okay and so I'm just going


---------06:52----------
just tunnel down for a second so mm-hmm


---------06:55----------
it sounds like the experience of the


---------06:57----------
happiness of your life too has nothing


---------06:59----------
to do with external congruence um oh


---------07:02----------
absolutely


---------07:03----------
of course okay um so okay and how long


---------07:10----------
would you say you've been happy I think


---------07:12----------
my whole life I think I've always had


---------07:14----------
like a pretty high mental state okay I


---------07:17----------
mean obviously within like there have


---------07:20----------
been periods of my life where I have


---------07:21----------
like been sad or like something has


---------07:23----------
happened sure but like those are like


---------07:25----------
traceable to like this is happening now


---------07:27----------
so now I'm upset but like my baseline


---------07:29----------
like as long as nothing's going on


---------07:31----------
that's bad it's very high I would say


---------07:32----------
and so you've kind of always been this


---------07:35----------
way I think so yeah um so let me just


---------07:39----------
try to ask you kind of like a couple of


---------07:41----------
clarifying questions yeah go for it um


---------07:43----------
one is so I'm almost getting a sense


---------07:46----------
from you that the experience of emotion


---------07:48----------
is actually different from the happiness


---------07:50----------
that you're talking about that you have


---------07:53----------
some sense of underlying contentment


---------07:55----------
which is almost independent doesn't


---------07:57----------
necessarily change if you get let's say


---------07:59----------
angry or sad yeah I would say so


---------08:03----------
yeah yeah I would separate those two


---------08:04----------
things out quite a bit being what do you


---------08:06----------
think that is um yeah so I guess my


---------08:11----------
personally I don't know for sure but


---------08:12----------
like I guess like my personal answer I


---------08:14----------
would say that like my greatest asset is


---------08:15----------
I feel like a very confident on myself


---------08:16----------
okay how much love the person that I am


---------08:18----------
I like Who I am and I enjoy that


---------08:21----------
regardless of kind of what people around


---------08:22----------
me say and I can always be like


---------08:23----------
comfortable with myself and I feel okay


---------08:25----------
with that and do you think that's what


---------08:27----------
leads to your sense of like happiness or


---------08:29----------
contentment that would be my guess when


---------08:32----------
I see a lot of people that are unhappy


---------08:33----------
it feels like a lot of that comes from


---------08:35----------
their view of how other people view them


---------08:38----------
or kind of like their place or their


---------08:39----------
just contentment with where they fit in


---------08:41----------
in society they don't like the feedback


---------08:43----------
that they're getting feels that way yeah


---------08:45----------
yeah so I'm trying to get a sense of


---------08:48----------
which one is the chicken and which one


---------08:49----------
is the egg because you know you're kind


---------08:51----------
of saying that you're confident in who


---------08:52----------
you are to me it actually makes sense


---------08:55----------
that that confidence actually comes from


---------08:58----------
being sort of generally content with who


---------09:00----------
you are as a person


---------09:02----------
yeah I don't know um I used to say I


---------09:05----------
used to kind of advocate for people to


---------09:07----------
like grow like a sense of confidence and


---------09:08----------
everything because you know from that


---------09:10----------
you develop habits and everything that


---------09:12----------
allow you to love yourself and etc but


---------09:14----------
you know if I'm really honest with


---------09:16----------
myself I'm not sure if I could foster


---------09:18----------
that in my 20s or if that's just


---------09:19----------
something I've kind of always had from a


---------09:21----------
really early age get there through a


---------09:22----------
combination of lucky biological and


---------09:24----------
environmental factors it just kind of


---------09:25----------
like led me into being the person I am


---------09:27----------
so yeah I don't know I can't draw like a


---------09:29----------
causal link unfortunately yeah I think


---------09:31----------
that makes sense because what you're


---------09:33----------
saying is that you've sort of always had


---------09:34----------
it so it's unclear what the origin of


---------09:37----------
that was because it's always been around


---------09:38----------
yeah it seems to be the case yeah yeah


---------09:42----------
hmm I'm just gonna think for a second


---------09:48----------
sure have you ever read anything by


---------10:01----------
Krishnamoorthy I'm horrible when it


---------10:04----------
comes to reading the time commitment is


---------10:06----------
grit my I can read pretty well but the


---------10:07----------
time command has really got me watching


---------10:08----------
TV shows watching movies and reading


---------10:10----------
like very hard for me to like sit down


---------10:12----------
and do it for long periods of time


---------10:13----------
okay I think you may find it interesting


---------10:15----------
just in terms of you know I I know you


---------10:17----------
that you don't hold a lot of like


---------10:19----------
spirituality or things like that and


---------10:22----------
you've described yourself as pretty


---------10:24----------
atheistic so I just think that if if you


---------10:27----------
are interested in sort of exploring


---------10:29----------
spirituality from a perspective that I


---------10:31----------
think is a lot more aligned with your


---------10:33----------
point of view Krishnamoorthy is someone


---------10:34----------
that I would highly recommend and that's


---------10:36----------
also for the people who are respectively


---------10:38----------
watching as well that I I think so a lot


---------10:40----------
of people how can I say this like


---------10:44----------
destiny why do you wait can I real quick


---------10:47----------
well you think yeah what is the name


---------10:48----------
just so I can write it down so much I


---------10:49----------
know kr is H n a and then either mu R th


---------10:55----------
Y or mo o r th wise I think it's usually


---------11:00----------
mu but okay gotcha


---------11:08----------
so I think you pointed out something


---------11:11----------
very important which is that a lot of


---------11:12----------
people have their sense of contentment


---------11:15----------
be related to other people's opinions of


---------11:18----------
that yeah which is very negative


---------11:21----------
negative what do you mean by negative I


---------11:23----------
think that when you become reliant on


---------11:25----------
how other people view you I think that


---------11:27----------
your mental state is like perpetually


---------11:29----------
held hostage by the people around you


---------11:31----------
which I consider to be very negative I


---------11:33----------
don't know if that's like a normal human


---------11:35----------
opinion or not but like yeah I wouldn't


---------11:37----------
want like if somebody around me says


---------11:38----------
that like oh hey like I don't like what


---------11:40----------
you're doing right now a lot of people


---------11:42----------
like view that as like personal attacks


---------11:44----------
and like can start to lose confidence in


---------11:46----------
themselves just because they're getting


---------11:47----------
negative feedback from people which i


---------11:48----------
think is like very bad yeah so I think


---------11:50----------
in in the in the system of yoga that


---------11:54----------
aspect is called a hum God or ego okay


---------11:57----------
that a sense of self can be based on two


---------12:00----------
things one is sort of an internal like


---------12:02----------
experience of self and the second kind


---------12:04----------
of self that we have is based on a more


---------12:08----------
common external identity so anything


---------12:10----------
that goes on a resume is a part of that


---------12:12----------
thing and the opinions of others how


---------12:14----------
other people receive you like that can


---------12:17----------
form a sense of self and that sense of


---------12:18----------
self is called the ego and generally


---------12:20----------
speaking in yogic philosophy having an


---------12:23----------
ego that's the larger your ego is the


---------12:25----------
more discontent you will be so what I'm


---------12:28----------
hearing from you is that your sense of


---------12:30----------
self is actually not based on external


---------12:31----------
things it's based on this internal sense


---------12:34----------
that you've always had of kind of being


---------12:36----------
confident to yourself in some degree of


---------12:38----------
internal tranquility yeah definitely


---------12:42----------
why don't you think other people have


---------12:44----------
that what separates like what is the


---------12:47----------
causative factor that that has you being


---------12:49----------
one way in them being another way this


---------12:54----------
is its I can give like conjecture about


---------12:57----------
this but I always caution people and I


---------12:59----------
say this like it's hard to draw causal


---------13:00----------
links to anything I grew up like


---------13:03----------
relatively independent like my parents


---------13:05----------
were busy with stuff growing up so I


---------13:06----------
kind of foster like a sense of


---------13:08----------
Independence and it seemed to me that


---------13:10----------
growing up typically like if you had


---------13:12----------
problems the way that people are kind of


---------13:14----------
told to resolve problems is to just get


---------13:16----------
affirmation from friends or family


---------13:17----------
without ever actually


---------13:19----------
dressing the problems so people kind of


---------13:20----------
grow up thinking that like the way that


---------13:22----------
I know that I'm mentally healthier


---------13:24----------
mentally sound so if other people around


---------13:25----------
me are telling me that I'm mentally


---------13:27----------
healthier mentally sound but then


---------13:28----------
obviously as soon as you start to run


---------13:29----------
into confrontation that your worldview


---------13:31----------
kind of falls apart because now when


---------13:32----------
people are telling you you're not doing


---------13:34----------
well you feel like you're actually like


---------13:36----------
unwell which i think is really bad yeah


---------13:37----------
okay and is there any part of you that


---------13:44----------
is concerned that so when when a large


---------13:48----------
part like I understand that a lot of


---------13:50----------
people are kind of contrary towards you


---------13:52----------
or take issue with some of your


---------13:54----------
perspectives or beliefs what's your


---------13:57----------
understanding of like what they take


---------13:58----------
issue with um it depends this is


---------14:02----------
something this is probably the biggest


---------14:03----------
thing that I try to keep in check is


---------14:05----------
very easy to get lost especially being a


---------14:07----------
streamer but but even for normal people


---------14:08----------
to kind of get lost in an echo chamber


---------14:09----------
where you're disregarding external


---------14:12----------
opinions of yourself


---------14:12----------
I very much keep in mind what people


---------14:15----------
think of me I know what every community


---------14:17----------
thinks to me and I know the reasons why


---------14:18----------
they don't like me and then my goal is


---------14:20----------
to like understand why people disagree


---------14:22----------
with me and then to integrate those


---------14:23----------
understandings into my life is see if


---------14:26----------
they're things I want to change I don't


---------14:27----------
want to change so I guess like two


---------14:28----------
examples I've give us like maybe I get


---------14:30----------
the feedback a lot that like oh destiny


---------14:32----------
is very rude all the time to everybody


---------14:34----------
and maybe when I get that feedback a lot


---------14:36----------
maybe I watch some videos and I find out


---------14:38----------
hey I actually talk over people a lot


---------14:39----------
like I can change that or maybe instead


---------14:42----------
I watch a video and I find out like I


---------14:43----------
don't really think I spoke over this


---------14:44----------
person well I think I just you know


---------14:45----------
responded well to his arguments so you


---------14:47----------
know in one case I would say okay well


---------14:49----------
you know I took their feedback I you


---------14:51----------
know did a little bit of introspection I


---------14:52----------
found out well I need to change this in


---------14:54----------
another case I took their feedback I


---------14:56----------
looked at the situation and I kind of


---------14:57----------
determined well I think they just feel


---------14:58----------
that way but I think the perception is


---------14:59----------
incorrect so then I have to feel you


---------15:01----------
know do I want to deal with that


---------15:02----------
incorrect perception or do I just ignore


---------15:04----------
it and I kind of move forward I guess is


---------15:05----------
how I try to integrate other people's


---------15:06----------
feedback into my own self concept or


---------15:09----------
whatever you know and or their


---------15:11----------
particular I think that makes a lot of


---------15:13----------
sense so it sounds like when people


---------15:14----------
criticize you in some way you you kind


---------15:17----------
of really do your your best job to take


---------15:20----------
a look and see if their criticisms have


---------15:21----------
merit and then you kind of conclude they


---------15:23----------
do have merit or they don't have merit


---------15:25----------
and so that that sounds like it makes


---------15:28----------
sense to me let me just think for a


---------15:31----------
second


---------15:32----------
their particular things so like I was


---------15:35----------
kind of confused about what this was as


---------15:38----------
I mentioned earlier so I did like just a


---------15:40----------
Google search for you and I looked at


---------15:41----------
your subreddit and then I looked at some


---------15:43----------
of the top some of the top posts of all


---------15:46----------
time on your sub read why is that funny


---------15:48----------
yeah because depending on what you look


---------15:51----------
at me you can find anything from guy


---------15:53----------
that did you know 40,000 in charity in a


---------15:56----------
single day to guy that is a pedophile


---------15:58----------
rapist that has a secret daughter to God


---------16:00----------
like there's like a million different


---------16:01----------
things you can read about me depending


---------16:02----------
on which communities you jump into so


---------16:04----------
yeah why do you think that is where do


---------16:06----------
you think there's such a wide disparity


---------16:08----------
between how you're viewed I think that's


---------16:12----------
the intersection of like several


---------16:13----------
different underlying topics any of which


---------16:16----------
I mean like one is it like people are


---------16:20----------
very like people are very holistic views


---------16:22----------
of somebody or I should say people are


---------16:24----------
very binary views of people it's


---------16:26----------
impossible for a good person to have


---------16:28----------
negative characteristics they're they're


---------16:29----------
wholly good or wholly negative so for


---------16:31----------
some communities as soon as they find


---------16:32----------
out one negative thing everything about


---------16:34----------
me becomes negative so for instance over


---------16:36----------
the past year I'm a very left-leaning


---------16:39----------
political person I'm incredibly


---------16:40----------
left-leaning and my economic positions


---------16:42----------
into my social positions but I'm not a


---------16:44----------
communist or I'm not a socialist so I've


---------16:46----------
had this issue with a lot of


---------16:47----------
left-leaning people that see that I'm a


---------16:48----------
capitalist and now all of a sudden I'm


---------16:49----------
not just a capitalist I'm also an alt


---------16:51----------
writer I'm a right wing I support you


---------16:53----------
know imperialism and all these crazy


---------16:55----------
things just because we don't know a line


---------16:56----------
on that one view so like in that case I


---------16:57----------
would say well these people don't like


---------16:59----------
me because we disagree on this one


---------17:00----------
position and then they start to like


---------17:02----------
attribute like everything that doesn't


---------17:04----------
have that particular position to me


---------17:05----------
right so like that would be like one


---------17:07----------
reason and yeah there's like a million


---------17:09----------
other I have to look like would look at


---------17:10----------
like every single individual like sure


---------17:12----------
thing that people have with me to figure


---------17:13----------
out why they sure so select it's almost


---------17:16----------
like so you know a human being has many


---------17:19----------
many facets in many many nuances and


---------17:21----------
beliefs are not don't like like a human


---------17:24----------
beings beliefs don't generally subscribe


---------17:26----------
to like a whole manifesto of like being


---------17:30----------
liberal or communist or capitalist like


---------17:32----------
we all have different kinds of beliefs


---------17:33----------
in different shades of beliefs and what


---------17:35----------
happens is you encounter different


---------17:37----------
groups of people who will kind of put


---------17:40----------
you in one bucket or the other right


---------17:43----------
yeah I think it's a very normal human


---------17:45----------
thing to


---------17:46----------
yeah so I mean I agree I think it's a


---------17:49----------
completely normal human thing to do and


---------17:50----------
I think that most people are just as


---------17:53----------
multifaceted as you are and yet hope so


---------17:56----------
you you seem to have a lot more


---------17:59----------
discrepancy in terms of how people view


---------18:01----------
you compared to everyone else sure how


---------18:05----------
do you understand that um I very much


---------18:09----------
have like my personal identity and the


---------18:12----------
things that I believe in and when it


---------18:13----------
comes time for me to decide like if I


---------18:16----------
like a particular thing or if I don't


---------18:18----------
like a particular thing I have like an


---------18:20----------
internal kind of rubric by which I score


---------18:22----------
things it feels to me like what people


---------18:24----------
tend to do is they tend to try to group


---------18:26----------
themselves into certain communities and


---------18:28----------
then how they feel about a particular


---------18:30----------
thing is usually more reflection of what


---------18:33----------
that person thinks everybody in that


---------18:35----------
group wants them to say so like for


---------18:37----------
instance let's say uh-oh you say extreme


---------18:40----------
example let's say somebody presented me


---------18:41----------
with like a very sparkly pink dress and


---------18:43----------
they wanted they were like hey would you


---------18:44----------
like to wear this I would evaluate that


---------18:47----------
in terms of like well what colors do I


---------18:48----------
like I don't really like pink I don't


---------18:50----------
particularly like the way that my legs I


---------18:52----------
think would look at a dress I don't


---------18:54----------
think I would enjoy wearing a dress and


---------18:56----------
that would be my answer but I feel like


---------18:57----------
I vote if I would ask a lot of people


---------18:59----------
that question like would you ever wear a


---------19:00----------
dress the answer would be more they


---------19:02----------
would think okay what part of what group


---------19:05----------
am I in and then what is our answer


---------19:06----------
supposed to be in regards to like


---------19:08----------
wearing dress okay I'm a man don't


---------19:09----------
[ __ ] wear dresses and the answer we


---------19:11----------
like of course not dude that's so stupid


---------19:12----------
like it feels like the answer from I get


---------19:15----------
from people when it comes to evaluating


---------19:16----------
things they like or don't like for


---------19:18----------
instance is usually a reflection of what


---------19:19----------
they feel like the group they belong to


---------19:21----------
would like or not like


---------19:23----------
yeah what is what I mean so people are


---------19:26----------
multifaceted people yes judgments and


---------19:29----------
input people into groups mm-hmm so like


---------19:32----------
I I mean it sounds to me like the answer


---------19:35----------
that you provided which is that no I


---------19:37----------
don't want to wear that pink dress


---------19:39----------
because I'm not cannot so happy about


---------19:42----------
the way that maybe my legs would look or


---------19:43----------
I'm not a huge fan of the color pink I


---------19:45----------
mean that to me sounds like a how can I


---------19:49----------
put this a less chaotic chaos inducing


---------19:53----------
answer then [ __ ] that I'm not gonna wear


---------19:55----------
a dress mm-hmm like I would think that


---------19:58----------
that kind of


---------19:59----------
Spahn sacktual ii leads to a general


---------20:02----------
sense of like understanding on the part


---------20:04----------
of other people as i mostly the one like


---------20:09----------
a real detailed answer yeah because your


---------20:13----------
answers thought like you come across as


---------20:14----------
like thoughtful right and not you the


---------20:16----------
action airy and so i would think that if


---------20:18----------
you were thoughtful and not reactionary


---------20:21----------
like you're saying most people are that


---------20:22----------
people would like that you wouldn't be


---------20:24----------
such a divisive figure on the internet


---------20:26----------
um maybe so i'm gonna come off okay so


---------20:29----------
here's where i have to fully admit that


---------20:31----------
because of the work that i do


---------20:33----------
there might be a horrendous selection


---------20:35----------
bias applied to the types of people that


---------20:37----------
I talk to I might talk to the worst of


---------20:38----------
the worst sinner right but it seems to


---------20:40----------
me that most people don't actually


---------20:42----------
appreciate a new monster answer if the


---------20:45----------
question that's asked demands an answer


---------20:47----------
from an entire group that would be one


---------20:48----------
way even considering an answer to that


---------20:51----------
would be absolutely unfathomable so like


---------20:54----------
a real-life example I can give is good


---------20:56----------
yeah I mean so like I completely agree


---------20:58----------
with you


---------20:59----------
but what I'm trying to understand is


---------21:00----------
like I don't understand anything that


---------21:03----------
you're saying seems to apply to everyone


---------21:06----------
else right so people are multifaceted


---------21:08----------
people make judgments therefore any


---------21:11----------
random person that you take on the


---------21:12----------
street is gonna fall into like one of


---------21:15----------
two camps and that people will react to


---------21:17----------
them they'll like if you're in the


---------21:18----------
middle of the political spectrum people


---------21:20----------
who are on the the conservative side


---------21:23----------
will call you a [ __ ] liberal and if


---------21:24----------
you're on the liberal end of the


---------21:25----------
spectrum they're gonna call you a


---------21:26----------
[ __ ] alt writer and so what I'm


---------21:29----------
trying to understand is like why and


---------21:32----------
that's true I completely accept your


---------21:34----------
premise so what I'm curious about is


---------21:36----------
what is your understanding of if that's


---------21:39----------
the case why are you perceived as you


---------21:42----------
put it so like you said like when I said


---------21:44----------
I like you know I should Google the and


---------21:46----------
you're like why I guess okay so actually


---------21:50----------
maybe I misinterpreted the same and


---------21:51----------
maybe there's a point of disagreement we


---------21:52----------
have actually I don't know if I would


---------21:53----------
agree necessarily that people are


---------21:55----------
multifaceted in the way that you are


---------21:57----------
thinking multifaceted I was thinking of


---------21:59----------
in terms of like is somebody like a


---------22:01----------
Republican or a Democrat probably not


---------22:03----------
people have views from both but that's


---------22:05----------
not necessarily because they're a


---------22:06----------
multi-faceted person that's considered


---------22:08----------
every position it's more that they


---------22:10----------
belong to a more fundamental group that


---------22:12----------
defers on those two


---------22:14----------
so they might identify more strongly as


---------22:15----------
like evangelical Christian and that's


---------22:17----------
more important to being a Republican or


---------22:18----------
a Democrat and as a result of being an


---------22:20----------
evangelical Christian they have some


---------22:21----------
beliefs that may or may not fit kind of


---------22:23----------
like both sides I guess is what I'm


---------22:24----------
saying yeah so but then depending on


---------22:27----------
which party they're talking to aren't


---------22:28----------
they going to get bucketed by that


---------22:30----------
respective group um well it depends on


---------22:33----------
the it depends on the pair on the lens


---------22:36----------
to which that conversation is happening


---------22:37----------
like if this was a conversation or


---------22:38----------
something in a church then they'll get


---------22:40----------
bucketed if it's a conversation that's


---------22:41----------
hopping like sheral italy then they


---------22:43----------
might not they might just end up getting


---------22:44----------
attacked by everybody depending on what


---------22:46----------
their beliefs are I guess I know what


---------22:48----------
type of person they are yeah so I'm


---------22:49----------
still confused about like fine I'll you


---------22:53----------
know I I think you explained about what


---------22:55----------
multi-faceted could look like and I


---------22:56----------
don't think you were that far apart I'm


---------22:58----------
still a little bit confused about so


---------23:00----------
you're you're kind of saying that the


---------23:02----------
reason that you're such a divisive


---------23:03----------
figure on the Internet which I still


---------23:05----------
don't really understand how divisive or


---------23:06----------
not divisive you are you seem pretty


---------23:09----------
reasonable to me is that people talk to


---------23:12----------
you and then they end up putting you in


---------23:13----------
a bucket and because people tend to


---------23:15----------
think in a binary way right yeah so like


---------23:18----------
I guess like the the short answer would


---------23:20----------
be I have a core set of principles that


---------23:22----------
I believe in that I use to generate like


---------23:24----------
all of my moral statements all of my


---------23:26----------
policy positions and that's what I


---------23:27----------
confer like that there that's what I


---------23:29----------
consult when I am given a thing to think


---------23:31----------
about sure feels like for other people


---------23:32----------
it's more just kind of like they want to


---------23:34----------
belong to certain groups on the Internet


---------23:36----------
and then anybody that has a belief that


---------23:38----------
is separate from any one of those things


---------23:39----------
instantly rejected as an outsider and


---------23:41----------
because of the internal positions I have


---------23:42----------
I don't line up exactly well with any of


---------23:45----------
these groups so it causes people to like


---------23:47----------
try to castigate me I guess from these


---------23:49----------
groups whatever that's the feeling that


---------23:51----------
I get okay


---------23:53----------
so you think that the reason that your


---------23:54----------
view differently is because your process


---------23:57----------
you don't just subscribe to a particular


---------23:58----------
on thought-out system yeah you think


---------24:04----------
through things clearly you develop your


---------24:06----------
own internal manifesto and it's because


---------24:09----------
of the uniqueness of your position that


---------24:11----------
these people who tend to make snap


---------24:14----------
judgments about people in group people


---------24:15----------
that your internal process in the way


---------24:18----------
that you view the world upsets or makes


---------24:21----------
people fall in love with you yeah


---------24:23----------
obviously this is like a very high view


---------24:24----------
of myself this is what I would like to


---------24:25----------
think yeah


---------24:26----------
yeah I mean what do you think about that


---------24:29----------
as you say it like I understand that


---------24:31----------
that's a high view of yourself in that


---------24:32----------
you would like to believe that but what


---------24:34----------
do you think about what do you think


---------24:35----------
about that when you reflect on that how


---------24:37----------
does that sound to you I mean I consider


---------24:40----------
it to be very good but I mean do you


---------24:43----------
think that's really that different from


---------24:45----------
other people like you don't think that


---------24:46----------
other people so let me actually rephrase


---------24:48----------
that so it's my experience that most


---------24:51----------
people believe that their beliefs have


---------24:54----------
been carefully considered and examined


---------24:57----------
and that they come up with a relatively


---------24:59----------
unique perspective on the world they may


---------25:01----------
ascribe themselves to certain group


---------25:02----------
identities absolutely but that generally


---------25:04----------
speaking people think that their beliefs


---------25:06----------
have been well thought out like if you


---------25:07----------
go to someone you say hey you believe


---------25:09----------
this because you haven't considered it


---------25:11----------
properly you haven't considered it fully


---------25:13----------
and you've just described to a


---------25:15----------
particular set of like inherited beliefs


---------25:17----------
they would disagree with you and they


---------25:19----------
would say that on the contrary I've


---------25:21----------
thought this through and the reason that


---------25:23----------
I ascribed to the Republican Party is


---------25:24----------
because I think the Republicans are


---------25:26----------
right based on my own internal study


---------25:28----------
yeah most of them would say that the


---------25:30----------
vast majority of them 95% plus would be


---------25:32----------
absolutely wrong that's just been my


---------25:34----------
personal experience with almost every


---------25:35----------
single person I've talked to that as


---------25:36----------
soon as he starts a question like okay


---------25:38----------
well you think that you've thought this


---------25:39----------
through as soon as I get about two


---------25:40----------
questions in be completely and totally


---------25:42----------
crumble they haven't fought through a


---------25:43----------
single thing that they said they have


---------25:45----------
yeah and that seems to be the case with


---------25:48----------
a lot of people yeah and so help me


---------25:49----------
understand how you're different um I


---------25:52----------
guess maybe as a result of growing up


---------25:56----------
like pretty independent I've had like so


---------26:00----------
let me be very clear for instance we're


---------26:02----------
real quick when I say like I I'm


---------26:03----------
independent or I have my own thoughts


---------26:05----------
clearly there it's influenced by the


---------26:07----------
society around me I'm sure how do I play


---------26:09----------
different games how did seeing different


---------26:10----------
movies had a grown up in a different


---------26:11----------
country it's entirely possible I'd be a


---------26:13----------
completely and totally different person


---------26:14----------
alright so I will acknowledge that right


---------26:16----------
I don't believe in any divine freewill


---------26:18----------
that's given me master control over the


---------26:19----------
perfect life or whatever I guess I feel


---------26:22----------
like as a result of growing up


---------26:23----------
relatively independent I didn't draw my


---------26:26----------
opinions or what I should or shouldn't


---------26:27----------
like necessarily from other people and


---------26:29----------
as a result of that I have like an


---------26:31----------
internal rubric by which I evaluate


---------26:32----------
things and the dad's kind of led me to a


---------26:35----------
unique position where I'm able to take a


---------26:36----------
topic consider the topic using what I


---------26:39----------
personally believe without


---------26:40----------
think of like what a group would you


---------26:41----------
know approve or disapprove of and then


---------26:43----------
give an answer that's like I feel


---------26:44----------
uniquely mine even if other people might


---------26:46----------
agree with that answer or give the same


---------26:47----------
answer my thought process I would like


---------26:49----------
to say so unique to myself and it


---------26:51----------
doesn't rely on another group to tell me


---------26:52----------
how I should answer a question okay so


---------26:57----------
and and so you think that your your


---------26:59----------
thought process has been very


---------27:01----------
independently developed you sure you've


---------27:03----------
been influenced like things just like


---------27:04----------
everyone else has and that by virtue of


---------27:07----------
you sort of not catering to other


---------27:10----------
people's opinions that the divisive


---------27:13----------
nough state on the Internet is by virtue


---------27:15----------
of like this internal thought process


---------27:17----------
that is very like unique and well


---------27:19----------
thought out yeah I would I would hope so


---------27:22----------
yeah


---------27:23----------
and okay let me just think about this so


---------27:28----------
I'm gonna ask a question that I asked


---------27:30----------
once before I'm just gonna ask it again


---------27:32----------
yeah no problem which is that like so


---------27:34----------
let's say that I take just any person


---------27:36----------
and I ask them you know how did you come


---------27:38----------
up with the beliefs that you came up


---------27:39----------
with I'm imagining would give me and


---------27:43----------
based on me having asked a lot of people


---------27:45----------
that question I'm sure you have to maybe


---------27:47----------
in slightly different contacts they


---------27:49----------
pretty much everyone that says your


---------27:50----------
answer right that they have grew up and


---------27:52----------
they sort of thought independently and


---------27:54----------
so what I'm trying to understand is if


---------27:58----------
everyone has an internal process and 95%


---------28:01----------
of them are right I mean 95% of them are


---------28:05----------
wrong and it seems like the reason that


---------28:06----------
you're saying that yours is right and


---------28:08----------
theirs is wrong is because you can ask


---------28:10----------
them two questions and they can't answer


---------28:12----------
question number three four five six


---------28:15----------
seven eight nine whereas you feel like


---------28:18----------
you can answer questions 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


---------28:22----------
10 11 12 and that's why your thought


---------28:25----------
process stands up better than theirs you


---------28:31----------
know in a in a in a backwards way yes


---------28:35----------
so like I'm not so interested in them


---------28:38----------
understanding like 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 but


---------28:40----------
more so that like if they don't it's


---------28:42----------
usually indicative of them inheriting


---------28:44----------
those top level positions rather than


---------28:47----------
arriving at them if that makes sense so


---------28:49----------
like for instance if you want to ask me


---------28:51----------
a question about like like


---------28:52----------
should health care be free in the United


---------28:54----------
States like I started a very fundamental


---------28:57----------
possession position to figure that out


---------28:59----------
right like what do I think goodness is


---------29:01----------
and then what's the best way to apply


---------29:03----------
goodness and then you know what's the


---------29:05----------
most applied position within the night


---------29:06----------
and then I kind of work through there so


---------29:07----------
then if you back up and ask me a


---------29:08----------
question I can kind of figure that out


---------29:09----------
right for some people you know it might


---------29:11----------
just be that they read off of their


---------29:12----------
favorite political candidate that like


---------29:14----------
oh you know socialized health care is


---------29:16----------
horrible or socialized healthcare is


---------29:18----------
great and then if I ask them a question


---------29:19----------
about oh you think it's good or bad well


---------29:21----------
why if they can't answer it it's not


---------29:23----------
that I'm like I I think that it's so bad


---------29:25----------
that you don't know the two three four


---------29:26----------
five six seven eight nine blah blah blah


---------29:27----------
it's more so that it's like it's clear


---------29:29----------
that you haven't really thought about


---------29:30----------
this it's just somebody that you look up


---------29:32----------
to told you this answer and now you're


---------29:33----------
just kind of parroting it to me and you


---------29:34----------
haven't really like arrived at that


---------29:36----------
conclusion so much as somebody else is


---------29:37----------
kind of stuck you there it's kind of


---------29:39----------
what I think of yeah I understand that


---------29:41----------
that's how you perceive them yeah what


---------29:43----------
I'm confused about is like when I talk


---------29:45----------
to them they don't perceive themselves


---------29:48----------
that way and so what I'm trying to


---------29:50----------
understand is like how are you different


---------29:51----------
from them because you don't perceive


---------29:54----------
yourself that way they don't perceive


---------29:55----------
themselves that way and yet you're


---------29:57----------
clearly different because like I I


---------29:59----------
accept that you're different so that's I


---------30:01----------
I mean that's what I'm operating under


---------30:03----------
the assumption of because most people


---------30:05----------
when I like look at their subreddit you


---------30:07----------
know don't have someone as a pet or


---------30:09----------
rapist and raise $40,000 yeah very right


---------30:12----------
so so most people aren't like that so


---------30:15----------
I'm trying to get a sense and this is


---------30:17----------
I'm trying to be just as transparent


---------30:19----------
like I'm trying to get a sense of like


---------30:21----------
how you understand how people react to


---------30:24----------
you are you asking me how I get a sense


---------30:29----------
of understanding of how other people


---------30:31----------
react to me yes and and that's what we I


---------30:33----------
mean that's what I've been asking you


---------30:34----------
about I'm just make trying to make that


---------30:35----------
oh so sure yeah I mean well in terms of


---------30:37----------
so the question is really how do I


---------30:38----------
understand like how do I get an


---------30:41----------
understanding of how other people view


---------30:42----------
me yeah like how do you like like so you


---------30:44----------
you are a divisive figure so let me just


---------30:46----------
let me just make sure I'm on the same


---------30:48----------
page with you okay go for it yeah yeah


---------30:49----------
so the first is that you are a divisive


---------30:52----------
figure when I asked you why are you a


---------30:53----------
divisive figure you say that I have a


---------30:54----------
very independent way of looking at the


---------30:56----------
world and that most people don't really


---------30:59----------
appreciate nuance and if you take a


---------31:01----------
multi-faceted viewpoint that they're


---------31:03----------
gonna slot you into one bucket or


---------31:05----------
another


---------31:05----------
and the reason that you're so divisive


---------31:07----------
is in this sort of makes perfect sense


---------31:09----------
right like if you're in the middle and


---------31:11----------
like you're gonna half the people are


---------31:14----------
gonna call you a Democrat and half the


---------31:15----------
people are gonna call you a Republican


---------31:16----------
which is sort of what we see charity


---------31:18----------
pedo rapist right sure so you're you're


---------31:21----------
kind of saying that like because people


---------31:22----------
slop me into these two slots that's like


---------31:24----------
that's why I'm perceived the way that I


---------31:27----------
am and then I ask you okay so then my


---------31:31----------
but in my experience people you know


---------31:34----------
that can apply to a lot of people right


---------31:35----------
so like not everyone it doesn't matter


---------31:38----------
where you are along the political


---------31:39----------
spectrum like I tend to be I think


---------31:41----------
somewhere in the middle of the political


---------31:42----------
spectrum and that some people think I'm


---------31:44----------
a Republican and some people think I'm a


---------31:45----------
Democrat that that sort of applies to a


---------31:48----------
lot of people that if you if we're


---------31:50----------
accepting that people slot get bucketed


---------31:52----------
in two different ways that most people


---------31:55----------
are gonna get bucketed to the the ends


---------31:58----------
of the spectrum because most people are


---------31:59----------
in the middle somewhere right that's


---------32:02----------
what you're saying I guess yeah kind of


---------32:04----------
yeah I don't know if we're missing on


---------32:05----------
this point but like politically they


---------32:07----------
might be bucketed in the middle which


---------32:09----------
like is deceptively nuanced but I feel


---------32:11----------
like the underlying reality is that


---------32:13----------
usually they're just completely ascribed


---------32:14----------
to some more fundamental group that


---------32:16----------
gives them the illusion of being a no


---------32:17----------
that's kind of what yeah I don't know


---------32:18----------
this melanocyte yeah yeah I I think I


---------32:20----------
mean that's about politics and specific


---------32:21----------
but I think your general point still


---------32:23----------
stands that that human beings tend to be


---------32:26----------
binary in the way that they look at


---------32:28----------
other human beings


---------32:29----------
yeah that most human beings are not at


---------32:31----------
either end of any kind of spectrum so as


---------32:34----------
a result if you take a hundred human


---------32:36----------
beings who are in the middle and you


---------32:37----------
show them to another hundred human


---------32:39----------
beings that those all hundred of those


---------32:41----------
human beings will be slotted towards


---------32:43----------
both ends of the spectrum by the hundred


---------32:45----------
people that they meet okay well okay


---------32:47----------
maybe this is getting more fundamental


---------32:48----------
okay maybe my cynicism will start


---------32:49----------
showing I do think that most people try


---------32:51----------
to find a group and identify wholly with


---------32:53----------
that group I don't think that most


---------32:55----------
people try to be nuanced or have


---------32:56----------
multiple opinions of things I think they


---------32:57----------
try to find like a certain group and


---------32:58----------
stick to it and then inherit all the


---------32:59----------
yeah yeah that doesn't that shouldn't


---------33:01----------
apply at all because then what we're


---------33:03----------
talking about is how people are


---------33:04----------
perceived by others right


---------33:06----------
so irrespective of whether I identify as


---------33:09----------
a Republican or a tea party person or in


---------33:12----------
a fundamental event or a game or


---------33:15----------
whatever that I'm still gonna be shunted


---------33:17----------
into one of two buckets by everyone that


---------33:19----------
meet because that's how human beings


---------33:20----------
operate and since I'm somewhere in the


---------33:23----------
middle


---------33:23----------
I should be shunted onto both ends of


---------33:26----------
the spectrum by a hundred random people


---------33:28----------
and I should have like a while like


---------33:30----------
people should be calling me Democrats


---------33:31----------
and Republicans and like that should


---------33:33----------
happen it doesn't matter whether I


---------33:35----------
identify with a particular group or I


---------33:38----------
came up with my own philosophy other


---------33:40----------
people are gonna still shunt me right


---------33:42----------
that's what you're sure yeah so then if


---------33:44----------
that's the case then like why do people


---------33:46----------
treat you differently from other people


---------33:49----------
um because everyone's shunting yeah


---------33:54----------
every one shot maybe maybe because I'm


---------33:56----------
more like visible in the space and maybe


---------33:58----------
more like I guess like unapologetic


---------34:02----------
about what I believe like maybe it's


---------34:03----------
possible that any twitch streamer that


---------34:05----------
did politics full-time would also be


---------34:07----------
hard core divided uh you know between


---------34:10----------
different people but I mean cuz this is


---------34:12----------
kind of like I don't know how much you


---------34:13----------
know about my content I'm sorry like my


---------34:14----------
main draw is probably political


---------34:16----------
conversations that's what I'm most


---------34:17----------
well-known for so that that's probably


---------34:18----------
why I I'm more divisive in that sense


---------34:21----------
than other twitch streamers because not


---------34:23----------
many others do that


---------34:24----------
full-time maybe yeah so so okay sure so


---------34:27----------
I think that sort of makes sense right


---------34:28----------
like you're saying that by virtue of the


---------34:30----------
kinds of conversations that I engage in


---------34:32----------
so like let's think about it


---------34:34----------
scientifically sure so a hundred people


---------34:36----------
mechant you right or left but the


---------34:38----------
problem that you're more divisive is


---------34:40----------
because the hundred people that you're


---------34:41----------
talking to is a more diverse set than


---------34:44----------
the hundred people that other people


---------34:45----------
expose themselves to yeah that's


---------34:47----------
entirely possible sure that's good yeah


---------34:48----------
but I mean is that what you think yeah


---------34:51----------
so I might talk to people that are


---------34:52----------
literally like literal neo-nazis and I


---------34:54----------
might also talk to people that are


---------34:56----------
literal like communists like Stalin


---------34:57----------
defenders so as a result of


---------34:59----------
conversations both of these people you


---------35:01----------
get to see way more device than us in my


---------35:03----------
opinions that gives everybody a good


---------35:04----------
reason to absolutely hate me yeah more


---------35:06----------
so than maybe what the average stream or


---------35:07----------
even would yeah so do you think that


---------35:09----------
most people's and and this could be by


---------35:12----------
virtue of you know my methodologies I


---------35:14----------
shared which was going on your subreddit


---------35:16----------
and then I'm sorting by top them all


---------35:19----------
time and then looking at a few links and


---------35:21----------
you know my sense is that like no one's


---------35:23----------
talking about your political beliefs um


---------35:26----------
it really just depends on what we're


---------35:28----------
doing at any particular point in time so


---------35:31----------
like over the past like month and a half


---------35:32----------
or


---------35:33----------
two months I've been playing a lot of


---------35:34----------
League of Legends so there's not much


---------35:35----------
like politics going on but I would say


---------35:37----------
like the stuff that I'm most well known


---------35:39----------
for on the Internet and then my biggest


---------35:40----------
viewership draw is usually when we're


---------35:42----------
doing like political content so it's


---------35:44----------
usually debates I'm having with either


---------35:45----------
people that defend Stalin Russia or


---------35:48----------
people that are you know neo-nazis or


---------35:50----------
whatever like my conversation with


---------35:51----------
jontron or March shkreli or Lauren


---------35:53----------
southern like these big like these kind


---------35:55----------
of like big headliner debates or


---------35:56----------
whatever are probably my most viewed


---------35:58----------
content that the people are most


---------35:59----------
interested in it's when I get the most


---------36:00----------
viewers four so I get the most


---------36:02----------
engagement on okay


---------36:03----------
so um I'm gonna sort of switch gears


---------36:05----------
thank you for explaining that I'm


---------36:07----------
getting curious so one of the things


---------36:09----------
that popped up is this thing that


---------36:10----------
destiny is a sociopath yeah what does


---------36:14----------
that mean


---------36:18----------
I have a very I'm a relatively colder


---------36:20----------
detached person for most people and it's


---------36:23----------
people just described me that way


---------36:26----------
sometimes and then sometimes I rot eclis


---------36:28----------
refer to it that way myself but what do


---------36:31----------
you mean by cold or detached um I'm just


---------36:35----------
not a very like emotional person I guess


---------36:37----------
like I don't get like I don't like cry a


---------36:39----------
lot or I don't you know like I'm kind of


---------36:42----------
like I don't wanna say like I'm a loner


---------36:44----------
I gotta have friends online a couple


---------36:46----------
friends that I talk to and I have like a


---------36:47----------
girlfriend but for the most part they


---------36:48----------
guide you like really well on my own I


---------36:49----------
functioned really well without like a


---------36:51----------
large group of people around me okay


---------36:55----------
so they call you a sociopath because


---------36:57----------
what become I don't know I think because


---------37:00----------
I evaluate things like very coldly yeah


---------37:05----------
okay yeah so like for instance Ike when


---------37:07----------
I look at like relationships for


---------37:08----------
instance whether they're business


---------37:10----------
whether they're romantic whether they're


---------37:12----------
friendships like I view everything like


---------37:13----------
highly transactional that's usually how


---------37:15----------
I try to like analyze those


---------37:16----------
relationships to make the most sense of


---------37:18----------
them yeah so what do you think that


---------37:22----------
means for someone's life who views as


---------37:25----------
good maybe to abstract of a question so


---------37:27----------
let me think about how to phrase it


---------37:28----------
better just state what my because I just


---------37:32----------
realized there's an implication to my


---------37:33----------
question sure and just think about this


---------37:39----------
so when you when you view relationships


---------37:43----------
more transactionally what effect does


---------37:45----------
that have on you


---------37:47----------
I don't again has any effect I think


---------37:48----------
it's incredibly positive I think it


---------37:50----------
gives me a really good view of


---------37:50----------
relationships but if I'm transparent


---------37:53----------
about that thought process then it seems


---------37:55----------
highly manipulative highly unemotional


---------37:58----------
very cold very detached and people get


---------38:00----------
very upset if I usually open up about


---------38:02----------
that yeah so let's start with the first


---------38:04----------
half of what you said I agree with you


---------38:05----------
that I think in it it feels really good


---------38:07----------
so you said something along those lines


---------38:10----------
you said it's highly positive right and


---------38:12----------
you said that oh yeah I think it's


---------38:14----------
really good yeah of course yeah so so


---------38:15----------
what's really good about it


---------38:17----------
it gives me well so I so generally I


---------38:22----------
favor having a greater understanding of


---------38:24----------
things that are true because I think the


---------38:26----------
more information I have about a given


---------38:27----------
situation the better act I can take to


---------38:29----------
maximise my own you know my own


---------38:32----------
enjoyment of said situation so the more


---------38:34----------
information I have the more power I have


---------38:35----------
to make decisions the benefit me so when


---------38:37----------
it comes to understanding relationships


---------38:38----------
where I understand them on a


---------38:39----------
transactional basis it feels like it


---------38:40----------
gives me the power to understand what do


---------38:42----------
I need to do to make this relationship


---------38:43----------
beneficial for me so when I engage with


---------38:45----------
another person my thought process is


---------38:47----------
usually something along lines of like I


---------38:49----------
want to get X Y or Z out of this person


---------38:51----------
so whether it's friendship whether it's


---------38:52----------
um playing games and Lea whether it's


---------38:53----------
you know some kind of busy relationship


---------38:55----------
in order to get that I need to make sure


---------38:57----------
that I am providing some level of value


---------38:59----------
or worth to that person that makes them


---------39:00----------
want to you know treat me in kind is


---------39:02----------
basically how I view it like a very some


---------39:04----------
people say there's like highly


---------39:05----------
transactional now personally I view


---------39:07----------
every single relationship in my life


---------39:08----------
this way you know I show a certain level


---------39:10----------
of kindness because I like a person that


---------39:11----------
I want to receive some reciprocated


---------39:13----------
kindness


---------39:14----------
you know I provide some you know level


---------39:16----------
of consultation or financial support or


---------39:18----------
business advice or whatever to somebody


---------39:19----------
in exchange for some sponsorship or


---------39:21----------
whatever [ __ ] right yeah this is


---------39:22----------
just basically how I view like all of


---------39:24----------
these types of relationships yeah yeah


---------39:25----------
and I think I mean it sounds like it's


---------39:27----------
very comforting for you to view


---------39:29----------
relationships in that way in terms of


---------39:30----------
like it's simple it's clean and you know


---------39:32----------
what you're getting and it's like and


---------39:34----------
highly descriptive and predictive yeah I


---------39:36----------
would say it's descriptive and


---------39:37----------
predictive sure um can you tell me a


---------39:39----------
little bit you said all of your


---------39:40----------
relationships are like this yeah I


---------39:42----------
believe so yeah and can you you said


---------39:45----------
that you grew up pretty independently


---------39:48----------
huh can you tell me a little bit about


---------39:49----------
what that means um


---------39:52----------
sure so let's see how we can do this my


---------39:56----------
parents were very busy growing up and I


---------39:58----------
was pretty kind of like left on my own


---------40:00----------
growing up so I kind of developed for


---------40:03----------
whatever reason I don't know why but I


---------40:05----------
and I was very very independent growing


---------40:08----------
up like I did things because I wanted


---------40:10----------
busy with my mom did a daycare 24/7 and


---------40:13----------
then my dad did whatever random multi


---------40:16----------
what do you mean by 24/7


---------40:17----------
you mean like she had it the daycare


---------40:18----------
kept people at night um yeah so it was


---------40:22----------
like a family home daycare I guess okay


---------40:24----------
so we had kids over it like anywhere


---------40:25----------
from I think 10 to 14 kids over the


---------40:27----------
house 24 hours a day seven days a week


---------40:29----------
okay and what about your dad um he did


---------40:32----------
multi-level marketing stuff okay random


---------40:35----------
yeah so what does that have to do with


---------40:37----------
what is his multi-level marketing like


---------40:38----------
help me understand so I don't know what


---------40:42----------
that means in terms of like assumptions


---------40:43----------
about what that uh about his pyramid you


---------40:45----------
know I know it means a pyramid scheme


---------40:47----------
but like yeah like so for example if


---------40:49----------
someone says yeah my dad was an attorney


---------40:51----------
versus like my dad drove a school bus


---------40:53----------
that gives me a sense of like that


---------40:55----------
parent's availability and like you know


---------40:58----------
it's an assumption could be wrong mm-hmm


---------41:00----------
but about like what influenced that


---------41:02----------
person like how much that person would


---------41:03----------
have been around


---------41:04----------
oh yeah the availability of both parents


---------41:06----------
was like pretty close to zero say for


---------41:08----------
like a family vacation like something it


---------41:10----------
was pretty low yeah and what did you do


---------41:13----------
you remember how you felt about that


---------41:15----------
growing up yeah I think early on in my


---------41:17----------
life I don't think I was very happy with


---------41:18----------
that I think about I made quite a bit


---------41:20----------
but for whatever reason after time the


---------41:22----------
feelings just like went away and I


---------41:23----------
became like more okay like just doing


---------41:25----------
things on my own yeah can you tell me


---------41:30----------
like around what age that happened I


---------41:33----------
wish I could it was before high school


---------41:36----------
but okay yeah I don't I don't know it's


---------41:39----------
a change happened before high school


---------41:41----------
yeah must have yeah like do you remember


---------41:43----------
being like in elementary school and and


---------41:45----------
thinking like you were a little bit


---------41:47----------
unhappy that your parents weren't around


---------41:50----------
as much yeah like I remember like in


---------41:51----------
third grade or fourth grade or something


---------41:53----------
like I would like walk around like


---------41:55----------
outside and I'd wonder like oh like if I


---------41:57----------
ran away with my parents like you even


---------41:58----------
noticed that I'm gone like those kinds


---------42:00----------
of thoughts which I imagine a pretty you


---------42:01----------
know


---------42:02----------
for kids that don't see much of their


---------42:03----------
parents but by the time like I got to


---------42:05----------
high school it's like an important thing


---------42:07----------
I remember in high school is like I


---------42:08----------
wanted to do music and I you know


---------42:10----------
decided to pick up the saxophone knowing


---------42:11----------
that like none of my parents are ever


---------42:13----------
coming to any of my concerts or anything


---------42:14----------
like that but I'm okay with that I


---------42:15----------
picked up music because I really loved


---------42:16----------
music and that's what I want to do so I


---------42:17----------
know for sure by the time I hit high


---------42:19----------
school none of it bothered anymore but


---------42:21----------
I'm sure that like for varying levels


---------42:23----------
from like first like sixth grade or


---------42:24----------
something


---------42:25----------
it must have bothered me a little bit


---------42:26----------
because I have memories like that but


---------42:27----------
for whatever reason the feelings just


---------42:28----------
kind of like went away okay what do you


---------42:33----------
think happens when feelings go away


---------42:35----------
um I mean a lot of things could happen I


---------42:39----------
mean like the two most common paths I


---------42:41----------
see is either one you confront them you


---------42:44----------
get an understanding of them and then


---------42:46----------
you integrate those feelings so that


---------42:48----------
you're capable of dealing with it going


---------42:49----------
forward


---------42:50----------
another way is you represent what she


---------42:52----------
did I mean I would like to think so


---------42:54----------
right yeah I would like to think that


---------42:56----------
but the alternative is that you


---------42:58----------
repressed them you pretend that they're


---------42:59----------
not bothering you but then they end up


---------43:00----------
manifesting in different ways in your


---------43:02----------
life later on I try to give like very


---------43:04----------
I'm trying to give you like very honest


---------43:06----------
answers yeah yeah yeah like I mean I


---------43:08----------
would like to think that like none of it


---------43:09----------
bothers know like I integrated it yeah


---------43:10----------
yeah yeah yeah so so I'm just a little


---------43:13----------
bit surprised because I you know like I


---------43:15----------
think your answers are a hundred percent


---------43:16----------
I mean I agree with you a hundred


---------43:17----------
percent and I think like so I think like


---------43:20----------
I said at the beginning I think my chat


---------43:21----------
and your chat are both gonna be


---------43:22----------
disappointed but so I think the thing


---------43:25----------
that the reason I think you saw me like


---------43:27----------
raising my eyebrows the thing the reason


---------43:28----------
you saw surprise in my face is not


---------43:30----------
because I disagree with your answers


---------43:31----------
it's just I I'm very surprised to hear


---------43:35----------
you sly cuz you describe confronting


---------43:37----------
your feelings processing your feelings


---------43:39----------
like internalizing them moving past them


---------43:41----------
metabolizing them like that makes


---------43:42----------
perfect sense to me and I don't know


---------43:45----------
many seven-year-olds who do that yeah I


---------43:48----------
mean like I don't think it happened when


---------43:50----------
I was seven I think it was more just


---------43:51----------
like an automated thing that happened


---------43:53----------
you know before I got to high school yes


---------43:57----------
that's kind of weird because okay so so


---------44:01----------
like when you kind of say that like you


---------44:03----------
confront them and and kind of like


---------44:04----------
process them and stuff like that that


---------44:06----------
sounds like a very like active process


---------44:08----------
right it's like an active mental process


---------44:10----------
and it's almost like the process that


---------44:12----------
you describe when someone criticizes you


---------44:14----------
like it


---------44:15----------
thought and you analyze it and you kind


---------44:17----------
of see where it's coming from is it


---------44:18----------
valid is it invalid and yet when you


---------44:20----------
talk about what happened to you it


---------44:23----------
sounds anything but intentional it


---------44:25----------
sounds because you kind of uses this


---------44:26----------
language like oh it just kind of like


---------44:28----------
happened on its own sort of like


---------44:29----------
happened like automatically like I don't


---------44:31----------
know like I was this way when I was


---------44:32----------
growing up and then older like I was


---------44:34----------
just I was different it was like no


---------44:35----------
longer a big deal yeah I like the the


---------44:39----------
reason why I try to be careful my


---------44:40----------
answers is like if you were asked me


---------44:41----------
five years ago I would have said all of


---------44:42----------
it was a very intentional but if I'm


---------44:44----------
totally honest looking back I don't know


---------44:46----------
how much was intentional versus how much


---------44:47----------
was just kind of lucky so like for


---------44:49----------
instance I can growing up a lot of the


---------44:51----------
video games I played were Japanese RPGs


---------44:53----------
the main characters tended to be like


---------44:55----------
very intelligent which is some you don't


---------44:56----------
find in a lot of American media and then


---------44:58----------
they also had like traditional masculine


---------44:59----------
archetypes as well they tend to be very


---------45:01----------
independent they tended to help other


---------45:02----------
artists um like Final Fantasy games


---------45:05----------
Final Fantasy seven eight nine funding


---------45:06----------
psychics the Metal Gear Solid games like


---------45:08----------
I love like snake Oh like yeah growing


---------45:09----------
up and I think I kind of sort of modeled


---------45:11----------
my myself off of those people I guess


---------45:14----------
right because they're heavy early


---------45:15----------
influences so like the idea of like oh


---------45:17----------
like being independent is like really


---------45:19----------
cool like I want to have that I think


---------45:20----------
being able to be independent is really


---------45:21----------
cool and then for whatever reason I


---------45:23----------
wasn't bothered by not getting constant


---------45:25----------
approval from like friends or family and


---------45:26----------
then that just kind of worked out so


---------45:28----------
that's what I mean when I say that like


---------45:30----------
I think that I kind of automatically


---------45:32----------
developed it in a healthy way and that I


---------45:33----------
don't think that I was like miserable


---------45:35----------
and I repressed it and I used games as a


---------45:37----------
retreat the depressed sure but I don't


---------45:38----------
think it's fully honest to say sure that


---------45:40----------
my ten year old self was like you know I


---------45:42----------
had the problem yeah yeah so so like


---------45:45----------
like so you like you grew up like cloud


---------45:48----------
Cloud Strife you sure yeah well it


---------45:51----------
would've been like the modeling when I


---------45:52----------
was it yeah sure so so how do you think


---------45:54----------
Cloud Strife would respond to parents


---------45:57----------
being like super unavailable to him


---------46:00----------
growing up um


---------46:03----------
oh god my seventh knowledge is being


---------46:06----------
tested well technically cloud grew up an


---------46:08----------
orphan although it seemed to me that


---------46:10----------
cloud dealt with that in a very


---------46:11----------
unhealthy way because he was very very


---------46:13----------
rude towards other people and seemed to


---------46:15----------
always have a chip on his shoulder about


---------46:16----------
it yeah so yeah I mean I would say cloud


---------46:18----------
probably would hate that but he dealt


---------46:20----------
with it in a very unhealthy way yeah


---------46:22----------
wait what it seemed like he done with


---------46:26----------
he like always had like problems with


---------46:27----------
other people it wasn't until like Tifa


---------46:29----------
put his mind back together in the


---------46:30----------
lifestream like later on in the game


---------46:31----------
that he actually developed like a sense


---------46:33----------
of self and then wanted to do things for


---------46:34----------
other people and help the party I'm like


---------46:36----------
everything done or whatever for the game


---------46:37----------
yeah so so I'm sorry you said that cloud


---------46:41----------
dealt with it in a poor way it seemed


---------46:43----------
like it growing up it's like when he was


---------46:44----------
always like kind of an [ __ ] and a


---------46:45----------
jerk to people and yeah so like was kind


---------46:47----------
of a divisive figure had a lot of people


---------46:49----------
like upset with him no I would say that


---------46:51----------
he was objectively like an [ __ ] like


---------46:53----------
and the goals that he had at his life


---------46:55----------
weird kind of shitty or whatever like he


---------46:56----------
just wanted to be strong and be a


---------46:57----------
soldier cuz that's what all the cool


---------46:59----------
people whatever and then yeah yeah and


---------47:00----------
you kind of model to yourself after him


---------47:02----------
aspects of my character are aspects of


---------47:05----------
my personality after those types of


---------47:07----------
people out imagine yeah yeah so like I


---------47:08----------
don't I can't envision cloud ever being


---------47:12----------
upset with his parents for dropping off


---------47:15----------
it and dropping him off at an orphanage


---------47:17----------
um yeah I guess later in life probably


---------47:19----------
not sure yeah yeah I mean it almost


---------47:23----------
sounds like you kind of grew up almost


---------47:25----------
like an orphan in some ways um that's a


---------47:29----------
really dramatic way of putting it I


---------47:30----------
guess in some ways yeah it absolutely is


---------47:32----------
it's hyperbole sure yeah what do you


---------47:36----------
think about that I


---------47:39----------
don't have strong feelings about it one


---------47:40----------
way or another I mean how did you grow


---------47:42----------
up you know I put a lot of video games


---------47:45----------
yeah yeah so it sounds like your parents


---------47:49----------
weren't around I mean they were they


---------47:52----------
were around I've got to be really


---------47:53----------
responsible cuz I was like some guy is


---------47:54----------
listen to this who's a literal [ __ ]


---------47:56----------
orphan who's like hating me for saying


---------47:57----------
this cuz I did it like my mom and dad


---------47:58----------
like absolutely love me like no


---------48:00----------
questions asked like I'm pretty sure


---------48:01----------
they would like if I came out as like um


---------48:04----------
like cuz my mom always tells me she


---------48:06----------
loves me she's like always excited for


---------48:08----------
you know she doesn't have anything mean


---------48:10----------
to say about me she's always excited for


---------48:11----------
what I do with my streaming stuff if I


---------48:12----------
call and talk to my parents they're


---------48:13----------
always excited to talk to me they've


---------48:15----------
never liked that we had a lot of


---------48:16----------
problems and I became an atheist in high


---------48:18----------
school but like I've never gotten the


---------48:19----------
feeling that my parents hate me ever and


---------48:21----------
my mom expressions like so great yeah my


---------48:23----------
mom says a lot of regret over not taking


---------48:25----------
a more active role in my life growing up


---------48:27----------
it's something that like makes her


---------48:27----------
really sad so how do you feel about that


---------48:30----------
um my parents are are insanely [ __ ]


---------48:34----------
conservative so I'm kind of grateful for


---------48:37----------
it


---------48:37----------
yeah like I kind of worried if I would


---------48:40----------
have grown up to be more like my parents


---------48:41----------
if I would have ran into a lot of


---------48:42----------
problems like it sounds kind of shitty


---------48:44----------
to say to my mom and I love her to death


---------48:45----------
but like the independence that I got


---------48:47----------
from them has equipped me for I mean for


---------48:49----------
this job if nothing else holy [ __ ] more


---------48:51----------
than anything else that I could have


---------48:52----------
learned from them individually yeah so I


---------48:56----------
mean at all I mean thank God that you


---------48:59----------
they didn't have time for you yeah kind


---------49:02----------
of yeah man if my mother saw this I love


---------49:04----------
your mom so much yeah I think I love


---------49:06----------
your mom yeah she loves you and I think


---------49:10----------
it's a very strange thing for a person


---------49:12----------
to say I'm really grateful that my


---------49:14----------
parents didn't have time for me yeah


---------49:16----------
100% holy [ __ ] I think that the sense of


---------49:19----------
Independence that I got growing up is my


---------49:20----------
most valuable asset and it's something


---------49:22----------
that I think yeah is so important to me


---------49:23----------
and I think that that makes perfect


---------49:26----------
logical sense I'm just trying to think


---------49:28----------
about like the alternative right so if


---------49:30----------
you if you aren't grateful to your


---------49:32----------
parents for not having time to you how


---------49:34----------
would you feel um that's a hard one I


---------49:39----------
mean these manifests of so many


---------49:40----------
different ways I mean some people spend


---------49:42----------
their lives like kind of like seeking


---------49:44----------
the like a replacement for a parent like


---------49:46----------
maybe you go and look for a girl that


---------49:47----------
resembles somebody that would take care


---------49:49----------
of you and that's the kind of thing


---------49:50----------
you're after or maybe you look for


---------49:52----------
somebody


---------49:53----------
like give you constant after my drop I'm


---------49:55----------
not talking about like some weird


---------49:57----------
psychological thing down the road I'm


---------49:58----------
just saying like if you're eight years


---------49:59----------
old and your your mom is busy taking


---------50:01----------
care of like eight other kids mm-hmm


---------50:04----------
like how do you think that kid feels


---------50:06----------
like a like a normal kid or like near


---------50:09----------
our normal kid um you it seems like a


---------50:15----------
lot of people get really resentful other


---------50:16----------
parents if they don't paid enough


---------50:17----------
attention to them so yeah I imagine you


---------50:19----------
were you were a normal kid back then


---------50:21----------
right you started to become a non normal


---------50:24----------
kid later when you had your


---------50:25----------
transformation which happens sometimes


---------50:28----------
I mean that's what you're telling me my


---------50:30----------
hardest name yeah you used to you used


---------50:33----------
to have some of those feelings of


---------50:34----------
feeling like neglected or lonely or


---------50:36----------
whatever from your parents and then like


---------50:38----------
something happened sometime around the


---------50:39----------
middle school years you started to


---------50:41----------
really like focus on being more like


---------50:43----------
cloud and there's these other like male


---------50:45----------
role models who were like emotionally


---------50:47----------
suppressing or like focused on self


---------50:50----------
growth and independent and self-reliant


---------50:52----------
and then you kind of became the


---------50:54----------
self-reliant human being that who's all


---------50:56----------
of their relationships are transactional


---------50:58----------
and has like kind of a lack of emotional


---------51:00----------
connection with others uh-huh right


---------51:02----------
until you enter the live stream which


---------51:04----------
will see you if and when that happens


---------51:06----------
but sure right yeah I yeah I think so


---------51:11----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------51:12----------
so I mean it yeah so real quick just to


---------51:17----------
be very clear I try to be brutally


---------51:19----------
honest with with how I do myself I can


---------51:22----------
tell you very clearly like why I thought


---------51:26----------
the things that I did from like probably


---------51:28----------
16 17 years onward it's a lot harder for


---------51:30----------
me to give you resolute answers about


---------51:31----------
like my particular state of mind or high


---------51:33----------
FL for something that's that's why it


---------51:35----------
feels like I'm giving you a wishy-washy


---------51:37----------
answer gonna try to avoid answering


---------51:38----------
something that's just trying to be


---------51:39----------
honest like I don't know like 100


---------51:41----------
percent maybe I was a little I'm not


---------51:42----------
getting the perspective that you're


---------51:43----------
wishy-washy at all in fact I think it


---------51:45----------
answers are very very clear okay


---------51:47----------
very kind of you clearly yeah yeah why


---------51:50----------
do you think your answers are


---------51:51----------
wishy-washy well cuz sometimes in people


---------51:53----------
it feels like sometimes people want more


---------51:55----------
exact answers sometimes and if I give an


---------51:57----------
answer with them it's it's like a habit


---------51:59----------
that I've gotten into from debating so


---------52:00----------
many people like for instance like my


---------52:02----------
girlfriend might ask something like um


---------52:03----------
this sounds really bad but she was like


---------52:05----------
do you think we'll still be together in


---------52:06----------
a year


---------52:06----------
and my answer that was always maybe like


---------52:08----------
I mean I hope so we should be but like I


---------52:10----------
can't sound like with 100% certainty


---------52:12----------
because you might go [ __ ] crazy I


---------52:13----------
don't know I like it so like I tend to


---------52:14----------
answer like every question there's


---------52:16----------
nothing to read into there sorry I try


---------52:18----------
to you know what I'm trying to read into


---------52:19----------
is like like like you when I'm asking


---------52:22----------
when we're talking about your and my


---------52:24----------
interaction you have this tendency to


---------52:26----------
talk about what feels to me to be like


---------52:28----------
completely irrelevant examples sure like


---------52:32----------
you can just you offer a lot of examples


---------52:34----------
like I'm just curious like why you think


---------52:37----------
that I think that your answers are


---------52:39----------
unclear because you're you're you know


---------52:42----------
you're a clear spoken guy I know you're


---------52:43----------
clear spoken guy I've asked you several


---------52:46----------
times over the course of like the last


---------52:47----------
half hour or 45 minutes if this is what


---------52:49----------
you believe it seems like we're on the


---------52:51----------
same page I think yeah I'm probably


---------52:53----------
honestly because I'm so used to speaking


---------52:55----------
to chat that it's this is more like a


---------52:57----------
public experience so I guess I'm trying


---------52:59----------
to clarify partially for that as well


---------53:01----------
but I'll try to focus more on just that


---------53:03----------
and ignore like outside clarifications


---------53:04----------
because I think you're understanding


---------53:05----------
most of what I'm saying I'm just I'm


---------53:07----------
still in the habit of like over


---------53:08----------
clarifying everything I say like with


---------53:09----------
the orphan thing earlier for instance to


---------53:11----------
make sure that people don't think that I


---------53:12----------
have the understanding that I'm like an


---------53:13----------
actual orphan because I know that would


---------53:15----------
like to spend a lot of whatever be like


---------53:16----------
okay I'll try to be more like just one


---------53:18----------
so so let's just no I mean that's I


---------53:20----------
think it's you know it's interesting


---------53:22----------
that the wishy-washy the reason for the


---------53:24----------
wishy-washy nough supper ception where


---------53:26----------
she washing is seems to be also changing


---------53:28----------
like at first it was about because


---------53:30----------
sometimes your ambiguous and you want to


---------53:33----------
clarify things and use the example of


---------53:34----------
your girlfriend and when I say our I


---------53:36----------
don't think that's the case then you say


---------53:37----------
it's like it's because of chat and I'm


---------53:39----------
trying to make sure that chad


---------53:40----------
understands and i'm half talking to them


---------53:42----------
so it seems like there are a lot of


---------53:43----------
reasons why i want to clarify


---------53:47----------
yeah for sure yeah okay okay so can you


---------53:52----------
tell me a little bit about i mean do you


---------53:54----------
have memories of like when you were


---------53:56----------
young and like times that you got upset


---------54:02----------
[Music]


---------54:05----------
times that I kind of sound I was young


---------54:07----------
yeah anything saying oh yeah of course


---------54:10----------
some stuff does I had a very strange


---------54:14----------
relationship with my with my grandma I


---------54:17----------
spent a lot of time


---------54:19----------
I swear to God my growing up there's


---------54:22----------
like just really weird [ __ ]


---------54:23----------
but so my family that okay my grandma


---------54:27----------
but for the most part my life is pretty


---------54:29----------
good okay my grandma is very okay


---------54:32----------
she had weird problems she like she


---------54:35----------
would buy a dog and she would like kill


---------54:37----------
it in like a year and she did this like


---------54:38----------
[ __ ] 20 times I don't know why I'm


---------54:40----------
where she would she would basically she


---------54:41----------
they go to the pound she get a dog and


---------54:43----------
she would carry it for about six to


---------54:46----------
twelve months and then she would say


---------54:47----------
like oh it's sick I need to go put it


---------54:49----------
down and I don't want to give it to


---------54:50----------
somebody else cuz I think it might be


---------54:51----------
hurt or whatever and I remember that


---------54:52----------
when I was when I was pretty young maybe


---------54:55----------
around like fifth grade I think she did


---------54:56----------
this to two dogs that me and my little


---------54:58----------
sister were like very attached to I


---------54:59----------
remember


---------55:00----------
obviously being incredibly upset when


---------55:01----------
that happened cuz they were like my two


---------55:03----------
dogs that I like the most but then after


---------55:05----------
that I kind of stopped caring so much


---------55:06----------
about each individual dog because I knew


---------55:08----------
that it was it had like a 12 month timer


---------55:10----------
on it basically yeah that's interesting


---------55:13----------
so so you used to care about things and


---------55:15----------
then what did you what did you learn


---------55:18----------
sounds like you learned something um I


---------55:22----------
guess we're trying to say that I learned


---------55:25----------
not to get attached to anything or I


---------55:27----------
mean in this particular saying yeah like


---------55:30----------
you used to form emotional attachments


---------55:32----------
with like living organisms and then you


---------55:34----------
sort of realize that forming attachments


---------55:36----------
with living organisms leads to pain and


---------55:38----------
so you better learn how to like not care


---------55:41----------
about the dog anymore um yeah I guess we


---------55:44----------
could say that sure yeah


---------55:47----------
and what about with your parents never


---------55:54----------
did anything on the level of like doing


---------55:56----------
it of course of course yeah I mean do


---------55:59----------
you remember sort of times actually let


---------56:02----------
me ask you kind of a different question


---------56:03----------
so do you remember times that like does


---------56:05----------
anything stick out let's say like before


---------56:07----------
seventh grade about when your parents


---------56:08----------
were super proud of you


---------56:10----------
but you sort of really did feel like


---------56:12----------
they made time or when did they make


---------56:14----------
time for you let's put it that way I


---------56:16----------
don't think so I remember there was one


---------56:20----------
time I was in a hotel and I made a


---------56:21----------
reference to something that I'd read


---------56:23----------
online that where I said like oh look


---------56:25----------
like they have mirrors in the hotel and


---------56:27----------
that makes the room look bigger and my


---------56:29----------
dad I actually remember this comment for


---------56:30----------
my entire life my I said wow you're real


---------56:31----------
smart kid and I think that's the only


---------56:33----------
time he's ever assessing to me like that


---------56:34----------
and I think I actually felt like really


---------56:35----------
good when I heard that but otherwise I


---------56:37----------
don't think they typically my mom like


---------56:39----------
always gives compliments so they don't


---------56:41----------
really mean anything to me


---------56:42----------
I'm like showers near that side whatever


---------56:44----------
yeah can you remember a time where they


---------56:47----------
made time for you um yeah we went back


---------56:50----------
so before I was like I think before I


---------56:53----------
was my timelines are so bad before I was


---------56:55----------
like 14 or 15 mom we had like a very


---------56:58----------
upper middle-class lifestyle when my mom


---------57:00----------
was doing the daycare and we would go


---------57:02----------
like on like every year every other year


---------57:04----------
we would take like a family vacation to


---------57:05----------
like Disney World or whatever we would


---------57:07----------
do stuff like that so I mean I would say


---------57:08----------
that was like making time for me yeah


---------57:10----------
hmm do you ever remember them doing


---------57:13----------
things outside of the norm like periods


---------57:15----------
where you were either really good or


---------57:17----------
really bad and they sort of like treated


---------57:19----------
you differently because of it um I don't


---------57:23----------
think so the the worst things that I


---------57:26----------
probably did growing up where I was very


---------57:28----------
antagonistic towards my sister which


---------57:29----------
bothered the [ __ ] out of my mom a dad


---------57:31----------
quite a bit I think that's pretty normal


---------57:32----------
for siblings very humble like yeah but


---------57:34----------
other than that no I think can you tell


---------57:37----------
me about your sister um she's just like


---------57:42----------
my little sister


---------57:43----------
okay what's your like I don't really


---------57:48----------
talk to any my family much I just don't


---------57:50----------
it's not that kind of person I guess we


---------57:53----------
should it sounds like they didn't talk


---------57:55----------
to you much um no that's not true they


---------57:57----------
my mom and dad make an effort to reach


---------57:59----------
out I try to talk to my mom like at


---------58:00----------
least once what about God loves you a


---------58:06----------
lot it sounds like she's very excited


---------58:07----------
and happy for your success it sounds


---------58:09----------
like you know on the occasions that you


---------58:11----------
all do interact she's very supportive


---------58:13----------
and loves you a lot and you love her and


---------58:15----------
at the same time it also sounds like


---------58:17----------
they kind of haven't been a part of your


---------58:19----------
life in a very like day-to-day kind of


---------58:22----------
chitchat share


---------58:24----------
experiences with Ferb basically your


---------58:27----------
entire life yeah my mom regrets it but I


---------58:31----------
mean I yeah yeah yeah I mean I good for


---------58:35----------
you it's always been normal


---------58:37----------
yeah for sure it's been normal to have


---------58:47----------
so earlier used a word transactional


---------58:49----------
would you say that your relationships


---------58:51----------
with your parents were transactional


---------58:53----------
when you were growing up um I don't


---------58:58----------
think it would have viewed relationships


---------59:00----------
like that back then and then those are


---------59:01----------
either yeah what do you think now like


---------59:06----------
I'm just trying to put myself so I have


---------59:07----------
two kids and I'm just trying to put


---------59:09----------
myself of like what the [ __ ] would my


---------59:11----------
relationship with my children be like if


---------59:13----------
there were eight other kids at home and


---------59:15----------
I would think that it would be like


---------59:17----------
quite businesslike because I don't have


---------59:19----------
time to like read them a story sure I'd


---------59:22----------
so like like meals would be sort of like


---------59:24----------
an assembly line like your house is a


---------59:27----------
very has a very assembly line feel to me


---------59:29----------
yeah there was a nap time there was a


---------59:30----------
feeding time there was a time when a


---------59:32----------
teacher came oh yeah and like whether


---------59:33----------
what you felt like or what your needs


---------59:35----------
were a moment-to-moment we're sort of


---------59:37----------
like completely swept under the but like


---------59:39----------
just just swept under the just the


---------59:44----------
simple need of like making the reigns


---------59:47----------
the trains run on time I can autumn and


---------59:50----------
and so you know and I I think it sounds


---------59:54----------
like that used to upset you but at some


---------59:56----------
point you sort of figured out that like


---------59:58----------
me being upset doesn't actually do me


---------60:01----------
any good yeah I guess so


---------60:03----------
yeah and so you started to like treat


---------60:07----------
yourself very independently you started


---------60:09----------
to treat people pretty transactionally


---------60:11----------
because having kind of like an emotional


---------60:13----------
relationship or an emotional investment


---------60:16----------
in a situation that is not going to


---------60:18----------
change is like completely idiotic


---------60:20----------
and that essentially essentially like


---------60:23----------
emotions are just gonna lead to


---------60:25----------
suffering when they lead to


---------60:26----------
relationships which is because the only


---------60:28----------
thing that you can really count on the


---------60:30----------
only thing that you can rely on and the


---------60:32----------
only thing that has predictive value for


---------60:35----------
making a change is sort of a


---------60:36----------
transactional selfish sort of


---------60:38----------
perspective to relationships because you


---------60:40----------
can count on other people's


---------60:41----------
self-interest but if you love them and


---------60:44----------
they love you that doesn't count for


---------60:46----------
[ __ ] yeah 100 percent make sense man


---------60:50----------
yeah makes


---------60:52----------
perfect sense sure any thoughts about


---------60:56----------
what I just said I'm not that gets


---------60:59----------
descriptive of how I view the world like


---------61:00----------
pretty well so one of the reasons why I


---------61:02----------
went into music yeah I always considered


---------61:04----------
a realing point to have a hobby that I


---------61:05----------
couldn't draw on my own without having


---------61:06----------
to rely on any other person to be there


---------61:07----------
and then yeah I'm very aware that like


---------61:10----------
any relationship I'm in I try to make


---------61:11----------
sure that it's as beneficial for the


---------61:13----------
other person as it needs to be for them


---------61:14----------
to maintain the relationship yeah it's


---------61:15----------
pretty much my outlook on really ships


---------61:17----------
in general yeah yeah and and you think


---------61:24----------
you okay so let me just stop for a


---------61:26----------
second let me think yeah sure destiny do


---------61:29----------
you have any thoughts about the way in


---------61:30----------
which I'm phrasing things are you


---------61:32----------
detecting any implications in my words


---------61:34----------
do you have any mom what I'm saying or


---------61:37----------
you think I can read it to it that way


---------61:38----------
but I didn't sound like you have the


---------61:40----------
same type of judgmental implications


---------61:42----------
that I would expect a person to so yeah


---------61:43----------
and what kind of judgmental implications


---------61:45----------
of that for those um generally that this


---------61:48----------
way of thinking is either autistic or


---------61:50----------
sociopathic that it misses a lot of the


---------61:52----------
underlying important aspects of human


---------61:54----------
interactions in it no no no I think I


---------61:56----------
think that this this way of interacting


---------61:59----------
I think is learned adaptive and vital


---------62:02----------
for survival sure I I I'm sorry just to


---------62:05----------
be clear I don't think you're thinking


---------62:06----------
about I'm saying that's what a lot of


---------62:07----------
people yeah and I'm telling you what I


---------62:09----------
think which is that this way of


---------62:11----------
approaching the world is adaptive


---------62:13----------
learned and vital for survival yeah I


---------62:17----------
mean obviously I would agree yeah why do


---------62:19----------
you agree with that well I mean I would


---------62:22----------
have to agree that it's adaptive because


---------62:24----------
it seems like it adapted to the


---------62:26----------
environment I had growing up it seems


---------62:28----------
key for survival because I think it's


---------62:30----------
got me like to great accomplishments in


---------62:32----------
terms of my career and everything and


---------62:34----------
then it's learned obviously because I I


---------62:36----------
think must be everything learned to him


---------62:37----------
yeah yeah so destiny I'm gonna kind of


---------62:40----------
give you and maybe you've sort of


---------62:41----------
figured out my punchline but I think you


---------62:43----------
know I think the way you feel makes


---------62:45----------
perfect sense so I think this is this is


---------62:47----------
what I understand this is my running


---------62:50----------
hypothesis for how life shaped you to be


---------62:53----------
the way that you are so I think that


---------62:56----------
early on you experienced a lot of


---------62:58----------
emotions like a kid normally one and


---------62:59----------
that your life was just structured in


---------63:02----------
such a way where your emotions were your


---------63:04----------
emotional needs were probably


---------63:06----------
not met because they couldn't be met


---------63:08----------
because your parents were too busy and I


---------63:10----------
think that hurt you for a while and I


---------63:12----------
think that you did what most children or


---------63:15----------
young adults do which is adapt to the


---------63:18----------
situation but I I think unfortunately


---------63:22----------
most of those adaptations are not like


---------63:24----------
the challenging processing metabolising


---------63:27----------
most of them are suppression so yeah for


---------63:29----------
sure and and that since you basically


---------63:32----------
had parents who are not it's not that


---------63:34----------
they didn't love you it's just like the


---------63:35----------
circumstances made it so that they could


---------63:37----------
not meet your emotional needs and so I


---------63:39----------
think early on somewhere along the way


---------63:41----------
you probably had and you remember some


---------63:44----------
things you don't remember others but I


---------63:45----------
think the grandmother example is a prime


---------63:46----------
example you learned the very important


---------63:49----------
lesson that emotions are a [ __ ] waste


---------63:51----------
of time and that they just need to be


---------63:55----------
removed in whatever way they can right


---------63:58----------
so like my personal point of view yeah


---------64:00----------
yeah I'm talking I'm talking about I'm


---------64:03----------
talking about this like how you're the


---------64:05----------
Chum that the mind of your child self


---------64:08----------
evolved and they were like let's just


---------64:10----------
remove emotions from the equation


---------64:12----------
because as long as emotions are there we


---------64:14----------
get hurt and then over time you started


---------64:17----------
to discover that like when you remove


---------64:18----------
emotions from the equation that that


---------64:20----------
relationships become transactional right


---------64:22----------
because that's what happens I think the


---------64:24----------
real challenge is that now at this point


---------64:27----------
the reason that you don't feel emotions


---------64:29----------
is because you essentially are


---------64:32----------
suppressing them because that's


---------64:34----------
something that's that's like that


---------64:36----------
concrete was pretty it was laid down


---------64:38----------
when you were a kid and you have


---------64:40----------
everything in your life sort of points


---------64:41----------
to that and now the real challenge is


---------64:44----------
that your current worldview is so


---------64:48----------
adaptive that the possibility of like


---------64:51----------
Rhian gauging with your emotions sort of


---------64:53----------
like changes everything that you believe


---------64:55----------
in everything that you've built your


---------64:56----------
life around so it's almost even further


---------64:59----------
adaptive to not explore that part or not


---------65:02----------
even question that because that [ __ ] has


---------65:04----------
been buried it's like nuclear waste that


---------65:06----------
got buried like you buried that [ __ ] the


---------65:08----------
second time that dog died and you were


---------65:10----------
like okay these are emotions and I think


---------65:12----------
that your brain is human so that you


---------65:15----------
have the amygdala and the limbic system


---------65:17----------
and that you're capable of feeling


---------65:19----------
emotion


---------65:19----------
that you feel sadness and you feel joy


---------65:21----------
but at the end of the day like those are


---------65:23----------
sort of relatively temporary


---------65:24----------
fluctuations that you experience like


---------65:26----------
those parts of your brain are active but


---------65:28----------
emotionally you you sort of don't have


---------65:30----------
that shits like buried because you


---------65:34----------
learned how to bury it because that's


---------65:35----------
what you needed to do and I think had


---------65:37----------
you done this later then it would make


---------65:39----------
more sense for this to be sort of like a


---------65:41----------
metabolism or digestion but that


---------65:43----------
essentially since it happened so young


---------65:45----------
it was sort of like a it was like a


---------65:47----------
reflexive protective response cuz that's


---------65:49----------
what kids do sure what do you think


---------65:52----------
about that I don't agree that at all


---------65:54----------
I've spent a great deal of time I think


---------65:56----------
about a year or two ago kind of


---------65:57----------
reflecting on kind of like the cold way


---------65:59----------
that I approach people and it's


---------66:01----------
something that I revisit like like quite


---------66:03----------
a bit you know I think about it every


---------66:04----------
now and then where I kind of wonder like


---------66:07----------
typically totally axing certain things


---------66:10----------
when your life is not good because


---------66:12----------
usually it's possible to engage with


---------66:14----------
them in a healthy manner such that you


---------66:15----------
limit the downsides and capitalize on


---------66:16----------
the upside so we're talking about like


---------66:18----------
emotional relationships here are being


---------66:19----------
more emotional with people I wonder


---------66:21----------
sometimes if there were like potential


---------66:23----------
upsides that I might be missing they


---------66:25----------
don't engage with people in that way I


---------66:27----------
just have a hard time coming up with


---------66:28----------
that yeah yeah so I don't think it's


---------66:31----------
about upsides so I think your strategy


---------66:33----------
has if we're talking about making a


---------66:35----------
probabilistic bet I think your strategy


---------66:38----------
has more upsides I just think it's


---------66:40----------
incomplete right so like exactly like I


---------66:43----------
could I could integrate some type of


---------66:45----------
emotional experience into my current


---------66:46----------
existence in a healthy and responsible


---------66:48----------
way using all of my prior adaptations


---------66:51----------
whatever to evaluate of those emotional


---------66:53----------
relationships are healthy or not I


---------66:54----------
wonder if that's something that I should


---------66:55----------
do I guess just so far I just haven't


---------66:57----------
felt the need for it because I don't


---------66:59----------
think there is a need so I think the


---------67:00----------
question is so this is not really a


---------67:02----------
great analogy but I think essentially


---------67:04----------
like you're going through life


---------67:05----------
colorblind and we sort of think about


---------67:09----------
color as being better than this so


---------67:12----------
there's like a value judgment there that


---------67:13----------
I don't necessarily agree with but that


---------67:15----------
there's there's like if you look at like


---------67:17----------
all these other people out there they're


---------67:20----------
operating with a particular like sense


---------67:23----------
that you just sort of don't have urge


---------67:25----------
and it's not that you're like lack you


---------67:27----------
lack emotions entirely it's just that


---------67:30----------
like your your perception of color it's


---------67:31----------
it's like dark outside so


---------67:33----------
you know your rods and cones like you


---------67:35----------
can still see some variants of color but


---------67:37----------
the amount of color saturation that you


---------67:38----------
get has a lot to do with the overall


---------67:40----------
ambient level of light and and I think


---------67:43----------
my sense of you is that you're someone


---------67:45----------
who's like in a low ambient level of


---------67:46----------
light so you do experience emotions but


---------67:48----------
you just don't experience the full range


---------67:50----------
and then the question from your


---------67:52----------
perspective is like is it worth it for


---------67:54----------
me to turn the lights on because if I


---------67:57----------
turn the lights on I'm gonna experience


---------67:58----------
a whole range of things and those may


---------68:00----------
not necessarily be good which is


---------68:02----------
absolutely correct I think the question


---------68:04----------
is whether you want to experience a


---------68:06----------
wider range of things than what you're


---------68:09----------
experiencing now yeah and that's kind of


---------68:11----------
the that's always been the central


---------68:12----------
question is like if I am missing out on


---------68:14----------
something you know is it worth it to


---------68:16----------
open myself up to those experiences


---------68:18----------
knowing that some might be better than


---------68:19----------
I've ever felt before and some might be


---------68:20----------
worse than I've ever felt before is that


---------68:22----------
something that's worth exploring and I


---------68:23----------
guess like so far I mean like I feel


---------68:26----------
like I'm pretty uniquely situated in


---------68:27----------
terms of my mental state of my job and I


---------68:30----------
feel like I have like such a high when I


---------68:31----------
say uniquely situated I mean that like I


---------68:32----------
feel like I'm uniquely equipped with my


---------68:34----------
level of Independence to deal with the


---------68:35----------
amount of negative feedback I got for


---------68:37----------
instance and I'm kind of worried if I


---------68:38----------
start trying to change up like too many


---------68:40----------
things like is that experience going to


---------68:41----------
change such that either it makes me


---------68:43----------
unsuited for this job or I lose like my


---------68:45----------
current level of what I would considered


---------68:47----------
to be like very high very content like


---------68:48----------
mental state is that something that I'm


---------68:50----------
willing to risk to try to experience a


---------68:53----------
wider array of emotions I guess how do


---------68:55----------
you feel about that um well know that


---------68:58----------
that's I guess like currently I feel I


---------69:00----------
feel like I get all of the love and


---------69:01----------
attention I need from people that I have


---------69:02----------
relationships with however transactional


---------69:04----------
they may be and then I also feel like I


---------69:06----------
mean you've been talking to streamers


---------69:08----------
holy [ __ ] every streamer is insanely


---------69:11----------
depressed and has I don't know how many


---------69:13----------
streamers you've gone through so far but


---------69:14----------
like every streamer that I know has


---------69:16----------
personally had at least one major


---------69:18----------
breakdown related to you know like


---------69:20----------
dealing with feedback and stuff and I've


---------69:22----------
never dealt with these problems and I


---------69:24----------
don't know if like becoming a more


---------69:25----------
emotional person okay so that would make


---------69:27----------
me more vulnerable to those types of


---------69:28----------
things absolutely would yeah yeah so I


---------69:31----------
mean I think you know using some some


---------69:34----------
video game terminology I think the main


---------69:35----------
question is whether you want to explore


---------69:37----------
so you have you have carved out a pretty


---------69:40----------
nice niche in your own world in terms of


---------69:43----------
I don't mean like success externally


---------69:45----------
just in terms of like the way


---------69:46----------
you interact with the world and there's


---------69:48----------
there's a world beyond that and so far I


---------69:52----------
think it can makes complete logical


---------69:54----------
sense that going outside of the known is


---------69:58----------
not really a good bet it's just about


---------70:02----------
your degree of adventurousness it's


---------70:04----------
about your degree of tolerating risk


---------70:06----------
it's about whether you're willing to


---------70:08----------
explore an aspect of life that I think


---------70:11----------
will make your life


---------70:12----------
we're not necessarily better but yeah


---------70:15----------
like richer right cuz we're talking


---------70:17----------
about other shades of cold we're talking


---------70:18----------
about experiences that other humans


---------70:20----------
don't have for another good example is


---------70:22----------
like the decision to have kids or not


---------70:23----------
have kids which i think is a life


---------70:25----------
transformative I mean it was for me not


---------70:29----------
to say that's better or worse it just


---------70:30----------
completely changes the [ __ ] ballgame


---------70:32----------
okay sign of that yeah yeah I mean so so


---------70:37----------
I mean I mean I think it changes


---------70:41----------
something in my mind I don't know that


---------70:43----------
it's actually relevant I have more of an


---------70:45----------
emotional reaction to that and it


---------70:46----------
include it incorporates more assumptions


---------70:48----------
but I don't I mean I think that most of


---------70:52----------
your emotions are were actively


---------70:53----------
suppressed in a very what what's called


---------70:57----------
an in kind of like an insecure


---------70:58----------
attachment growing up which is something


---------71:00----------
you can google but there's something


---------71:01----------
called attachment theory which sort of


---------71:03----------
talks a little bit about like how


---------71:06----------
children experience emotions and how


---------71:08----------
they like understand the world and that


---------71:09----------
you've essentially created like this


---------71:11----------
adaptive mechanism which by the way like


---------71:13----------
now getting to kind of like that the end


---------71:15----------
point so I don't think that your logical


---------71:17----------
argument for why you're such a divisive


---------71:19----------
figure sort of makes sense which is sort


---------71:21----------
of what I was implying because I don't


---------71:22----------
think it's because they see multiple


---------71:23----------
facets of you I think it's because they


---------71:25----------
they're picking up on something on this


---------71:28----------
realm which like makes people deeply


---------71:30----------
unsettled and makes them dislike you


---------71:32----------
you're just disliked and arguable and


---------71:35----------
also on the flip side liked by more like


---------71:38----------
more people than the average person I


---------71:39----------
don't think that's just because of the


---------71:41----------
political stuff you engage in although


---------71:42----------
that's a very good variable in the


---------71:45----------
equation I think it makes a lot of sense


---------71:47----------
I don't think many people expose


---------71:48----------
themselves to the variety of opinion


---------71:51----------
that you do primarily because you do


---------71:54----------
have this insulating armor right like


---------71:56----------
you can see you can expose yourself to


---------71:58----------
like more things because you're


---------72:00----------
kind of emotionally protected which


---------72:01----------
other people don't do so I think that


---------72:03----------
has a lot to do with it but I think


---------72:04----------
there's something there's something


---------72:05----------
visceral about people's and I think if


---------72:07----------
you stop and think about that I would


---------72:09----------
really be surprised if you disagree with


---------72:10----------
us there's some 100 centigrade one


---------72:12----------
there's something visceral so all this


---------72:14----------
stuff about like you know people are


---------72:15----------
like binary and they judge you this way


---------72:17----------
and this like I think that's fine but I


---------72:19----------
don't think it's about the political


---------72:20----------
spectrum I think it's visceral there's


---------72:22----------
something about you that like sets


---------72:24----------
people off in like a weird way and it


---------72:27----------
almost reminds me of something called


---------72:29----------
the uncanny valley which is this this


---------72:32----------
you're familiar the uncanny valley yeah


---------72:34----------
it's almost like uncanny valley level


---------72:37----------
which is sort of this idea that like if


---------72:38----------
we human beings for people who aren't


---------72:41----------
familiar with this concept you want


---------72:42----------
explain it yeah basically something is


---------72:44----------
not quite human but it's very very close


---------72:46----------
but that very small amount of not quite


---------72:48----------
human is so much more crazy and weird


---------72:50----------
and quite discomforting than if it was


---------72:52----------
just completely fake all together


---------72:54----------
yeah and so I mean I'm not saying that


---------72:56----------
that's what's it's kind of like a unfair


---------72:58----------
characterization or analogy I'm not


---------73:00----------
saying that you're not human but there


---------73:01----------
is something incredibly visceral and


---------73:03----------
emotional to people's from what I could


---------73:05----------
see initially there's something


---------73:07----------
incredibly visceral and emotional to


---------73:09----------
people's responses to you and I think


---------73:11----------
they're picking up on something and like


---------73:13----------
a flea watch this YouTube video about


---------73:15----------
someone who's like trying to convince


---------73:16----------
you with value of emotions and it was


---------73:17----------
like the guy didn't know what the [ __ ]


---------73:20----------
he was talking it up and I'm sorry for


---------73:24----------
being judgmental I didn't know let me


---------73:25----------
put real Oh me rephrase I didn't


---------73:27----------
understand what he was trying to say or


---------73:29----------
in my mind he didn't make it convinced I


---------73:30----------
think I actually I'm almost positive I


---------73:32----------
know exactly you're talking about but I


---------73:33----------
think what he was trying in a less


---------73:35----------
formal way to get what you were saying


---------73:36----------
is like maybe it's worth exploring like


---------73:37----------
some level of emotional attachment


---------73:38----------
because there might be some good there


---------73:40----------
that you're missing out completely by


---------73:41----------
shutting yourself from it or whatever


---------73:43----------
yeah I don't know anyway so being


---------73:46----------
charitable yeah but I mean I think the


---------73:48----------
destiny here like so here's what I'll


---------73:50----------
kind of leave you with do you have


---------73:51----------
questions by the way I'm saying leave


---------73:54----------
you with it yeah I mean I don't I mean I


---------73:59----------
don't think so what questions am I


---------74:00----------
supposed to have so here's what I'll


---------74:03----------
offer you I I don't know because I


---------74:05----------
wasn't sure if you were gonna be asking


---------74:06----------
me questions or I was gonna be asking


---------74:08----------
you questions it seemed like this was


---------74:09----------
like I was enjoying this seemed like you


---------74:10----------
were enjoying it yeah I think that you


---------74:13----------
know if it's um


---------74:14----------
you decide that you do want to explore


---------74:17----------
your emotional side then I'm happy to


---------74:20----------
have another conversation about that


---------74:22----------
I actually don't know how that's gonna


---------74:23----------
go like I really don't because this [ __ ]


---------74:25----------
seems pretty dick buried to me um at the


---------74:28----------
same time I do think that here's what I


---------74:33----------
do believe if you decide to explore it


---------74:35----------
because this has been my experience with


---------74:36----------
other people is that the armor that


---------74:39----------
you've essentially put on yourself is


---------74:42----------
something that is so ingrained that


---------74:44----------
you'll be able to like put that back on


---------74:47----------
like you can unequip it and you can


---------74:48----------
react with it so my experience for


---------74:51----------
people who learn habitually how to do


---------74:53----------
something is even if they learn how to


---------74:55----------
like stop doing it it's not like the


---------74:57----------
armor gets destroyed it just gets


---------74:59----------
unequipped and then you can react with


---------75:01----------
it and so I don't think I I think in my


---------75:04----------
my instinct tells me that if you were to


---------75:08----------
get connected to your emotions that the


---------75:10----------
net would be positive because generally


---------75:12----------
speaking in the work that I do I find


---------75:16----------
that exploring just about anything and


---------75:19----------
understanding yourself deeper and better


---------75:21----------
and having a greater experience of


---------75:24----------
yourself is almost always an


---------75:26----------
overwhelmingly positive experience sure


---------75:29----------
okay you're basically saying it's not


---------75:31----------
going to like it revocable changed me in


---------75:32----------
a way I don't think so because you know


---------75:34----------
that yeah I mean I think it could there


---------75:38----------
could be like rough patches here there


---------75:39----------
but I would put it like scientifically


---------75:41----------
that your neurons have been like


---------75:43----------
hard-coded in a non-emotional


---------75:46----------
transactional non empathic kind of state


---------75:49----------
and that you know like like this is this


---------75:52----------
something that's learned so it's not


---------75:54----------
like in the same way that like if you


---------75:56----------
start swimming you don't forget how to


---------75:57----------
learn how to ride a bike


---------75:59----------
it's just like if you're in the water


---------76:00----------
you're gonna swim and if you're on a


---------76:01----------
bike you're on a bike that's been my


---------76:03----------
experience


---------76:04----------
sure okay um yeah I only bring this up


---------76:11----------
bad cuz people are spending about it any


---------76:13----------
opinions but psychedelic drugs why the


---------76:15----------
[ __ ] this is the only question that


---------76:16----------
people ever ask me I've asked this


---------76:18----------
question like a thousand times


---------76:19----------
uh-huh okay so so this is what I'll say


---------76:25----------
so as a psychiatrist there are some


---------76:27----------
luminary studies which show that are


---------76:30----------
very promising that these psychedelics


---------76:32----------
some psychedelic compounds can have


---------76:34----------
positive effects on your mental health


---------76:36----------
yeah I believe mean in terms of like a


---------76:39----------
clinical setting I mean more of like I


---------76:41----------
don't want to say just recreational but


---------76:42----------
not like in a like treating like


---------76:43----------
depressive disorders forever but like in


---------76:45----------
like utilizing them to gain some insight


---------76:47----------
into your life we'd like a monster like


---------76:49----------
LSD or shroom trip or something to have


---------76:50----------
any thoughts so I don't advocate for


---------76:53----------
that and the reason is very simple so


---------76:55----------
one of my teachers so the first thing to


---------76:57----------
understand is that psychedelics can only


---------76:59----------
do what your brain is capable of doing


---------77:01----------
sure right so like I want everyone to


---------77:03----------
understand this because this is an


---------77:05----------
important point chemical compounds go


---------77:08----------
and activate existing brain machinery in


---------77:11----------
new ways or not even new ways but they


---------77:14----------
just activate the machinery that's


---------77:16----------
already there right so like for example


---------77:17----------
marijuana is a cannabinoid and gives us


---------77:22----------
a sense of like like relaxation or


---------77:24----------
whatever's there they're different


---------77:25----------
compounds in marijuana but we also have


---------77:29----------
endocannabinoids which when it comes to


---------77:32----------
like video games and habit circuitry we


---------77:34----------
release a lot of like so when you get


---------77:36----------
addicted to video games when you're


---------77:37----------
playing a video game like every day all


---------77:38----------
day at that point you're not even


---------77:40----------
getting like rewards it's not even


---------77:41----------
dopaminergic its cannabinoid at that


---------77:44----------
point which is why I like gamers have so


---------77:45----------
many so you're when you develop a habit


---------77:48----------
it's no longer dopamine that governs it


---------77:50----------
it's actually an endocannabinoid that


---------77:52----------
governs like the performance of habits


---------77:54----------
and endocannabinoids the reason that


---------77:56----------
habits are so easy to do is because they


---------77:58----------
don't require motivation and in turn


---------78:00----------
like gamers have a problem with


---------78:02----------
motivation because they have


---------78:03----------
endocannabinoids that are like floating


---------78:04----------
around in the brain like all the time so


---------78:06----------
it's kind of like they're sort of like


---------78:07----------
kind of chilled out or they're a


---------78:09----------
motivated my point here is that you can


---------78:11----------
smoke marijuana but like marijuana is


---------78:13----------
activating all of these endogenous like


---------78:16----------
circuitry's and LSD and things like that


---------78:19----------
are exactly the same so they activate


---------78:21----------
your brain in ways that we don't


---------78:23----------
normally activate it but that


---------78:25----------
essentially if you talk to people who do


---------78:27----------
psychedelics and you talk to people who


---------78:28----------
meditate a lot and you talk about and


---------78:31----------
you also talk about people who


---------78:32----------
dissociate during trauma there's a


---------78:34----------
remarkable amount of similarity between


---------78:37----------
these three experiences so you talked


---------78:39----------
about like like you know


---------78:41----------
a dissolution of the self people feel


---------78:43----------
connected it's the same way people feel


---------78:45----------
when they meditate sometimes and you can


---------78:47----------
have very powerful spiritual experiences


---------78:49----------
through meditation and so my my teacher


---------78:52----------
once told me that you know if you really


---------78:54----------
want to like understand like kind of the


---------78:56----------
nature of self and the boundaries of


---------78:57----------
reality and all this [ __ ]


---------78:58----------
meditation those kinds of things should


---------79:01----------
be avoided for a couple of reasons one


---------79:03----------
is that when you do that and then you


---------79:04----------
try to meditate it creates an


---------79:06----------
expectation of an experience that is


---------79:08----------
very difficult for meditation to live up


---------79:10----------
to and makes it harder to continue to


---------79:12----------
meditate the other way to think about it


---------79:15----------
is that I kind of think about like


---------79:17----------
climbing to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro


---------79:18----------
like you can take it you can take LSD


---------79:21----------
which is like getting in a helicopter


---------79:22----------
and flying to the top of the mountain


---------79:24----------
the view that you get is the same as if


---------79:26----------
you hiked one is way easier one is way


---------79:29----------
harder view is equally grand the problem


---------79:32----------
is that if you've trained yourself too


---------79:34----------
high to climb to the top of Mount


---------79:35----------
Kilimanjaro you're in a better state to


---------79:38----------
climb higher and with LSD or other


---------79:41----------
compounds you have no control over the


---------79:44----------
direction or where you land you just


---------79:46----------
like it's just you know like getting in


---------79:48----------
the chopper and the pilot decides I'm


---------79:50----------
gonna take you here I'm gonna take you


---------79:51----------
here I'm gonna take you here so I don't


---------79:53----------
advocate for the use of psychedelics if


---------79:55----------
you really want to understand like


---------79:56----------
yourself in the nature of reality


---------79:57----------
because I think it's sort of a crutch


---------79:59----------
that gets you it's like a cheat code


---------80:01----------
that kind of gets you to like a pretty


---------80:03----------
important milestone which people love


---------80:04----------
and find invigorating but if you really


---------80:06----------
want to go all the way you shouldn't use


---------80:08----------
meditation instead okay okay I got a


---------80:13----------
really big fight over yesterday I agree


---------80:15----------
100% I'm always really skeptical of


---------80:17----------
people that say that psychedelics are


---------80:18----------
good tool to solve problems it always


---------80:19----------
seemed like a substitution for your


---------80:20----------
inability to kind of deal with problems


---------80:22----------
without having to be hi-spec to do it so


---------80:25----------
I mean it is a substitution which is


---------80:27----------
what most medications are right so like


---------80:29----------
I'm like if we think about so I think


---------80:30----------
that they can have a role in treatment


---------80:32----------
because those people so someone who's


---------80:34----------
super depressed or has been through a


---------80:35----------
lot of trauma they may not have the time


---------80:37----------
circumstance or wherewithal to like


---------80:39----------
spend a year in India like meditating so


---------80:42----------
like psychedelics can potentially be


---------80:43----------
helpful yeah a band-aids aren't bad


---------80:45----------
they're just not optimal when it comes


---------80:48----------
to having something right yeah sure okay


---------80:49----------
other questions do you have questions


---------80:54----------
why why did you ask me to explain why


---------80:57----------
did you ask me to explain the uncanny


---------80:58----------
valley it was a reason for that


---------80:59----------
no just because I get two reasons one is


---------81:06----------
when people ask questions or just in


---------81:09----------
general I if there's something that the


---------81:12----------
person that I'm talking to can explain I


---------81:14----------
default to having them explain it okay


---------81:16----------
for a couple of reasons one is I like to


---------81:18----------
hear other people's explanations of it


---------81:21----------
and the second is I I don't want to talk


---------81:24----------
all the time okay gotcha


---------81:27----------
cool I was just curious um okay um I


---------81:33----------
died there's like a million random


---------81:35----------
things from chat but I don't know if you


---------81:37----------
don't have any other like major things


---------81:38----------
but you want to talk about I don't need


---------81:42----------
me to say this obviously especially I


---------81:43----------
don't know if you are you practicing in


---------81:45----------
terms with you like a license like okay


---------81:46----------
yeah I've tried like therapy before I'm


---------81:51----------
gonna be totally honest there's only one


---------81:52----------
person and oh my god was it a horrible


---------81:54----------
waste of time


---------81:55----------
although understanding that yeah you're


---------81:56----------
supposed to shop around for therapy I


---------81:58----------
don't think I don't think he said


---------81:59----------
anything here that I disagreed with that


---------82:00----------
i thought was stupid or like totally


---------82:02----------
like dumb like meandering conjecture


---------82:04----------
which i hear from a lot of people that


---------82:05----------
aren't necessarily like psychiatrists


---------82:08----------
but like therapy ask people sometimes it


---------82:10----------
feels like they're just looking for


---------82:11----------
opportunities to insert their own


---------82:13----------
narratives into whatever story you tell


---------82:14----------
them they're trying to make the pieces


---------82:15----------
fit you do a really good job at i think


---------82:17----------
of understanding what I'm saying and


---------82:18----------
then rephrasing that and then presenting


---------82:20----------
it to me in a way that it's like makes


---------82:22----------
sense and it's like a complete story I


---------82:23----------
thank you so destiny the one thing that


---------82:25----------
I think may that I would like you to


---------82:28----------
take away from this because I believe


---------82:31----------
this is where we disagreed yes that I


---------82:33----------
don't think that you're emotional I


---------82:36----------
think you're emotionally suppressing and


---------82:38----------
I don't think I didn't get the sense at


---------82:40----------
the beginning of our our talk together


---------82:42----------
that you thought that but I do believe


---------82:44----------
that um I would probably agree I think


---------82:51----------
maybe there might be like I don't think


---------82:52----------
I would have disagreed might be more of


---------82:54----------
a semantic than anything


---------82:55----------
I mean obvi clearly unless I am


---------82:57----------
literally inhuman I must be suppressing


---------82:59----------
my emotions to some extent like you said


---------83:01----------
I have an amygdala I have a limbic


---------83:02----------
system like I can't not have these


---------83:04----------
things yeah so some level of learned


---------83:05----------
suppression I guess when I think of


---------83:06----------
suppression


---------83:08----------
I'm sorry when I speak is there there's


---------83:09----------
so many implication by every word


---------83:10----------
usually when somebody uses the word


---------83:11----------
suppression there's a whole lot of


---------83:12----------
negative baggage and other ways of that


---------83:15----------
manifest in your life and in really


---------83:16----------
detrimental ways that I don't think i


---------83:18----------
exhibit those behaviors but I did I


---------83:19----------
would have to agree well it's probably


---------83:21----------
some level surprise I'm not so sure


---------83:22----------
about that right because we have some


---------83:23----------
evidence that you have a track record


---------83:25----------
for disrupting a lot of other people's


---------83:30----------
lives like in terms of like the way that


---------83:32----------
they respond to you so I think that sure


---------83:34----------
I don't know if I would necessarily


---------83:35----------
agree that's a bad thing though I think


---------83:36----------
to some of this I think it's sure I


---------83:39----------
think I think the other thing that's


---------83:40----------
that's kind of like tricky here is that


---------83:42----------
I think you're placing yeah okay but I


---------83:47----------
mean III think that that that could be


---------83:48----------
causing problems in your and I think


---------83:51----------
actually there's a decent chance that it


---------83:52----------
will cause problems in your


---------83:53----------
relationships because your relationships


---------83:55----------
are very transactional


---------83:56----------
yeah right so yeah the sewing that's


---------83:58----------
come up a lot young yeah and and so I


---------84:00----------
think the problem here is that when you


---------84:01----------
are in a transactional relationship with


---------84:03----------
someone who doesn't view relationships


---------84:04----------
same way it's very is gonna have a tough


---------84:08----------
time of course yeah and generally


---------84:10----------
speaking I do as a personal value


---------84:13----------
judgment I mean hopefully these words


---------84:15----------
don't bite me in the ass but I have some


---------84:16----------
relationships that are not transactional


---------84:18----------
in fact I would say that most of the


---------84:21----------
relationships that I have are not


---------84:22----------
transactional and that serves me very


---------84:23----------
well okay okay put in mine when I


---------84:27----------
revisit this thought to myself up maybe


---------84:29----------
I'll push harder in that direction sure


---------84:30----------
yeah cool


---------84:32----------
okay cool well hey listen I really


---------84:34----------
appreciate the conversation yeah


---------84:36----------
likewise any other final things that


---------84:39----------
nope nope okay well hey listen I really


---------84:43----------
pushed the conversation if there's


---------84:44----------
anything ever in particular that comes


---------84:46----------
up that I don't know people like always


---------84:48----------
bother me to talk to you not that it's a


---------84:49----------
bother to talk to you but if you go away


---------84:51----------
then a lot of online I don't know if


---------84:53----------
you've gotten this yet from twitch by


---------84:54----------
the way that a lot of these


---------84:55----------
conversations happen is usually both fan


---------84:57----------
bases start firing their shots in the


---------84:58----------
direction of the other fanbase in order


---------85:00----------
to get the two people to come together


---------85:01----------
so if people I guess keep poking me to


---------85:04----------
pick your brain about a particular topic


---------85:05----------
or likewise whatever we can chat again


---------85:06----------
if you're interested


---------85:07----------
sure and okay I know that sometimes I


---------85:10----------
mean I I didn't give you an opportunity


---------85:12----------
to that like asked me questions and


---------85:14----------
stuff like that so if you I'm not saying


---------85:15----------
you short or that you want to but you


---------85:17----------
know I'm open to that about like the the


---------85:20----------
I've heard a lot of like org


---------85:21----------
stories in terms of starting off as like


---------85:23----------
a spiritual hindu person i don't know


---------85:25----------
how much of this is true versus not true


---------85:27----------
for your development i can do that in


---------85:30----------
five minutes yeah go for it hit me up


---------85:31----------
i'm curious yeah so i grew up playing a


---------85:33----------
lot of [ __ ] video games uh-huh and


---------85:35----------
then did okay in high school started


---------85:38----------
college was failing out of college my


---------85:41----------
parents kind of took me aside after


---------85:42----------
trying everything else from yelling and


---------85:44----------
punishing and all that kind of stuff and


---------85:46----------
my dad was like look this is not working


---------85:47----------
out like we got to do something and so


---------85:50----------
then I was like yeah I agree so it felt


---------85:52----------
like super antagonistic early on but


---------85:54----------
then it sort of felt like we were


---------85:55----------
problem-solving together and so he's


---------85:57----------
like you got to go to India and I said


---------85:58----------
[ __ ] it okay so I went to India I stayed


---------86:00----------
at an ashram which is sort of like a


---------86:03----------
monastery I studied yoga and meditation


---------86:05----------
a little bit of Ayurveda for a period of


---------86:06----------
about three months and then decided I


---------86:08----------
wanted to become a monk so went to my


---------86:11----------
teachers and I said hey I want to become


---------86:12----------
a monk I'm not interested in the


---------86:14----------
material life they said fantastic real


---------86:17----------
great as so yeah we understand we are


---------86:19----------
what so I understand when you say monk


---------86:21----------
what does how does that actually mean so


---------86:22----------
that means take some yes so in the Hindu


---------86:25----------
tradition but but this distribution as


---------86:27----------
well there are four stages of life so


---------86:29----------
the first stage is student the second


---------86:31----------
stage is a householder the third stage


---------86:33----------
is transitionary in the fourth stage is


---------86:35----------
to like let go of your material


---------86:37----------
attachments slash meditate slash devote


---------86:40----------
yourself to God if you believe in that


---------86:42----------
kind of thing and so what I said is I


---------86:44----------
want to forego a material life and focus


---------86:46----------
on spiritual development and like


---------86:49----------
realizing my true self which is the goal


---------86:52----------
of a lot of meditative practices is


---------86:53----------
something called moksha or enlightenment


---------86:55----------
or liberation so I wanted to devote


---------86:57----------
myself to that that was gonna be my


---------86:58----------
full-time job they said that's a


---------87:00----------
fantastic idea you'd be great at it but


---------87:02----------
finish your school get a doctoral degree


---------87:04----------
and come back when you're 30 and if you


---------87:06----------
still want to do it we'll take you so


---------87:09----------
the place that I studied was run by so


---------87:11----------
the head of the ashram was actually a


---------87:12----------
quantum physicist like other teachers of


---------87:15----------
mine were like like neuroscientists and


---------87:17----------
things like that and they'd all taken


---------87:18----------
son yeah so they'd become monks but they


---------87:21----------
believed in sort of getting like a


---------87:22----------
worldly education first in understanding


---------87:24----------
science and then kind of following a


---------87:26----------
spiritual path and so turned out that


---------87:29----------
their decision was a great one because I


---------87:30----------
went back to the US and then traveled


---------87:31----------
back and forth from the u.s. to India


---------87:33----------
for about seven years with the goal of


---------87:35----------
coming a monk but in that time met my


---------87:38----------
wife fell in love got confused and then


---------87:41----------
decided ultimately that becoming a monk


---------87:44----------
was about ego that I couldn't cut it in


---------87:46----------
the real world


---------87:47----------
and that like it was a very if I'd said


---------87:49----------
like oh I'm like the real world isn't


---------87:51----------
for me because I'm bad at it and I


---------87:55----------
thought of all of the reasons why


---------87:57----------
becoming a monk was like a fantastic


---------87:58----------
idea right because like there's so many


---------88:01----------
positives about it there's so many


---------88:02----------
logical reasons that it's good but at


---------88:03----------
the root of it the problem was ego which


---------88:05----------
by the way I think could apply to you


---------88:07----------
and your view of emotions as well um a


---------88:10----------
form of post hoc rationalization you


---------88:12----------
have like an end goal and you're just


---------88:13----------
gonna do whatever you can to get to it


---------88:15----------
basically yeah without really yeah sure


---------88:16----------
yeah so I think you have a potentially a


---------88:21----------
subtle ego but I don't think your ego is


---------88:22----------
generally very large sure but ultimately


---------88:25----------
that that it was really about ego and


---------88:29----------
that living a spiritual life has nothing


---------88:31----------
to do with wearing robes or like you


---------88:34----------
know being in a particular location that


---------88:36----------
spirituality is all internal it's like


---------88:37----------
internal struggles it has nothing to do


---------88:39----------
with what you wear what you eat or you


---------88:41----------
know whether you walk around with prayer


---------88:43----------
beads or whatever so decided to


---------88:45----------
ultimately live life and ended up doing


---------88:48----------
neuroscience research for a couple of


---------88:50----------
years went to med school became a


---------88:51----------
psychiatrist and now I incorporate a lot


---------88:54----------
of meditation yoga Eastern principles


---------88:56----------
into like clinical practice I do a lot


---------88:59----------
of stuff for professional athletes


---------89:00----------
performance enhancement kind of stuff


---------89:02----------
some eSports orgs and that's kind of


---------89:06----------
where I where I am financier yeah I


---------89:10----------
think so yeah can I am if you have to go


---------89:12----------
to any time you can always tell me go


---------89:13----------
for it


---------89:14----------
if I were to ask you the question do you


---------89:16----------
feel like we've made a lot of progress


---------89:18----------
as a civilization over the past like 50


---------89:20----------
to 100 years specifically like in the


---------89:22----------
Western world or ever I'll even say more


---------89:23----------
specifically in the United States would


---------89:25----------
you agree or disagree with that how


---------89:27----------
would you measure that generally I would


---------89:28----------
agree but it depends on how you're


---------89:30----------
defining progress yeah that's the


---------89:32----------
question I guess I'm curious how you


---------89:33----------
would define that it's something I've


---------89:34----------
thought about a lot recently I mean so I


---------89:36----------
think progress has different facets so


---------89:38----------
if you look at something like so you


---------89:39----------
know I sometimes get into discussions


---------89:40----------
with like my mom for example and and not


---------89:44----------
just my mom but there's a general idea


---------89:45----------
that boomers like myself things that


---------89:47----------
think that things used to be better in


---------89:49----------
the past


---------89:49----------
and that the world has become more


---------89:51----------
materialistic it's become like more


---------89:53----------
vapid I do think for example that mental


---------89:56----------
health is on the rise and I think that


---------89:57----------
has a lot to do with social media but


---------89:59----------
also like infant mortalities like way


---------90:00----------
[ __ ] down you know like the the norm


---------90:03----------
for people growing up like a hundred or


---------90:05----------
150 years ago is that multiple of their


---------90:08----------
children would die yeah and there's I


---------90:11----------
mean I just think that that's progress


---------90:13----------
like okay I think that yeah so I think


---------90:15----------
in general we made progress and I think


---------90:17----------
that the challenges of any given point


---------90:20----------
in time continue to evolve and change


---------90:22----------
and that the the primary challenges


---------90:24----------
right now tend to be around ego


---------90:26----------
materialism and like a disconnection


---------90:29----------
from self okay yeah I think I agree with


---------90:32----------
that I think that I'm going the other


---------90:35----------
way I'd put it is that the challenge is


---------90:37----------
let's say 150 years ago we're lower on


---------90:40----------
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and now


---------90:42----------
we're getting closer to the the


---------90:44----------
challenges being like at the top of


---------90:46----------
Maslow's hierarchy of needs oh I'm not


---------90:48----------
sure if I agree with that my I'll just


---------90:51----------
that my general thought on this and then


---------90:53----------
you can excuse me it feels like when we


---------90:54----------
measure progress it feels like we we


---------90:57----------
really like quantifiable stuff so when


---------91:00----------
we talk about like medical advancements


---------91:02----------
like vaccine rates infant mortality


---------91:04----------
graduation graduation rates median


---------91:07----------
income that we look at that but it


---------91:08----------
almost feels like we have I'm only


---------91:10----------
thirty years old but even in my lifetime


---------91:12----------
it feels like we never measure progress


---------91:13----------
in terms of like how we view ourselves


---------91:15----------
how we maintain our personal


---------91:17----------
relationships how many friendships we


---------91:18----------
have and it feels like a lot of people


---------91:20----------
miss that and that around like it feels


---------91:23----------
strange that like in all of this


---------91:24----------
technological I'm sorry I'm 31 years old


---------91:25----------
my birthday was four years ago it feels


---------91:27----------
like an in the in the wake of like all


---------91:28----------
of this like technological and in


---------91:30----------
biological medical advancement


---------91:31----------
everything somehow like it feels like as


---------91:33----------
a society people have totally missed the


---------91:36----------
self development thing and then in some


---------91:39----------
ways that's even regressing and I mean


---------91:41----------
self development was like no but III


---------91:42----------
agree with you but I don't think it's


---------91:44----------
regressing because when you're dying of


---------91:45----------
Cholera like feeling fulfilled is


---------91:48----------
irrelevant


---------91:49----------
do you think that people and this isn't


---------91:52----------
strong disagrees I'm just curious do you


---------91:54----------
think that people that lived have you


---------91:55----------
ever heard the theory that like the


---------91:56----------
hunter-gatherer lifestyle that those


---------91:58----------
people were probably like incredibly


---------91:59----------
fulfilled and very happy yeah those


---------92:01----------
people yeah do you think that anything


---------92:04----------
that is possible that people like a


---------92:05----------
hundred years ago that had no internet


---------92:07----------
well I won't go to a honey years ago to


---------92:10----------
like world war one stuff but like


---------92:11----------
outside of like Wars and stuff any


---------92:12----------
people generally were more fulfilled in


---------92:14----------
life and less depressed and and felt


---------92:15----------
better about themselves or no so this is


---------92:17----------
gonna be a little bit strange but I


---------92:19----------
think that this is exactly like what I


---------92:21----------
in my own life I sort of came to this


---------92:24----------
realization that happiness is actually


---------92:26----------
independent of like so the conciliar and


---------92:30----------
I asked you like would you say that the


---------92:32----------
contentment that you feel is independent


---------92:35----------
of emotion yeah right so I think that


---------92:38----------
like this is something that the Yogi's


---------92:39----------
understood really well is they recognize


---------92:41----------
that there's like there are different


---------92:42----------
layers of like pain and suffering so


---------92:46----------
would they use a word called book and


---------92:48----------
book means suffering and the really


---------92:51----------
interesting thing about book is that


---------92:52----------
it's actually independent to pain and


---------92:54----------
pleasure that you can have look and be


---------92:56----------
pleasure and being a life full of


---------92:57----------
pleasure or you can have look and you


---------92:59----------
can have a life full of pain or you can


---------93:02----------
have soaked which is like contentment or


---------93:04----------
bliss or happiness and being a life full


---------93:06----------
of pain so I think that these are


---------93:07----------
independent and the progress has been


---------93:09----------
like more on the physical level but I


---------93:12----------
think what we're seeing in terms of the


---------93:14----------
spike of my static line of mental yeah


---------93:21----------
so the the the you know you're saying


---------93:23----------
there's a meme for like suck like succ


---------93:26----------
is like I think that's why they're


---------93:27----------
saying that if that's what you're


---------93:28----------
looking at here ya know this is su Chi


---------93:30----------
it's the opposite of that yeah okay good


---------93:32----------
but that that those are relatively


---------93:34----------
independent and this is like a big thing


---------93:36----------
that I think a lot of the people that I


---------93:38----------
work with struggle with because a lot of


---------93:39----------
them are successful and they think that


---------93:41----------
just because you're successful you


---------93:42----------
should be happy but in my experience


---------93:44----------
success and Happiness like in terms of


---------93:46----------
worldly success are independent and that


---------93:48----------
you know I was stunned when I was


---------93:51----------
working in a jail and was talking to one


---------93:53----------
of the inmates and then like was talking


---------93:56----------
to one of my patients who's an


---------93:57----------
investment banker and that the amount of


---------93:59----------
suffering they experienced and the cause


---------94:01----------
of their suffering was essentially the


---------94:02----------
same


---------94:03----------
and it really caused me distracted


---------94:04----------
scratch my head I was like how on earth


---------94:06----------
is it that this investment banker is


---------94:07----------
feeling the same thing that this guy in


---------94:09----------
prison is feeling their lives are


---------94:11----------
completely different and it's this


---------94:13----------
recognition that you know sure life was


---------94:16----------
simpler it's hard for me to say like I


---------94:17----------
do think that social media for example


---------94:19----------
exacerbates ego and makes us more prone


---------94:21----------
to book so I would say that like social


---------94:24----------
media has that kind of effect but


---------94:26----------
generally speaking I think the whole


---------94:27----------
point that would the made was that


---------94:31----------
contentment and suffering is on a


---------94:33----------
separate axis from success joy pleasure


---------94:37----------
sadness failure and that I don't know if


---------94:41----------
that really has changed which i think is


---------94:44----------
part of the reason why like those


---------94:45----------
teachings are becoming have like been so


---------94:47----------
prevalent right there's a Darwinian like


---------94:50----------
effect on human knowledge and like this


---------94:53----------
stuff has been around for thousands of


---------94:55----------
years and that was kind of having a


---------94:57----------
revitalization because this is what we


---------94:58----------
need deep so I am incredibly atheist


---------95:02----------
very atheist very anti theological


---------95:05----------
everything when I was growing up I went


---------95:08----------
to a Catholic school from from grades 1


---------95:10----------
to 12 I want to Jesuit High School into


---------95:12----------
a Catholic grade school despite being


---------95:14----------
very anti religious I feel like


---------95:16----------
throughout the course of my entire life


---------95:18----------
the only type of institution that was


---------95:22----------
giving me any type of actual like long


---------95:25----------
term fulfillment actually came from the


---------95:27----------
Catholic Church that like everything


---------95:29----------
else in life


---------95:29----------
is kind of like geared towards like true


---------95:31----------
happiness is like going to school so you


---------95:34----------
can get a good job and you need a good


---------95:36----------
job so that you can get you know a big


---------95:37----------
house and to have some whatever like a


---------95:39----------
lot of things that don't I don't think


---------95:40----------
necessarily go towards like a more like


---------95:41----------
fulfilling life in terms of like feeling


---------95:43----------
like you're your self actualized I guess


---------95:46----------
we if we borrow the Maslow thing do you


---------95:48----------
ever think that like these are very


---------95:50----------
broad questions like do everything like


---------95:51----------
the secularization of society and kind


---------95:53----------
of like the loss of religion and the


---------95:56----------
lack of replacement for that like leads


---------95:58----------
people to get I don't know kind of lost


---------96:01----------
in terms of like the things they're


---------96:02----------
looking for like how do you direct


---------96:03----------
somebody to find purpose in life who is


---------96:06----------
like an atheist and a religious person


---------96:07----------
it seems like a really hard thing to do


---------96:09----------
for a lot of people


---------96:11----------
well those that's three questions yes


---------96:14----------
fashion is is do you think that the


---------96:15----------
secularization of society comes at a


---------96:17----------
cost and I say yeah and I think that's


---------96:20----------
why like mindfulness and yoga studios


---------96:23----------
are popping up all over the place


---------96:25----------
because that there is something that


---------96:27----------
religion used to fill which we've kind


---------96:30----------
of now fewer people are turning to and


---------96:33----------
there's been a resurgence of like


---------96:34----------
appreciation of Buddhism for example


---------96:37----------
which is sort of a religion but not


---------96:38----------
really like a judeo-christian religion


---------96:41----------
in Hinduism is kind of the same way and


---------96:44----------
and so I think yeah that's so like you


---------96:46----------
can you can look as a scientist or an


---------96:48----------
epidemiologist as I think is a better


---------96:50----------
way to think about it you can look at


---------96:51----------
trends in society and say like what is


---------96:53----------
causing people suffering now what is


---------96:55----------
causing them hurt and water people are


---------96:57----------
gravitating towards and I think that


---------96:58----------
there's a very natural correlation there


---------97:00----------
the second thing that you asked is if


---------97:02----------
someone's an atheist how can you help


---------97:05----------
them find purpose and fulfillment so I


---------97:08----------
think that Buddhism and Hinduism or good


---------97:09----------
religions because Hinduism very few


---------97:12----------
people understand this but Hinduism is


---------97:14----------
theistic and atheistic at the same time


---------97:17----------
it is monotheistic polytheistic and


---------97:19----------
atheistic all three of these doctrines


---------97:22----------
exist equally and and happily within


---------97:25----------
Buddhist I mean within Hinduism so I


---------97:27----------
think that like in terms of fine and


---------97:29----------
giving someone a sense of purpose like


---------97:31----------
they don't have to be religious but I


---------97:32----------
think it can be very helpful to turn to


---------97:34----------
religious texts because those are


---------97:37----------
sources of very good knowledge in my


---------97:39----------
opinion


---------97:39----------
so I used to be and or / am an atheist


---------97:43----------
still and I derive a lot of value out of


---------97:46----------
a lot of a Hindu and Buddhist texts


---------97:48----------
because I think it's not about like


---------97:50----------
beliefs so this is the big thing is that


---------97:52----------
judeo-christian religions are about


---------97:54----------
believing in a particular thing whereas


---------97:56----------
the Eastern religions are not they sort


---------97:58----------
of start with the idea that like pole


---------98:01----------
what you want to out of this religion


---------98:02----------
because there are many different paths


---------98:04----------
to enlightenment and so on my stream the


---------98:07----------
other day like I don't know how what


---------98:08----------
percentage of people that I listen to I


---------98:10----------
mean that watch my stream are atheists


---------98:14----------
are religious but I I did a story that's


---------98:17----------
from in theory an Indian epic / Hindu


---------98:20----------
religious sects and I think that went


---------98:22----------
really well


---------98:23----------
and the story is not like you should


---------98:25----------
believe this and it's like the 10


---------98:26----------
commandments and this is this the story


---------98:28----------
is about exploring what your purpose is


---------98:30----------
in life and it's kind of like a


---------98:32----------
convoluted thing that turns morality and


---------98:34----------
purpose like on their heads so there's


---------98:38----------
like a good guy in the story and there's


---------98:39----------
a bad guy in the story but the good guy


---------98:41----------
is the one who's not fulfilling his


---------98:43----------
purpose and the bad guy is the one who


---------98:44----------
is so it sort of causes you to grapple


---------98:47----------
with questions of duty and morality and


---------98:49----------
that those may not always line up and


---------98:51----------
like how do you navigate life how do you


---------98:53----------
find purpose I get a lot of stuff out of


---------98:55----------
some of these corner quote religious tax


---------98:57----------
even though you have to you have to


---------98:58----------
believe in the [ __ ] religion you just


---------98:59----------
you know read it and think and learn and


---------99:02----------
explore for yourself and come to your


---------99:04----------
own conclusions sure and to answer your


---------99:08----------
question in a very concrete way I think


---------99:10----------
if you're looking for purpose in life a


---------99:12----------
great text to start with is something


---------99:13----------
called the Mahabharata because it's a


---------99:15----------
it's a story about duty and


---------99:17----------
responsibility okay it's just a funny -


---------99:24----------
okay my house it looks like a good


---------99:26----------
translation is it in entertaining or I


---------99:28----------
mean I think there are cool stories like


---------99:30----------
so I liked videogames and I loved


---------99:32----------
reading the Mahabharat because there are


---------99:33----------
like different kinds of weapons and


---------99:35----------
there's like this half-demon guy that is


---------99:37----------
unkillable and then someone has to use


---------99:39----------
like he can throw lightning from the sky


---------99:40----------
and he's like a child of he's a grand


---------99:43----------
son of the wind-god


---------99:44----------
and [ __ ] like that I just like cuz it's


---------99:47----------
cool yeah yeah yeah yeah it's cool


---------99:48----------
mythology and theology especially is


---------99:50----------
usually entertaining I've tried to get


---------99:51----------
more philosophy and oh my [ __ ] god


---------99:53----------
reading anything by even Hume or Khan or


---------99:56----------
anything is a very [ __ ] dry holy [ __ ]


---------99:58----------
yeah I think so that's what I like about


---------100:00----------
the Mara they're like their cool stories


---------100:02----------
about betrayal and and like tricking and


---------100:05----------
like there's this guy who was saving


---------100:07----------
this one arrow so he's got like this


---------100:09----------
one-shot kill it's like he's got this


---------100:11----------
one very special arrow that will destroy


---------100:13----------
anything that he shoots it against and


---------100:15----------
like if you're playing against that how


---------100:17----------
do you create a situation where they


---------100:19----------
have to use their one-shot kill and


---------100:20----------
protect your ace in the hole and so it's


---------100:23----------
sort of like stories like that that I


---------100:24----------
think are cool okay um alright is that


---------100:29----------
it guys anything else are we good I I


---------100:33----------
think we're good man thanks a lot


---------100:34----------
destiny


---------100:35----------
thanks a lot of your stuff heard what do


---------100:37----------
you well yeah I'm


---------100:38----------
people are crucifying me because I


---------100:40----------
forget to do that yes oh right so you


---------100:42----------
know a couple of things so we stream


---------100:44----------
ice-cream on on Twitch and I do like


---------100:46----------
sort of mental health support content


---------100:48----------
teach meditation help people understand


---------100:52----------
you know how they work as human beings


---------100:54----------
because it's my belief that a lot of the


---------100:56----------
reasons that we get stuck in life is we


---------100:58----------
don't understand like where we come from


---------101:00----------
like how our mind works how our mind got


---------101:02----------
to be that way and if you want to make a


---------101:03----------
change in your life you have to


---------101:04----------
understand like where the origins of


---------101:06----------
your patterns come from so I essentially


---------101:07----------
try to help people do that we also have


---------101:10----------
a website called hell ww healthy game or


---------101:13----------
not GG where originally was about


---------101:16----------
treating people with video game


---------101:17----------
addiction but now we're just sort of


---------101:18----------
expanding on all this stuff we have a


---------101:20----------
beta program that we're training coaches


---------101:22----------
in so we've got about a dozen coaches


---------101:24----------
that I'm personally training cuz I get


---------101:26----------
about 20 to 200 requests for people to


---------101:29----------
for me to work with them per day so


---------101:31----------
there's no way I can help everyone I


---------101:32----------
want to but I'm training a group of


---------101:35----------
coaches the beta is now closed because


---------101:37----------
we kind of filled up and so we're


---------101:39----------
basically trying to create a community


---------101:41----------
for gamers to support themselves support


---------101:43----------
each other in sort of mental health for


---------101:45----------
gamers by gamers it is not a medical


---------101:47----------
thing so I'm a clinician but it's not


---------101:49----------
medical so it's not intended to diagnose


---------101:51----------
or treat anything so people should


---------101:52----------
understand that we've got a discord and


---------101:53----------
all that kind of good stuff to and if


---------101:56----------
y'all want to come on stream and have me


---------101:58----------
talk to you then I'm open to doing that


---------101:59----------
we have people all kinds of people come


---------102:01----------
on stream awesome do you have a link


---------102:03----------
your discord in your chatter whatever if


---------102:04----------
you bring it up I can link it on my


---------102:05----------
community or whatever I don't know how


---------102:08----------
to do that exclamation mark disquiet um


---------102:12----------
yeah I think that I think that link


---------102:14----------
should be fine okay cool awesome yeah


---------102:17----------
well yeah thanks a lot everyone a chat


---------102:18----------
