---------00:00----------
let's talk a little bit about motivation


---------00:01----------
okay so


---------00:03----------
motivational styles okay so the first


---------00:05----------
thing to understand is that we think


---------00:07----------
about motivation as a monolith right so


---------00:09----------
people say i


---------00:10----------
lack motivation i don't have motivation


---------00:12----------
i wish i was motivated


---------00:13----------
so if we really tunnel down into that


---------00:15----------
language what it means is that


---------00:16----------
motivation is one quality


---------00:19----------
that has like a quantifiable number


---------00:21----------
right it just moves in one direction or


---------00:23----------
it's even binary


---------00:24----------
i have i have motivation or i don't have


---------00:26----------
motivation


---------00:27----------
and so people say like oh i lack


---------00:29----------
motivation


---------00:30----------
um and so in my experience like that's


---------00:33----------
not really how it works that motivation


---------00:35----------
is a lot like body type so


---------00:37----------
for example we know in western medicine


---------00:39----------
that there are different kinds of


---------00:40----------
metabolism right there are people who


---------00:42----------
have slow metabolisms


---------00:43----------
and they're people who have fast


---------00:44----------
metabolisms so people who have fast


---------00:46----------
metabo


---------00:47----------
metabolisms can kind of eat whatever


---------00:49----------
they want to and their body is just


---------00:50----------
going to burn it up


---------00:52----------
and then people with slow metabolisms


---------00:54----------
they can even eat healthy and they're


---------00:56----------
still going to be sort of heavyset


---------00:58----------
so we can call we call those people like


---------00:59----------
big boned is what people used to say


---------01:02----------
um and so the first thing to kind of


---------01:04----------
understand is that like


---------01:05----------
people are different okay and so


---------01:08----------
but in western medicine we don't really


---------01:10----------
think about that in the way that western


---------01:12----------
science conceptualizes things it


---------01:14----------
conceptualizes things


---------01:15----------
as standalone monolithic concepts so for


---------01:18----------
example like


---------01:19----------
gravity is gravity no matter where you


---------01:21----------
go the caloric


---------01:23----------
recommendations from the u.s government


---------01:25----------
are like 2 000 calories or the world


---------01:27----------
health organization


---------01:28----------
or 2 000 calories a day no matter who


---------01:30----------
you are or where you are


---------01:32----------
right um actually i mean there are


---------01:34----------
different caloric


---------01:36----------
recommendations for children and things


---------01:37----------
like that but generally speaking


---------01:40----------
when we think about western


---------01:42----------
recommendations or western solutions


---------01:44----------
they're a one-size-fits-all solution


---------01:46----------
and you kind of see this on the internet


---------01:47----------
because you'll get a bunch of people who


---------01:49----------
are like motivational speakers


---------01:51----------
and what they do is try to motivate


---------01:52----------
everyone right because they sort of say


---------01:54----------
that you're lacking motivation so you


---------01:56----------
just


---------01:56----------
need this motivation and then you'll be


---------01:58----------
fine and it's kind of like making a 2000


---------02:00----------
calorie recommendation for


---------02:02----------
people with slow metabolisms and people


---------02:04----------
with fast metabolisms which is kind of


---------02:06----------
silly because these people are


---------02:07----------
fundamentally


---------02:08----------
different the way their metabolisms work


---------02:10----------
is different and so the dietary


---------02:11----------
recommendations need to be


---------02:13----------
tailored to the metabolic fingerprint


---------02:16----------
of the person right so this person has a


---------02:19----------
relatively different kind of class


---------02:21----------
of metabolism they have a different


---------02:23----------
metabolic style


---------02:25----------
and therefore they need different kinds


---------02:26----------
of recommendations


---------02:28----------
for an ideal diet but that's not how


---------02:31----------
western medicine works western medicine


---------02:32----------
is sort of a one-size-fits-all


---------02:34----------
kind of approach right if i diagnose you


---------02:36----------
with depression


---------02:37----------
i treat depression so when i was


---------02:40----------
training to become a psychiatrist they


---------02:41----------
gave us a class about


---------02:42----------
a depression not about people so if you


---------02:45----------
go to the diagnostic and it sounds weird


---------02:47----------
but we treat an illness we don't treat a


---------02:48----------
person


---------02:49----------
i say okay if i diagnose you with


---------02:51----------
depression then i go to the depression


---------02:52----------
protocol and i give you this medication


---------02:54----------
and i do this and i do this


---------02:56----------
and so basically the way that western


---------02:58----------
medicine works is that we


---------03:00----------
average a bunch of stuff and that's what


---------03:02----------
we make is our recommendation


---------03:04----------
so if i were to say like okay you know


---------03:06----------
how did they come


---------03:07----------
up with the 2000 calorie diet what they


---------03:09----------
did is they asked a bunch of healthy


---------03:11----------
people how many calories do you eat a


---------03:12----------
day


---------03:13----------
and there was a range some people ate


---------03:15----------
1500 some people ate 2 500


---------03:17----------
and then they averaged all those numbers


---------03:18----------
and they say we recommend that


---------03:20----------
you eat 2 000 calories a day that's how


---------03:23----------
we come up with our answers


---------03:24----------
we average populations to make a uniform


---------03:27----------
recommendation


---------03:28----------
but if you stop and really think about


---------03:30----------
it within that population two thousand


---------03:32----------
calories isn't going to work for the


---------03:34----------
person who normally is eating 2500


---------03:36----------
calories


---------03:36----------
and isn't going to work for the person


---------03:38----------
who's eating 1500


---------03:40----------
and so that's kind of bizarre it's


---------03:41----------
almost like if i were to say okay like


---------03:43----------
if we relied on the fda to tell us what


---------03:45----------
kind of clothing to wear


---------03:46----------
what the fda would do is survey the us


---------03:49----------
population


---------03:50----------
and would say what size clothing do you


---------03:52----------
wear and some people would wear larges


---------03:54----------
some people wear small


---------03:55----------
some people were would wear extra larges


---------03:57----------
they'd average them all together and


---------03:59----------
they'd say everyone should


---------04:00----------
wear between a medium and a large that's


---------04:02----------
our recommendation


---------04:04----------
and so if you kind of think about it


---------04:05----------
that's just that's just dumb like you're


---------04:06----------
gonna miss the boat on a lot of people


---------04:08----------
but like most people would be kind of


---------04:10----------
okay with that right


---------04:11----------
if you give everyone a piece of clothing


---------04:13----------
between a medium and large


---------04:15----------
it's going to kind of work for a fair


---------04:16----------
number of people it's going to be like


---------04:18----------
kind of baggy but they're not going to


---------04:19----------
be walking around like


---------04:21----------
naked and for the people it's going to


---------04:24----------
be a little bit tight and uncomfortable


---------04:25----------
but they'll manage and so that's what


---------04:27----------
our recommendations are like


---------04:29----------
so 2000 calories a day sort of works for


---------04:32----------
most people


---------04:33----------
um but it's not really ideal for many


---------04:36----------
people at all


---------04:37----------
and so we think about motivation sort of


---------04:39----------
is the same way


---------04:42----------
and we kind of say like okay so this is


---------04:43----------
what works on average for a bunch of


---------04:45----------
people which is what motivational


---------04:46----------
speakers do right they'll say like


---------04:48----------
i've done this thing and about 50 of


---------04:51----------
people who show up to my motivational


---------04:53----------
seminars get help from it


---------04:54----------
and the whole reason that motivational


---------04:57----------
seminars


---------04:58----------
are still a thing is because they're


---------05:00----------
ineffective because like just think


---------05:01----------
about this for a second right


---------05:03----------
if they were actually effective then


---------05:07----------
you'd do like 10 seminars and then you'd


---------05:09----------
have motivated everyone and then you'd


---------05:10----------
be done and no one would need your help


---------05:13----------
there's a really simple like thing in


---------05:14----------
medicine whereas like you know when you


---------05:16----------
have an effective treatment for medicine


---------05:18----------
in medicine like the problem sort of


---------05:20----------
goes away and you don't need the


---------05:21----------
treatment anymore


---------05:22----------
a good example of this is like the


---------05:23----------
smallpox vaccine like we don't really


---------05:24----------
worry too much about smallpox thanks god


---------05:26----------
thank god because we sort of like took


---------05:28----------
care of it right


---------05:29----------
we sort of took care of like nutritional


---------05:31----------
problems like you know we sort of took


---------05:33----------
care of things like sinus infections


---------05:35----------
which used to be lethal like a thousand


---------05:36----------
years ago


---------05:38----------
and so when you actually have an


---------05:39----------
effective solution


---------05:41----------
the problem sort of goes away and so


---------05:43----------
then the question becomes like why are


---------05:45----------
these motivational seminars so


---------05:47----------
successful


---------05:48----------
if they don't really fix the problem and


---------05:50----------
that's because they do a good job for a


---------05:52----------
slice of the population


---------05:55----------
and that's where we get to the concept


---------05:56----------
of motivational styles


---------05:58----------
so in the west what we tend to think


---------06:00----------
about is that like there's a particular


---------06:02----------
kind of motivation that we shoot for


---------06:04----------
and i think what gets us into a lot of


---------06:06----------
trouble is it's not


---------06:07----------
that kind of motivation doesn't work for


---------06:09----------
everyone


---------06:11----------
and that's because we each have a


---------06:12----------
cognitive fingerprint or a particular


---------06:14----------
cognitive style


---------06:16----------
and what i've found is that once you


---------06:18----------
understand what your cognitive style is


---------06:20----------
once


---------06:20----------
once you understand what your


---------06:21----------
motivational style is


---------06:24----------
then you can actually motivate yourself


---------06:26----------
in sort of like a very specific way


---------06:28----------
and if we go back to the diet analogy


---------06:30----------
like people are figuring out on their


---------06:32----------
own


---------06:32----------
that even though the fda says you should


---------06:34----------
you know bread rice


---------06:36----------
or noodles makes no difference you


---------06:39----------
should eat x


---------06:40----------
number of carbs per day that some people


---------06:42----------
are gluten gluten insensitive


---------06:44----------
and so like even though the fda says oh


---------06:46----------
it makes no difference for some people


---------06:48----------
they're like it absolutely makes a


---------06:49----------
difference


---------06:51----------
that the fda will say a certain amount


---------06:52----------
of fat and a certain amount of protein


---------06:54----------
whereas some people will be like dairy


---------06:56----------
really messes me up or cheese really


---------06:57----------
messes me up


---------06:58----------
that there's individual variants within


---------07:00----------
a population that a global


---------07:02----------
recommendation doesn't capture


---------07:04----------
and so i think that's true of motivation


---------07:07----------
as well that where we make global


---------07:08----------
recommendations of


---------07:10----------
this is how you get motivated and you


---------07:12----------
should just do this


---------07:13----------
just do it man get good noob


---------07:16----------
right just do it and that only works for


---------07:19----------
a particular kind of motivational style


---------07:22----------
and so what we're gonna do is turn to


---------07:24----------
something called


---------07:25----------
ayurveda so ayurveda is a traditional


---------07:28----------
system of medicine from india from


---------07:30----------
about 5 000 years ago and the really


---------07:32----------
cool thing about ayurveda is people


---------07:33----------
in ayurveda sort of said they started


---------07:35----------
with the idea that people are like


---------07:36----------
fundamentally different they're like oh


---------07:38----------
look this person has a fast metabolism


---------07:40----------
and this person has a slow metabolism


---------07:42----------
this person feels really really like um


---------07:46----------
you know bad when they eat a bunch of


---------07:48----------
salad like they really don't like to eat


---------07:49----------
salad


---------07:50----------
and this person really likes salad oh


---------07:51----------
there's like different dietary


---------07:53----------
preferences


---------07:53----------
there are different metabolic styles


---------07:56----------
there are different


---------07:57----------
cognitive styles and so they came up


---------08:00----------
with these three things called doshas


---------08:02----------
and doshas


---------08:03----------
are essentially classifications that are


---------08:05----------
not real they're just ways that we kind


---------08:07----------
of lump people together


---------08:09----------
and what they realized is that the


---------08:10----------
dorsals like sort of


---------08:12----------
relate to the elements and what they


---------08:15----------
mean by that is not so much that like


---------08:16----------
you can


---------08:17----------
you know so there's like a wind type a


---------08:19----------
fire type and an earth type


---------08:21----------
and so it's not so much that you know


---------08:24----------
you can like


---------08:25----------
biopsy someone and you're gonna see wind


---------08:27----------
in one person but what they noticed is


---------08:28----------
that some


---------08:29----------
mines are kind of like the wind they're


---------08:31----------
highly dynamic so i'm avata type which


---------08:34----------
means i'm a wind type mind


---------08:35----------
which means that my mind is all over the


---------08:37----------
place so i'm kind of prone to adhd and


---------08:40----------
anxiety like my mind kind of thinks


---------08:41----------
about this and then i get excited about


---------08:43----------
that and then i get bored of this and


---------08:45----------
i kind of bounce around all over the


---------08:46----------
place


---------08:48----------
and then there's there's the second type


---------08:50----------
which is sort of the fire type mind


---------08:51----------
which is a bit the mind


---------08:53----------
and the bit the mind is sort of like


---------08:54----------
fire it's like slow and steady kind of


---------08:56----------
burns


---------08:57----------
i mean not really slow but it kind of


---------08:58----------
burns consistently in one direction


---------09:01----------
so if you're trying to figure out you


---------09:02----------
know which way the wind is blowing the


---------09:03----------
wind will blow this way today and it'll


---------09:05----------
blow that way tomorrow


---------09:06----------
which is the whole reason you have a


---------09:07----------
weather vane right that little thing


---------09:08----------
that spins around because the wind


---------09:09----------
changes direction


---------09:11----------
whereas if i you know if i go to like a


---------09:13----------
field and i like


---------09:14----------
light a fire in the corner of the field


---------09:16----------
like the fire is gonna spread in a


---------09:18----------
pretty consistent


---------09:19----------
and steady manner and this is the kind


---------09:22----------
of motivation that we tend to prefer


---------09:24----------
or prioritize in the west we tend to


---------09:27----------
think about


---------09:28----------
motivation as fit the style motivation


---------09:30----------
like you wake up every day


---------09:31----------
you hammer out your work you go to bed


---------09:34----------
you wake up the next day you're


---------09:35----------
ambitious


---------09:36----------
you're driven you're kind of fiery like


---------09:38----------
you you guys like


---------09:39----------
you know people envy and we value sort


---------09:41----------
of this western style


---------09:42----------
or the fire type motivation of i want to


---------09:44----------
wake up every day and have a fire in my


---------09:46----------
belly like i want to work hard and i


---------09:48----------
want to be ambitious


---------09:49----------
and uh you know that's the kind of thing


---------09:51----------
that we kind of


---------09:52----------
try to value and then the third


---------09:56----------
motivational style is the kapha style or


---------09:58----------
the earth style


---------10:00----------
so people with with a kapha motivational


---------10:02----------
pattern or sort of like


---------10:04----------
slow steady resilient if you think about


---------10:06----------
the earth right like earth is sort of


---------10:07----------
like stable


---------10:09----------
it's steady it's strong but it's not


---------10:12----------
very flashy it doesn't move too much


---------10:14----------
and so there's a kapha style of


---------10:15----------
motivation which is kind of like slow


---------10:17----------
and steady wins the race


---------10:19----------
like um and so these are kind of the


---------10:21----------
three different motivational styles


---------10:24----------
okay so i think part of the reason that


---------10:27----------
i want to explain this to you guys is


---------10:28----------
that if you try to adopt a motivational


---------10:32----------
strategy that does not meet your


---------10:35----------
cognitive style you're gonna run into


---------10:37----------
trouble


---------10:37----------
because it's not what you're built for


---------10:39----------
so just to use a gaming analogy it's


---------10:41----------
like you know if i watch a youtube video


---------10:43----------
of like you know mitch has been


---------10:45----------
streaming wow recently so if i watch


---------10:46----------
mitch


---------10:47----------
and i'm like oh man like mages are op


---------10:49----------
dude like mages are sick bro


---------10:52----------
and and then like i try to be a mage but


---------10:54----------
my character is like a fighter i'm gonna


---------10:55----------
suck


---------10:56----------
right so there are different classes and


---------10:59----------
just because a particular class gets a


---------11:01----------
bunch of hype


---------11:02----------
doesn't mean it's the class that you're


---------11:04----------
playing and so the most important thing


---------11:06----------
is that you need to gear


---------11:08----------
and build your strategy based on the


---------11:09----------
class and the stats that you have


---------11:11----------
as opposed to like the stats that get


---------11:14----------
advertised


---------11:15----------
in the class that gets advertised right


---------11:19----------
and so we're gonna kind of go through


---------11:21----------
the three different styles i'm gonna


---------11:22----------
tell you a little bit about them


---------11:24----------
and i'm gonna tell you a little bit


---------11:25----------
about how to find your ideal form of


---------11:27----------
motivation


---------11:28----------
okay all right so what i'm going to call


---------11:32----------
them


---------11:32----------
is there's a vata motivation which is a


---------11:34----------
dynamic motivation


---------11:36----------
a bit the motivation which is a driven


---------11:38----------
motivation


---------11:39----------
and a resilient motivation which is a


---------11:41----------
kapha motivation


---------11:43----------
okay and the first thing that i want to


---------11:44----------
point out is that isn't driven in


---------11:46----------
motivation the same thing like isn't


---------11:48----------
that redundant like that's my whole


---------11:50----------
point


---------11:50----------
is that we define motivation in the bit


---------11:53----------
the style and that's what holds people


---------11:55----------
back is because we assume that all


---------11:57----------
motivation


---------11:58----------
has to be like this drive oriented like


---------12:01----------
steady burn kind of ambition sort of


---------12:03----------
motivation


---------12:04----------
and if you really want to be successful


---------12:06----------
you don't need to adopt that style if


---------12:08----------
that's not what works for you okay


---------12:11----------
so let's start with the dynamic form of


---------12:12----------
motivation or the vata or wind kind of


---------12:15----------
motivation okay i'm going to use those


---------12:16----------
three terms kind of interchangeably


---------12:19----------
so vatas tend to be like very dynamic so


---------12:23----------
they tend to like their mind is sort of


---------12:24----------
like the wind they move in this


---------12:25----------
direction they kind of move in that


---------12:27----------
direction they move in a different


---------12:28----------
direction


---------12:29----------
and so their motivation is something


---------12:30----------
that is easy come


---------12:32----------
easy go and so the first thing that i


---------12:34----------
want you guys to notice is that for


---------12:36----------
people a lot of people


---------12:37----------
complain about this they say that my


---------12:40----------
motivation i get super excited about


---------12:42----------
something


---------12:43----------
and then i lack follow through and they


---------12:46----------
say that this is a problem to be fixed


---------12:48----------
and then they beat their heads against a


---------12:50----------
wall trying to


---------12:52----------
stop having their attention wander so


---------12:54----------
much and then start to like really focus


---------12:56----------
on follow through and they want to be


---------12:57----------
more bit the like right they want to be


---------12:59----------
like more driven


---------13:01----------
and and what i would say to these people


---------13:03----------
is actually you shouldn't do that


---------13:04----------
because that's not who you are and when


---------13:05----------
i tried to do that i started to suck at


---------13:07----------
life


---------13:08----------
and actually what vata motivators need


---------13:10----------
to do is just acknowledge that you're


---------13:12----------
going to get excited about stuff


---------13:14----------
and then you're going to get bored of


---------13:15----------
stuff and so the solution for people who


---------13:17----------
have


---------13:18----------
avata motivational style is to rotate


---------13:22----------
what you're working on and so what i do


---------13:25----------
like my days like i'm


---------13:26----------
part clinician i stream three days a


---------13:28----------
week i see patients


---------13:30----------
like a couple days a week i you know


---------13:32----------
have meetings for healthy


---------13:34----------
gamer i do research i do some consulting


---------13:36----------
here and there


---------13:37----------
um and so like if my my schedule is like


---------13:41----------
all over the place like today you know i


---------13:44----------
saw a patient in the morning


---------13:45----------
i wrote this lecture now i'm streaming i


---------13:49----------
have a research meeting after this


---------13:51----------
i'm going to play some cyberpunk after


---------13:52----------
that i've got a random patient like this


---------13:54----------
evening


---------13:55----------
and so my mind i can work 10 hours a day


---------13:59----------
every single day as long as i'm giving


---------14:02----------
my


---------14:02----------
mind different kinds of things to work


---------14:04----------
on and this was a huge discovery for me


---------14:08----------
because what i used to do is like i used


---------14:09----------
to look at my colleagues who were


---------14:10----------
successful


---------14:12----------
and what i would see is people who were


---------14:14----------
like super hyper focused on


---------14:16----------
one thing like i have a colleague who's


---------14:18----------
a awesome person


---------14:19----------
so she's like an md phd and does a lot


---------14:22----------
of schizophrenia brain research


---------14:24----------
and she knows the brains of people with


---------14:27----------
schizophrenia


---------14:28----------
in and out and she like does research


---------14:30----------
and works clinically in schizophrenia


---------14:32----------
that's like what she does like day in


---------14:33----------
and day out and if


---------14:35----------
i would look at her i'd say wow look at


---------14:36----------
how hyper successful she is she's like


---------14:38----------
assistant professor at the harvard


---------14:40----------
medical school and she has this like


---------14:42----------
she goes to international conferences


---------14:44----------
and presents her research wow she's so


---------14:46----------
amazing i wish i could devote myself to


---------14:48----------
something the way that she does


---------14:51----------
and then i realized like that's just not


---------14:52----------
who i am right so her


---------14:54----------
her style is very kapha oriented we'll


---------14:56----------
kind of get to that


---------14:58----------
so for vata styles recognize that your


---------15:00----------
mind is dynamic


---------15:01----------
that your motivation is easy come easy


---------15:03----------
go that follow through is going to be


---------15:05----------
hard for you which is totally fine


---------15:08----------
because what isn't hard for you is


---------15:10----------
getting re-excited about something right


---------15:12----------
so what you want to do is your


---------15:14----------
your excitement is going to bump up and


---------15:16----------
then it's going to fade


---------15:17----------
but what you can count on yourself for


---------15:19----------
is you're going to get excited about it


---------15:20----------
again


---------15:21----------
so what you need to do is have a


---------15:24----------
rotation


---------15:25----------
of what you work on so instead of going


---------15:27----------
from like okay today i'm going to learn


---------15:29----------
guitar and tomorrow i'm going to


---------15:30----------
learn drums and then the third day i'm


---------15:32----------
going to learn piano


---------15:34----------
pick like one instrument pick like one


---------15:36----------
life skill


---------15:37----------
and then like try to write and then work


---------15:39----------
on your resume and then do this


---------15:41----------
and then the key thing about vatas is


---------15:43----------
that instead of going from


---------15:45----------
one to two to three to four five six


---------15:46----------
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve


---------15:48----------
thirteen fourteen what you'll actually


---------15:50----------
find is once you hit number three or


---------15:51----------
four


---------15:52----------
you can go back to number one and you'll


---------15:54----------
be just excited about it


---------15:56----------
just as excited so you at the end of the


---------15:58----------
day what you're gonna do is not dig


---------16:00----------
one well a hundred feet deep you're


---------16:02----------
gonna dig one well one foot deep and


---------16:04----------
then you're gonna start a second well


---------16:06----------
and a third well and a fourth well


---------16:08----------
and then you just need to rotate back to


---------16:09----------
number one and then over the course


---------16:12----------
of like a month you'll have you'll have


---------16:13----------
dug four 50-foot wells


---------16:15----------
which is like pretty good and kind of


---------16:17----------
good enough okay


---------16:18----------
so solution to vata motivation is don't


---------16:20----------
try to force yourself


---------16:22----------
to follow through let your mind wander


---------16:24----------
and come back to it


---------16:26----------
from a daily perspective what you want


---------16:28----------
to do is take frequent breaks and do


---------16:31----------
multiple things a day


---------16:32----------
okay so like for vatas your


---------16:35----------
your day shouldn't be like okay i'm


---------16:37----------
gonna start work


---------16:38----------
every day at like you know 10 a.m and


---------16:41----------
i'm gonna work until


---------16:42----------
six no i mean your day can be kind of


---------16:44----------
all over the place like for structure


---------16:46----------
and frequent breaks


---------16:47----------
you know you can start you want to try


---------16:49----------
to be consistent but it's okay to have


---------16:50----------
some variability in your start time


---------16:53----------
structure frequent breaks because your


---------16:55----------
mind is going to do way better


---------16:57----------
when it's kind of like fresh and so the


---------16:59----------
other way to think about vata motivation


---------17:01----------
is that y'all are sprinters


---------17:03----------
not marathon runners so you want to have


---------17:06----------
your day lined up in like multiple


---------17:07----------
sprints


---------17:08----------
or even like a sprint for a week where


---------17:10----------
like this week i'm gonna sit down and


---------17:12----------
i'm gonna learn how to program python


---------17:14----------
and then next week i'm gonna sit down


---------17:16----------
and i'm gonna like learn how to play the


---------17:17----------
piano


---------17:18----------
so you want to organize your day in in


---------17:20----------
in sprints okay


---------17:21----------
or organize your kind of motivational


---------17:23----------
style in sprints


---------17:26----------
next thing is pitfalls for vata people


---------17:28----------
so the pitfalls that vata people run


---------17:29----------
into


---------17:30----------
tend to be like anxiety-oriented or


---------17:33----------
worry-oriented


---------17:34----------
so since our mind is kind of all over


---------17:36----------
the place


---------17:37----------
we tend to um you know anticipate all


---------17:40----------
kinds of different sorts of problems


---------17:42----------
and then all of those problems will kind


---------17:44----------
of destroy our motivation


---------17:46----------
because we're like this could go wrong


---------17:47----------
and that could go wrong and that could


---------17:48----------
go wrong and that could go wrong


---------17:50----------
and so the best thing to kind of do


---------17:52----------
there's some meditation techniques and


---------17:53----------
things like that we


---------17:54----------
that we've taught so nadi should be is


---------17:55----------
like a really good technique


---------17:57----------
for um vata motivators


---------18:00----------
kapalabhati is also really good you kind


---------18:02----------
of want to slow yourself down a little


---------18:04----------
bit just recognize that you may worry


---------18:06----------
about things


---------18:07----------
and recognize that your mind has the


---------18:10----------
capacity to see


---------18:11----------
more problems than actually exist


---------18:15----------
so have a little bit of faith in


---------18:16----------
yourself and kind of circle back to it


---------18:18----------
and over time your let your excitement


---------18:21----------
overcome your anxiety because remember


---------18:23----------
when you get started you're not anxious


---------18:25----------
you're just excited about it


---------18:26----------
and so as your excitement dwindles the


---------18:28----------
anxiety will start to decrease


---------18:30----------
and you'll lose motivation because of


---------18:32----------
your anxiety and that's actually totally


---------18:33----------
fine


---------18:34----------
so just move to the next thing and then


---------18:36----------
over time the excitement will rebuild


---------18:38----------
and the anxiety will just kind of go


---------18:39----------
away


---------18:40----------
because the thing that you've got


---------18:41----------
working for you if you're avata mind


---------18:43----------
is that the anxiety is going to be a


---------18:45----------
sprint in your mind too


---------18:46----------
that the anxiety will flare and as long


---------18:49----------
as you don't feed it


---------18:50----------
it'll actually die away on its own


---------18:51----------
because your mind is going to get bored


---------18:52----------
of it and it's going to be like oh like


---------18:54----------
let's go do something else now


---------18:56----------
so you can play that to your that's a


---------18:57----------
strength that you can kind of rely on


---------19:00----------
okay so so def the second type is the


---------19:03----------
pitta


---------19:04----------
or the driven motivational style or the


---------19:06----------
the fire motivation


---------19:08----------
so this is what i would call kind of a


---------19:09----------
more traditional motivation so when we


---------19:11----------
think about people who are highly


---------19:13----------
motivated


---------19:14----------
we think about pittas okay so bit the


---------19:16----------
motivation is like the steady burn


---------19:18----------
it's like it's not slow but it's kind of


---------19:20----------
steady


---------19:21----------
constant kind of driven towards a


---------19:24----------
particular thing and if you're a pit the


---------19:25----------
motivator generally speaking


---------19:27----------
you may not actually have that much


---------19:28----------
trouble with motivation because our


---------19:30----------
society is designed


---------19:32----------
for fitness to succeed so our societal


---------19:34----------
structure is like if you look at


---------19:37----------
you know pay raises for example there's


---------19:39----------
like a statistic that suggests that


---------19:40----------
people who earn the highest salaries


---------19:42----------
like move every two years


---------19:44----------
so you're not like avatar and switching


---------19:46----------
jobs every six months


---------19:48----------
and you're not like a kapha and


---------19:49----------
switching jobs every five years if you


---------19:50----------
like kind of


---------19:51----------
go to a job you work really hard you


---------19:53----------
start to kind of get bored of it you


---------19:55----------
sort of burn out a little bit and then


---------19:56----------
you move to the next thing that's sort


---------19:58----------
of the bit the style


---------20:00----------
so if you're a pit the motivator a


---------20:02----------
couple of things to


---------20:04----------
kind of be mindful of is that you want a


---------20:06----------
sort of stable work day so you want to


---------20:08----------
work


---------20:08----------
start at maybe like you know somewhere


---------20:10----------
between eight and ten in the morning


---------20:12----------
and then run until five or six um you


---------20:15----------
neces you don't necessarily want to take


---------20:16----------
a bunch of breaks because like once you


---------20:18----------
get going you kind of get going right


---------20:20----------
um and then like you know if the fire


---------20:22----------
goes out it can be hard to kind of


---------20:24----------
reignite it


---------20:25----------
second thing about bit this is you have


---------20:27----------
to be careful about burnout so


---------20:29----------
bitters often times have ambition


---------20:32----------
that exceeds their stamina okay so what


---------20:35----------
this means is


---------20:36----------
and you go you guys may run into this


---------20:39----------
which is that


---------20:39----------
um you know you feel like you really


---------20:43----------
want to work


---------20:44----------
but then you kind of feel burnt out at


---------20:45----------
the end and then like


---------20:47----------
you don't actually end up progressing


---------20:49----------
because you kind of like


---------20:51----------
burnt up too quickly and so what i want


---------20:53----------
you guys to think a little bit about is


---------20:54----------
like


---------20:55----------
you know the brightest candle burns out


---------20:57----------
the fastest


---------20:58----------
so if you're a pit that you may need to


---------21:00----------
restrain that kind of fire


---------21:02----------
a little bit you guys have to be careful


---------21:04----------
about sort of feelings of ambition or


---------21:06----------
feelings of righteousness


---------21:07----------
or other kinds of like emotions like


---------21:09----------
anger or irritability


---------21:12----------
that drive you to work really hard and


---------21:14----------
kind of leave you


---------21:16----------
in sort of a burnt out sort of state so


---------21:19----------
pithas also need to watch out for


---------21:21----------
interpersonal conflict


---------21:25----------
so my diagnostic question for pithas is


---------21:27----------
are you intolerant of the idiocy of


---------21:29----------
others


---------21:31----------
and if the answer to that question is


---------21:32----------
yes then chances are you're a pitta


---------21:34----------
so as you motivate yourself you guys may


---------21:38----------
end up working with other people


---------21:40----------
and you may find that their motivational


---------21:42----------
style


---------21:43----------
is different from yours and you can get


---------21:45----------
really really frustrated with them and


---------21:47----------
that can lead to interpersonal conflict


---------21:49----------
which really shatters your productivity


---------21:51----------
because then you're fighting with this


---------21:52----------
person instead of doing your work


---------21:54----------
so the pitfall to really watch out for


---------21:56----------
if you're a beta is interpersonal


---------21:57----------
conflict


---------21:59----------
that brings us to our third um


---------22:02----------
motivational style which is kaphas


---------22:04----------
so kaphas are earth types or


---------22:07----------
the resilient motivators i kind of think


---------22:10----------
about them


---------22:11----------
their motivation is like a marathon okay


---------22:14----------
so what that means is that it's slow to


---------22:16----------
start


---------22:17----------
and really doesn't like start rolling


---------22:19----------
until like you know


---------22:20----------
late in the day so i want you guys to


---------22:23----------
think about kapha's as people with


---------22:25----------
low acceleration and high top speed


---------22:28----------
whereas vatas have high acceleration and


---------22:31----------
low top speed


---------22:33----------
betas are kind of in the middle so the


---------22:35----------
biggest thing about kaphas is that they


---------22:37----------
tend to beat themselves up


---------22:38----------
for not being faster they look at the


---------22:41----------
fitness and they say like oh my god look


---------22:43----------
at how successful and driven this person


---------22:44----------
is


---------22:45----------
they look at the vatas and they're like


---------22:46----------
oh my god look at how quickly this


---------22:48----------
person learns things


---------22:50----------
so uh gaffas just they start slow but


---------22:53----------
they hit their top speed


---------22:54----------
and when they hit their top speed they


---------22:56----------
do awesome work so the main thing about


---------22:58----------
guppas is you got to give yourself


---------23:00----------
time to get started so some of these


---------23:03----------
people may have a lot of trouble


---------23:04----------
starting work like early in the morning


---------23:08----------
and they may sort of like have their


---------23:09----------
most productive hours late at night


---------23:12----------
or like in the in the middle of the


---------23:14----------
afternoon whereas like a zavata


---------23:16----------
once 3 pm rolls around i like i'm done


---------23:18----------
like my stamina is shot


---------23:20----------
and so for kapha kapha's the biggest


---------23:21----------
thing that they need to learn is kind of


---------23:23----------
patience


---------23:23----------
right and recognize that like you're


---------23:25----------
someone who will take


---------23:27----------
maybe a few weeks or a few months to


---------23:29----------
like figure out how


---------23:30----------
you know your job works some people are


---------23:33----------
quick studies


---------23:34----------
kaphas are slow studies which doesn't


---------23:36----------
mean that they're dumb


---------23:37----------
because the interesting thing about


---------23:38----------
kapha memory is that they learn


---------23:40----------
slowly but they also forget slowly


---------23:43----------
whereas vatas learn very quickly and


---------23:45----------
then they forget very quickly


---------23:47----------
so with kapha's you're sort of like a


---------23:49----------
late game build


---------23:50----------
okay so it's going to take you some time


---------23:53----------
to get started so be patient with


---------23:55----------
yourself


---------23:56----------
once you get kraken you're a force to be


---------23:58----------
reckoned with


---------23:59----------
so you can think about kaf as sort of


---------24:01----------
late bloomers i think a lot of people


---------24:03----------
on you know a lot of people in our


---------24:05----------
community are like oh i miss the boat


---------24:07----------
i'm so old now


---------24:09----------
um there are so many people who are


---------24:10----------
younger and more successful than i am


---------24:12----------
you got to understand that you just may


---------24:13----------
be a late bloomer


---------24:14----------
and be patient with yourself which


---------24:17----------
brings us to the cognitive pitfall


---------24:19----------
of guffas which is that they tend to be


---------24:21----------
very very self-critical and prone to


---------24:23----------
depression


---------24:24----------
and as a result they are likely to give


---------24:27----------
up


---------24:29----------
kind of at the worst possible moment


---------24:31----------
just when they're about to really start


---------24:32----------
kicking ass


---------24:34----------
right so i want you guys to think about


---------24:35----------
a kapha like a late game carry


---------24:38----------
whereas like if you're 25 minutes into


---------24:40----------
the game and you haven't really done a


---------24:41----------
whole lot you've just been kind of


---------24:42----------
farming and you've died a couple of


---------24:44----------
times


---------24:44----------
but you're sort of a late game carry and


---------24:46----------
and guffas have a tendency to be really


---------24:48----------
self-critical


---------24:50----------
and so they'll work at something for


---------24:51----------
like you know a week two weeks three


---------24:53----------
weeks four weeks and they won't see a


---------24:54----------
whole lot of result


---------24:56----------
and then the self-critical thinking


---------24:57----------
starts to step in and says oh look at


---------24:59----------
how dumb you


---------25:00----------
are you've been doing this for a month


---------25:01----------
and you haven't gotten anywhere you


---------25:02----------
might as well stop


---------25:05----------
and then when they stop they really


---------25:06----------
shoot themselves in the foot because if


---------25:08----------
they


---------25:08----------
actually just like recognize that it's


---------25:11----------
going to take me a while


---------25:12----------
and if you recognize that you're patient


---------25:14----------
with yourself if you let yourself be


---------25:16----------
patient with yourself


---------25:17----------
if you don't let yourself be quite so


---------25:19----------
critical about how slow you are


---------25:21----------
you'll realize that like when you figure


---------25:23----------
things out you'll have figured them out


---------25:25----------
completely and then you'll really start


---------25:27----------
to fly


---------25:28----------
so just give yourself a little bit of


---------25:30----------
time give yourself a little bit of


---------25:32----------
patience and recognize that


---------25:33----------
your acceleration is going to be slow


---------25:36----------
but once you get into a groove


---------25:38----------
you'll really do amazing work so i've


---------25:41----------
worked with a couple of like guffas


---------25:44----------
who um you know


---------25:47----------
they they sort of feel very anxious in


---------25:50----------
their workplace because they'll get some


---------25:52----------
new employee


---------25:53----------
who like seems super bright and super


---------25:55----------
capable and everyone's like oh look how


---------25:57----------
smart this person is


---------25:58----------
and then like they'll get a new person


---------26:00----------
you know they've been there for three


---------26:01----------
years and then the new person shows up


---------26:03----------
nakafa feels like this person is doing


---------26:05----------
way better than i am


---------26:06----------
and they've only been here two weeks and


---------26:08----------
i've been here three three years


---------26:10----------
and then if they give themselves a


---------26:11----------
little bit of patience what they begin


---------26:12----------
to see is that like


---------26:14----------
everyone starts to realize oh the shiny


---------26:16----------
new toy is just shiny and actually can't


---------26:17----------
get the work done


---------26:18----------
and they kind of come back to the coffin


---------26:20----------
they're like hey can you help us out


---------26:21----------
with this again


---------26:22----------
hey you know it seems like i'm really


---------26:24----------
having trouble this person's really not


---------26:25----------
cutting it


---------26:26----------
and so kapha's kind of you know you just


---------26:28----------
got to really give yourself patience


---------26:31----------
um and so that's sort of a quick rundown


---------26:34----------
of different motivational styles just to


---------26:36----------
recap


---------26:37----------
we have vata motivators which are


---------26:38----------
sprinters or dynamic


---------26:40----------
right motivation is easy come easy go


---------26:43----------
the solution is to rotate things that


---------26:46----------
you work on


---------26:47----------
and let your mind be a little bit free


---------26:49----------
but


---------26:50----------
rotate them between the same set of


---------26:53----------
things so when you get bored of number


---------26:54----------
one go to number two when you get bored


---------26:56----------
of number two go to number three you get


---------26:57----------
bored of number three


---------26:58----------
number four and then back to one the


---------27:01----------
things to watch out about are anxiety


---------27:03----------
so a lot of times your anxiety will tell


---------27:05----------
you oh my god all this stuff will go


---------27:06----------
wrong just drop it


---------27:08----------
and the cool thing to remember there is


---------27:09----------
that like your anxiety will go away too


---------27:11----------
because your mind is fata and dynamic


---------27:14----------
and you'll get bored of your anxiety


---------27:16----------
second type is bit the motivators that


---------27:18----------
are sort of driven


---------27:20----------
motivators so this is the classic


---------27:21----------
motivation that's kind of kind of steady


---------27:23----------
constant


---------27:24----------
a lot of ambition which you have to


---------27:26----------
watch out for is interpersonal conflict


---------27:28----------
because


---------27:29----------
you're going to have low tolerance and


---------27:30----------
low patience for other people


---------27:32----------
there's going to be a lot of anger


---------27:33----------
irritability righteousness


---------27:35----------
that could kind of push you in the wrong


---------27:37----------
direction and then you're going to get


---------27:39----------
so caught up in your interpersonal


---------27:40----------
conflict that you're not going to be


---------27:41----------
productive in your work anymore


---------27:44----------
the third motivational type is the


---------27:45----------
kaphas or earth motivators or resilient


---------27:48----------
motivators


---------27:49----------
these are our marathon runners


---------27:52----------
so they start slow um they take a while


---------27:55----------
to get to top speed but once they hit


---------27:58----------
top speed they're really a force to be


---------27:59----------
reckoned with


---------28:00----------
so you got to give yourself time and


---------28:02----------
have patience to for yourself


---------28:04----------
and recognize that kaphas have a


---------28:06----------
tendency to be very self-critical


---------28:08----------
and so a lot of kaphas give up right at


---------28:10----------
the moment of success


---------28:12----------
and so just give yourself more time give


---------28:14----------
yourself time to kind of get started


---------28:17----------
and you'll be far more successful


---------28:20----------
so i hope that was kind of um


---------28:23----------
helpful and what i want to really what i


---------28:26----------
want you guys to take away is that if


---------28:27----------
you have


---------28:28----------
trouble with motivation maybe the reason


---------28:30----------
you struggle so much is because you're


---------28:32----------
trying to motivate


---------28:34----------
you're trying to play a class that


---------28:35----------
you're not that you aren't


---------28:37----------
right so you're a mage running around


---------28:39----------
with a two-handed sword and you're like


---------28:40----------
my dps sucks


---------28:42----------
yeah it's going to like start casting


---------28:44----------
fireballs bro


---------28:46----------
and don't do what other people are doing


---------28:47----------
recognize what your strengths are


---------28:49----------
and play to your motivational strengths


---------28:51----------
and then you'll be surprised at what


---------28:52----------
you're able to accomplish


---------29:04----------
you
