---------00:00----------
so a couple of other things uh to just


---------00:02----------
remember so our coaching program we just


---------00:04----------
uh


---------00:04----------
opened up a bunch of slots on monday so


---------00:07----------
there should be


---------00:09----------
plenty of slots open for you guys we're


---------00:11----------
going to open up more slots next week


---------00:13----------
a lot of people are kind of concerned


---------00:15----------
about coaching because of issues of fit


---------00:17----------
or they worry like they're going to


---------00:18----------
burden people or that they're going to


---------00:20----------
monopolize time or they're not going to


---------00:21----------
be able to connect with other people


---------00:23----------
and so one of the things that i want to


---------00:25----------
remind you guys is that there's a huge


---------00:27----------
selection


---------00:28----------
bias um that


---------00:31----------
uh comes with our coaching program what


---------00:34----------
i mean by that is like


---------00:35----------
you know there aren't like randos in our


---------00:36----------
coaching program our coaching program is


---------00:38----------
y'all


---------00:39----------
it's the same group of people who you


---------00:42----------
know it's the same group of people who


---------00:43----------
watch stream


---------00:44----------
so the goal of coaching and especially


---------00:46----------
group coaching is to like connect you


---------00:47----------
guys with each other


---------00:48----------
and and help you guys work through stuff


---------00:50----------
together so here's a


---------00:53----------
uh just a quick testimonial from our


---------00:54----------
coaching program i really enjoy being


---------00:56----------
able to talk to someone i don't really


---------00:59----------
allow myself to talk to people about my


---------01:01----------
issues


---------01:02----------
and just lifting the burden is great


---------01:04----------
right and i think that's kind of like a


---------01:05----------
good testimonial because i think part of


---------01:07----------
the problem is that you guys


---------01:09----------
don't allow yourselves to like


---------01:13----------
be supported by other people that you


---------01:15----------
want support but then you pull away


---------01:18----------
so let's hop in with albert


---------01:23----------
you're gonna have to forgive me i'm a


---------01:24----------
little bit flustered today and it's been


---------01:26----------
chaotic apparently i doxed myself


---------01:28----------
earlier


---------01:30----------
and then there's the van that tends to


---------01:32----------
happen sometimes yeah


---------01:33----------
um and and you know then i saw my wife


---------01:36----------
enter the van with a stranger


---------01:38----------
and then i was a little bit cons


---------01:39----------
confused so then i just literally got up


---------01:41----------
and and


---------01:42----------
ran out to my front yard and left stream


---------01:45----------
hanging


---------01:46----------
so i'm gonna need a minute to compose


---------01:47----------
myself


---------01:49----------
and maybe we can talk about my feelings


---------01:51----------
today


---------01:53----------
does that happen often do you ever get


---------01:56----------
reverse therapize on your own streams um


---------01:59----------
no but that's the first time for


---------02:00----------
everything man


---------02:03----------
and given what appears to be your vast


---------02:05----------
technical expertise and


---------02:07----------
and manual dexterity maybe you can maybe


---------02:10----------
you know you can help me out for once


---------02:11----------
yeah you want to see something while you


---------02:14----------
compose yourself


---------02:16----------
absolutely man i think that'd be awesome


---------02:18----------
um


---------02:21----------
have you seen a lot of magic or anything


---------02:23----------
of that sort in your lifetime


---------02:25----------
um sort of but i don't know about a lot


---------02:28----------
i don't think i've seen a lot i've seen


---------02:30----------
some


---------02:32----------
okay um


---------02:35----------
so this i guess this is more of an


---------02:36----------
experiment this is not really like a


---------02:38----------
trick


---------02:38----------
um so like i've recently been getting


---------02:42----------
into chess


---------02:43----------
and it's something that like i


---------02:44----------
personally enjoy a lot it's just


---------02:46----------
a lot of people find it anxiety-inducing


---------02:48----------
i find it kind of relaxing


---------02:50----------
knowing that like you know everything


---------02:52----------
that happens is kind of just


---------02:53----------
between you and someone else and it's


---------02:55----------
all like within like your own


---------02:57----------
capabilities and your own control


---------02:58----------
[Music]


---------03:00----------
and so there's like different like time


---------03:01----------
formats you know like there's like


---------03:03----------
classical which is super


---------03:04----------
long um and then you have like ultra


---------03:06----------
bullet which is just like you have a


---------03:07----------
minute


---------03:08----------
to just like make all your moves um and


---------03:11----------
if you run out of time you lose


---------03:12----------
and so the thing that i'm fascinated


---------03:15----------
about that is like with


---------03:16----------
like what the more time you have the


---------03:18----------
more i guess opportunities you have to


---------03:20----------
kind of like


---------03:21----------
think out like the best move but when


---------03:23----------
you have no time


---------03:24----------
you're kind of resorting to your your


---------03:27----------
instincts and like


---------03:28----------
patterns that you already know and so in


---------03:29----------
a way if you know someone really


---------03:32----------
well you can like predict what they're


---------03:33----------
going to do like when you like shorten


---------03:35----------
that time or you add a time pressure to


---------03:37----------
it


---------03:38----------
and so i've been like really fascinated


---------03:39----------
with that idea as of late and


---------03:41----------
um i've been working on something that i


---------03:43----------
think speaks to that


---------03:45----------
so if you would indulge me for a second


---------03:47----------
i'm gonna bring out a giant timer


---------03:49----------
um yeah


---------03:56----------
okay and so basically we're going to


---------03:58----------
create a card um


---------04:00----------
under some time time constraints and


---------04:03----------
um i'm just going to ask you two like


---------04:06----------
binary questions like


---------04:07----------
uh yes or no type of things or red or


---------04:09----------
blue that kind of


---------04:10----------
deal but just to practice i don't want


---------04:13----------
you to think about your answers you just


---------04:14----------
say the first thing that comes to mind


---------04:16----------
so we're going to do some unrelated


---------04:18----------
things all right


---------04:19----------
um pirates are ninjas


---------04:22----------
parts um


---------04:26----------
let's see so ninjas


---------04:30----------
how about apples or oranges


---------04:33----------
apples okay interesting


---------04:37----------
and then do one more max pc


---------04:42----------
pc pc all right we're on twitch that


---------04:45----------
makes sense


---------04:47----------
okay so


---------04:50----------
here i'm gonna have a timer and i'm just


---------04:52----------
gonna ask you a bunch of card related


---------04:54----------
questions


---------04:55----------
okay and we're going to need you to use


---------04:57----------
your imagination for this


---------04:58----------
okay okay and


---------05:02----------
ready set go in every deck of cards


---------05:06----------
there's two types of cards numbers and


---------05:07----------
pictures what would you like numbers or


---------05:09----------
pictures


---------05:09----------
numbers numbers all right so we're going


---------05:12----------
to


---------05:12----------
take the numbers and we're going to move


---------05:14----------
down the deck leaving just the pictures


---------05:16----------
and um there's the jack the queen and


---------05:18----------
the king um which one of those would you


---------05:19----------
like just name one


---------05:21----------
cake king and then name a suit


---------05:25----------
spades spades the king of spades


---------05:29----------
and it took us 24 seconds to generate


---------05:34----------
that card okay and so


---------05:38----------
i find it curious that you would end up


---------05:39----------
on the king of spades so you notice that


---------05:41----------
this deck


---------05:43----------
has been sitting here the entire time


---------05:44----------
right yep and i haven't


---------05:46----------
touched it at all i haven't gotten near


---------05:48----------
it


---------05:50----------
yeah that's correct yep all right so i'm


---------05:53----------
gonna pick it up for the first time


---------05:54----------
obviously like normally i would just


---------05:55----------
hand this to you


---------05:56----------
um if we were to do this in person


---------06:00----------
so right now we have two pieces of


---------06:01----------
information we have the king of spades


---------06:03----------
and we also have


---------06:04----------
the time it took to generate that card


---------06:07----------
the number 24. and so if i count down


---------06:11----------
24 cards from the top


---------06:15----------
hopefully if i kind of attuned to your


---------06:19----------
your wavelength the king of space should


---------06:20----------
be at the 24th position


---------06:22----------
okay all right


---------06:26----------
one two


---------06:30----------
three four five


---------06:33----------
6 7 8 9 10


---------06:36----------
11 12 13 14 15


---------06:40----------
16 17 18 19


---------06:43----------
20 21 22


---------06:47----------
this is the 23rd card so hopefully


---------06:50----------
that's right the 24th card


---------06:54----------
awesome man


---------06:58----------
that was really cool thank you


---------07:02----------
all right do you feel more at ease now


---------07:05----------
we're ready to


---------07:06----------
yeah so what was why the pirates apples


---------07:09----------
and ninjas


---------07:10----------
or is that i just wanted to like


---------07:13----------
sometimes it's like hard to


---------07:14----------
like because there's a timing aspect


---------07:16----------
sometimes people are not ready to like


---------07:18----------
answer immediately they'll like think a


---------07:19----------
little bit so there's just to prime


---------07:20----------
people


---------07:21----------
to just say the first thing as soon as


---------07:23----------
they hear it


---------07:27----------
so that's really interesting


---------07:32----------
i'm just trying to think about you know


---------07:33----------
whether we should do a spoilerina


---------07:36----------
no no okay no spoilery no


---------07:40----------
okay but that's really cool i i really


---------07:43----------
enjoyed your trick albert


---------07:45----------
thank you honestly i'm impressed because


---------07:49----------
i can almost duplicate it


---------07:51----------
the one thing that i can't do is show


---------07:54----------
the cards face up


---------07:56----------
that's what i can't figure out so if the


---------07:58----------
deck is face down i think i could


---------08:00----------
duplicate your trick


---------08:02----------
but i don't think i could do it i don't


---------08:04----------
know how you did it face up


---------08:06----------
that has me thinking


---------08:12----------
yeah anyway that that's fantastic dude i


---------08:14----------
really like it


---------08:15----------
thank you so is is


---------08:19----------
it sounds like you spend your time with


---------08:20----------
creative pursuits


---------08:23----------
um mostly yeah well i would say


---------08:26----------
now i'm mostly just someone who


---------08:29----------
i basically go on youtube i go on reddit


---------08:31----------
and i find like a video of something


---------08:33----------
that i'm like wow this is really cool


---------08:35----------
and i will think to myself i wonder how


---------08:38----------
one goes about learning this


---------08:40----------
and then i'll start doing research i'll


---------08:41----------
watch go down the


---------08:43----------
youtube rabbit hole watch every video on


---------08:45----------
something


---------08:46----------
and then find like the really nice


---------08:48----------
subcultures and the communities that


---------08:49----------
surround it and then


---------08:51----------
try to like immerse myself in it and so


---------08:54----------
in a way i'm more of like a collector of


---------08:56----------
hobbies rather than like


---------08:57----------
an expert at anything trick i just like


---------09:01----------
knowing how things are done and


---------09:04----------
kind of like how how far you can push a


---------09:07----------
skill or


---------09:08----------
a sk or a knowledge set and


---------09:11----------
and you say you use the word now so does


---------09:14----------
that imply that that's


---------09:15----------
it's changed for you recently i would


---------09:18----------
say it's something that


---------09:18----------
i've always held at the back of my mind


---------09:21----------
like


---------09:22----------
even like as a kid like i was like


---------09:24----------
really into a lot of different things


---------09:26----------
but i was sort of raised in a way where


---------09:30----------
like it's good to have hobbies it's good


---------09:32----------
to be well-rounded for college


---------09:34----------
applications but


---------09:35----------
like no you can't make a career doing


---------09:36----------
this you know because that's all it is


---------09:38----------
it's just a hobby


---------09:39----------
and so um i guess for the longest time


---------09:43----------
like i just


---------09:44----------
didn't think it was like worth putting


---------09:46----------
in more effort into getting better this


---------09:48----------
stuff because there wasn't any kind of


---------09:49----------
financial gain


---------09:51----------
it's just something that i would do for


---------09:52----------
myself and


---------09:55----------
essentially like when things didn't work


---------09:56----------
out in college and like i didn't end up


---------09:58----------
going down a traditional path i still


---------10:01----------
like


---------10:01----------
like well music um was the thing that i


---------10:04----------
was studying or ended up switching to in


---------10:06----------
college


---------10:07----------
and i'm like well this is kind of


---------10:10----------
difficult and i don't know if i


---------10:12----------
know how if i'm ever going to be good


---------10:14----------
enough to like be


---------10:15----------
in an orchestra cause i play the violin


---------10:18----------
and so then i switched over to like


---------10:20----------
filmmaking and then


---------10:23----------
eventually it landed in streaming but i


---------10:25----------
didn't really like know what my niche


---------10:27----------
wasn't streaming


---------10:28----------
like i played games but like above


---------10:30----------
average but not good enough to be


---------10:32----------
viewed as like a gaming streamer and


---------10:34----------
like my music


---------10:35----------
was good but not good enough to be a


---------10:37----------
music streamer um


---------10:38----------
i think magic was the one thing that i


---------10:41----------
kind of stood out


---------10:42----------
but even i think when you do like any


---------10:45----------
performance


---------10:46----------
art related thing on twitch you're


---------10:47----------
always going to hit a wall where


---------10:49----------
when you've over saturated your audience


---------10:52----------
with everything that you can do


---------10:53----------
then people lose interest because


---------10:57----------
they've


---------10:57----------
they've seen every trick you've done you


---------10:59----------
can only do


---------11:01----------
so many variations of it before you will


---------11:03----------
tap yourself dry


---------11:04----------
there's only finite amount of things


---------11:06----------
that exist in


---------11:07----------
the magic resource you know universe


---------11:11----------
and i guess as of late now i'm like well


---------11:15----------
if i just


---------11:16----------
make my passion for learning and like


---------11:18----------
getting into all these weird things my


---------11:20----------
hobby like maybe


---------11:21----------
or like my my job like maybe this is


---------11:24----------
something that i could see myself doing


---------11:25----------
you know five ten


---------11:26----------
twenty years down the line versus like


---------11:29----------
like only for like a couple years


---------11:31----------
i see so it's almost like you're you're


---------11:33----------
taking the


---------11:35----------
acquisition of new skills and exploring


---------11:37----------
a new hobby


---------11:38----------
as your constant mm-hmm yeah


---------11:42----------
and i think it's something that i've


---------11:43----------
always done but i never


---------11:45----------
thought that it could be something that


---------11:46----------
i could i guess do for a living


---------11:49----------
that makes sense yeah i mean i think


---------11:51----------
that sounds really cool because i think


---------11:52----------
it actually mirrors a lot about


---------11:54----------
you know what people's experience on the


---------11:57----------
internet is which is that we get


---------11:59----------
relatively excited about something and


---------12:02----------
then we kind of


---------12:03----------
dig into it for a while and then we sort


---------12:05----------
of move on to the next thing


---------12:08----------
um and and that sounds really cool


---------12:11----------
and uh so albert yeah man that that


---------12:14----------
sounds cool is there something in


---------12:15----------
particular you wanted to talk about


---------12:17----------
today or something that maybe i can help


---------12:18----------
you with


---------12:22----------
um


---------12:24----------
say i like wrote down a bunch of stuff


---------12:26----------
give me a second i just have like a list


---------12:30----------
nothing like in particular i feel like a


---------12:32----------
lot of it


---------12:34----------
is like i have a fairly


---------12:37----------
um grounded stance and kind of


---------12:40----------
where i am position like the whole


---------12:44----------
uh grand scheme of things but some of it


---------12:47----------
is just like okay like these things make


---------12:49----------
me feel bad


---------12:50----------
and i know why it makes me feel bad but


---------12:53----------
the solutions don't seem to be like


---------12:56----------
it's like it's like i'm trying to do the


---------12:57----------
things that i know i'm supposed to do


---------12:59----------
but it's like difficult regardless um


---------13:03----------
so maybe you can help me out with that


---------13:05----------
yeah i didn't understand


---------13:07----------
what this sentence meant you said i have


---------13:09----------
a grounded stance


---------13:11----------
in the way that i like where i am


---------13:14----------
like where i exist it's like i know kind


---------13:16----------
of


---------13:19----------
like in in i guess like the streaming


---------13:21----------
world and like the content creation


---------13:23----------
world like i know where


---------13:24----------
my position is and all of that um and


---------13:30----------
it's like i don't have any


---------13:34----------
so here i'm trying to figure out like


---------13:37----------
the best way for me to


---------13:39----------
just try to clarify my sentiment tell me


---------13:41----------
what your position is


---------13:43----------
in the streaming world


---------13:46----------
so as like someone who used to be part


---------13:48----------
of an online streaming community


---------13:51----------
and is no longer part of that and is not


---------13:53----------
likely to be


---------13:54----------
kind of welcome in that like


---------13:57----------
um close-knit group of people


---------14:00----------
um it's like now i'm just trying to kind


---------14:03----------
of figure out like what i can do


---------14:05----------
as like a solo entity and then


---------14:08----------
but what i've been struggling with both


---------14:11----------
kind of like


---------14:12----------
business-wise but also like from like a


---------14:15----------
personal


---------14:16----------
human fulfillment level is


---------14:20----------
it's hard to stream when you like


---------14:23----------
you are the only person like in


---------14:27----------
like you are the only person responsible


---------14:28----------
for your content


---------14:30----------
i think unlike youtube videos where you


---------14:31----------
have a lot of time to ideate and you


---------14:33----------
have like


---------14:33----------
editing and a lot of external things


---------14:36----------
that you can do to spice up your content


---------14:38----------
but streaming you're doing long hours


---------14:41----------
and if you're not


---------14:41----------
gaming like you're essentially trying to


---------14:45----------
market your life and like your


---------14:48----------
interpersonal relationships and that's


---------14:50----------
like what people


---------14:51----------
tune into what and that someone who like


---------14:54----------
doesn't


---------14:54----------
really have that anymore and also


---------14:58----------
knowing that there there's a lot of like


---------15:01----------
people that i would normally want to


---------15:03----------
reach out to or be friends with that


---------15:05----------
feel like are cut off to me um


---------15:09----------
it's been like a struggle trying to


---------15:10----------
figure out how i can sustain myself


---------15:12----------
and also kind of dealing with the


---------15:15----------
loneliness of


---------15:16----------
being kind of like on my own and doing


---------15:19----------
my thing


---------15:21----------
yeah and i think yeah i mean


---------15:24----------
albert it sounds to me uh


---------15:34----------
so i just want to comment for a second


---------15:36----------
about drama


---------15:37----------
so like we're not really here and i just


---------15:39----------
want to make it clear to everyone that


---------15:40----------
we're not here to talk about drama right


---------15:42----------
that's not


---------15:43----------
really what i care about and if that's


---------15:45----------
what people are looking for they can go


---------15:46----------
look elsewhere


---------15:48----------
um but what i'm hearing from you is


---------15:50----------
actually a story of


---------15:53----------
uh rejection what i'm hearing is a story


---------15:57----------
of being alone or being part of


---------15:59----------
something and now no longer being a part


---------16:01----------
of it


---------16:02----------
it's almost like i mean when i hear you


---------16:04----------
talk what i'm envisioning is like a wolf


---------16:07----------
that's like no longer part of the pack


---------16:09----------
and and what i'm almost hearing is like


---------16:11----------
a a sense of like


---------16:13----------
you know how does the lone wolf survive


---------16:16----------
um and and it sounds really challenging


---------16:20----------
for you and you're trying to figure that


---------16:21----------
out i mean that's that's what i'm kind


---------16:23----------
of feeling


---------16:25----------
between the lines and i'm not saying


---------16:26----------
that from a drama perspective it's just


---------16:28----------
like that i think that's yeah yeah


---------16:30----------
you know and yeah i think


---------16:34----------
that that that's a fair assessment um


---------16:38----------
and i think it's like particularly


---------16:40----------
difficult for me because i've always


---------16:41----------
been a very


---------16:42----------
extroverted person um even though like


---------16:44----------
my demeanor is not like the typical


---------16:46----------
like loud outgoing archetype that you


---------16:49----------
normally


---------16:51----------
um think of when you think of like


---------16:52----------
extrovert but i've always been someone


---------16:54----------
who


---------16:55----------
like values friendships and


---------16:56----------
relationships and having like


---------16:58----------
being surrounded by people and i think


---------17:02----------
a lot of my struggles comes with the the


---------17:05----------
clash of that


---------17:06----------
sentiment but also feeling like i want


---------17:08----------
to be somebody as well


---------17:10----------
at the same time like i want to be


---------17:11----------
recognized for what i have to offer


---------17:14----------
and but i'm also you know


---------17:17----------
but i struggle with wanting to use the


---------17:20----------
people that i'm


---------17:21----------
around and making them happy um often at


---------17:24----------
the cost of my own personal ambitions


---------17:25----------
and so just to


---------17:28----------
basically i guess these two ideas always


---------17:31----------
clash with


---------17:32----------
one another what do you what do you mean


---------17:34----------
what do you mean by that that


---------17:35----------
people you want to make the people


---------17:36----------
around you happy but at the cost of your


---------17:38----------
own personal ambition


---------17:42----------
i'm like the most conflict diverse


---------17:44----------
person like ever


---------17:46----------
like if someone wants me to do something


---------17:47----------
i will do it um even if i don't


---------17:49----------
necessarily


---------17:50----------
like if even if it's not good for me or


---------17:52----------
i don't have the time for it


---------17:53----------
or i don't have the resources for it


---------17:56----------
because like i'd rather


---------17:58----------
see them like succeed and do well and be


---------18:00----------
happy


---------18:01----------
then um like do what's best for me in


---------18:04----------
the moment


---------18:05----------
and i think i've always thought that


---------18:08----------
like oh i can do all this


---------18:09----------
and because like that's just the kind of


---------18:11----------
person i am and like took pride in being


---------18:13----------
someone who could like shoulder a lot


---------18:15----------
um and like as of late you know in the


---------18:18----------
past year or so i realized like that's


---------18:20----------
definitely just


---------18:21----------
not true something that i've told myself


---------18:24----------
like


---------18:24----------
it's like a false identity i've given to


---------18:26----------
myself you know


---------18:28----------
i think i've i'm just really good at


---------18:30----------
like repressing and internalizing


---------18:32----------
feelings like over like long long


---------18:34----------
periods of time


---------18:36----------
okay and some of this just stems from


---------18:38----------
just the way that i've


---------18:39----------
always dealt with conflict as a child


---------18:42----------
you know it's just like people won't be


---------18:45----------
mad i won't be upset if i disagree with


---------18:47----------
it or do whatever they tell me


---------18:49----------
and so that's and it's gotten me to like


---------18:52----------
where i


---------18:52----------
am to degree right so i'm like if it


---------18:55----------
didn't if it


---------18:56----------
if it works you know why stop doing it


---------19:02----------
i know that's obviously not not a


---------19:04----------
healthy mindset or


---------19:06----------
not the way you should approach


---------19:06----------
everything um but


---------19:09----------
albert can i think for a second yeah go


---------19:12----------
for it


---------19:19----------
so my first thought is boy you've been


---------19:21----------
doing a lot of thinking haven't you


---------19:24----------
that's all i've had time to do so


---------19:29----------
that's all i've had time to do do i


---------19:32----------
detect a little bit of


---------19:34----------
frustration in that sentence


---------19:38----------
um maybe not frustration but just kind


---------19:40----------
of


---------19:41----------
acceptance um you know i've had a lot of


---------19:44----------
time


---------19:45----------
i took a year cynicism maybe that's the


---------19:47----------
better


---------19:48----------
yeah cynical like yep this is this is


---------19:51----------
just how things are


---------19:52----------
this is it'd be like this sometimes and


---------19:55----------
i'm just trying to make the most out of


---------19:56----------
it


---------19:56----------
yeah and there's a lot right you've


---------20:00----------
thought


---------20:01----------
what are you feeling right now


---------20:04----------
um at this very moment


---------20:10----------
um


---------20:15----------
it's not catharsis i feel like i'm


---------20:17----------
saying things that i've said


---------20:19----------
or that i've like thought about and


---------20:21----------
talked about a lot


---------20:22----------
um you know privately to a lot of like


---------20:24----------
close friends and family


---------20:25----------
so it's not something that i feel like


---------20:27----------
this is a revelation for me


---------20:29----------
um i do a lot of journaling so


---------20:35----------
[Music]


---------20:37----------
what what am i feeling is neither


---------20:41----------
it's like very neutral like i don't feel


---------20:45----------
like it doesn't make me feel


---------20:46----------
particularly good but i also don't feel


---------20:48----------
bad for like okay saying this so okay


---------20:52----------
yeah so sometimes we can perceive


---------20:55----------
neutral


---------20:55----------
sometimes it's neutral and sometimes


---------20:57----------
what we perceive as neutral


---------20:59----------
is actually something that's more like


---------21:01----------
bittersweet


---------21:03----------
right so bittersweet isn't really


---------21:05----------
neutral but are you feeling neutral or


---------21:07----------
are you feeling bittersweet


---------21:10----------
obviously more like bittersweet so


---------21:12----------
that's what's like feeling from yeah


---------21:15----------
right there's there's hurt there


---------21:18----------
but there's also positivity


---------21:22----------
yeah and and it's interesting but i i i


---------21:25----------
can't tell if your face is really


---------21:26----------
neutral or i'm reading into it or


---------21:29----------
are um it's the lighting


---------21:32----------
but i actually see a fair amount of


---------21:35----------
bitterness


---------21:36----------
just right behind your eyes for lack of


---------21:39----------
a better term


---------21:40----------
i take off my glasses will help no leave


---------21:43----------
them on no i don't think we need to see


---------21:44----------
it


---------21:45----------
it's okay all right um


---------21:49----------
so let me ask you so so albert here's


---------21:53----------
so first of all i i think you know for


---------21:56----------
lack of a better term i'm gonna say i'm


---------21:58----------
i'm impressed or


---------21:59----------
or maybe excited or um


---------22:02----------
optimistic some some combination of like


---------22:06----------
when i see how much you've thought about


---------22:08----------
things and how you've already started to


---------22:10----------
piece things together i feel


---------22:12----------
good about it because i feel like you've


---------22:14----------
done a lot of the work that i


---------22:16----------
do like i start doing with people and so


---------22:18----------
you've already actually done chapter one


---------22:21----------
and for example you've recognized that


---------22:23----------
you're conflicted first you've


---------22:24----------
recognized that you


---------22:26----------
started to become conflict averse in


---------22:28----------
childhood you've recognized that that


---------22:30----------
has worked for you in some ways that


---------22:32----------
it's


---------22:32----------
it's an adaptation but that at times


---------22:35----------
it's become a maladaptation


---------22:38----------
um and and i actually


---------22:43----------
have i i think


---------22:47----------
i know this is going to sound weird but


---------22:48----------
i i think i have more hope for your


---------22:50----------
future than you do


---------22:52----------
which is weird because we haven't really


---------22:53----------
talked about how much hope for your


---------22:54----------
future you have


---------22:55----------
and i think the reason that i have more


---------22:57----------
hope for your future than you do is that


---------22:58----------
i think there are some options that feel


---------23:00----------
close to you which i don't think are


---------23:02----------
close to you


---------23:04----------
um and then maybe we'll we'll work our


---------23:06----------
way there maybe i'm right maybe i'm


---------23:08----------
wrong i mean


---------23:09----------
i don't really know but and


---------23:12----------
and so you know if you want to steer the


---------23:14----------
conversation you're more than welcome to


---------23:16----------
if there's a particular thing that you


---------23:17----------
want to learn how to


---------23:18----------
you know talk like get over or whatever


---------23:20----------
that's fine otherwise i i've got


---------23:23----------
a gigantic pile of questions to ask oh


---------23:26----------
fire away i'm you know i don't like


---------23:29----------
talking about myself that much


---------23:31----------
like first yeah i want to know more


---------23:34----------
about myself


---------23:35----------
why don't you like talking about


---------23:36----------
yourself


---------23:39----------
um i


---------23:43----------
i just don't like making things about me


---------23:47----------
it just feels


---------23:51----------
i don't think it's my place i don't feel


---------23:53----------
like people don't care so i don't want


---------23:54----------
to


---------23:55----------
like bother them with like inanity of my


---------24:02----------
life


---------24:05----------
how long have you felt that way


---------24:13----------
[Music]


---------24:17----------
maybe since like middle school


---------24:21----------
i think yeah can you tell me about


---------24:25----------
middle school


---------24:32----------
kind of i'm trying to remember i think


---------24:34----------
there's like


---------24:35----------
two things going on here


---------24:39----------
i think one thing is i think i was


---------24:41----------
always a very good child


---------24:43----------
you know like straight a student wasn't


---------24:45----------
all the extra curriculars i was in


---------24:47----------
band orchestra tennis team like


---------24:50----------
your parents must have been very proud


---------24:52----------
they're very proud but i think


---------24:54----------
because i did everything well um


---------24:58----------
there was like my there was like nothing


---------25:00----------
to criticize me on so like my dad would


---------25:02----------
end up


---------25:03----------
criticizing me on like the most like


---------25:05----------
tiny things like


---------25:06----------
why don't you capture toothpaste after


---------25:08----------
you finish brushing your teeth


---------25:11----------
like can you like i'm very flat-footed


---------25:13----------
so he's like you know you should think


---------25:14----------
more about picking up your feet and i'm


---------25:15----------
getting these huge arguments with my


---------25:17----------
father like why it doesn't matter am i


---------25:19----------
doing everything else right


---------25:21----------
and then um and i think that was the


---------25:24----------
moment


---------25:24----------
at least personally aware she's like i i


---------25:27----------
hated just like getting into yelling


---------25:29----------
just my dad and i would cry like every


---------25:32----------
day for i think two years


---------25:34----------
um and then suddenly just like turned


---------25:36----------
off where it's just like


---------25:37----------
i just stopped crying all together for


---------25:40----------
the next like


---------25:41----------
15 years um


---------25:44----------
and then in school i was like


---------25:47----------
mildly bullied like i don't know like


---------25:50----------
this could just be my


---------25:51----------
version of the vents like now that i'm


---------25:53----------
older i'm like maybe this is not what


---------25:54----------
actually happened but i just thought


---------25:56----------
this was and it became like


---------25:57----------
such a huge part of the narrative of


---------26:00----------
like who i was as a person but there was


---------26:01----------
this girl


---------26:03----------
who's like on the cheerleading team and


---------26:05----------
you know i was like very


---------26:07----------
very scrawny not athletic i was like the


---------26:10----------
like last np


---------26:11----------
all the time you know and my school was


---------26:13----------
very athletic i think


---------26:14----------
had i gone to a more normal school it


---------26:16----------
wouldn't be this case but i was running


---------26:18----------
six minute models and i was the slowest


---------26:19----------
guy in my class as an


---------26:21----------
as an eighth grader um


---------26:24----------
and so i had a lot of like


---------26:25----------
self-conscious umness about


---------26:28----------
my appearance and my physical ability


---------26:31----------
and


---------26:32----------
so there's this girl who would always


---------26:33----------
just like


---------26:35----------
who claimed that she like was in love


---------26:37----------
with me um but was


---------26:38----------
very iced my perception was she was very


---------26:41----------
out of my league


---------26:42----------
and so every day when i would go to


---------26:44----------
homeroom she would like


---------26:45----------
hide behind like a door and like jump


---------26:47----------
out and like hug me


---------26:48----------
and then it just made me feel very


---------26:53----------
like that i was i was being made fun of


---------26:56----------
in a way that i couldn't like


---------26:58----------
like show or resist because like oh it's


---------27:00----------
like why are you complaining about this


---------27:01----------
you know it's like a attractive girl is


---------27:03----------
like hugging you


---------27:04----------
and saying she's in love with you but


---------27:06----------
then she would like call like she would


---------27:07----------
like


---------27:08----------
find my phone number and like call my my


---------27:10----------
phone or


---------27:11----------
my home phone this is back before i had


---------27:13----------
a cell phone


---------27:14----------
and then you know like i had to hear


---------27:16----------
like laughing in the background so like


---------27:17----------
i'm pretty sure it was just


---------27:18----------
to like make me feel uncomfortable and


---------27:21----------
so


---------27:22----------
i think at that point like i just never


---------27:24----------
felt like i was like


---------27:27----------
um someone that people like want to be


---------27:29----------
around or it's like i was always


---------27:30----------
someone that will kind of had in their


---------27:33----------
groups so that


---------27:34----------
they could like make fun of


---------27:40----------
yeah i'm not someone who other people


---------27:42----------
want to be around


---------27:52----------
and i think that's partially why like


---------27:56----------
i felt like the desire to like get into


---------27:58----------
so many things because i wanted to


---------27:59----------
provide value whether it's like music


---------28:03----------
or magic or like any number of things


---------28:10----------
so what i'm hearing from you is that


---------28:14----------
you know if you could bring something to


---------28:15----------
the table then people


---------28:17----------
then you would be worth caring about


---------28:27----------
yeah i think that's the case because i


---------28:29----------
just didn't have any confidence in like


---------28:31----------
my personality or


---------28:32----------
you know my


---------28:45----------
are you okay are you okay just sitting


---------28:48----------
for a second and just


---------28:49----------
feeling what you're feeling or do you


---------28:51----------
want me to distract you


---------28:54----------
um i'm good i okay i like this pulling


---------28:58----------
what's this feeling


---------29:01----------
i think um


---------29:05----------
i think just being able to share


---------29:06----------
something that has been bothering me for


---------29:08----------
a while


---------29:10----------
so that feels good and what bothers me i


---------29:13----------
think it's something that i'm


---------29:16----------
just like being aware of like how much i


---------29:18----------
like don't like myself


---------29:22----------
so albert what's it like to be someone


---------29:25----------
who other people don't want to be around


---------29:29----------
and to be cut off from the pack


---------30:14----------
sorry it's heavy yep


---------30:20----------
i'm gonna start crying in a second


---------30:25----------
don't a lot of people start crying on


---------30:27----------
this show do you do do you cry


---------30:28----------
sympathetically


---------30:30----------
i mean i cry i don't i don't know


---------30:33----------
about other people


---------30:36----------
yeah um it's lonely


---------30:40----------
for sure


---------30:43----------
and a lot of it has to do with like


---------30:48----------
guilt


---------30:53----------
not feeling like


---------30:57----------
like i can feel bad about my situation


---------30:59----------
that makes sense because it's like


---------31:02----------
self-induced


---------31:04----------
so


---------31:10----------
okay albert i need you to i need you to


---------31:12----------
let me know if you need so


---------31:14----------
i'm gonna tell you something that we


---------31:15----------
call coming up for air okay


---------31:18----------
so you know sometimes we're gonna get


---------31:20----------
into heavy places


---------31:22----------
and then um you know if you need to come


---------31:26----------
up for air you let me know and i'll like


---------31:28----------
break the tension


---------31:29----------
so we'll you know is there like a like a


---------31:32----------
safe word


---------31:33----------
it's like i need it um i mean so my


---------31:36----------
standard with usually


---------31:38----------
uh men is as we uh make a dick joke


---------31:42----------
okay because usually penises are funny


---------31:46----------
um okay and and so i guess our our safe


---------31:49----------
word is going to be dick joke


---------31:51----------
okay um


---------31:55----------
but you just you know you let me know i


---------31:56----------
mean i i can see that you're able to


---------31:58----------
tolerate some of this and i think we're


---------32:00----------
making progress but


---------32:02----------
you know at the same time i um


---------32:06----------
it doesn't it doesn't have to be


---------32:10----------
how can i say this i imagine that you


---------32:12----------
think that you are someone who has to be


---------32:14----------
able to tolerate


---------32:15----------
everything right and you can't


---------32:18----------
you can't come up for air you won't let


---------32:21----------
yourself come up for air


---------32:24----------
because not coming up for air is the


---------32:26----------
right thing to do


---------32:28----------
yeah right so just notice that like even


---------32:31----------
that


---------32:32----------
and and so learn how to forgive yourself


---------32:34----------
for


---------32:37----------
not being able to do all this


---------32:41----------
and so i think maybe i'm gonna have to


---------32:43----------
use the safe word because i i don't know


---------32:44----------
if you're gonna


---------32:46----------
feel


---------32:50----------
worthy enough to say hey actually this


---------32:53----------
is too much for me


---------32:59----------
i think the thing that i struggle with


---------33:01----------
is


---------33:02----------
or like regarding this particular


---------33:06----------
ideas a lot of like the kind of things


---------33:09----------
i'm


---------33:10----------
going through right now it's like i feel


---------33:12----------
like i don't have


---------33:14----------
like i'm not privy to those


---------33:17----------
too


---------33:21----------
it's like i'm not allowed to feel


---------33:23----------
sadness or


---------33:24----------
pain towards my own situation why not


---------33:27----------
because


---------33:28----------
like i mean because like i'm the one


---------33:32----------
that


---------33:33----------
created it right and so it's like you


---------33:36----------
know


---------33:39----------
it's like well if you didn't [ __ ] up


---------33:41----------
then you wouldn't like be in this


---------33:42----------
situation so like stop complaining


---------33:44----------
kind of deal yeah


---------33:49----------
and so like i just and i don't that's


---------33:51----------
why i don't like talking about it


---------33:52----------
because i'm like


---------33:54----------
no one wants to hear someone talk about


---------33:56----------
like how


---------33:57----------
you know shitty they feel because of


---------33:59----------
something that they did to like other


---------34:00----------
people


---------34:04----------
yeah what i'm what i'm hearing you say


---------34:05----------
is that you're not allowed to suffer


---------34:08----------
because it's your fault


---------34:12----------
well that's how i feel at least like i


---------34:14----------
know it's


---------34:15----------
it's not necessarily like like it


---------34:18----------
shouldn't be the case you know i think


---------34:19----------
everyone's how do you know


---------34:20----------
that where do you say i came from


---------34:25----------
just things i read my own therapy


---------34:27----------
sessions it's just like


---------34:28----------
i think the lived human experience is


---------34:31----------
imperfect


---------34:32----------
and we're all going to make mistakes so


---------34:35----------
if no one's allowed to feel


---------34:37----------
bad for like anything then that's just a


---------34:40----------
very sad


---------34:41----------
experience of being alive yeah so that


---------34:44----------
sounds philosophically wonderful to me


---------34:48----------
tell me why doesn't any of that [ __ ]


---------34:50----------
apply to you


---------34:52----------
i think a lot of it ties into just like


---------34:54----------
being like a internet figure


---------34:56----------
and like having so much of


---------35:00----------
like what i say or what i feel being


---------35:03----------
judged through like the lenses of like


---------35:04----------
thousands of people


---------35:07----------
you know it's like there's no winning


---------35:08----------
right it's like if i


---------35:10----------
if you know if i don't if i'm emotional


---------35:13----------
then it's like i'm


---------35:14----------
trying to get sympathy i'm trying to


---------35:16----------
garner sympathy


---------35:17----------
and then that's manipulative and if i


---------35:19----------
like don't emote


---------35:20----------
and i'm just very like stoic and very


---------35:23----------
you know like business then you're like


---------35:25----------
cold then you're cold


---------35:27----------
and so my solution is i just don't use


---------35:30----------
it i just


---------35:31----------
like i i feel like i can't post anything


---------35:34----------
that isn't like


---------35:35----------
inherently valuable or good because


---------35:38----------
people are just gonna like just like me


---------35:40----------
mommy or [ __ ] on me like


---------35:43----------
like twist whatever i say into like the


---------35:45----------
context that they think


---------35:46----------
you know is like the most hurtful


---------35:49----------
and so like i know like that stuff hurts


---------35:52----------
me so i


---------35:52----------
so i just don't use it i will only just


---------35:55----------
post


---------35:56----------
my content and i i will just like not


---------35:58----------
read any of the comments


---------36:00----------
and then let's go about my day until i


---------36:02----------
have something


---------36:03----------
else to do albert i i totally get that i


---------36:05----------
think social media i would say amplifies


---------36:07----------
this


---------36:09----------
and at the same time i think that you


---------36:11----------
have been


---------36:16----------
taking away your capacity to suffer long


---------36:19----------
before any of these people on the


---------36:20----------
internet ever showed up


---------36:24----------
and if we're talking about you know


---------36:26----------
really moving forward it's about finding


---------36:28----------
the origin of these things


---------36:30----------
right what we're talking about is like


---------36:32----------
how does it feel to be the kid


---------36:34----------
that all the other and forgive me for


---------36:36----------
being a little bit racist here let me


---------36:38----------
know if this is offensive you know that


---------36:40----------
all the other asian kids hate because


---------36:42----------
you're the kid that when they


---------36:43----------
before they go to bed their parents tell


---------36:45----------
them why can't you be more like albert


---------36:48----------
yeah and yeah i grew up in fresno so i


---------36:52----------
was like one of the only asian kids


---------36:54----------
actually at the time so


---------36:57----------
so my experience being an indian kid was


---------37:00----------
that you know


---------37:00----------
people my parents always compared me to


---------37:02----------
the other indie and still do


---------37:05----------
and then and then the thing that's


---------37:07----------
really bizarre about that is like i'm


---------37:08----------
like mom what


---------37:09----------
what more do you want i'm i'm the kid


---------37:12----------
that all the other parents are comparing


---------37:14----------
to now like and you're still like


---------37:16----------
you know i i used to joke that i'm


---------37:20----------
every indian parent's


---------37:24----------
dream and every indian kid's nightmare


---------37:27----------
hmm yeah and i think i was like that


---------37:31----------
more


---------37:32----------
generally speaking just like


---------37:35----------
like on paper i was like i was like the


---------37:38----------
textbook child


---------37:39----------
you know um


---------37:42----------
yeah and so albert


---------37:46----------
what does it feel like to be the


---------37:47----------
textbook child and have your dad be


---------37:49----------
unhappy with you


---------37:53----------
what is it like not knowing yeah you go


---------37:56----------
ahead sorry


---------37:59----------
it's like not knowing what you can do to


---------38:01----------
be better


---------38:02----------
um and so it's just like at a loss


---------38:07----------
and and like i think at the time i felt


---------38:10----------
like no matter what i did to like


---------38:12----------
improve like there would just be


---------38:13----------
something else that was missing


---------38:15----------
like there's this never-ending


---------38:18----------
list of things that like why aren't you


---------38:20----------
like better at this or why aren't you


---------38:22----------
doing this better and a lot of it wasn't


---------38:24----------
even like


---------38:25----------
like at this point it was never about


---------38:26----------
academics you know because the academics


---------38:28----------
like


---------38:29----------
sure before i went to college and where


---------38:32----------
like i


---------38:32----------
i realized like that didn't matter as


---------38:34----------
much as i used to think you know like i


---------38:35----------
had never


---------38:37----------
gotten anything below like 100 on


---------38:39----------
anything


---------38:40----------
because our school offered a lot of


---------38:41----------
extra credit for you know


---------38:43----------
kids who like needed it so like if i got


---------38:45----------
if i ever got below 100


---------38:47----------
i would like beat myself up like


---------38:50----------
not not like in a self-harm kind of way


---------38:52----------
but more like


---------38:54----------
yeah emotionally i would like punish


---------38:57----------
myself


---------38:58----------
what would you do to yourself


---------39:01----------
um i don't know like i would sometimes i


---------39:04----------
would not speak for


---------39:05----------
like a week because i was so upset


---------39:09----------
and what what made you upset


---------39:13----------
um that i like made a mistake


---------39:17----------
and whose fault is it


---------39:23----------
and so how did you treat yourself when


---------39:26----------
you [ __ ] it up


---------39:27----------
albert you got a 99


---------39:30----------
yeah just not happy


---------39:36----------
yeah and it became like a thing where


---------39:38----------
like then my friends would make fun of


---------39:39----------
me


---------39:40----------
for not getting 100 as well you know


---------39:43----------
like i had


---------39:46----------
so and well they thought it was good but


---------39:48----------
it reinforced


---------39:50----------
like they were doing it jokingly but


---------39:52----------
then i think for me it reinforced that


---------39:54----------
idea and so when people on the internet


---------39:57----------
say things about you what does it do to


---------40:00----------
you


---------40:02----------
um i guess it's more like what i know


---------40:06----------
it'll do to me


---------40:07----------
because i i really have not read


---------40:09----------
anything good


---------40:11----------
go what do you know


---------40:14----------
um


---------40:18----------
i think at least from like


---------40:21----------
so what happens is my my close friends


---------40:23----------
will like spoon feed me stuff


---------40:25----------
right they'll they'll be like all right


---------40:26----------
this is like maybe the worst kind of


---------40:28----------
thing people are saying this is like


---------40:30----------
generally people are like saying these


---------40:31----------
nice things right and then


---------40:33----------
because i want to know like even if i


---------40:36----------
don't want to know the specifics i want


---------40:37----------
to know the general sentiment


---------40:39----------
but usually the stuff that like hurts


---------40:41----------
the most are the are not the


---------40:43----------
like single and like [ __ ] you or go die


---------40:45----------
like those ones


---------40:46----------
i know it takes a certain kind of person


---------40:48----------
to like be in a place in their lives


---------40:49----------
where


---------40:50----------
like they can type that to like a random


---------40:53----------
nobody that they don't know


---------40:54----------
right it's like that stuff doesn't


---------40:56----------
bother me at all it's like the


---------40:57----------
people who are writing like long essays


---------41:00----------
trying to like


---------41:01----------
cycle analyze me from like the comfort


---------41:03----------
of their own homes


---------41:05----------
and i think sometimes like there's a


---------41:07----------
glimpse of truth and like that stuff


---------41:09----------
hurts


---------41:10----------
or the other ones where it's like i know


---------41:12----------
it's like just


---------41:13----------
straight up false but it sounds


---------41:14----------
convincing enough that i feel like i'm


---------41:16----------
being misinterpreted


---------41:18----------
and i think i have this deep fear not of


---------41:21----------
like owning up to my mistakes


---------41:23----------
but being misunderstood or like


---------41:26----------
like not not feeling like people have


---------41:28----------
the wrong impression of me


---------41:30----------
um but believing that to be the case and


---------41:33----------
but i know there's nothing i can do or


---------41:35----------
say to like convince them otherwise


---------41:37----------
it's just like a futile battle where did


---------41:40----------
you learn that convincing people


---------41:44----------
who had the wrong impression of you was


---------41:46----------
futile


---------41:50----------
um i'm trying to think about it in my


---------41:54----------
actual day-to-day life but the internet


---------41:56----------
i just feel like


---------41:58----------
that's just the general sentiment where


---------42:01----------
like if people are determined to hate


---------42:02----------
you


---------42:03----------
like no matter what you put out what you


---------42:05----------
say they're going to feel that way until


---------42:07----------
something in their own life shifts


---------42:10----------
i mean it sounds to me like you're


---------42:11----------
talking about your dad again


---------42:14----------
you know not to overly psychoanalyze you


---------42:16----------
because i hate doing that [ __ ] right


---------42:18----------
because i'm i'm just envisioning like


---------42:21----------
you know like who did you feel you are


---------42:25----------
who did you try to be and what did your


---------42:26----------
dad see


---------42:29----------
right he just refuses to see


---------42:33----------
like not just straight a's hundreds


---------42:36----------
across the board baby


---------42:39----------
and then he chooses to pick a fight i


---------42:42----------
mean it's just


---------42:42----------
it's so misunderstood it's so


---------42:45----------
disconnected


---------42:47----------
it's so judged and then i'd i'd say that


---------42:51----------
some


---------42:51----------
somewhere in there your dad would also


---------42:53----------
say things if i had to hypothesize i


---------42:54----------
mean i don't mean to say this is all


---------42:56----------
about your dad but like


---------42:57----------
i mean come on you know like yeah


---------43:00----------
whatever yeah i mean i'd say a lot of


---------43:03----------
things


---------43:04----------
like probably like you knew 90 of what


---------43:06----------
he was saying was like wrong and like


---------43:08----------
you knew you're like dad what


---------43:09----------
it's just a [ __ ] toothpaste gap


---------43:13----------
right yeah and you would tell yourself


---------43:16----------
that 90 of the time


---------43:18----------
but then 10 of the time he'd say


---------43:20----------
something that would stick


---------43:24----------
right and and over time what i'm i'm


---------43:26----------
just i'm just thinking like what is


---------43:28----------
what happens to a 13 year old kid who


---------43:30----------
like


---------43:33----------
can never do right


---------43:38----------
right can never do enough what does that


---------43:39----------
kid start to think about himself


---------43:42----------
what does he start to believe about


---------43:44----------
himself


---------43:48----------
and yeah go ahead


---------43:52----------
i don't know i thought you were about to


---------43:53----------
say one more thing


---------43:56----------
yeah so i mean i i think he says what


---------43:58----------
you say


---------44:00----------
that in order for people to like in


---------44:03----------
order for me to bring


---------44:04----------
value to the table it needs to be some


---------44:06----------
something super concrete


---------44:09----------
that like it has to be something that no


---------44:10----------
one can refute because like


---------44:12----------
like who i am is like not enough


---------44:17----------
right and i i'd say i'm just envisioning


---------44:20----------
you know if we really want to try to tie


---------44:21----------
things together


---------44:22----------
yeah in in a overly simplistic


---------44:26----------
and probably unfair way it's going to be


---------44:28----------
like i mean


---------44:29----------
i don't know man like you know when we


---------44:31----------
talk about these phrases like


---------44:32----------
self-esteem


---------44:34----------
and confidence in who you are and


---------44:37----------
and accepting yourself for who you are


---------44:40----------
and and i'm also i'm just going to keep


---------44:42----------
going and you can cut me off at any


---------44:44----------
point


---------44:44----------
and then i also think a little bit about


---------44:47----------
you know the things that you tell


---------44:48----------
yourself and what you've learned to tell


---------44:50----------
yourself


---------44:51----------
which is that if you do everything right


---------44:54----------
and it's your fault


---------44:56----------
it sure as hell is going to be if you


---------44:58----------
don't get any forgiveness when you do


---------45:00----------
anything right


---------45:01----------
why on earth would you get any


---------45:02----------
forgiveness if you do even an iota of


---------45:04----------
something wrong


---------45:06----------
if you get a 99 you're not happy with


---------45:08----------
the 100 or maybe you are happy or maybe


---------45:10----------
your dad's not happy but if there's a 99


---------45:12----------
like


---------45:12----------
[ __ ] that you don't deserve a break


---------45:16----------
and so with whatever happened like it's


---------45:18----------
your fault so like you don't deserve a


---------45:20----------
break you don't deserve forgiveness


---------45:23----------
and then we also get to this this


---------45:25----------
feeling of being trapped right where


---------45:27----------
like you're


---------45:27----------
you're like i you know i can't win this


---------45:30----------
game


---------45:33----------
i can't win if i show emotion


---------45:37----------
they say i'm being manipulative


---------45:40----------
and if i don't show emotion they say i'm


---------45:42----------
being cold


---------45:45----------
you strike me as a guy or kid who just


---------45:49----------
can't win no matter what you do


---------45:56----------
it's really hard to


---------46:00----------
believe that you can't win


---------46:06----------
to try to convince yourself that you can


---------46:08----------
find some kind of


---------46:10----------
niche that you can


---------46:13----------
kind of like come back


---------46:16----------
that if you try hard enough to show


---------46:18----------
other people that like


---------46:20----------
you know if you work really really hard


---------46:22----------
and you can


---------46:24----------
you can sort of overcome like that core


---------46:27----------
sense of like


---------46:28----------
rot and decay about like who you are


---------46:37----------
and that's hard man it's a hard way to


---------46:40----------
live life


---------46:44----------
so despite being so [ __ ] pessimistic


---------46:46----------
with my imagery


---------46:50----------
the reason i'm hopeful for you albert is


---------46:52----------
because i think you actually


---------46:53----------
are wrong i think you're not rotten okay


---------46:57----------
so


---------46:57----------
and i think you have value and i think


---------47:01----------
that for a long time you


---------47:03----------
like there haven't and it sounds like


---------47:05----------
you've had people around you try to


---------47:06----------
teach you that but


---------47:07----------
i i fundamentally don't think that


---------47:11----------
you know i just don't think you're a


---------47:13----------
piece of [ __ ]


---------47:16----------
i think the reason that you heard


---------47:17----------
giggling in the background when that


---------47:19----------
girl called you


---------47:20----------
is because her friends put her up to it


---------47:23----------
and she's like if you like him call him


---------47:26----------
and then she calls you and then her


---------47:28----------
friends are giggling in the background


---------47:29----------
because


---------47:29----------
she's calling you i don't think it's an


---------47:32----------
elaborate


---------47:33----------
you know joke that they're making fun of


---------47:36----------
you


---------47:37----------
i think that's what teenage girls do


---------47:40----------
when they put their friends up to


---------47:41----------
calling their crushes


---------47:47----------
you know i i wouldn't know though i


---------47:48----------
never got one of those phone calls


---------47:56----------
anyway i came up for air there yeah at


---------47:58----------
the end


---------48:00----------
i can tell you yeah appreciate it


---------48:08----------
i'm also doing some of the lifting you


---------48:11----------
can pick it up


---------48:14----------
all right um i'm at the pen or the


---------48:17----------
conversation either one


---------48:19----------
but yeah what's interview meant which


---------48:21----------
one you're talking about


---------48:23----------
i have oh you've got a backup okay one


---------48:26----------
this is a knife


---------48:27----------
yeah but it's not a real knife so


---------48:33----------
yeah i i just feel like i just i just


---------48:35----------
need to fidget with stuff because i have


---------48:36----------
so much anxiety


---------48:38----------
you're super impossible and there's a


---------48:41----------
certain level of satisfaction of being


---------48:43----------
proficient with


---------48:45----------
like seeing progress like when you work


---------48:47----------
at something and then like sure


---------48:49----------
either see the progress or you can feel


---------48:52----------
it


---------48:52----------
yeah and so i i'm very like like


---------48:56----------
that's something that's always i've been


---------48:57----------
drawn to that


---------49:00----------
yeah so if you want to get super


---------49:02----------
analytical there right there's two kinds


---------49:04----------
of


---------49:06----------
progress there there's one is that like


---------49:08----------
there's a certain satisfaction over


---------49:09----------
mastery and then there's also the sense


---------49:12----------
that like


---------49:12----------
if i can see myself getting better i


---------49:15----------
don't


---------49:17----------
have to look at my intrinsic lack of


---------49:19----------
value


---------49:20----------
because you see here's my external value


---------49:22----------
like i can do this and now i can do this


---------49:24----------
and now i can do this and it's just an


---------49:26----------
emphasis


---------49:27----------
on positive feeling from the external


---------49:29----------
world


---------49:30----------
and a sense of mastery that other people


---------49:32----------
can't deny that you yourself can't deny


---------49:39----------
i think it's a bit of both i think so


---------49:42----------
too


---------49:49----------
do you wanna i know you were about to


---------49:50----------
say something and then


---------49:52----------
you let me continue so i don't know if


---------49:53----------
you wanna share anything or


---------49:58----------
i'm trying to see if there's any like


---------50:01----------
engine points


---------50:02----------
or like further things because like


---------50:12----------
because you mentioned in the beginning


---------50:14----------
that it sounds like a story about


---------50:15----------
rejection


---------50:17----------
um and like i think a lot of or the way


---------50:20----------
that i've perceived a lot of my life is


---------50:22----------
just like a series of rejections


---------50:24----------
and a lot of both like personally


---------50:28----------
but also like objectively not getting to


---------50:31----------
the college that i wanted or


---------50:33----------
you know like having like a lot of um


---------50:37----------
like putting myself out there and like


---------50:39----------
like for crutches whatever and like


---------50:40----------
being rejected


---------50:41----------
or job opportunities


---------50:45----------
so i think i focus a lot on those as


---------50:48----------
like kind of


---------50:50----------
as kind of like defining moments in my


---------50:52----------
life rather than kind of


---------50:54----------
maybe the things i have accomplished and


---------50:55----------
like i know this to be the case but


---------50:57----------
it's like my brain just goes there


---------51:02----------
so am i hearing the question of what do


---------51:04----------
i do about that


---------51:06----------
no it's just more like


---------51:20----------
well


---------51:22----------
you know i don't i don't know


---------51:25----------
tell us yeah


---------51:28----------
sorry go ahead i just feel like a lot of


---------51:32----------
the things i think about her is like i


---------51:34----------
know this is how i feel


---------51:36----------
so now like how do i like kind of


---------51:39----------
reprogram


---------51:41----------
what i'm like how am i trying to


---------51:42----------
approach all these things so that i


---------51:44----------
don't


---------51:45----------
do well on it so much great that's a


---------51:48----------
that's a fantastic question


---------51:50----------
um so i think


---------51:55----------
so once you have one of these like core


---------51:58----------
beliefs about yourself


---------52:00----------
right i think i think your rejection


---------52:02----------
sensitivity comes because


---------52:05----------
so albert what i see is within you


---------52:07----------
there's a war


---------52:09----------
between


---------52:12----------
what you know


---------52:15----------
shouldn't be true and what you believe


---------52:18----------
about yourself


---------52:20----------
right like you can look at your life and


---------52:22----------
when you're tranquil and you're


---------52:23----------
level-headed you can say i've


---------52:24----------
accomplished a lot


---------52:25----------
i'm a good person you know i support a


---------52:28----------
lot of people


---------52:29----------
i'm a good friend i'm allowed to make


---------52:31----------
mistakes


---------52:33----------
and then inside there's also like this


---------52:35----------
kind of fear this belief that you carry


---------52:37----------
around that you're none of those things


---------52:40----------
that you're a cause for suffering for


---------52:43----------
people around you


---------52:45----------
that you don't have value that all you


---------52:47----------
bring is unhappiness


---------52:49----------
and there's this kind of war and then


---------52:51----------
sometimes what happens is like something


---------52:53----------
happens in your life


---------52:55----------
and i think what's been going on is like


---------52:57----------
the positive part of you has been


---------52:59----------
winning


---------53:00----------
and then the negative part of you when


---------53:02----------
something happens the negative part of


---------53:03----------
you is like see


---------53:04----------
see i told you i told you all along


---------53:11----------
that's not who i am


---------53:14----------
and so how what do you do with that


---------53:16----------
right what do you do when you start to


---------53:18----------
when you have that voice inside you that


---------53:20----------
tells you that


---------53:22----------
um you know that you're not worth it and


---------53:26----------
that you're not a good person


---------53:27----------
and that unless you bring something


---------53:30----------
concrete to the table unless you


---------53:32----------
can make people smile or laugh with


---------53:34----------
magic tricks


---------53:36----------
that you're not worth being around


---------53:40----------
how do you deal with that it's a good


---------53:41----------
question


---------53:43----------
so i'm going to give you kind of like a


---------53:47----------
two or three part answer and it's going


---------53:49----------
to be a little bit academic


---------53:50----------
okay the first is that yeah


---------53:54----------
say safe territory uses our mind not our


---------53:57----------
heart


---------53:58----------
so the first thing is that each of these


---------54:00----------
emotional insults is an


---------54:02----------
unprocessed trauma or something that i


---------54:04----------
would call a some scar


---------54:06----------
so some scar is like something that is


---------54:08----------
like an


---------54:10----------
undigested emotion that then goes


---------54:12----------
dormant into your unconscious mind


---------54:14----------
and over time builds up like basically


---------54:16----------
what happened is that


---------54:17----------
you know for two years you said every


---------54:19----------
day you used to cry and


---------54:21----------
to a certain degree you were starting to


---------54:22----------
process those emotions


---------54:24----------
but i don't think that there was anyone


---------54:26----------
there who could sustain


---------54:29----------
the positive albert during those times


---------54:32----------
and so each one of those moments each


---------54:35----------
one of those conversations


---------54:37----------
you kind of built up this like


---------54:42----------
portal that would spawn like negative


---------54:45----------
thoughts and feelings


---------54:46----------
and so the problem right now is that


---------54:48----------
you've got that portal in your


---------54:50----------
unconscious and it spawns these thoughts


---------54:52----------
right like literally if you look at the


---------54:54----------
way the nature that the mind works


---------54:56----------
it's like you're going about your day


---------54:58----------
and it's like literally something just


---------55:00----------
spawns in your mind


---------55:03----------
right it's weird it's like a it's like a


---------55:06----------
bubble machine that's just like


---------55:08----------
generating


---------55:09----------
these like thoughts about you and and so


---------55:12----------
you can kind of acknowledge that you


---------55:14----------
shouldn't have those thoughts but


---------55:15----------
i mean that that machine is in there


---------55:18----------
that belief is in there and as long as


---------55:19----------
that belief is there it's going to start


---------55:21----------
generating these thoughts


---------55:22----------
so the question is okay what do you do


---------55:24----------
about it one way is through emotional


---------55:25----------
processing


---------55:26----------
so that's like doing something like


---------55:28----------
therapy where you go and you talk about


---------55:30----------
these things and you cry and then like


---------55:31----------
when you cry you feel a little bit


---------55:32----------
better


---------55:33----------
the main thing is that the some scar


---------55:35----------
gets digested a little bit gets digested


---------55:37----------
digested digestive digest


---------55:39----------
and if you do that work for a while one


---------55:41----------
day you'll kind of be free from it


---------55:44----------
so that's kind of like a psychological


---------55:46----------
approach a therapy approach


---------55:48----------
the other thing that i'd say which i


---------55:49----------
think is going to terrify the [ __ ] out


---------55:50----------
of you is that i think that there's like


---------55:51----------
a spiritual or karmic approach


---------55:54----------
and i think what that means is like


---------55:56----------
actually going and and


---------55:57----------
you know like having conversations with


---------56:00----------
people that you've wronged


---------56:03----------
recognizing that like although you're a


---------56:05----------
wolf who's been cut from the pack


---------56:08----------
there is a certain peace that comes from


---------56:15----------
resolving that and what i mean by


---------56:18----------
resolving that is like going and like


---------56:19----------
having conversations with people and if


---------56:21----------
you want to be a part


---------56:22----------
of that group again if you miss that


---------56:24----------
group


---------56:25----------
you know if if you've if you've made a


---------56:28----------
if there's a rupture


---------56:30----------
between you and someone that you care


---------56:32----------
about you try to


---------56:36----------
you try to fix that now fixing it


---------56:39----------
doesn't mean


---------56:40----------
practically like rejoining something or


---------56:43----------
doesn't i'm not talking about business


---------56:45----------
what i'm talking about is like a karmic


---------56:46----------
debt right


---------56:48----------
of like going back and and trying to


---------56:50----------
like make things right with people and i


---------56:52----------
think there's an


---------56:52----------
immense amount of strength and then also


---------56:54----------
acknowledging that like and this is the


---------56:56----------
thing is


---------56:57----------
until you try that you're carrying it


---------57:00----------
and if someone says [ __ ] you i never


---------57:01----------
want to see you again


---------57:03----------
you can at least be a little bit calm


---------57:06----------
with yourself that like you tried right


---------57:08----------
and if they if they don't want to


---------57:10----------
forgive you and and that's


---------57:12----------
like totally fine but like you [ __ ] up


---------57:14----------
and i tried to make it up to you


---------57:16----------
and if you don't want me to make it up


---------57:18----------
to you that's entirely your choice and i


---------57:20----------
can respect that


---------57:21----------
but i can also respect myself a little


---------57:23----------
bit because i tried to fix it


---------57:27----------
you know and i think this is where


---------57:30----------
frankly i mean i think this is like


---------57:32----------
where


---------57:33----------
honestly sometimes i kind of differ from


---------57:35----------
my colleagues because


---------57:36----------
the thing about therapy is they tell you


---------57:39----------
i mean i'm i'm


---------57:40----------
about to dis therapy but i think it's


---------57:42----------
sort of true


---------57:43----------
you know what we're taught is therapists


---------57:45----------
what we're trained to do as therapists


---------57:47----------
is to work in the room right we're going


---------57:50----------
to come and we're going to talk about


---------57:52----------
your feelings but you never have to


---------57:53----------
really do anything


---------57:54----------
outside of the room that's the whole


---------57:56----------
scope of therapy


---------57:59----------
and there's a part of me that says that


---------58:01----------
like ultimately


---------58:03----------
you have to do things outside of that


---------58:04----------
room you have to do more than


---------58:06----------
emotionally process you have to take


---------58:08----------
action


---------58:09----------
i think we leave something really


---------58:11----------
important


---------58:12----------
behind when we don't try to take action


---------58:15----------
and i'd say


---------58:16----------
albert if you've made a mistake in your


---------58:18----------
life it's not about whether you get to


---------58:21----------
feel or whatever it's about like trying


---------58:23----------
to [ __ ] fix it man


---------58:26----------
right and you have to give it your all


---------58:28----------
to try to fix it i don't know if you


---------58:29----------
have


---------58:31----------
i don't know you know


---------58:34----------
you're laughing so i'm i'm guessing


---------58:36----------
you've got an answer for me there


---------58:40----------
um i think i've done as much as i could


---------58:45----------
like like in a reasonable way so


---------58:48----------
it's like i think i've already done that


---------58:51----------
um


---------58:52----------
and so so now it's like now that i know


---------58:55----------
like the position


---------58:56----------
about how things are it's like now i'm


---------58:58----------
trying to just deal with like


---------59:00----------
moving forward as like myself that makes


---------59:02----------
sense


---------59:03----------
sure yeah it wasn't like i


---------59:07----------
i like stopped talking to everyone and


---------59:10----------
just like all right


---------59:11----------
like i tried having those like


---------59:12----------
conversations


---------59:14----------
um and then you know it's just like kind


---------59:17----------
of like


---------59:19----------
this is just how it's going to be and


---------59:21----------
then


---------59:22----------
and then to like live our separate lives


---------59:25----------
kind of deal


---------59:26----------
yeah so so do you feel at peace with


---------59:28----------
that


---------59:31----------
um


---------59:34----------
i think it's more like it's like the


---------59:35----------
bittersweet thing right


---------59:37----------
where it's um and also it's like this is


---------59:40----------
given time right like i i don't know if


---------59:43----------
like you're supposed to revisit these


---------59:45----------
things like you know like


---------59:46----------
there's like a protocol for like okay


---------59:48----------
after this amount of time we should


---------59:50----------
maybe revisit this topic again


---------59:53----------
these people um but it's the kind of


---------59:56----------
thing where it's like i've just been


---------59:57----------
trying to


---------60:00----------
like like knowing kind of the general


---------60:02----------
state of things


---------60:09----------
kind of being okay like making new


---------60:11----------
connections and trying to


---------60:13----------
not be so tied up with i guess past


---------60:15----------
relationships


---------60:16----------
and try to like make new ones that i


---------60:18----------
know like


---------60:21----------
at least there is more of a risk


---------60:23----------
reciprocity


---------60:24----------
in terms of like kind of the um


---------60:28----------
i guess emotional labor and kind of time


---------60:30----------
spent


---------60:32----------
and like i know it's not like obviously


---------60:35----------
didn't feel great for me but i


---------60:36----------
also knew like this is their choice this


---------60:39----------
is their decision


---------60:40----------
and like i'm not going to be one to try


---------60:41----------
and pose my own


---------60:43----------
will on other people because like i know


---------60:46----------
because i want it


---------60:47----------
so yeah so you made a comment early in


---------60:52----------
the interview


---------60:53----------
albert that actually made me think that


---------60:55----------
like you said something like there are


---------60:56----------
things that you want to say or people


---------60:58----------
that you would want to reach out to


---------61:00----------
but that you don't something along those


---------61:02----------
lines


---------61:04----------
and and does that do you remember that


---------61:07----------
or does that ring a bell or do you and


---------61:10----------
so what keeps you from reaching out


---------61:14----------
um well one is fear


---------61:20----------
others rejection or both


---------61:23----------
rejection um


---------61:27----------
and also like also the fear of being


---------61:30----------
misunderstood


---------61:31----------
you know it's like i'm reaching out what


---------61:33----------
for what


---------61:34----------
means or what purpose am i doing this is


---------61:36----------
it because


---------61:37----------
i'm trying to like build my business


---------61:40----------
am i trying to you know like work my way


---------61:44----------
back into certain parts of like


---------61:46----------
certain communities it's just like i i


---------61:48----------
just feel like unless someone reaches


---------61:50----------
out to me


---------61:51----------
then like any action that i have like


---------61:54----------
reaching out to someone else is going to


---------61:55----------
be


---------61:55----------
viewed like in like the most negative


---------61:57----------
light and i don't know


---------61:58----------
that true but that's just like my fear


---------62:00----------
and like i'd rather not risk it


---------62:03----------
um for something like that and what does


---------62:06----------
reaching out


---------62:07----------
look like it's like


---------62:11----------
it's like hey wanna hang out or it's


---------62:14----------
been a while


---------62:15----------
love to catch up or if it's someone that


---------62:18----------
i i don't know it's just


---------62:19----------
kind of kind of there's there's some


---------62:23----------
people that i would want to like


---------62:25----------
other content creators and that's kind


---------62:26----------
of how i've always operated in the past


---------62:28----------
as well


---------62:29----------
it's like if i think what someone's


---------62:30----------
doing is really cool or


---------62:32----------
what they do is really like i feel like


---------62:35----------
connected to like their work


---------62:37----------
or whatever they do as their jobs like i


---------62:40----------
want to reach out like i want to


---------62:41----------
see we can be friends um


---------62:45----------
and so a lot of like i have a lot of


---------62:47----------
fear


---------62:49----------
that like people don't want to talk to


---------62:51----------
me because


---------62:56----------
because i myself don't offer enough as


---------62:59----------
like an individual


---------63:00----------
as aura as like a content creator as an


---------63:02----------
influencer that the risk


---------63:04----------
of potentially like being on the bad


---------63:07----------
side of other people


---------63:08----------
is going to supercede the immediate


---------63:10----------
value that i give


---------63:12----------
so it's like if someone finds out like


---------63:14----------
they've been talking to me or they're


---------63:15----------
working with me


---------63:16----------
and then it's like okay maybe these


---------63:17----------
people like it's not like i don't think


---------63:19----------
anyone would be like no you can't work


---------63:20----------
with this guy


---------63:22----------
but it might kind of i guess in a


---------63:24----------
business


---------63:25----------
or in a scene that is so


---------63:28----------
largely based off of your relationships


---------63:31----------
and like


---------63:32----------
good vibes towards people and like


---------63:34----------
vouching for people you think are cool


---------63:37----------
it's like any and like how hard it is to


---------63:39----------
even like break in


---------63:40----------
um in the first place


---------63:44----------
i think a lot of people just wouldn't


---------63:45----------
want to take that risk


---------63:47----------
especially since i'm like much smaller


---------63:49----------
so


---------63:50----------
and there's like so i have a lot of fear


---------63:52----------
regarding that


---------63:54----------
it's like i don't want to hurt other


---------63:55----------
people's chances by like either reaching


---------63:58----------
out to them or


---------63:58----------
like having them work with me so i just


---------64:00----------
don't unless they reach out first


---------64:03----------
and there's there's been some people who


---------64:05----------
reached out and i'm


---------64:06----------
very grateful for it but even then it's


---------64:09----------
like it can never be in any meaningful


---------64:11----------
public way


---------64:12----------
because of you know just like how it'll


---------64:13----------
look or like it might be disrespectful


---------64:16----------
for


---------64:17----------
certain like two certain people and like


---------64:20----------
i understand that and i acknowledge that


---------64:22----------
and you know it's like i would love to


---------64:24----------
like talk to them more


---------64:25----------
or like spend time with them but i know


---------64:28----------
it's just like not a


---------64:29----------
it's not a possibility given the current


---------64:31----------
circumstances


---------64:32----------
and so there's a lot of kind of


---------64:35----------
bittersweet feelings towards that as


---------64:38----------
well


---------64:38----------
where it's like i feel like i can't i


---------64:40----------
can't be i can't ask for more


---------64:42----------
you know like having some people talk to


---------64:44----------
me is better than no one


---------64:50----------
so it seems to me like talking about


---------64:52----------
this is actually more comfortable


---------64:54----------
for you


---------64:58----------
i think i thought about this more so


---------65:01----------
maybe that's why


---------65:02----------
so i i think there are a couple of


---------65:03----------
reasons for that one is it


---------65:05----------
sounds like you've thought about it more


---------65:07----------
the second is that i think this is more


---------65:09----------
from the present


---------65:11----------
whereas a lot of the heavy emotion i


---------65:14----------
think is like some scars from the past


---------65:16----------
right these are like


---------65:17----------
thoughts and beliefs like i'm not


---------65:20----------
someone who other people want to be


---------65:21----------
around


---------65:22----------
like i think you've felt that way for a


---------65:23----------
long time


---------65:25----------
and so what happens is like when the


---------65:28----------
things that are heavy from the present


---------65:29----------
day


---------65:30----------
are the ones that reinforce that belief


---------65:33----------
from the past does that make sense


---------65:36----------
whereas this you know sounds like there


---------65:38----------
really is a business side to this


---------65:41----------
that that you really you know and i


---------65:43----------
think the really tricky thing about this


---------65:45----------
is that i think that that business side


---------65:46----------
is like you know seems really legitimate


---------65:48----------
legitimate to me but i also see you


---------65:52----------
your kind of emotional


---------65:55----------
shackles holding you back from making


---------65:58----------
progress here


---------65:59----------
and what i mean by that is that you know


---------66:02----------
i think it's


---------66:03----------
like like it sounds like you kind of


---------66:06----------
said earlier that you put other people


---------66:08----------
first


---------66:08----------
you know and you always felt like other


---------66:10----------
people are more important than you are


---------66:12----------
and so what you're doing is you're even


---------66:14----------
the risk that you could potentially


---------66:16----------
taint someone's career


---------66:18----------
keeps you from taking a shot at doing


---------66:21----------
something that you find like


---------66:22----------
fulfilling and and happy


---------66:26----------
and and if we really think about it


---------66:27----------
that's that's really


---------66:29----------
kind of very caring and also kind of


---------66:31----------
shooting yourself in the foot


---------66:32----------
right which is what you were saying and


---------66:35----------
i think some of this stuff has to do


---------66:37----------
like you said with your fear of


---------66:38----------
rejection


---------66:40----------
and and i'm curious what would that


---------66:41----------
rejection look like i mean what do you


---------66:43----------
imagine


---------66:44----------
would happen um


---------66:49----------
well it's also happened like actually i


---------66:52----------
i did try it like a couple of times


---------66:54----------
and then do you feel comfortable sharing


---------66:57----------
that i


---------66:58----------
find myself being really curious what


---------66:59----------
that actually looks like


---------67:02----------
i mean it's not like a um basically like


---------67:05----------
i asked someone like


---------67:06----------
hey can i hang out and then they're like


---------67:08----------
let me check


---------67:09----------
um and then there but there's bases like


---------67:12----------
oh they're not comfortable with this


---------67:13----------
then


---------67:14----------
i'm like okay that's and then that was


---------67:17----------
that


---------67:17----------
and then i kind of there was like


---------67:20----------
similar like


---------67:21----------
things on like a similar vein um and so


---------67:26----------
it was never like it was never like very


---------67:28----------
dramatic it was just like


---------67:29----------
you know it's like feeling is there


---------67:32----------
and so people just want to respect okay


---------67:36----------
and how do you feel about how do you


---------67:38----------
understand


---------67:39----------
their choice


---------67:42----------
it's like


---------67:46----------
i think when you're like because i'm


---------67:48----------
trying to think about it from like their


---------67:49----------
perspective right


---------67:51----------
it's like i'm no longer like the friend


---------67:53----------
that they're closer to


---------67:54----------
so it doesn't make sense to kind of


---------67:59----------
do something that you know that your


---------68:00----------
your closer friend is gonna


---------68:03----------
um or like people that you're close to


---------68:05----------
are going to be more hurt by


---------68:06----------
than to like kind of


---------68:10----------
extend that like kind of hand of


---------68:13----------
like empathy or compassion in that


---------68:15----------
moment


---------68:16----------
and especially if like people have


---------68:20----------
doubts about like my character or like


---------68:21----------
who i am as a person


---------68:23----------
right and it's like i don't know like


---------68:24----------
maybe this guy is just trying to weasel


---------68:26----------
his way back into like being successful


---------68:29----------
or


---------68:30----------
part of something


---------68:34----------
that sounds tough man


---------68:40----------
so i'm just trying to stay in my lane


---------68:42----------
just do my thing it's kind of like


---------68:44----------
where i've been at or i've been telling


---------68:45----------
myself but obviously it's hard


---------68:48----------
and it's like i've been alone for so


---------68:50----------
long that i kind of like forgotten


---------68:52----------
like what it's like to be lonely


---------68:55----------
[Music]


---------68:58----------
i remember in the beginning it was like


---------68:59----------
the feelings of like


---------69:01----------
isolation were like way more intense and


---------69:03----------
then covet happened and then


---------69:05----------
kind of everyone else was feeling what i


---------69:06----------
was feeling but at that point i was so


---------69:08----------
acclimated to it that i'm like


---------69:09----------
my life is no different well


---------69:12----------
postpandemic and


---------69:13----------
like during the pandemic why do you


---------69:17----------
why do you try to stay in your lane


---------69:22----------
because i feel like


---------69:26----------
like i just don't want to stir up


---------69:27----------
trouble for people you know it's like i


---------69:29----------
know


---------69:32----------
like i don't like i've only been


---------69:34----------
streaming or i've been like making


---------69:35----------
content for like a month now


---------69:37----------
a month and a half it's like i haven't


---------69:38----------
proven myself to like kind of


---------69:41----------
be better or


---------69:44----------
so until like i feel like i've


---------70:20----------
seems to me like you want to feel worthy


---------70:28----------
again


---------70:33----------
what's it like to feel unworthy


---------70:56----------
so


---------71:24----------
foreign


---------71:30----------
not great for that's for sure


---------71:34----------
just like i have like earned it


---------71:37----------
you know yep


---------71:40----------
and until i do that like i don't have


---------71:43----------
the right


---------71:44----------
to kind of like ask for anything


---------71:48----------
so i'm just gonna think for a second


---------71:49----------
about what do we what do we do about


---------71:52----------
that


---------71:55----------
what is that shrug when i asked that


---------71:58----------
question


---------72:00----------
and i don't know


---------72:08----------
i think albert the real the real


---------72:10----------
challenge here is that


---------72:16----------
the real challenge real real challenge


---------72:18----------
is that that i honestly think that your


---------72:20----------
road forward


---------72:21----------
is not alone


---------72:24----------
and i i think here's you know we do this


---------72:27----------
to ourselves sometimes where we think


---------72:28----------
like


---------72:29----------
you know i'm gonna face the rest of the


---------72:31----------
world once i know i'm worth it


---------72:33----------
right once i know i'm ready it's kind of


---------72:35----------
like


---------72:37----------
you know i'm gonna take the sat or like


---------72:41----------
you know i'm once i know i'm gonna like


---------72:43----------
get a good score i'm gonna practice


---------72:44----------
really hard i'm gonna stay in my lane


---------72:46----------
i'm gonna fix myself and then i will


---------72:49----------
unleash myself upon the world


---------72:52----------
i'll re-enter once i know that i'm gonna


---------72:55----------
be


---------72:55----------
like okay right once people once i have


---------72:58----------
something to bring to the table


---------73:01----------
there's a lot of there's a lot of what i


---------73:03----------
would call paralytic security there


---------73:07----------
there's a lot of like idea that like you


---------73:09----------
know once i do this


---------73:12----------
then i can feel safe to go out and and


---------73:15----------
then i can approach people because


---------73:18----------
i i bring something to the table people


---------73:20----------
can care about me and people can want me


---------73:23----------
and and i really do have some value


---------73:26----------
and i gotta stay in my lane until i get


---------73:28----------
to that point


---------73:31----------
the reason i call it paralytic security


---------73:33----------
is because i i think it's paralyzing


---------73:35----------
because i i think that unfortunately


---------73:37----------
like your road forward


---------73:39----------
that's certainly one way to do it right


---------73:42----------
and i'm i'm not saying that's


---------73:43----------
the only way to do it but i mean there's


---------73:45----------
a part of me that says that


---------73:47----------
you know you got to fix what's broken


---------73:50----------
and


---------73:50----------
and what i'm hearing over and over and


---------73:52----------
over again is like is not that


---------73:55----------
you're going to teach yourself that you


---------73:57----------
have value


---------73:58----------
like what you've missed and what's


---------74:00----------
missing in your life


---------74:02----------
is not your own perception of your value


---------74:04----------
it's


---------74:05----------
other people giving you value and that's


---------74:08----------
the damnedest thing that's the really


---------74:10----------
really hard thing is that sometimes in


---------74:11----------
life you know we always think that like


---------74:14----------
we always think that healing is


---------74:16----------
something that i can do


---------74:18----------
right i can heal myself i can go to


---------74:19----------
therapy i can talk about my emotions and


---------74:21----------
stuff like that but


---------74:22----------
i mean i hate to say it man but


---------74:24----------
sometimes in life the fastest way to get


---------74:26----------
better is actually like


---------74:28----------
depends on other people and it can be


---------74:31----------
incredibly terrifying


---------74:34----------
to roll that those dice


---------74:38----------
right and i think that the something


---------74:39----------
tells me that if if you can


---------74:42----------
i think you have to a certain degree but


---------74:44----------
if you can keep on


---------74:46----------
actually showing them


---------74:50----------
because here's you have to show them


---------74:52----------
your imperfect self


---------74:53----------
and you have to give them a chance to


---------74:54----------
accept that because here's the problem


---------74:57----------
is that if you stay in your lane and you


---------74:59----------
assure yourself that you bring value to


---------75:01----------
the table


---------75:02----------
and then you show it to them and they


---------75:03----------
accept you what are they accepting


---------75:08----------
they're accepting the magic tricks


---------75:11----------
they're not accepting you


---------75:13----------
right and this is what's really got you


---------75:15----------
stuck is that you figured out this


---------75:17----------
solution


---------75:19----------
you figured out this thing that if i do


---------75:21----------
something that other people can't refuse


---------75:23----------
then they'll accept me but that's where


---------75:25----------
you shoot yourself in the foot because


---------75:26----------
then


---------75:27----------
the only thing you're truly doing is


---------75:29----------
reinforcing that


---------75:30----------
they're not accepting you


---------75:34----------
they're accepting the rubik's cube or


---------75:35----------
the magic trick


---------75:37----------
or the whatever right and so bizarrely


---------75:40----------
what it does is it reinforces the idea


---------75:41----------
that you're not worth it


---------75:44----------
and the real antidote to that is to to


---------75:46----------
show people


---------75:47----------
the half-formed thing right to show


---------75:49----------
people the incomplete thing


---------75:51----------
to show people the vulnerable thing to


---------75:53----------
show people yourself


---------75:55----------
which you're terrified that they're not


---------75:56----------
going to accept


---------76:00----------
the magic is that when you show people


---------76:02----------
those things


---------76:04----------
and they do accept you


---------76:08----------
then it's gonna be really really


---------76:09----------
confusing and really really difficult


---------76:12----------
because you're just gonna be like what


---------76:13----------
the [ __ ] like i don't understand why


---------76:15----------
this person is showing me value i mean


---------76:16----------
we saw it with your you know that girl


---------76:18----------
who was in love with you you're like i


---------76:19----------
don't understand


---------76:21----------
what this person can possibly see in me


---------76:25----------
and that's exactly what you need to


---------76:27----------
encounter over and over and over again


---------76:31----------
right you need to be just really [ __ ]


---------76:33----------
confused that people think that you're


---------76:35----------
you have value as a person


---------76:39----------
that you have value out outside of


---------76:41----------
making them


---------76:42----------
feel better and putting them first


---------76:46----------
you need a lot of confusion in in terms


---------76:49----------
of like


---------76:49----------
like why are these people hanging out


---------76:51----------
with me i don't do anything from them


---------76:53----------
i'm small


---------76:54----------
why do they care about me i don't


---------76:56----------
deserve to be cared for


---------77:01----------
and there's a part of me that honestly


---------77:02----------
says that's your road forward i mean


---------77:04----------
like


---------77:07----------
it's hard it's gonna require courage on


---------77:09----------
a level that i don't know if you've ever


---------77:11----------
found in yourself or realize that you


---------77:14----------
have but i think it's in there


---------77:16----------
i think i think it's it's buried but i


---------77:18----------
don't think you realize that you have it


---------77:20----------
i don't think you realize that


---------77:22----------
that you are a strong person and you


---------77:24----------
don't need to prove that to anyone


---------77:27----------
i think you your strength built up


---------77:30----------
each day of those two years that you


---------77:32----------
cried on a daily basis


---------77:35----------
and it's in there right because you kind


---------77:38----------
of survived and to


---------77:40----------
even extent you thrived and then you


---------77:42----------
made mistakes


---------77:46----------
and not to say that you shouldn't accept


---------77:47----------
responsibility but i think it's probably


---------77:50----------
worthwhile


---------77:50----------
also thinking about and learning to


---------77:53----------
forgive yourself


---------77:54----------
for why you made those mistakes and we


---------77:57----------
haven't really talked about that and i


---------77:58----------
don't know if we're going to because


---------77:59----------
that skirts a little bit


---------78:00----------
close to drama but if i had to venture


---------78:03----------
we don't even need to talk about i can


---------78:04----------
toss out a couple hypotheses


---------78:08----------
that's certain that sometimes we do


---------78:11----------
things to not disappoint other people


---------78:15----------
and did you make mistakes that were sort


---------78:18----------
of egotistical sure


---------78:19----------
but i you know i'd bet money that that


---------78:21----------
sprinkled in there


---------78:27----------
and and i think that ultimately like i


---------78:28----------
don't know if you've forgiven yourself


---------78:30----------
but like that too


---------78:31----------
is an important path that you have to


---------78:34----------
walk which is going to be hard and


---------78:35----------
unfamiliar because i don't know


---------78:37----------
you know so we learn from what people


---------78:40----------
show us


---------78:43----------
and i don't know if other people have


---------78:44----------
shown you forgiveness so i don't know


---------78:46----------
how you're going to learn how to do it


---------78:47----------
yourself


---------78:50----------
and ultimately i mean i hate to say this


---------78:53----------
but like


---------78:54----------
you know someone who works with people


---------78:56----------
who are suicidal and things like that on


---------78:58----------
a daily basis what i can tell you is


---------78:59----------
that


---------79:01----------
you know expecting someone who's


---------79:02----------
suicidal and hopeless


---------79:04----------
to find that on their own is [ __ ]


---------79:06----------
ridiculous


---------79:10----------
and so where do you get the idea that


---------79:12----------
you can walk this journey on your own


---------79:14----------
and i think that's what's so [ __ ]


---------79:15----------
hard is like


---------79:17----------
staying in your lane like you can


---------79:18----------
certainly get there don't get me wrong


---------79:20----------
like you can do a lot of introspection a


---------79:21----------
lot


---------79:22----------
of therapy i think you're well on that


---------79:23----------
road but there's a part of me that says


---------79:25----------
that


---------79:26----------
you know the fast track here is going to


---------79:29----------
be actually like with other people


---------79:32----------
that even if you feel you know if you


---------79:35----------
fear that rejection


---------79:37----------
that reaching out to other people and


---------79:38----------
saying hey i've thought about this a lot


---------79:41----------
i'd love it if we could reconnect


---------79:45----------
you know and being authentic and honest


---------79:46----------
with them and and also i think you do a


---------79:48----------
good job of this it sounds like you're


---------79:50----------
pretty respectful of their boundaries if


---------79:51----------
they say


---------79:52----------
i'm not comfortable with that so that's


---------79:53----------
good right


---------79:55----------
but to still share with people that like


---------79:58----------
you know i don't know if you've told


---------79:59----------
someone


---------80:00----------
that you miss them


---------80:06----------
right and and you want to be clear about


---------80:09----------
not trying to guilt-trip people into


---------80:11----------
like seeing you and things like that but


---------80:12----------
like


---------80:13----------
but there are ways to have these


---------80:14----------
conversations but i think if you miss


---------80:16----------
someone


---------80:16----------
you should tell them


---------80:20----------
you know i grow up in a tradition that


---------80:22----------
says that unless you fix this in this


---------80:23----------
life it's going to carry with you like


---------80:25----------
you carry it


---------80:27----------
you know all actions have an equal and


---------80:28----------
opposite reaction


---------80:30----------
all actions have consequences and what i


---------80:32----------
see in your life albert more than


---------80:34----------
anything else


---------80:35----------
is work that's left half done


---------80:54----------
say that's fair


---------81:10----------
that's questions


---------81:27----------
i guess maybe more fears


---------81:33----------
good very good


---------81:37----------
i mean there's also like a question


---------81:39----------
right it's like


---------81:44----------
i think i maybe made a sound sound like


---------81:48----------
like i have like no friends but i mean i


---------81:50----------
have i have


---------81:52----------
um like a decent support system you know


---------81:55----------
even now


---------81:56----------
um it's just like i think maybe what i


---------81:59----------
miss most is having like a centralized


---------82:01----------
friend group which i realize now is


---------82:06----------
less of them is less normal than i


---------82:10----------
used to think i guess i think a lot of


---------82:13----------
people


---------82:14----------
work nine to five jobs and then you have


---------82:16----------
like friends that you like


---------82:18----------
connect with but you don't like see them


---------82:19----------
every day and like that's like normal


---------82:21----------
existence and i think that's why


---------82:24----------
communities on twitch of like streamers


---------82:26----------
are very like attracted to


---------82:28----------
viewers because


---------82:32----------
because it's kind of like what you wish


---------82:33----------
you had in your own life


---------82:35----------
there's like this kind of parasocial


---------82:38----------
relationship


---------82:38----------
and this kind of living vicarially


---------82:41----------
through other people


---------82:43----------
and i think having like tasted that it's


---------82:45----------
like


---------82:46----------
you know feels good to be part of


---------82:50----------
something


---------82:52----------
um but they're it's not necessarily like


---------82:55----------
the right


---------82:56----------
like i don't know if it's necessarily


---------82:57----------
necessary either to like


---------82:59----------
want to go back like to living that kind


---------83:02----------
of life


---------83:03----------
because i think there's definitely to a


---------83:06----------
degree feeling like


---------83:08----------
my like like my relationships with


---------83:11----------
people


---------83:12----------
were like the product that i was selling


---------83:15----------
and i think there's a lot of confusion


---------83:18----------
there


---------83:18----------
like involving like like am i friends


---------83:21----------
with this person or is it because


---------83:23----------
our friendship like gets us a lot of


---------83:25----------
social validation


---------83:27----------
and like i definitely feel


---------83:31----------
like at some points that that was hard


---------83:32----------
to like differentiate


---------83:35----------
whereas like you know i know like the


---------83:37----------
kind of


---------83:38----------
friendships i have now with people are


---------83:41----------
like because of like everything that's


---------83:42----------
happened like i know this person's here


---------83:44----------
like showing up for me because you know


---------83:47----------
that


---------83:48----------
you know they're not here for like like


---------83:50----------
the video like the filmmaker


---------83:52----------
the musician the magician whatever um


---------83:56----------
so like that's something that i think


---------84:00----------
about a lot as well


---------84:02----------
where it's like how am i happy to hear


---------84:04----------
that


---------84:06----------
and a lot of like the feelings i have


---------84:08----------
too are


---------84:09----------
like do i miss like


---------84:12----------
is it the idea of loss and the feeling


---------84:15----------
that i need to fix something


---------84:17----------
the reason why it feels bad or is it


---------84:19----------
because i genuinely like


---------84:23----------
need this to be a part of my life


---------84:29----------
so yeah i haven't figured i figured that


---------84:31----------
out yet


---------84:32----------
those are all wonderful questions albert


---------84:34----------
it makes me hopeful for you actually


---------84:37----------
i mean the one one thing that i would


---------84:38----------
say and maybe we can kind of segue to


---------84:40----------
meditation in a few minutes but


---------84:42----------
um you know i'd say that i think these


---------84:44----------
are conversations that you should at


---------84:46----------
least try to have


---------84:48----------
and it sounds like you actually do have


---------84:50----------
people around you that


---------84:51----------
help you feel valued outside of your


---------84:58----------
performances which is wonderful


---------85:01----------
and so so if that's the case then then i


---------85:04----------
think it's it's really about settling


---------85:06----------
your karmic debts it's about


---------85:08----------
you know i i i mean there are a couple


---------85:10----------
of things here the first is that


---------85:12----------
i think a lot of what holds us back is


---------85:14----------
like not


---------85:16----------
fixing the past and fixing the past


---------85:18----------
doesn't mean returning to it it means


---------85:20----------
like not addressing it


---------85:22----------
right like owning up to what you did and


---------85:23----------
like like acknowledging things and


---------85:25----------
and sort of letting things kind of like


---------85:28----------
like letting your own mind kind of


---------85:30----------
process it


---------85:31----------
giving other people a chance to process


---------85:33----------
it even if that means


---------85:35----------
sending anger and frustration and hurt


---------85:37----------
your way which you should absolutely


---------85:39----------
receive from them and


---------85:42----------
and you know take it from them and then


---------85:44----------
and then let it go because like then


---------85:45----------
they're gonna be done they're not


---------85:46----------
holding on to it


---------85:48----------
you've done your job you can let it go


---------85:50----------
it's gonna be hard


---------85:52----------
the second thing is that ultimately i


---------85:54----------
think albert what you need to learn is


---------85:56----------
like


---------85:56----------
you know your road to value can come


---------85:59----------
from


---------85:59----------
your new friends and things like that


---------86:01----------
can come from therapy and reflection but


---------86:03----------
it can also come from


---------86:04----------
facing your own fears and surviving them


---------86:09----------
right what you need now more than


---------86:11----------
anything else i think is courage


---------86:14----------
and and and you're not going to


---------86:15----------
recognize entirely who you are


---------86:18----------
until you face that fear and even if


---------86:22----------
they reject you


---------86:24----------
i i think my hope is that there would be


---------86:26----------
peace around that


---------86:27----------
that you can kind of say like hey like


---------86:29----------
you know telling people


---------86:31----------
how you feel and like telling people


---------86:33----------
like hey you know i really valued this


---------86:35----------
it was really awesome to have


---------86:36----------
this opportunity and and i'm grateful


---------86:38----------
for it and


---------86:40----------
you know i miss this and then kind of


---------86:43----------
acknowledging like


---------86:45----------
you know i don't want you guys to feel


---------86:47----------
guilty i really don't


---------86:49----------
um and if anything i i i would hope that


---------86:52----------
we could


---------86:53----------
really just like have one last


---------86:55----------
conversation and put it behind us


---------86:56----------
not trying to get back in um


---------86:59----------
and and also whatever i've had


---------87:02----------
conversations already


---------87:04----------
and how did they go pretty much


---------87:07----------
like it was it was all amicable it was


---------87:09----------
just kind of like


---------87:11----------
yeah so in a way it's like i'm more


---------87:12----------
dealing with


---------87:14----------
now that i know and it's like living


---------87:17----------
with it


---------87:18----------
kind of deal living with water


---------87:21----------
just like like you know like i try my


---------87:24----------
best but just like because of like


---------87:26----------
the trauma and the damage i've done it's


---------87:28----------
just like it's never going to be


---------87:29----------
like truly healed and so like living


---------87:31----------
with that guilt


---------87:35----------
and interesting


---------87:40----------
so when you say it's never truly going


---------87:42----------
to be healed what is healed look like to


---------87:44----------
you


---------87:46----------
know


---------87:49----------
like for me like i like when i even just


---------87:52----------
go on


---------87:53----------
the platform like twitch it's like


---------87:57----------
like i i could never stream like i can


---------87:59----------
never go onto the twitch page because


---------88:01----------
there's too much stuff that like


---------88:03----------
i guess like reminds me of thing and


---------88:06----------
like


---------88:06----------
so i just and i'm sure


---------88:10----------
like it goes both ways right i'm sure


---------88:13----------
people


---------88:13----------
like not a lot of people feel good about


---------88:15----------
like seeing stuff about me or


---------88:17----------
whatever and


---------88:23----------
yeah albert i i think it sounds like


---------88:25----------
you've done a lot of it but i don't


---------88:27----------
i don't think you're done man okay i


---------88:30----------
mean


---------88:30----------
just just something about the way that


---------88:32----------
you're describing things like so


---------88:34----------
so i'm i'm very happy i mean happy's a


---------88:37----------
weird


---------88:37----------
i'm i feel reassured that you've had


---------88:41----------
some of these conversations i think it's


---------88:43----------
absolutely the right step to take


---------88:45----------
and what i'm also hearing is that like


---------88:47----------
the wound is still open


---------88:50----------
and i don't know what that conversation


---------88:52----------
looks like but i


---------88:54----------
you know maybe it isn't a conversation


---------88:55----------
maybe it's more on your end but like it


---------88:57----------
sounds to me like you've done a lot of


---------88:58----------
work


---------88:59----------
on your own in the last year and i don't


---------89:01----------
know


---------89:02----------
when you had those conversations


---------89:06----------
but you know sometimes it's worth


---------89:09----------
revisiting


---------89:10----------
a conversation especially if it's open


---------89:11----------
like sometimes one conversation and i


---------89:13----------
don't know i'm not assuming you just had


---------89:14----------
one


---------89:15----------
but you know sometimes it takes a lot of


---------89:18----------
conversations


---------89:19----------
to put things behind you


---------89:22----------
and i


---------89:26----------
i don't know i mean do you feel like


---------89:28----------
you've been forgiven by the people that


---------89:30----------
you've hurt


---------89:36----------
i think what i


---------89:41----------
i think these are two separate things


---------89:43----------
like what i've been told


---------89:44----------
like directly and like what i perceive


---------89:46----------
to be the sentiment are two different


---------89:48----------
things


---------89:50----------
okay so let's acknowledge for a moment


---------89:53----------
that like you don't


---------89:54----------
deserve forgiveness okay so what i mean


---------89:57----------
by that is like i think this is a really


---------89:58----------
common misconception but


---------89:59----------
forgiveness is something that the


---------90:01----------
aggrieved party gets to give


---------90:03----------
or not give you're not entitled to it


---------90:06----------
and even moving past that i know it


---------90:09----------
sounds kind of weird but even if you


---------90:10----------
never get forgiven i think that's okay


---------90:13----------
as long as you know that it's never


---------90:15----------
gonna happen and that this person is


---------90:17----------
like then you can still move past it you


---------90:18----------
can say


---------90:19----------
you know i [ __ ] up in a way that's


---------90:21----------
going to be irreparable for the rest of


---------90:22----------
my life so be it let me accept it and


---------90:24----------
let me move on


---------90:25----------
i think never being forgiven is okay


---------90:28----------
being forgiven


---------90:29----------
is better but the hard thing is being in


---------90:32----------
that middle space where you don't really


---------90:34----------
know


---------90:37----------
right and and there's a part of me i


---------90:39----------
mean like really


---------90:41----------
albert it's i mean it sounds like you're


---------90:42----------
holding on to a lot of this stuff


---------90:44----------
and some of it you know maybe i'm just


---------90:46----------
focusing on this i don't know why


---------90:48----------
but um


---------90:51----------
you know there's a part of me that you


---------90:54----------
know i think it kind of comes back from


---------90:56----------
this like image from the beginning of


---------90:57----------
like you're a wolf that's been


---------90:59----------
cut from the pack and it's


---------91:03----------
it's hard to be in that position


---------91:07----------
and doing everything that you can to get


---------91:09----------
back in even if it hurts and i don't


---------91:11----------
mean like get back in from a business


---------91:13----------
standpoint i mean like


---------91:14----------
you know reach a place of emotional


---------91:16----------
peace


---------91:18----------
and then sort of recognizing that like


---------91:20----------
you know i can't be a part of this pack


---------91:22----------
but at least i sort of know that and


---------91:23----------
we're like


---------91:24----------
okay with that and the pack is gonna


---------91:26----------
continue and i'm gonna go find a new one


---------91:28----------
like there's peace there


---------91:30----------
you know you don't have to get back


---------91:31----------
together with


---------91:33----------
your ex or anything like that like all


---------91:35----------
the rom-coms right like you guys can


---------91:37----------
agree that like


---------91:38----------
divorces can be amicable and things like


---------91:40----------
that where it's like


---------91:41----------
hey we tried it for a while you know it


---------91:43----------
was challenging but like i'm gonna live


---------91:45----------
my life and you're gonna live yours


---------91:47----------
and we can appreciate what we had


---------91:48----------
together and and we can kind of like


---------91:50----------
acknowledge that it wasn't great


---------91:55----------
and that like we're better off on our


---------91:57----------
own i don't get the sense that you have


---------91:59----------
closure


---------92:03----------
i guess that's the the word that i'm


---------92:04----------
sniffing around for hunting around for


---------92:09----------
what do you think


---------92:13----------
i guess people usually you know get that


---------92:15----------
closure being like a one-time thing


---------92:17----------
where it's like you talk about


---------92:18----------
everything and then


---------92:19----------
it gets sort of feathered


---------92:22----------
but i think it's just with the


---------92:26----------
nature of time it's like it's like


---------92:29----------
like i don't know have things changed um


---------92:33----------
from the last conversation because i


---------92:35----------
think from that perspective


---------92:37----------
like there was closure with people i had


---------92:39----------
talked to


---------92:40----------
um you know given like the circumstances


---------92:43----------
of that time


---------92:45----------
and so maybe it's like the uncertainty


---------92:48----------
or like


---------92:50----------
like not knowing like you know like


---------92:53----------
i have feelings changed has the general


---------92:57----------
sentiment atmosphere


---------93:01----------
so i'd steer that in a slightly


---------93:02----------
different direction what i'd say is okay


---------93:04----------
like


---------93:04----------
now i'll kind of just wrap up this point


---------93:07----------
we can talk about you know whatever you


---------93:09----------
want to after this or you can ask


---------93:10----------
questions but


---------93:11----------
here's what i'm feeling i'm feeling that


---------93:13----------
like so you're right that closure is not


---------93:15----------
a one-time thing


---------93:16----------
right so if you think about let's say


---------93:18----------
grief right so


---------93:19----------
about nine years ago my dad passed away


---------93:23----------
and then like i felt grief


---------93:25----------
and then you know but like i revisit


---------93:28----------
that grief


---------93:29----------
periodically and i sort of get closure


---------93:33----------
around my relationship with him


---------93:34----------
at like periodic intervals and it


---------93:37----------
happens like a little bit more intensely


---------93:38----------
after someone passes away but i i just


---------93:40----------
had


---------93:41----------
a feeling that i hadn't had in a couple


---------93:43----------
years which is that i really missed him


---------93:44----------
the reason that i really missed him is


---------93:46----------
that i was listening to a podcast that i


---------93:48----------
think he would have really enjoyed


---------93:50----------
and so i think part of what i'm what i'm


---------93:53----------
kind of pushing you towards albert and


---------93:55----------
you know be careful when i push you


---------93:56----------
because i usually am wrong


---------93:58----------
is that that like there's there's a


---------94:00----------
there's a different kind of conversation


---------94:01----------
that you can have now


---------94:03----------
after your year of reflection you know


---------94:06----------
you're in a different place there in a


---------94:07----------
different place


---------94:08----------
and i think that there's a second


---------94:09----------
opportunity for closure


---------94:12----------
and there's also like if they're not


---------94:13----------
interested in that that's okay that's


---------94:14----------
even


---------94:15----------
that's a closure in and of itself like


---------94:17----------
for other people to be like hey you know


---------94:18----------
i'm not


---------94:19----------
i'm just not interested in revisiting


---------94:21----------
that part of my life at least you know


---------94:22----------
that and then like you can be like okay


---------94:24----------
like that's


---------94:25----------
it's over now but there's something just


---------94:28----------
that feels


---------94:28----------
karmically open to me about this


---------94:32----------
um i don't know if that


---------94:35----------
resonates with you or not that makes


---------94:38----------
sense


---------94:41----------
you have any thoughts or questions


---------94:46----------
i feel like i've been pushing the


---------94:47----------
conversation in a particular direction


---------94:49----------
for the last half hour


---------94:51----------
that's fine i'm i'm always interested in


---------94:54----------
like seeing what someone else thinks


---------94:58----------
about yeah


---------95:21----------
all right i i don't have any questions


---------95:23----------
about it that's okay that's totally fine


---------95:25----------
like


---------95:26----------
like i know this is a very real


---------95:28----------
possibility and like a very


---------95:29----------
real course of action so like


---------95:34----------
i feel like if


---------95:38----------
you know maybe a time and place for it


---------95:41----------
and i just don't know when that


---------95:44----------
yeah i think albert from what i'm


---------95:47----------
hearing it sounds like you're actually


---------95:48----------
making a lot of good progress


---------95:51----------
i think it's great that you found people


---------95:52----------
who can appreciate that you don't have


---------95:54----------
to perform for


---------95:57----------
and what happened emotionally just now


---------96:00----------
what


---------96:02----------
something happened no no i don't think


---------96:04----------
so


---------96:05----------
okay maybe i just can't read your face


---------96:07----------
um


---------96:09----------
and yeah i mean i think


---------96:12----------
you know keep at it i think it's it's


---------96:14----------
worthwhile to think a little bit about


---------96:16----------
some of these things that you said


---------96:18----------
um you know about sort of these


---------96:21----------
adaptations that you have which actually


---------96:23----------
can hold you back in some ways i think


---------96:24----------
you've done a lot of good


---------96:25----------
self-reflection sounds like you're


---------96:28----------
working with a therapist or you did work


---------96:29----------
with a therapist so


---------96:30----------
you know that's really good i'd


---------96:33----------
encourage you to continue


---------96:35----------
last thing that i'll leave you with is


---------96:36----------
whether you want to learn how to


---------96:37----------
meditate


---------96:38----------
or whether you i don't know you hot


---------96:42----------
i've been doing it i used to look like


---------96:44----------
guided asian abs


---------96:45----------
nothing fancy it's like 10 minutes a day


---------96:48----------
kind of deal


---------96:49----------
and how do you feel about that


---------96:53----------
well like part of me like i'm not even


---------96:55----------
sure if i'm doing it right


---------96:57----------
like some of it is just like you


---------97:00----------
like i just feel good after doing it you


---------97:03----------
know more kind of


---------97:05----------
for me it helps put a lot of things in


---------97:06----------
perspective just like


---------97:09----------
you know this life


---------97:12----------
and i just want to make the most of it


---------97:15----------
and


---------97:15----------
that like your feelings and thoughts


---------97:19----------
it's like never the situation that


---------97:21----------
causes you unhappiness it's like how


---------97:23----------
you like your feelings and thoughts


---------97:25----------
towards it right and meditation kind of


---------97:27----------
helps me


---------97:28----------
take a step back and view like you know


---------97:31----------
the situation more you know from an


---------97:35----------
outsider's perspective


---------97:36----------
being like you know like this is


---------97:38----------
bothering me so much because


---------97:40----------
of like how i'm like feeling or thinking


---------97:43----------
about it


---------97:44----------
um not that the situation itself is like


---------97:47----------
harming


---------97:50----------
anyone like at the moment


---------97:53----------
yeah that's a pretty important insight


---------97:57----------
and when you say you're not sure if


---------97:58----------
you're doing it right


---------98:00----------
what do you think doing it right like i


---------98:04----------
i've seen like a lot of sentiments where


---------98:05----------
there's like this


---------98:07----------
like wave of people just doing


---------98:08----------
meditation because it's like


---------98:11----------
like like the pop like the cool thing to


---------98:12----------
do and then like you just do it just to


---------98:14----------
do it and say you're doing it


---------98:16----------
and but like it's more of a performative


---------98:18----------
theater thing rather than


---------98:20----------
like actually digging in and trying to


---------98:24----------
learn more about yourself while you're


---------98:26----------
meditating


---------98:27----------
and so like i'm not sure if i'm like


---------98:30----------
which camp i've fallen yet


---------98:32----------
because there's like no good metrics of


---------98:34----------
like you know


---------98:36----------
i'm really in my stride when i'm


---------98:38----------
meditating


---------98:39----------
uh versus just being consistent do you


---------98:42----------
have thoughts when you meditate


---------98:45----------
um try not to


---------98:48----------
try to exist


---------98:52----------
but it's hard like i just in the


---------98:55----------
beginning was very hard


---------98:56----------
to just like not think about anything


---------99:00----------
yeah i feel like it actually opposite


---------99:02----------
where it's just like now i'm like racing


---------99:04----------
my mind's just racing


---------99:06----------
um okay it's slowing down recently


---------99:12----------
if meditation could change one thing


---------99:15----------
about your life what would you want to


---------99:16----------
change


---------99:20----------
i just want to be


---------99:53----------
you


---------100:10----------
there my headphones died


---------100:34----------
hmm


---------100:40----------
all right


---------101:02----------
so


---------101:09----------
hey this one


---------101:26----------
i just want to wake up and be happy that


---------101:29----------
i'm


---------101:31----------
and not feel like i have to


---------101:35----------
fight to prove that


---------101:38----------
you know that i'm here


---------101:50----------
well whatever that takes to be at peace


---------101:52----------
with that


---------102:26----------
okay


---------102:54----------
hmm


---------103:05----------
so i'm gonna


---------103:09----------
ask you to do something okay i want you


---------103:11----------
to sit up straight


---------103:15----------
this is gonna be a two-parter two-parter


---------103:17----------
in the sense that once you do this for a


---------103:19----------
while


---------103:20----------
um i'm gonna teach you so this


---------103:22----------
meditation technique has to be taught


---------103:24----------
in at least two parts okay so i'm going


---------103:27----------
to teach you part one


---------103:28----------
and then down the road dm me or whatever


---------103:32----------
if you do it if you do this if you do


---------103:34----------
this like consistently for like three or


---------103:36----------
four months


---------103:37----------
just let me know and i'll i'll dm you i


---------103:39----------
can teach you the second part in five


---------103:40----------
minutes


---------103:42----------
but i want you to i'm gonna


---------103:45----------
say something so it's gonna be a piece


---------103:47----------
of a mantra


---------103:49----------
but i want you to focus on i'm going to


---------103:52----------
teach you one piece of it today


---------103:57----------
i want you to focus on the generation of


---------104:00----------
sound and feeling in your body you play


---------104:02----------
music


---------104:03----------
violin you said do you sing


---------104:06----------
not really okay great um


---------104:10----------
so i want you to focus on the sound that


---------104:11----------
it creates okay and and focus on it


---------104:14----------
in your in your body


---------104:17----------
so that what i want you to do is chant


---------104:23----------
[Music]


---------104:29----------
okay so close your eyes and focus on the


---------104:33----------
sound generation


---------104:34----------
and you can be loud about it okay


---------104:38----------
next string


---------104:39----------
[Music]


---------104:46----------
um


---------104:48----------
[Music]


---------104:53----------
okay less emphasis on the m and more


---------104:57----------
emphasis on the first half


---------105:02----------
[Music]


---------105:12----------
[Music]


---------105:14----------
um


---------105:16----------
[Music]


---------105:19----------
now tell me what you feel when you chant


---------105:22----------
that


---------105:25----------
feel kind of a reverberation


---------105:29----------
kind of here okay and then kind of sound


---------105:32----------
generation


---------105:33----------
of the sound like here and it kind of


---------105:36----------
goes


---------105:36----------
from here um


---------105:40----------
okay so i'm going to give you a little


---------105:42----------
bit of direction that's great


---------105:44----------
so focus on the vibration and what i


---------105:46----------
really want you to do is


---------105:47----------
notice where the vibration starts from


---------105:49----------
and where it ends


---------105:52----------
okay so practice again do like nine


---------105:56----------
rounds


---------105:58----------
[Music]


---------106:10----------
from


---------106:12----------
[Music]


---------106:32----------
what do you notice about where it starts


---------106:34----------
and where it ends


---------106:39----------
[Music]


---------106:47----------
it feels pretty similar okay maybe not


---------106:51----------
here but like yeah it's like it's like


---------106:54----------
from here down to here


---------106:56----------
okay how does it feel to do it


---------107:00----------
[Music]


---------107:05----------
kind of relaxing but also requires like


---------107:08----------
a degree of focus


---------107:09----------
or at least okay i'm doing it


---------107:12----------
okay sure so i'm going to teach you one


---------107:15----------
more practice


---------107:17----------
okay i'm going to teach you how to do


---------107:18----------
ohm chanting


---------107:20----------
so om is composed of three syllables


---------107:23----------
ah and


---------107:26----------
okay it's a little bit


---------107:29----------
so you're basically going from a


---------107:32----------
completely open mouth to a completely


---------107:34----------
closed mouth


---------107:35----------
so i'll demonstrate


---------107:57----------
got it so we'll do one round together


---------108:01----------
deep breath


---------108:02----------
in


---------108:09----------
[Music]


---------108:20----------
okay


---------108:24----------
all right did you feel that


---------108:27----------
yeah we're gonna do five rounds together


---------108:32----------
okay or five let's do seven breaths


---------108:34----------
together okay so we're gonna do


---------108:36----------
let's do five rounds together and what i


---------108:38----------
want you to do after the fifth i can't


---------108:39----------
hear you anymore did something happen oh


---------108:41----------
yeah i'm sorry


---------108:42----------
i was on i switched to push to talk so


---------108:44----------
what i want you to do is on


---------108:46----------
on um we're gonna do five rounds


---------108:48----------
together


---------108:49----------
and when we finish i want you to sit in


---------108:51----------
the silence


---------108:52----------
after the fifth round and just keep your


---------108:54----------
eyes closed for about 60 seconds i'll


---------108:56----------
prompt you when it's time to


---------108:58----------
come back okay


---------109:02----------
okay okay so deep breath in


---------109:26----------
again


---------109:35----------
[Music]


---------109:40----------
ah


---------109:50----------
deep breath in


---------110:10----------
[Music]


---------110:22----------
oh


---------110:24----------
[Music]


---------110:26----------
[Laughter]


---------110:32----------
[Music]


---------110:34----------
last one maximal power


---------110:39----------
[Laughter]


---------110:50----------
oh


---------111:32----------
so


---------112:33----------
when you're ready go ahead and come on


---------112:34----------
back


---------112:38----------
how do you feel feel good


---------112:44----------
um what were you thinking about


---------112:50----------
when we were doing the practice


---------112:54----------
during the whole thing or just like in


---------112:55----------
the silence either one just what was


---------112:58----------
your experience of it


---------113:00----------
um generally speaking like


---------113:04----------
having something to do like focuses a


---------113:07----------
lot of my thoughts on


---------113:08----------
like that action i'm like not really


---------113:11----------
thinking


---------113:12----------
about stuff it's like


---------113:15----------
yeah focusing on your breathing cases on


---------113:18----------
tone projection


---------113:19----------
so yeah so so that's the goal


---------113:22----------
okay so like so the first thing to


---------113:24----------
understand about meditation is that


---------113:26----------
the practice is about focusing so if you


---------113:30----------
really


---------113:30----------
think about it technically as your focus


---------113:33----------
becomes one pointed you don't have


---------113:34----------
thoughts


---------113:36----------
if you are observing where a vibration


---------113:39----------
exists within your body


---------113:41----------
that is not actually thinking it's


---------113:43----------
observation


---------113:44----------
so thoughts are like discrete entities


---------113:47----------
that come and go


---------113:48----------
right let me think like oh i'm a smart


---------113:50----------
person i'm a stupid person whatever


---------113:52----------
that's like a thought so it starts with


---------113:55----------
focus


---------113:55----------
and then as you practice over time


---------113:59----------
as you focus on one thing then your mind


---------114:01----------
will sort of melt away


---------114:03----------
and then that period of mindlessness


---------114:06----------
which is bizarre because everyone talks


---------114:08----------
about mindfulness it's not about


---------114:09----------
mindfulness it's about mindlessness


---------114:11----------
it's about being free of mind will


---------114:13----------
linger into the period of silence


---------114:16----------
the other interesting thing is that for


---------114:18----------
you especially i think feeling the


---------114:20----------
reverberations


---------114:23----------
of the second half of the i mean like


---------114:26----------
there's chanting and then there's


---------114:28----------
silence which is like


---------114:31----------
kind of an echo of the sound i don't


---------114:33----------
know if any of that makes sense


---------114:35----------
but i think really sitting in that place


---------114:38----------
is going to teach you


---------114:40----------
[Music]


---------114:41----------
that what you are


---------114:45----------
is fine and what i hear is that every


---------114:49----------
day when you wake up


---------114:51----------
what you are is not fine and if we think


---------114:55----------
about what that feeling of not fine is


---------114:57----------
it comes with a lot of thoughts


---------114:59----------
it comes with a lot of like not


---------115:01----------
accepting like this core


---------115:02----------
sense of who you are the ways in which


---------115:05----------
you are not fine have to do with your


---------115:07----------
actions and your worth


---------115:09----------
and other people and all of these things


---------115:11----------
outside of you


---------115:13----------
they're all about the ripples you judge


---------115:16----------
yourself based on the ripples that you


---------115:18----------
cause in life


---------115:20----------
whereas like those ripples are created


---------115:22----------
by all kinds of things but at the core


---------115:25----------
is you and you actually don't make any


---------115:27----------
ripples


---------115:28----------
it's all of your like psychological


---------115:30----------
complexes and some scars and your


---------115:32----------
emotions and your attachments


---------115:34----------
that's what creates ripples you don't


---------115:35----------
create anything


---------115:37----------
and so the more that you begin to sit


---------115:39----------
with like just the quiet version of


---------115:41----------
yourself you'll begin to realize that


---------115:43----------
like


---------115:43----------
all this other crap is not really who


---------115:46----------
you are


---------115:48----------
but you literally need to spend time


---------115:50----------
with yourself in silence


---------115:58----------
one last thing i want oh yeah the last


---------116:00----------
thing that i want to say albert is that


---------116:02----------
the other thing that you need is


---------116:03----------
should be so should be means cleansing


---------116:07----------
what i get from you is that you're


---------116:09----------
polluted by a lot of your thoughts a lot


---------116:11----------
of your actions


---------116:12----------
you hold on to things that make you not


---------116:15----------
be able to see who you are


---------116:18----------
and we need to cleanse you of that so


---------116:20----------
the last thing that i'm going to do and


---------116:22----------
i've tried to avoid doing this on stream


---------116:24----------
because it has a religious connotation


---------116:26----------
to it


---------116:27----------
are you religious i am not


---------116:30----------
okay i'm gonna send you something called


---------116:32----------
a kirtan


---------116:34----------
so kirtan is a religious hindu song


---------116:37----------
so it's like it's like pakti oriented so


---------116:40----------
it's like about as hindu as


---------116:41----------
you can get and at the same time i've


---------116:44----------
been struggling with this for a long


---------116:45----------
time


---------116:46----------
in terms of how can you take the value


---------116:49----------
of kirtan which is


---------116:50----------
essentially purification and like


---------116:54----------
remove the religion from it and i


---------116:56----------
haven't been able to figure it out so


---------116:57----------
the last thing that i'm going to do is


---------116:58----------
i'm going to send you a link to a song


---------117:00----------
it's about 12 minutes long and what i


---------117:03----------
want you to do is listen to it


---------117:05----------
every day for seven days and if you


---------117:08----------
if it doesn't feel good to do that at


---------117:11----------
the end of day seven


---------117:13----------
then just stop doing it but if you feel


---------117:16----------
some degree of peace or


---------117:19----------
like cleaner after you listen to it


---------117:23----------
then by all means continue and then like


---------117:26----------
let me know and then we'll send you some


---------117:27----------
additional stuff i really try to avoid


---------117:29----------
this because it's like


---------117:30----------
you know it has a it has a religious


---------117:32----------
recommendation it's not you're not going


---------117:33----------
to understand the words


---------117:34----------
you're not going to understand any of


---------117:35----------
this [ __ ] it's in a language you're not


---------117:36----------
going to know


---------117:37----------
you know it's not like worshiping


---------117:39----------
anything really


---------117:41----------
there's just a very purifying aspect to


---------117:43----------
girtham like in the


---------117:44----------
hindu tradition they sort of say that


---------117:46----------
doing this sort of stuff will clean you


---------117:47----------
out


---------117:49----------
um and it's not you don't have to


---------117:50----------
believe in anything


---------117:52----------
you know you're not signing up to be


---------117:53----------
anything it's just like purifying vibes


---------117:57----------
and i'm just curious it may help you and


---------117:59----------
if it doesn't no big deal


---------118:01----------
all right i'm i'm always down to try new


---------118:03----------
things so okay


---------118:05----------
so i'll send it to you okay


---------118:09----------
anyway any last thoughts or questions


---------118:11----------
before we wrap up


---------118:14----------
i mean no not really i mean i'm just


---------118:18----------
happy to be here talk to another person


---------118:21----------

---------118:25----------

---------118:26----------

---------118:33----------
