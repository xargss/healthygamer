---------00:00----------
um yeah so let me just okay so can you


---------00:05----------
talking about my sprigs not really


---------00:07----------
excited yeah we can talk about


---------00:09----------
myers-briggs do you like myers-briggs


---------00:10----------
can we oh my gosh I'd love ladies freaks


---------00:13----------
sure what what do you love about


---------00:15----------
myers-briggs hmm


---------00:18----------
I really like it because for me it's


---------00:21----------
like a gateway to talk about yourself


---------00:23----------
and other people


---------00:24----------
yeah absolutely hey do you know what


---------00:28----------
your myers-briggs type is yeah I always


---------00:31----------
get infp yep sounds about right


---------00:34----------
whatever you i am i and TP make sense


---------00:45----------
yeah so I I think I definitely make


---------00:49----------
sense


---------00:49----------
you're not very like neither of us are


---------00:51----------
sort of rigorous or hardcore which makes


---------00:54----------
us more peace than Jays and then I think


---------00:57----------
the big difference between us is that


---------00:59----------
you're an F and I'm a tea feeling and


---------01:04----------
thinking yeah


---------01:08----------
so how have you been and we could talk


---------01:10----------
more about myers-briggs but um I've been


---------01:15----------
good much better yeah it's pretty good


---------01:19----------
awesome I'm happy to hear that


---------01:21----------
um what's sinking what's changed um well


---------01:27----------
okay there were like two things since


---------01:30----------
the last time we talked that really


---------01:32----------
stood out to me personally great and I


---------01:36----------
think one of them was you said I was


---------01:39----------
like a sponge mm-hmm and learning that


---------01:43----------
was kind of useful like oh okay this is


---------01:46----------
just how I am and I think it's more


---------01:48----------
important that I learn what to do


---------01:50----------
afterwards yep which was really cool and


---------01:53----------
I didn't I didn't know what empath or


---------01:55----------
whatever the heck that was so I looked


---------01:57----------
that up too and all that stuff and the


---------02:00----------
second thing was um you said you thought


---------02:05----------
it was like a waste if I never found


---------02:09----------
love again or something like that I


---------02:10----------
never tried or something like that


---------02:12----------
along those lines right


---------02:13----------
okay yes yeah I'm trying okay just cool


---------02:17----------
okay cool so so um I was thinking maybe


---------02:21----------
we could talk a little bit since you're


---------02:23----------
you're feeling better I think a lot of


---------02:24----------
times what this stream is is focused on


---------02:27----------
is helping people who are down kind of


---------02:30----------
come back to baseline but I think what


---------02:33----------
is just as important is like exploring


---------02:36----------
how like where goodness and life comes


---------02:39----------
from so we spend a lot of time talking


---------02:42----------
about where badness comes from right so


---------02:44----------
like trauma and people hurt you and this


---------02:46----------
and that but like I think it's just as


---------02:48----------
important to understand like where does


---------02:50----------
goodness come from and how can you build


---------02:52----------
like goodness into your life okay so you


---------02:56----------
say that things are better and can you


---------02:57----------
help me understand a little bit about


---------03:00----------
you know how those two things about sort


---------03:02----------
of you know for a lack I'm trying to


---------03:07----------
figure out how to say this without


---------03:08----------
sounding cheesy but I can't do it


---------03:10----------
so not giving up on love for the lack of


---------03:12----------
it how can I say that but that's Anna


---------03:16----------
and and then also like like recognition


---------03:20----------
that you're kind of a sponge and that


---------03:22----------
you absorb in this kind of this


---------03:24----------
interesting thing about being a sponge


---------03:26----------
is that like actually helps the people


---------03:27----------
around you because you you kind of take


---------03:30----------
some of their negative energy and you it


---------03:33----------
makes you kind of a good friend but it


---------03:35----------
actually costs you a lot to do that but


---------03:39----------
so help me understand a little bit about


---------03:40----------
those two aspects those two things that


---------03:43----------
we talked about and have those been kind


---------03:44----------
of like active and a part of your life


---------03:47----------
or have you changed the way that you've


---------03:48----------
started to live because of those I have


---------03:52----------
accepted myself more so you know


---------03:55----------
throughout my life people have always


---------03:57----------
told me you're too sensitive or you're


---------04:00----------
too emotional things like that I started


---------04:04----------
to I guess yes I am very sensitive I am


---------04:08----------
very emotional I do take in literally


---------04:10----------
everything around me and kind of


---------04:13----------
acknowledging that helped me I guess


---------04:15----------
yeah awesome man much and sometimes like


---------04:18----------
I still don't know how to deal with it I


---------04:20----------
guess yeah it's not perfect sometimes I


---------04:23----------
still get really upset over like stupid


---------04:26----------
stupid


---------04:26----------
okay yeah how do you do that how do you


---------04:30----------
like what does that mean acknowledge it


---------04:32----------
what does that tell it because that's


---------04:34----------
why good stuff in there um I used to


---------04:38----------
think it was not a good quality I guess


---------04:42----------
like oh I am really emotional I do take


---------04:46----------
a lot of things in personally and I


---------04:50----------
didn't know how to like just stop it


---------04:51----------
yeah I don't think it's possible


---------04:54----------
um so by just acknowledging that this is


---------04:58----------
just who I am and I need to learn how to


---------05:00----------
work around that instead of trying to


---------05:03----------
change myself for no reason I guess yeah


---------05:06----------
beautifully said and I'm just gonna kind


---------05:09----------
of repeat back what I heard so I think I


---------05:10----------
think Lily like this is exactly what


---------05:12----------
we're here for


---------05:13----------
my mission in life is to try to help


---------05:16----------
people understand that instead of trying


---------05:20----------
to live a life of someone that they're


---------05:23----------
not live that live your life with all of


---------05:27----------
your advantages in all of your


---------05:28----------
disadvantages and what I see people


---------05:30----------
doing time and time and time again is


---------05:32----------
imagine you're playing poker you play


---------05:34----------
poker so so like you know I think what I


---------05:39----------
see people doing is like you're dealt a


---------05:41----------
certain hand in poker and what people


---------05:43----------
try to do is they spend their entire


---------05:44----------
life wishing that they had a different


---------05:47----------
hand and then trying to change their


---------05:50----------
hand into someone else's hand and they


---------05:52----------
think that oh if I have like pocket if I


---------05:54----------
had pocket aces then I would be


---------05:56----------
successful because that guy over there


---------05:57----------
has pocket aces and if he's got pocket


---------05:59----------
aces then then I would be fine instead


---------06:02----------
of playing the hand that they're dealt


---------06:03----------
which let's remember that like pocket


---------06:06----------
aces doesn't always win even though


---------06:07----------
theoretically it's the best hand you


---------06:09----------
just have to play the hand that you've


---------06:10----------
got and and what I really love about


---------06:12----------
what you're saying is that like you're


---------06:14----------
starting to do that and and I think a


---------06:17----------
lot of like success and and suffering so


---------06:21----------
I think suffering and Happiness like


---------06:23----------
that starts to tip when you start to


---------06:25----------
accept for yourself for who you are and


---------06:27----------
that also leads to success because


---------06:29----------
you're like you're trying to play a game


---------06:31----------
for which you're not like built you're


---------06:34----------
trying to play other people's games and


---------06:35----------
I I don't think that you're too


---------06:36----------
sensitive I don't think you're too


---------06:38----------
emotional I think you are sensitive and


---------06:40----------
emotional and that's that's a strength


---------06:44----------
and a weakness and yeah I think it's


---------06:48----------
wonderful that you're starting to accept


---------06:50----------
yourself how but how are you able to


---------06:53----------
start doing that because I mean is does


---------06:58----------
that make sense like because yeah I can


---------07:02----------
imagine there are a lot of people who


---------07:04----------
have trouble accepting things about


---------07:07----------
themselves because they've been told


---------07:08----------
that that thing is like not good it


---------07:13----------
definitely helped because okay after a


---------07:15----------
first session I had so many people


---------07:18----------
messaging me how much that helped them


---------07:20----------
and like how inspired and I'm like wow


---------07:24----------
that's pretty cool maybe they're on to


---------07:27----------
something you know maybe I I did help


---------07:28----------
them you know and then just even by


---------07:33----------
starting to accept it it shifted my


---------07:36----------
mentality a lot because instead of just


---------07:40----------
I guess the first step of just accepting


---------07:42----------
yourself just really helps even if I


---------07:45----------
don't do anything else you have that


---------07:46----------
make sense


---------07:47----------
yeah it makes perfect sense and it's one


---------07:48----------
of the most mind-boggling things so I


---------07:51----------
like like the thing that's really


---------07:52----------
confusing is when I work with a lot of


---------07:54----------
people they keep on asking how do I


---------07:55----------
change how do I change how do I change


---------07:58----------
and and the crazy thing is like your


---------08:02----------
goal is not to change it's actually to


---------08:03----------
accept the person that you are and once


---------08:06----------
you do that like once you start


---------08:07----------
accepting yourself what happens what


---------08:09----------
changes in your mind in your head in


---------08:12----------
your life in your behaviors how does


---------08:14----------
that affect you when you start to accept


---------08:16----------
yourself for who you are


---------08:19----------
feels like the first step into I'm so by


---------08:24----------
avoiding things I just woke up hold on


---------08:26----------
take your time um it feels like


---------08:31----------
something positive instead of something


---------08:34----------
that I have looked down on I don't know


---------08:37----------
if that makes sense okay it just feels


---------08:40----------
more freeing like to accept that hey


---------08:43----------
this is just this is me this is who I am


---------08:46----------
I'm going to live with it and this is


---------08:49----------
how it's gonna be


---------08:50----------
it feels better yeah freeing yeah


---------08:55----------
awesome


---------08:55----------
I'm so happy was it hard yeah but even


---------09:00----------
um accepting is one thing too but it's


---------09:02----------
still like hard for me I guess yeah I


---------09:05----------
still have you know some given how I am


---------09:12----------
and that I stream for a living and that


---------09:15----------
my life is exposed to thousands of


---------09:17----------
people it's weird like my friends often


---------09:21----------
joke that I have like the worst


---------09:23----------
personality to be a public figure


---------09:26----------
because I take things in so much all the


---------09:30----------
good all the bad yep and yeah so it's


---------09:33----------
something I'm so you know I think I'll


---------09:35----------
always it's like a path that always be


---------09:38----------
on yep yes how very zen of you yeah also


---------09:46----------
how very zen of you right that's what


---------09:49----------
zen is all about it is what it is and


---------09:51----------
and mmm right that's what they always


---------09:54----------
talk about so I think that's what your


---------09:55----------
what yours so the other thing that we


---------09:57----------
can call this is I think you're starting


---------09:58----------
to live in the present


---------10:00----------
so so instead of starting to live the


---------10:03----------
imagined life of what you could what


---------10:06----------
your life could look like if you were a


---------10:08----------
different person is also something that


---------10:09----------
a lot of people do right so they imagine


---------10:11----------
themselves is a different person and


---------10:13----------
what their life would be like and then


---------10:15----------
they like start building these fantasies


---------10:17----------
about my life could be this if only I


---------10:19----------
was someone else and what I hear you


---------10:22----------
doing is saying okay I'm gonna stop


---------10:24----------
living this imagined life of someone


---------10:26----------
else I'm gonna stop living


---------10:28----------
you know like alter ego like shadow


---------10:32----------
universe Lily who is like not emotional


---------10:34----------
and not sensitive and instead of


---------10:38----------
becoming your alter ego sit version of


---------10:40----------
yourself you're just you've started to


---------10:42----------
accept yourself for who you are and it


---------10:45----------
can be liberating because now you're no


---------10:47----------
longer like like think about why that's


---------10:49----------
liberating it's because you're no longer


---------10:50----------
trying to live a life that doesn't exist


---------10:53----------
it's really hard to live a life that


---------10:54----------
doesn't exist and we try to do it all


---------10:56----------
the time the other thing that you're


---------10:59----------
noticing which is also awesome is just


---------11:01----------
because you accept yourself doesn't mean


---------11:03----------
that everything goes away


---------11:11----------
sounds like kimmy14 to me is that Timmy


---------11:19----------
Timmy penny penny sounds like Timmy


---------11:26----------
agrees okay hey how long have you had to


---------11:34----------
me oh I've had her since let's see like


---------11:37----------
three years now how do you like having


---------11:40----------
it on it's amazing okay so I got Timmy


---------11:45----------
okay I was in this super depressed state


---------11:48----------
back then


---------11:49----------
super super depressed literally did not


---------11:51----------
want to get out of bed and I hurt I


---------11:53----------
don't know if this is I don't know


---------11:54----------
whether it's the right or wrong reason I


---------11:57----------
don't care anymore but I heard that


---------11:58----------
getting a dog can motivate you to get


---------12:00----------
out of bed huh and have something to


---------12:02----------
take care of and look forward to and


---------12:03----------
that's the reason I got her


---------12:06----------
mostly huh and it worked like so well


---------12:09----------
she gave me a meaning and that's fine I


---------12:12----------
feel loved


---------12:13----------
for her no no no me yeah that's awesome


---------12:18----------
yeah I think animals um you know can be


---------12:21----------
really awesome for us and we can be


---------12:23----------
really awesome for them and that


---------12:25----------
relationship can be really powerful also


---------12:27----------
they do things like reduce mortality


---------12:29----------
like so they oh wow yeah literally thank


---------12:33----------
you there's studies that show that


---------12:35----------
animals will literally reduce mortality


---------12:37----------
and people who have animals live longer


---------12:40----------
bizarre I love dogs I love her it's just


---------12:45----------
it's amazing how much she makes me so


---------12:47----------
happy


---------12:48----------
yeah so I just want to point out that I


---------12:52----------
think that too is because you're an


---------12:53----------
emotional sponge right so like like the


---------12:56----------
dog is going to be able to affect you in


---------12:58----------
a positive way greater than it would be


---------13:01----------
able to affect someone who is


---------13:02----------
insensitive because you can open


---------13:04----------
yourself up to like her joy and


---------13:06----------
compassion and licks so that's awesome


---------13:11----------
like dogs can make everyone happy yeah


---------13:15----------
I'm not so sure about that I mean I hear


---------13:18----------
that they're these people called cat


---------13:19----------
people I grew up with three German


---------13:25----------
shepherds so I'm not sure what the cat


---------13:27----------
what's the deal with the cat people but


---------13:29----------
the more time I spend on Reddit the more


---------13:31----------
time I kind of like the more I find


---------13:33----------
myself wanting to get a cat they're like


---------13:38----------
more low maintenance right you don't


---------13:39----------
need to potty train them or anything


---------13:41----------
just kind of there yeah but also


---------13:44----------
apparently some of them are [ __ ] not


---------13:50----------
not the cat people the cats themselves


---------13:52----------
oh yeah yeah if you're lucky you get a


---------13:57----------
cat that acts like a doc Oh interesting


---------14:01----------
interesting anyway so just going back to


---------14:05----------
you mentioned that there's still some


---------14:07----------
problems is it okay if we just kind of


---------14:09----------
like understand those a little bit in


---------14:11----------
the context of what's changed and what


---------14:13----------
hasn't changed yeah so can you give me


---------14:16----------
an example of you know so it sounds like


---------14:18----------
you're you've turned over a new leaf


---------14:19----------
your check you're living your life


---------14:20----------
slightly differently you're changing the


---------14:22----------
way that you look at yourself and yet


---------14:24----------
problems still arise


---------14:27----------
um because even if I accept that this is


---------14:29----------
who I am I'm still going to be affected


---------14:31----------
by it that's not gonna change


---------14:33----------
absolutely so now I'm dealing with how


---------14:37----------
do I better cope with it you know I


---------14:40----------
better deal with it which is still I


---------14:42----------
think an ongoing process yeah so like


---------14:47----------
I'm really glad that you recognized that


---------14:49----------
so I'm gonna try to kind of explain this


---------14:50----------
so acceptance doesn't really happen in


---------14:54----------
our traditional mind it sort of happens


---------14:57----------
outside of our mind so like I know this


---------15:00----------
isn't gonna sound weird but like there's


---------15:01----------
there are different layers of mind and


---------15:03----------
so what I think you've managed to do is


---------15:06----------
gain some degree of acceptance that sort


---------15:09----------
of exists outside of your mind and your


---------15:11----------
mind can still have the roller coaster


---------15:13----------
you can still feel good things and bad


---------15:15----------
things but the more that you kind of


---------15:18----------
accept all of the roller coaster the


---------15:20----------
less impactful the roller coaster


---------15:22----------
becomes does that make sense or not


---------15:25----------
really anything okay


---------15:27----------
the other thing is that it doesn't


---------15:29----------
actually change the fact that you still


---------15:31----------
have a roller coaster so I think what


---------15:34----------
you're still experiencing is that


---------15:35----------
there's still a roller coaster it's just


---------15:37----------
the roller coaster it's like you're more


---------15:39----------
protected against the roller coaster


---------15:42----------
does that is that how it feels it's kind


---------15:46----------
of I guess the fact that there's still a


---------15:49----------
roller coaster yeah but there's still a


---------15:52----------
roller coaster right that's what's kind


---------15:54----------
of weird about this is that like what


---------15:56----------
what you what you've grown and you


---------15:57----------
haven't so a lot of people who feel like


---------15:59----------
you know they're they are emotionally


---------16:02----------
sensitive what they try to do is become


---------16:04----------
emotionally less sensitive so that's


---------16:07----------
exactly that's the equivalent of


---------16:09----------
reducing the roller coaster it's like


---------16:12----------
changing the roller coaster into like a


---------16:14----------
flat drive but that doesn't work so life


---------16:17----------
is still gonna send you a roller coaster


---------16:19----------
it's your ability to step back from the


---------16:22----------
roller coaster and kind of accept it for


---------16:24----------
what it is that actually gives you a


---------16:26----------
sense of peace but the roller coaster


---------16:28----------
still happens and I think that's what


---------16:30----------
you mean by the problems like you don't


---------16:32----------
you haven't stopped becoming emotionally


---------16:33----------
sensitive you're just better at


---------16:36----------
understanding that you're emotionally


---------16:37----------
sensitive and like more accepting of


---------16:39----------
that which makes the roller


---------16:41----------
are less painful fair yeah okay that's


---------16:44----------
me that's a good way to put it yeah so


---------16:46----------
so there so can you give me an example


---------16:49----------
of like what is like what's something


---------16:52----------
that you've experienced that has been a


---------16:53----------
little bit more problematic recently


---------16:56----------
okay um I'm a public figure yourself


---------17:00----------
most of my life is online I share a lot


---------17:03----------
of things with my audience I'm very very


---------17:05----------
very very open about literally


---------17:08----------
everything huh but I think sometimes


---------17:10----------
that gives people stuff to use against


---------17:13----------
me okay because I'm so open though see


---------17:17----------
that and I guess form their own analysis


---------17:20----------
on my life my relationships etc that are


---------17:24----------
just completely wrong but yeah and that


---------17:26----------
bugs me because I'm like that's not true


---------17:28----------
yeah


---------17:30----------
yes absolutely right so people are gonna


---------17:33----------
just they're gonna make all kinds of


---------17:35----------
judgments over the Internet and because


---------17:38----------
you're open they're going to feel like


---------17:41----------
they understand you because you share so


---------17:44----------
much but they're they're not really I


---------17:47----------
mean they're missing crucial even though


---------17:48----------
you're super open it sounds like they're


---------17:50----------
missing crucial pieces of the puzzle


---------17:51----------
which is like what your actual


---------17:54----------
experiences yes I mean I choose to be


---------17:59----------
open so and this sounds like I expected


---------18:02----------
cuz it's the internet you know you put


---------18:03----------
yourself out there people are going to


---------18:05----------
form their own opinions about you and I


---------18:08----------
understand that I guess it's just I just


---------18:10----------
deeply don't like being misunderstood


---------18:12----------
that's like the one thing that's why I'm


---------18:15----------
open and honest because I make if you


---------18:16----------
need to know something like I will tell


---------18:18----------
you don't make wrong assumptions on your


---------18:21----------
house okay what do you think what do you


---------18:24----------
think it is that bothers you about being


---------18:26----------
deeply misunderstood it's it's like


---------18:29----------
people thinking you're this one you're


---------18:32----------
not and that kind of bothers me I guess


---------18:35----------
because I'm not that anything so it


---------18:39----------
almost sounds like you it was part of


---------18:41----------
your openness is to prevent people


---------18:43----------
misunderstanding you yes sometimes and


---------18:47----------
also because I just like sharing things


---------18:49----------
it's just fun yeah so I think they're


---------18:51----------
like those sound like no they sound like


---------18:54----------
separate mode


---------18:54----------
patience to me yeah there yeah and even


---------19:00----------
though the so sharing like there's a


---------19:01----------
part of that that I think is just


---------19:03----------
genuinely you you just like to share


---------19:05----------
right and that's awesome I like sharing


---------19:08----------
feelings and talking about how I feel


---------19:10----------
and malicious that's why I love my


---------19:12----------
brakes on my tray I'm like hey what my


---------19:14----------
strings are you all without muses and


---------19:16----------
you know we can get into a whole other


---------19:17----------
conversation about that that's like


---------19:19----------
super fun for me yeah and and also it


---------19:24----------
sounds like you share part of the reason


---------19:26----------
that you share the degree with which you


---------19:28----------
share is to try to prevent people


---------19:30----------
misunderstanding you just a bit okay


---------19:36----------
yeah yeah so and and when when they


---------19:40----------
misunderstand you how does that affect


---------19:42----------
you like what happens within you when


---------19:44----------
when you see that happening and how does


---------19:46----------
it happen like over Twitter or like what


---------19:48----------
a little wedding sometimes I get Dan's


---------19:51----------
most of it is just messages emails etc


---------19:54----------
hey Shh are we are we going to dangerous


---------19:58----------
territory is Tammy should we switch


---------20:00----------
gears no no no that's cuz she hears


---------20:03----------
someone outside okay like no I mean it


---------20:09----------
sounds like Tammy is very are you sure


---------20:12----------
it's because she hears something outside


---------20:13----------
or it's because she's sensing something


---------20:15----------
within you because of what we're talking


---------20:17----------
about


---------20:17----------
I think it's outside good


---------20:20----------
she's like growls what if she used stuff


---------20:23----------
everything wolf um but that'd be cool if


---------20:25----------
she could send something inside me and


---------20:27----------
then like growl from that I've never


---------20:29----------
seen her do that but that'd be really


---------20:30----------
cool she probably does other things


---------20:31----------
besides growl she does when I'm like sad


---------20:36----------
or whatever I think she can tell I'm


---------20:37----------
like she always like cuddles me like


---------20:39----------
more and it's like super super super


---------20:42----------
healing yeah


---------20:43----------
what are we talking about though we were


---------20:45----------
talking about being misunderstood yeah


---------20:48----------
so so but it sounds like most of what


---------20:51----------
your openness is just because you want


---------20:52----------
to be open yes okay okay and we can talk


---------20:57----------
a little bit about more about being


---------20:59----------
misunderstood and why that's important


---------21:00----------
to you although I suspect that that'll


---------21:02----------
be a little bit of


---------21:06----------
less positive conversation because it's


---------21:09----------
kind of like a negative sort of thing


---------21:11----------
does that make sense yeah I'm free to


---------21:15----------
talk about mother okay so the other


---------21:17----------
thing that you mentioned is that you've


---------21:19----------
stopped giving up on love you're giving


---------21:21----------
love another chance and


---------21:24----------
and I mean so we could talk about that


---------21:27----------
too if I mean because that's what's okay


---------21:30----------
so what does that mean practically you


---------21:35----------
know just kind of fell free someone I'm


---------21:38----------
lying you know I try to convince myself


---------21:40----------
for like no I don't I don't actually


---------21:43----------
like you know it's and it's not gonna


---------21:45----------
work at all but I gotta try wait why do


---------21:51----------
you try to convince yourself that it's


---------21:53----------
not going to work out cuz I was afraid I


---------21:55----------
was gonna get hurt again initially right


---------21:58----------
but then honestly I think that's a risk


---------22:02----------
that we're all kind of willing to take


---------22:05----------
okay um by the way I have trouble seeing


---------22:09----------
your whole face because of the


---------22:10----------
microphone I'm sorry


---------22:11----------
that's okay yes I just rely on facial


---------22:13----------
expressions a lot it helps me


---------22:15----------
but if you want to hide behind the mic


---------22:18----------
then I don't want to take that away from


---------22:20----------
you well yeah I guess I'm just afraid me


---------22:25----------
yeah you do have to be a little bit


---------22:26----------
closer you can move it back to to cover


---------22:28----------
your face that's better oh sorry no


---------22:30----------
problem okay great okay so so it sounds


---------22:40----------
like you [ __ ] sorry that's okay


---------22:42----------
say okay so so you fell for someone so


---------22:49----------
those are emotions right and then


---------22:50----------
something happened in your mind where


---------22:52----------
you tried to keep yourself from falling


---------22:54----------
for them yeah and you think and you did


---------22:59----------
that to try to protect yourself yes


---------23:02----------
makes a lot of sense so this is great so


---------23:05----------
I think Lily the other advantage of you


---------23:07----------
being emotional is that I think you can


---------23:09----------
we can cover a lot more ground because I


---------23:12----------
don't have to explain like emotional


---------23:14----------
stuff to you because like you're you're


---------23:16----------
actually really in tune with your own


---------23:17----------
feelings I'm


---------23:18----------
really surprised honestly that you're


---------23:20----------
able to piece together that you have


---------23:21----------
that kind of protective reflex in your


---------23:24----------
mind to pull away from someone that you


---------23:27----------
fell for what exactly does that does


---------23:29----------
that mean love just crashed okay


---------23:33----------
I don't know yeah and and so are you do


---------23:37----------
you mind if I ask you a few questions


---------23:38----------
about that yeah are you so are you in a


---------23:41----------
relationship of some kind yeah how does


---------23:45----------
that feel pretty good I mean it's like


---------23:49----------
you take a journey another adventure you


---------23:52----------
sort of feel yeah


---------23:53----------
like I'm willing to put my all into this


---------23:58----------
I guess that's nice what that's awesome


---------24:03----------
so that sounds so positive I don't know


---------24:06----------
how else just say that I mean it sounds


---------24:09----------
like you're not expecting too much out


---------24:11----------
of it um yeah we're pretty much like


---------24:15----------
let's just go with the flow see where it


---------24:16----------
ends up I am very open like if it works


---------24:19----------
great if it doesn't doesn't like what


---------24:22----------
I'm willing to try it at the very least


---------24:24----------
that's how I feel about this yeah so it


---------24:29----------
sounds like you're hopeful but not


---------24:32----------
expecting yes so that I think is the


---------24:36----------
perfect way to be in a relationship so I


---------24:39----------
think we run into problems when you


---------24:41----------
start to expect what do you think about


---------24:42----------
that then you get disappointed


---------24:46----------
absolutely but sometimes it's hard it's


---------24:50----------
it's very hard to be hopeful without


---------24:52----------
expectation that's true how are you I'm


---------24:56----------
just I feel I feel like I'm very


---------24:58----------
realistic about this relationship though


---------25:01----------
from all the things I went through in


---------25:03----------
the past uh-huh so I just I feel like


---------25:07----------
it's just like a lot of communication


---------25:09----------
like I tell everything if there's


---------25:12----------
something that is bothering me I dress


---------25:15----------
it it's very very honey word that's like


---------25:22----------
straightforward okay so it sounds like


---------25:24----------
you're on top of it


---------25:26----------
mm-hmm right like it sounds


---------25:29----------
when when they're there issues that


---------25:31----------
arise in the relationship like either


---------25:33----------
feelings that you have or concerns that


---------25:35----------
you have that you're straightforward and


---------25:36----------
like you talk about them instead of


---------25:38----------
letting them kind of fester we yeah we


---------25:41----------
both communicate a lot and I really like


---------25:45----------
that so it feels very free and very open


---------25:47----------
very honest and at the moment no


---------25:50----------
changing all honeymoon phase I know that


---------25:52----------
so whatever hackin how long have you


---------25:54----------
guys been together


---------25:57----------
months okay


---------25:59----------
it's very nice yes so that is relatively


---------26:03----------
new but it also sounds like y'all you're


---------26:06----------
it sounds like the relationship is


---------26:08----------
actually pretty strong yeah yeah nice


---------26:17----------
yeah I don't have any problems I mean


---------26:20----------
usually like it you know that that sort


---------26:22----------
of open straightforward communication is


---------26:25----------
is rare so early in a relationship do


---------26:28----------
you mind if I ask it did you know the


---------26:30----------
person before you guys started okay okay


---------26:34----------
so I guess that makes a little bit more


---------26:35----------
sense but because usually people are


---------26:36----------
like you know they're like all kinds of


---------26:38----------
anxieties around and so I know that


---------26:47----------
you're an open person and I also know


---------26:49----------
you're a public figure so feel free to


---------26:50----------
not answer this question I'm just not


---------26:53----------
sure how often I can call this person


---------26:55----------
this person so can I have a name Michael


---------26:59----------
okay okay so tell me a little so it


---------27:03----------
sounds like you've you've really given


---------27:05----------
this a shot and you're acknowledging


---------27:06----------
that you don't know where it's gonna go


---------27:08----------
but you feel pretty optimistic about it


---------27:11----------
yes yeah so what's that like the you


---------27:20----------
know I I know the beginning of a


---------27:22----------
relationship is always like man that


---------27:24----------
person can do no wrong perfect it's like


---------27:27----------
sweet and it's super cute I know this


---------27:30----------
but I'm enjoying it for what it is


---------27:32----------
Yeah right and I realize it will end


---------27:36----------
eventually well maybe well I don't know


---------27:37----------
I've heard stories so but again it's


---------27:39----------
just whatever comes at me I will I will


---------27:42----------
tackle it then


---------27:43----------
yeah so so yeah so Lily okay let me just


---------27:49----------
think for a second so I want you to just


---------27:51----------
notice what words you're using right so


---------27:54----------
once again you're creating distance


---------27:57----------
between what your mind kind of like


---------27:59----------
projects and expects and you're saying


---------28:01----------
like you know that this is the honeymoon


---------28:03----------
phase in that it very well could end but


---------28:06----------
that too is acceptance right so like


---------28:12----------
you're kind of accepting that this could


---------28:13----------
be the honeymoon phase and you're


---------28:15----------
enjoying it for what it is that also is


---------28:17----------
super zen so like that's the whole point


---------28:20----------
right so like when so I'll just give you


---------28:22----------
an example so if I walk outside so


---------28:24----------
spring is coming and I don't know what


---------28:27----------
part of the world you live in but I


---------28:29----------
don't know if you're gonna have flat are


---------28:31----------
you gonna have like flowers and stuff in


---------28:32----------
bloom where you are I live in California


---------28:34----------
that's okay so I don't I don't know how


---------28:37----------
much of a spring really hits California


---------28:39----------
but so I live in Massachusetts and and


---------28:41----------
you know winter is brutal here and then


---------28:43----------
also spring is like super super


---------28:45----------
beautiful and and so you know that some


---------28:49----------
people what they do when they have


---------28:50----------
something good in life is they try to


---------28:52----------
hold on to that and that I think holds


---------28:54----------
people is the more you try to hold on to


---------28:56----------
what you have the more held back you


---------28:59----------
become and what I'm hearing from you is


---------29:01----------
that you're not trying to hold on to the


---------29:03----------
honeymoon phase you're just trying to


---------29:05----------
enjoy it while it lasts yeah and so so


---------29:08----------
you know the Zen master when they look


---------29:10----------
at a flower that's in bloom they don't


---------29:13----------
try to hold on to the beauty of that


---------29:15----------
flower for ever they don't try to


---------29:18----------
capture it they don't try to hold on to


---------29:20----------
it forever and this is what we try to do


---------29:22----------
with like Instagram and cameras and


---------29:24----------
iPhones is we try to capture memories


---------29:26----------
and moments in our lives forever but the


---------29:30----------
Zen master what they do is just


---------29:32----------
appreciate the beauty of the flower for


---------29:33----------
what it is and appreciate that it's


---------29:35----------
transient and that it will eventually


---------29:38----------
wither and it doesn't mean that like


---------29:41----------
that to that like you know the plant


---------29:43----------
will still remain and there's a there's


---------29:45----------
a beauty within the plant as well and


---------29:47----------
that the plant will continue to bloom so


---------29:49----------
you just kind of accept things for what


---------29:50----------
they are instead of trying to hold on to


---------29:53----------
a particular like state in your life now


---------29:56----------
and I'm hearing a lot of just just the


---------30:00----------
nature of your language has changed


---------30:01----------
since the last time I talk to you it's


---------30:04----------
hard to pinpoint but it's just these


---------30:06----------
statements like I acknowledge so that


---------30:08----------
too is like you're acknowledging the


---------30:10----------
roller coaster that right now this is


---------30:12----------
the high phase of the relationship and


---------30:14----------
at some point the roller coaster is


---------30:16----------
going to dip but you're separating


---------30:18----------
yourself from the roller coaster and


---------30:20----------
you're saying I'm going to let myself


---------30:23----------
enjoy this and if it ends so be it if it


---------30:28----------
doesn't end get fantastic what and and I


---------30:32----------
think it that's that's that's perfect


---------30:35----------
that's like perfect


---------30:36----------
that's what I want everyone to do is to


---------30:39----------
understand that the good things in your


---------30:41----------
life they could go away or they could


---------30:43----------
stay for a while and enjoy them why they


---------30:45----------
well they last and the more that you try


---------30:48----------
to hold on to something yeah I think I


---------30:52----------
think this relationship is gonna work


---------30:53----------
out thank you III really think it is


---------31:04----------
yeah okay you know yeah I know I'm sorry


---------31:08----------
for creating an expectation but


---------31:09----------
something about this sometimes I get a


---------31:12----------
sense of things and and I I like the way


---------31:16----------
you're thinking about it and I like the


---------31:18----------
way you're talking about it and and I


---------31:20----------
hope that the guy isn't like decent dude


---------31:24----------
yeah so but I think this is yeah so Lily


---------31:29----------
the other thing is that's all I'll tell


---------31:31----------
you like you know as much as okay so I'm


---------31:36----------
gonna ask you a personal question okay


---------31:37----------
in your heart of hearts and you don't


---------31:40----------
have to answer this okay you really


---------31:41----------
don't have to answer this because this


---------31:42----------
is not helping you understand maybe I'm


---------31:44----------
just really curious in your heart of


---------31:46----------
hearts what do you think is gonna happen


---------31:51----------
you don't have to answer right no no no


---------31:56----------
stop stop for a second this is not an


---------31:59----------
expectation what I'm asking you about is


---------32:01----------
not an expectation well what I think is


---------32:05----------
going to happen what do you feel is


---------32:06----------
gonna happen or not even gonna happen


---------32:12----------
because gonna happen is like is


---------32:14----------
cognitive it's heart ache I know what I


---------32:18----------
want to happen okay of course and I want


---------32:22----------
us to work yeah okay do you feel like


---------32:24----------
it's going to work long term not talking


---------32:27----------
about expectation I want to jinx it okay


---------32:31----------
that's fine so don't say anything but I


---------32:34----------
want you to just so this is another


---------32:35----------
important point okay so there's


---------32:37----------
expectation which comes from the mind


---------32:39----------
but I think that there's there's also


---------32:42----------
something that is I don't even think


---------32:44----------
it's emotional I think it's almost more


---------32:45----------
spiritual in terms of sometimes we have


---------32:48----------
a sense of things does that make sense


---------32:52----------
so I think you're very good at it sort


---------32:56----------
of having a sense of things so this is


---------32:57----------
the end for - breaks by the way okay so


---------33:01----------
like what is your intuition it's not an


---------33:04----------
expectation it's an intuition it's a gut


---------33:06----------
and you don't even have to answer but I


---------33:08----------
would trust that right and so I would


---------33:13----------
also ask you because like my gut is


---------33:16----------
telling me very very strong things right


---------33:18----------
now


---------33:18----------
and so we don't even have to ask I get


---------33:20----------
you to answer I know what your answer is


---------33:22----------
but and so that then I want you to go


---------33:24----------
back in time and think about the other


---------33:27----------
relationships you've had and think about


---------33:30----------
what was telling you to stay in the


---------33:32----------
relationship was it your mind or your


---------33:35----------
gut or a fear or that you didn't want to


---------33:39----------
believe or what are you feeling what was


---------33:42----------
your gut telling you then what was your


---------33:44----------
intuition telling you then and what is


---------33:46----------
your intuition telling you now is it the


---------33:48----------
same or is it different


---------33:49----------
no it's different very good very


---------33:52----------
different I like that's not surprising


---------33:54----------
to me at all so I think and so that I


---------33:58----------
feel weirdly optimistic I don't even


---------34:00----------
know anything about this purse


---------34:02----------
right but I have a sense of these things


---------34:04----------
and and honestly like I don't know how


---------34:07----------
else to put this Lily but I see in your


---------34:10----------
face and your demeanor what I felt like


---------34:13----------
when I met my wife no that's that I see


---------34:19----------
it and like as crazy as this sounds so


---------34:22----------
like as much as I think about


---------34:23----------
rationality and god this is gonna be so


---------34:26----------
bad if you guys break up because I'm


---------34:27----------
staking my entire reputation and and and


---------34:30----------
stuff on horseback [ __ ] it it's what I


---------34:32----------
believe like so I actually like this is


---------34:34----------
crazy I believe in true love like I


---------34:36----------
really do and and I think I think for


---------34:42----------
all of the cognitive stuff in the


---------34:43----------
neuroscience and psychology I think that


---------34:45----------
some things are just meant to be I think


---------34:47----------
this is garma Karma right I think that


---------34:51----------
there are forces in our life that shape


---------34:54----------
who we are in the kinds of life we live


---------34:56----------
and I see that force very very strongly


---------34:59----------
in my own life and I don't know how to


---------35:02----------
put this but like I don't know how to


---------35:04----------
say this but there is no earthly way in


---------35:08----------
which I have done something to deserve


---------35:10----------
the person that I'm married to yeah go


---------35:18----------
ahead go for it no I just say things


---------35:23----------
like that I guess


---------35:24----------
no no but I mean seriously like and I


---------35:27----------
think the only the only way that this is


---------35:29----------
possible is for a force greater than me


---------35:31----------
to like be acting at it right cuz I'm


---------35:35----------
just I'm just not that good I'm just not


---------35:39----------
I'm just not I mean it's not it's not an


---------35:41----------
issue of confidence or anything I'm very


---------35:43----------
confident the person that I am but I


---------35:44----------
think it's just she's just really


---------35:46----------
amazing and I'm really really lucky to


---------35:47----------
have her I mean she stuck with me


---------35:48----------
through all kinds of stuff and and so


---------35:52----------
like in that I mean I can't and I see it


---------35:55----------
I see it in you and there are a lot of


---------35:57----------
things that were hard for us but it's


---------36:01----------
there and so I you know don't stop


---------36:02----------
believing that's really that's adorable


---------36:09----------
what does that mean a door we have


---------36:11----------
before you that's so cute


---------36:13----------
they


---------36:14----------
believe in true love and you must love


---------36:16----------
your wife so much it's just it's really


---------36:19----------
cute I really I'm enjoying this what are


---------36:23----------
you doing I'm happy thank you I'm happy


---------36:25----------
for me too


---------36:27----------
what's enjoyable about it it's just nice


---------36:31----------
thing you happy and talked so lovingly


---------36:34----------
about your life and no like it's just


---------36:38----------
beautiful to see I like it


---------36:40----------
no I'm glad you're enjoying it no no no


---------36:47----------
I mean what I said sounded weird to I'm


---------36:48----------
just really curious about what resonates


---------36:50----------
with what I'm saying you know like like


---------36:53----------
like and and I'm really I really am glad


---------36:59----------
that that it's bringing you some degree


---------37:01----------
of happiness


---------37:02----------
I always feel happy when I see like a


---------37:06----------
relationship just work and seeing them


---------37:10----------
be happy for each other and the way that


---------37:13----------
you talk about each other and just


---------37:15----------
seeing that kind of things makes me very


---------37:16----------
very happy


---------37:17----------
cuz it's just I can tell they're happy


---------37:20----------
it's it's very nice to see ya oh god how


---------37:24----------
do I wear this umm not creepy way it's


---------37:27----------
yeah I'm happy that you're happy


---------37:31----------
yes so now we come back to the


---------37:33----------
advantages of being an emotional sponge


---------37:39----------
right so I think it's I think it's


---------37:43----------
wonderful that the person that you are


---------37:45----------
are you feeling embarrassed or something


---------37:47----------
I'm confused I'm what are you


---------37:50----------
embarrassed about I just say okay let's


---------37:59----------
just let's ignore that I'm gonna keep


---------38:01----------
talking okay you ready yeah so I think


---------38:04----------
this is this is the upside of being an


---------38:06----------
emotional sponge so I think this is


---------38:07----------
what's fun and amazing about your life


---------38:09----------
and also like really difficult is


---------38:11----------
because when there's toxicity around you


---------38:14----------
it affects you but also that you can


---------38:16----------
look at another person's joy and like be


---------38:19----------
so affected by it which is beautiful so


---------38:23----------
it's like it's like when you see like a


---------38:24----------
flower in the sunshine and like you see


---------38:27----------
like warm ray


---------38:27----------
of light on those pedals like you're


---------38:29----------
capable of feeling that warmth - which


---------38:33----------
is amazing I said this in the first


---------38:38----------
conversation but you really do make me


---------38:40----------
sound very cool I really I really - very


---------38:47----------
good I know so I make you sound cool am


---------38:49----------
i how can I make you sound anything yeah


---------38:55----------
shouldn't affect that no I'm glad you


---------38:58----------
said it


---------38:58----------
no no I'm glad you said I'm really glad


---------38:59----------
you said it and I'm glad you recognized


---------39:01----------
that it's Lily - right so that's that's


---------39:04----------
the goal is to catch it when it happens


---------39:06----------
and to notice it no wonder you're doing


---------39:08----------
so much better because you caught it


---------39:10----------
really fast and this is this is


---------39:12----------
something important like if you guys


---------39:14----------
just have to catch it if you catch it


---------39:16----------
and you notice it that actually weakens


---------39:18----------
it because remember that Lily - gets out


---------39:20----------
of control when you can't see her when


---------39:23----------
she goes in vis and then she starts


---------39:25----------
wrecking your [ __ ] life it's like a


---------39:27----------
poltergeist it's like you can't see it


---------39:29----------
you can't stop it but all you need is


---------39:32----------
like you need detection you need to be


---------39:33----------
able to see her like you don't want her


---------39:34----------
hiding in the bushes you know like you


---------39:37----------
play wall right there's like the bushes


---------39:39----------
or whatever right so like Lily - is


---------39:41----------
gonna own you as long as she's like


---------39:42----------
hanging out in those places that you


---------39:44----------
can't see her and she's like attacking


---------39:45----------
you from the bushes or whatever but once


---------39:48----------
you see it once you detect her then you


---------39:50----------
could take her on man like you can own


---------39:51----------
her like you can yeah it's good work in


---------39:57----------
continues yeah I made like after that


---------40:02----------
and maybe Lily one emailed and look to


---------40:04----------
eat now after this I'm gonna need to


---------40:07----------
make Ozen fully emotes yeah cool this is


---------40:12----------
it's just it's cute it's very cute I


---------40:14----------
like to call it I really like the


---------40:15----------
concept a lot like separating it yeah


---------40:18----------
separating what so when I say something


---------40:23----------
or I know it's coming from really to


---------40:26----------
having that separation I guess even


---------40:29----------
though it's still me I know but giving


---------40:30----------
like acknowledging that all that's


---------40:32----------
that's really - talking yep yes that's


---------40:36----------
how our mind works and I think


---------40:37----------
oftentimes we forget


---------40:40----------
that just because like we think that


---------40:42----------
Lily too is like the speaker of truth


---------40:45----------
right and whatever Lily too says like


---------40:47----------
you accept is true but now does that


---------40:51----------
make sense like when you're feeling bad


---------40:52----------
you accept lily twos statements or


---------40:55----------
thoughts as facts but when you separate


---------40:59----------
out Lily too you begin you you weaken


---------41:01----------
her ability to convince you that she's


---------41:04----------
correct because you recognize that she's


---------41:06----------
just a part of your mind and that your


---------41:08----------
mind is not infallible in fact it thinks


---------41:09----------
were stupid wrong thoughts all the time


---------41:11----------
yeah and and so that's that's awesome


---------41:14----------
Lily I'm really happy for you I think


---------41:16----------
you've changed a lot since the last time


---------41:17----------
I talked to you thank you I'm really


---------41:22----------
glad we had our talk yeah I think


---------41:24----------
initially after the talk I was feeling


---------41:28----------
embarrassed because I cried so much and


---------41:35----------
thousands of people like some it


---------41:39----------
affected a lot of people and I wasn't


---------41:43----------
sure I was just embarrassed I guess not


---------41:47----------
sure and then afterwards I was feeling


---------41:50----------
happy that it affected people in a good


---------41:53----------
way in a positive way cuz I really did


---------41:57----------
receive so many private messages about


---------42:00----------
that conversation and thanking me and


---------42:03----------
how much it helped them and that made me


---------42:06----------
really really happy like super happy


---------42:09----------
yeah and just yeah I'm really glad I had


---------42:13----------
that conversation and showed all that


---------42:17----------
yeah I'm glad you did too I think a lot


---------42:21----------
of life is hard because we like try to


---------42:23----------
live it alone you know and and we just


---------42:26----------
all of the burdens like despite being


---------42:28----------
such an open person I can imagine that


---------42:31----------
you probably share a lot but you're you


---------42:34----------
probably hold a lot of the burdens that


---------42:36----------
you carry like to yourself yes and and


---------42:40----------
you share a lot of the positivity which


---------42:42----------
I think can be good in some ways like


---------42:44----------
because you can be kind of inspiring and


---------42:47----------
comforting to people who are feeling


---------42:48----------
down but I think in a sense like you


---------42:51----------
know when you share something with


---------42:52----------
someone else it kind of like


---------42:54----------
lessons the weight on you and and I


---------42:57----------
think you were carrying a lot of burden


---------42:59----------
of negativity like within yourself about


---------43:01----------
I'm not quite sure what but and and so I


---------43:05----------
think it's good that you sort of let


---------43:07----------
that go a little bit and also let it be


---------43:10----------
and let it pass and also I think part of


---------43:14----------
the reason that you're probably feeling


---------43:15----------
better is because of Michael because


---------43:17----------
that sounds like it's calling me will


---------43:22----------
call me again I I know yeah it is what


---------43:27----------
it is I say this a lot now yeah good


---------43:29----------
good it is what it is right and it


---------43:32----------
sounds wonderful is it wonderful okay so


---------43:40----------
you don't know Jake said I get it


---------43:41----------
right so you don't wanna okay fine


---------43:44----------
objectively no it is it is above average


---------43:49----------
it is above average excellent I don't


---------43:51----------
want to be perfect because it's jinxing


---------43:53----------
it and that's like you know just


---------43:54----------
expectations is up but it is nice yeah


---------43:57----------
no I think being with a good person is


---------43:59----------
really really nice for your life also in


---------44:02----------
my experience some of that doesn't


---------44:04----------
really go away like the honeymoon phase


---------44:07----------
I think the honeymoon phase is really


---------44:10----------
only applicable to relationships without


---------44:12----------
the one I think with the one the whole


---------44:15----------
reason that they're the one is because


---------44:16----------
the honeymoon phase doesn't really stop


---------44:18----------
Wow I hope I mean do I hope yeah I hope


---------44:27----------
I have or find what you have sounds


---------44:33----------
amazing


---------44:34----------
yeah I guess wait I think it's it's


---------44:38----------
different for every person right so


---------44:39----------
remember we don't want to play someone


---------44:41----------
else's handsome but I think I think it's


---------44:45----------
fine to hope that you find something one


---------44:47----------
day that describes sort of what I'm what


---------44:50----------
I have


---------44:50----------
yeah yeah I hope I think it's closer


---------44:54----------
than you think man but let's not jinx it


---------44:56----------
okay let's stop talking about a singing


---------44:58----------
I'm not sick but no no no you should be


---------45:01----------
dude you should absolutely be


---------45:02----------
superstitious when it comes to my stuff


---------45:04----------
right because this is not the kind of


---------45:07----------
stuff that


---------45:07----------
[ __ ] around with oh no yeah I become so


---------45:11----------
superstitious recently it's bizarre


---------45:13----------
expired I said once I had kids like I


---------45:17----------
just it's weird it's like parts of my


---------45:19----------
brain woke up that were like dormant and


---------45:22----------
now it becomes like superstitious okay


---------45:26----------
in our culture like we like my


---------45:28----------
grandmother used to talk about the evil


---------45:30----------
eye mm-hm and and like I was like that's


---------45:33----------
BS there's no evil eye


---------45:35----------
but now I've so that's the evil eye just


---------45:38----------
kidding I don't even know it's like when


---------45:41----------
some when people so in in my culture


---------45:43----------
it's like when people when you're like


---------45:46----------
overly happy or joyous and people become


---------45:49----------
jealous like bad things happen to you to


---------45:51----------
put you back in line oh that's that's


---------45:55----------
the best I can think of that's the best


---------45:57----------
description I see I didn't feel like at


---------46:03----------
one point I was too scared to be too


---------46:05----------
happy I guess we're cautiously too happy


---------46:08----------
yeah cuz I what if something bad happens


---------46:11----------
to counteract that yeah I don't know


---------46:13----------
that superstition or anxiety or whatever


---------46:15----------
I always felt that yeah so like I know


---------46:18----------
this is what I'll say like I think that


---------46:20----------
I don't think it's rational and yet


---------46:23----------
sometimes I think that we encounter and


---------46:28----------
experience things that defy rationality


---------46:31----------
and okay and I think that if you want to


---------46:34----------
be a real scientist you have to accept


---------46:36----------
that your view of the world may not be


---------46:40----------
correct and that there may be forces at


---------46:43----------
play in the world that we just don't


---------46:45----------
understand yet and if we just assume


---------46:47----------
that those forces are wrong just because


---------46:50----------
they don't fit into our worldview that's


---------46:51----------
not truly being scientific so what a


---------46:53----------
scientist does is collects data from the


---------46:56----------
world and then form basis creates a


---------46:59----------
worldview that accounts for your


---------47:00----------
observations it's not let's say it's not


---------47:04----------
assuming a worldview and then


---------47:06----------
discounting your observations because


---------47:08----------
they don't fit with what you believe the


---------47:10----------
world looks like and essentially what's


---------47:13----------
happened to me recently over the past


---------47:15----------
couple of years is like I've just like


---------47:17----------
started to feel weird things like I


---------47:20----------
don't know how else to put it


---------47:21----------
it's like making me think about this


---------47:23----------
evil eye stuff which is not rational at


---------47:24----------
all I have no idea how this [ __ ] works


---------47:26----------
but I feel it and so I don't know if


---------47:29----------
it's just parental paranoia and just


---------47:32----------
part of my psychology I'm not sure but


---------47:35----------
you know I start to I start to take


---------47:37----------
these things seriously like the knock on


---------47:38----------
wood and stuff yes a little stop talking


---------47:40----------
about Oh Michael it's not even use this


---------47:42----------
name we'll call it this person back to


---------47:46----------
this I think anyway so what I'm what do


---------47:52----------
you I'm not really sure where to go from


---------47:55----------
here what huh hmm well you doing today


---------48:04----------
like like how am i spending my day yeah


---------48:09----------
so for today I I mean I worked in the


---------48:12----------
morning I'm gonna work after this and


---------48:14----------
then I will go home and hang out with my


---------48:18----------
kids for a while and then may do a


---------48:21----------
little bit of work after that or


---------48:23----------
actually I'll probably just like watch


---------48:25----------
something and hang out with my wife for


---------48:27----------
a little while and then are you watching


---------48:30----------
right now I'm watching a couple of


---------48:33----------

understand like that slight paranoia if


---------50:01----------

---------52:22----------
boomer murca invaded chat yeah okay cool


---------52:31----------
they're being cued up yeah so what are


---------52:34----------
you watching on Netflix ah


---------52:38----------
I'm watching this anime about volleyball


---------52:40----------
which is really cool it's it's yeah it's


---------52:46----------
just an anime about volleyball it's


---------52:48----------
really fun um that's it I mean we


---------52:52----------
watched like a bunch of the shows


---------52:53----------
already um you've heard of I'm not okay


---------52:57----------
with this


---------52:58----------
I've heard of it I don't know what it is


---------53:00----------
it's like yeah it's a coming-of-age sort


---------53:04----------
of story about a girl who has powers not


---------53:07----------
bad hmm I'm always looking for stuff to


---------53:10----------
binge on Netflix yeah me too um okay I


---------53:19----------
think we're getting questions okay here


---------53:20----------
we go


---------53:23----------
okay so let's go so people are asking


---------53:26----------
about Lily's dosha did you know anything


---------53:28----------
about Ayurveda Lily oh you'll you'll


---------53:30----------
maybe like this okay oh sure yeah so um


---------53:34----------
you know what myers-briggs is based on


---------53:37----------
no so myers-briggs is based on the work


---------53:40----------
of Carl Jung who was a psychoanalyst in


---------53:44----------
a contemporary of Freud's and Carl


---------53:46----------
Jung's a lot of his theories were based


---------53:49----------
on actually like Indian philosophy and


---------53:51----------
were actually based on Ayurveda in IRA


---------53:54----------
as traditional Indian medicine


---------53:57----------
and an Ayurveda sort of posits that like


---------54:00----------
so Western medicine kind of says that


---------54:02----------
everyone is the same


---------54:03----------
so if you think about like what you


---------54:05----------
study in Western medicine you study like


---------54:06----------
heart attacks or the flu or a corona


---------54:09----------
virus right so a doctor learns how to


---------54:11----------
treat a disease they don't learn how to


---------54:13----------
treat a person with me


---------54:16----------
so Ayurvedic swith kind of a different


---------54:19----------
assumption it says that all people are


---------54:20----------
different and that we each have like


---------54:23----------
different elemental balances is kind of


---------54:26----------
they use elements to describe certain


---------54:27----------
characteristics like personalities or


---------54:29----------
physical form or things like that and


---------54:31----------
those they have three kind of quote


---------54:34----------
unquote elements which are called doshas


---------54:36----------
and then based on someone's door sha you


---------54:38----------
can kind of understand how their mind


---------54:40----------
works so I kind of call it a cognitive


---------54:43----------
fingerprint so we each have like a


---------54:45----------
unique fingerprint and we each have a


---------54:46----------
unique like way that our mind works


---------54:49----------
so one exactly thing so there are all


---------54:52----------
kinds of traits so for example you are


---------54:55----------
predominantly gafas and I think you're


---------54:58----------
probably gonna and Vata so gafas is kind


---------55:01----------
of think about earth and water so people


---------55:02----------
who are guffaws they they deal with


---------55:06----------
stress when their mind becomes stress


---------55:08----------
they become kind of isolated and


---------55:10----------
depressive they start to think negative


---------55:13----------
self thoughts about themselves so vadas


---------55:16----------
are different because vadas become


---------55:18----------
anxious and start thinking negative


---------55:20----------
thoughts about the external world so


---------55:22----------
they start worrying about oh this is


---------55:23----------
gonna happen and this is gonna happen


---------55:25----------
and this is gonna happen whereas cough


---------55:26----------
is when they get stressed say like oh


---------55:29----------
like I'm dumb because I did this I'm


---------55:30----------
dumb because I did this I'm dumb because


---------55:32----------
I did this the third element is fit


---------55:35----------
though which is kind of like fire and so


---------55:37----------
when pit does get stressed they get


---------55:39----------
angry at other people so they're like oh


---------55:41----------
this is dumb like this person is dumb


---------55:43----------
like these people suck in traffic like


---------55:45----------
road rage is a classic bit the


---------55:47----------
phenomenon whereas like I would imagine


---------55:49----------
you don't have road rage like you just


---------55:51----------
don't understand why people wrote rage


---------55:53----------
because that's just not how your mind


---------55:54----------
works right and and so you're


---------55:57----------
predominantly kapha and I think you have


---------55:59----------
Vata as well and the other thing about


---------56:01----------
Ayurveda is that there are physical


---------56:03----------
characteristics associated with these as


---------56:05----------
well so can you look directly at the


---------56:08----------
camera


---------56:10----------
and can you take off your glasses oh can


---------56:14----------
we do that yes sir sorry okay so so the


---------56:19----------
other thing is is there are some


---------56:21----------
physical characteristics which you can


---------56:23----------
kind of us all do my face okay so my


---------56:26----------
face tends to be like a little bit


---------56:27----------
angular like if you look at my nose like


---------56:29----------
my nose is very like angular like your


---------56:32----------
faces has kind of a rounder quality to


---------56:35----------
it if you look at my hands so my hands


---------56:38----------
have very prominent veins on the back of


---------56:40----------
my hands my fingers tend to be like long


---------56:42----------
and thin these are all Vata


---------56:44----------
characteristics so these are very wind


---------56:46----------
characteristics so vadas are angular


---------56:49----------
sharp cold so I tend to like get cold


---------56:53----------
hands and feet very easily so there are


---------56:55----------
all kinds of physical characteristics so


---------56:57----------
you have a lot of roundness to your face


---------56:59----------
and it doesn't I'm not saying you're fat


---------57:02----------
or anything like that I'm just talking


---------57:03----------
about like your your your nose is like


---------57:06----------
rounded whereas mine is like angular


---------57:08----------
right so there's like angular there's


---------57:10----------
less angularity to your features has


---------57:13----------
nothing to do with beauty or


---------57:14----------
attractiveness or anything like that


---------57:15----------
it's just like some people's hands and


---------57:17----------
faces and stuff just look different the


---------57:21----------
other thing about vatta's is like


---------57:24----------
sivadas have eyes that are bigger than


---------57:26----------
their plate so what that means is that


---------57:29----------
they usually feel super super hungry but


---------57:31----------
then it doesn't take a whole lot of food


---------57:32----------
to fill them up Gotha is kind of have a


---------57:35----------
pretty stable and steady appetite so do


---------57:37----------
you get filled up easily and feel hungry


---------57:39----------
easily I eat a lot yeah so I think


---------57:45----------
you're predominantly Gotha so but your


---------57:50----------
guff about that and I think the other


---------57:52----------
tricky thing about this is that like I'm


---------57:54----------
not sure


---------57:57----------
because all of this stuff was developed


---------57:59----------
with like Indian people so I don't know


---------58:02----------
how how exactly to translate this stuff


---------58:04----------
to other ethnicities I think a lot of it


---------58:06----------
translates pretty easily like mentally


---------58:08----------
it's fine like I'm really good at


---------58:09----------
picking out someone's mental dosha so


---------58:12----------
other characteristics of gafas or their


---------58:15----------
mind is resilient and also very stable


---------58:18----------
so I know this is gonna sound bizarre to


---------58:20----------
you but your cup your capacity to


---------58:22----------
withstand emotional punishment is


---------58:24----------
actually very very high so like cough I


---------58:27----------
think that before yeah so guffaws have


---------58:29----------
high h peoples that's the other way to


---------58:32----------
think about it so yeah if I want to read


---------58:37----------
up more on this what should i search up


---------58:38----------
um so give me like a week and then I


---------58:41----------
will send you a video about it okay


---------58:44----------
that's me I can actually I can link you


---------58:46----------
a video if you promise not to link it to


---------58:48----------
anyone else because it's a rough draft


---------58:50----------
version but if you're really okay so


---------58:53----------
we're gonna try to make it like look


---------58:54----------
better but if you're really curious


---------58:57----------
so other features so the interesting


---------59:00----------
thing about guffaws is like it's good


---------59:02----------
because they're very resilient may have


---------59:03----------
high HP pools but the downside of gafas


---------59:06----------
is that they also tolerate negative


---------59:08----------
situations for a lot longer than other


---------59:11----------
people would because they can actually


---------59:14----------
just they have high HP pools so they'll


---------59:17----------
like sit in piles of acid or poison for


---------59:19----------
a long period of time because they can


---------59:22----------
handle it and so understanding you know


---------59:25----------
what your though she is is important and


---------59:27----------
basically everything I was kind of


---------59:28----------
telling you about being an emotional


---------59:29----------
sponge comes from Gotham so gafas are


---------59:32----------
also emotional sponges so vodkas tend to


---------59:35----------
get like very very deranged by like the


---------59:38----------
emotions of others like they can get


---------59:39----------
very affected by them and they can't


---------59:42----------
really tolerate them bit those are sort


---------59:43----------
of medium they get somewhat influenced


---------59:46----------
by other people but like not so much


---------59:48----------
they tend to be like a little bit more


---------59:49----------
narcissistic or ambitious they're kind


---------59:51----------
of like fiery so they tend to be


---------59:53----------
argumentative and things like that res


---------59:55----------
guffaws tend to absorb a lot of like if


---------59:57----------
you think about you know the wind like


---------59:59----------
how much like how much can the wind hold


---------60:06----------
not wait I know it's a bizarre question


---------60:09----------
actually yeah like a strong wind could


---------60:13----------
total line but yes sir how much


---------60:16----------
generally not much how much how much can


---------60:19----------
hold way more than wind yeah absolutely


---------60:22----------
right


---------60:23----------
so Gotha and this is why they kind of


---------60:25----------
came up with like gafas being earth and


---------60:27----------
water and Vata being wind it's not like


---------60:30----------
there's actually like wind inside me


---------60:32----------
with what the people did in ancient


---------60:33----------
india is they like looked at different


---------60:35----------
elements and they realize there are


---------60:36----------
certain like qualities to those elements


---------60:39----------
and they use those elements as


---------60:41----------
descriptions to help us understand like


---------60:44----------
certain qualities of people so it's not


---------60:46----------
like we can biopsy you and you're gonna


---------60:48----------
find like earth inside you and you're


---------60:51----------
gonna find wind inside me they kind of


---------60:53----------
so you're kind of stable you're


---------60:54----------
resilient you're absorbent


---------60:56----------
whereas like i'm not absorbent at all


---------60:58----------
like people ask me how can i do this


---------61:00----------
work and it's because i don't absorb any


---------61:02----------
of it because i'm just like the wind


---------61:05----------
so i sit with someone and i feel things


---------61:07----------
very intensely with them and then much


---------61:09----------
like the wind i blow really hard in one


---------61:11----------
direction and then i just stop and then


---------61:13----------
i blow really hard in this direction so


---------61:15----------
i think a lot of people who are confused


---------61:17----------
about why I do this work I'm able to do


---------61:19----------
this work because I'm a Vata so stuff


---------61:22----------
doesn't sit with me because I just I


---------61:24----------
feel things really intensely and then


---------61:26----------
like I just jet like I just let it


---------61:28----------
passes through me right and it's not


---------61:31----------
that it's like good or bad it's not


---------61:32----------
better or worse than yours it's just if


---------61:35----------
you tried to do this work you'd probably


---------61:36----------
not be like a do a very good job at it


---------61:39----------
because they're not it's nothing you


---------61:40----------
wouldn't do a good job it's that you do


---------61:42----------
a different kind of good job whereas


---------61:44----------
like I would I think you'd be like a


---------61:46----------
better like you're probably a better


---------61:47----------
friend than I am because I can I can


---------61:49----------
meet someone and like be super emotional


---------61:52----------
with them for one hour but like people


---------61:54----------
don't stay in my life because I just


---------61:56----------
move on to other things so I'm really


---------61:58----------
good at like brief interactions with


---------62:00----------
people even am I like in my practice


---------62:02----------
like you know a lot of psychiatrists or


---------62:04----------
therapist will see people for years I


---------62:05----------
work with people for like six months and


---------62:07----------
then you know I try to get him better


---------62:09----------
and try to get him out the door


---------62:12----------
and and so you know I mean some people I


---------62:16----------
end up working with for years but a lot


---------62:17----------
of people like they just get better and


---------62:19----------
then I'm like okay well you're better


---------62:20----------
now so wait go live your life man stop


---------62:23----------
showing up here and and so that's


---------62:25----------
because I'm about that because I just


---------62:26----------
you know I get really excited to work


---------62:28----------
with new people and vodkas also have a


---------62:31----------
very tangential thought process so I'm


---------62:33----------
saying all kinds of random [ __ ] to you


---------62:35----------
right now it's not like uniform does


---------62:38----------
that make sense I'm just talking about


---------62:39----------
all kinds of rings yeah anyway sorry


---------62:42----------
yeah so so your predominant door shiz is


---------62:45----------
Gotha certainly mentally and and


---------62:47----------
probably VAT the second and so what that


---------62:50----------
means for you is basically everything


---------62:51----------
we've already said but I want you to


---------62:53----------
think about you know you're so in your


---------62:58----------
worst-case scenario when you're Gotha is


---------63:00----------
really really bad you're gonna feel like


---------63:02----------
mud so when you put water and earth


---------63:05----------
together you're just gonna be sluggish


---------63:07----------
and slow and not want to get out of met


---------63:10----------
bad you're gonna be like this like mud


---------63:12----------
creature instead of like a human right


---------63:15----------
well not creature and there are gonna be


---------63:16----------
other people who are like so like as


---------63:21----------
someone who's a bit though who's a fire


---------63:22----------
person when they get stressed they're


---------63:24----------
gonna be pissed off at everyone and it's


---------63:27----------
like the worse their life it gets the


---------63:29----------
more they take it out on like randomly


---------63:31----------
on other people and they're irritable


---------63:32----------
and angry like you probably don't get


---------63:34----------
very irritable or angry you probably get


---------63:35----------
withdrawn and kind of pulled in and


---------63:37----------
stuff like that and so I stopped moving


---------63:39----------
yeah absolutely yeah so so I think that


---------63:43----------
that's your dough shot that's a great


---------63:45----------
question okay so so we're gonna send


---------63:55----------
some of these questions your way okay


---------63:56----------
Lily yeah go for it see how question for


---------63:59----------
you don't - have you heard of tea


---------64:01----------
Enneagram yeah and graham and a grammar


---------64:05----------
yeah what number are you I don't know I


---------64:08----------
haven't oh I mean I I have a couple of


---------64:12----------
colleagues that use this


---------64:17----------
but I'm not sure I'm not too familiar


---------64:19----------
with it got it got it


---------64:22----------
okay this wandering but all explored I


---------64:24----------
like personality stuff too


---------64:25----------
so one of the things that I'm actually


---------64:26----------
trying to develop for people is like a


---------64:28----------
comprehensive cognitive personality test


---------64:31----------
that's based on like iron meta so it's


---------64:33----------
kind of it's gonna be kind of like


---------64:34----------
myers-briggs but I'm trying to you know


---------64:36----------
I kind of said like you're an emotional


---------64:37----------
sponge so I'm trying to figure out how


---------64:39----------
to like make a test for people to


---------64:41----------
understand their Ayurvedic


---------64:42----------
characteristics mmm yeah


---------64:47----------
so another random example of how


---------64:49----------
different though shows are different so


---------64:51----------
Vata memory is also dosha dependent so


---------64:54----------
vatta's learn things very quickly but


---------64:57----------
they also forget things very quickly bit


---------65:00----------
does kind of learn things at a medium


---------65:01----------
speed and kind of hold on the things at


---------65:03----------
the medium speed and guffaws are


---------65:05----------
actually like kind of slow to pick


---------65:07----------
things up but once they hit their stride


---------65:09----------
they'll be good forever does one of


---------65:13----------
those describe you feel like medium


---------65:20----------
speed what describe me I don't think I


---------65:22----------
learn things quickly or that slowly okay


---------65:25----------
I'm not sure yeah so we all have all


---------65:28----------
three elements within us and they're


---------65:30----------
kind of like at different levels but


---------65:31----------
anyway so here's a question free for you


---------65:38----------
so someone's asking you how do you stop


---------65:40----------
thinking about your ex any ideas


---------65:51----------
time-space you could contact fully well


---------65:55----------
mine was I don't know if this is true


---------65:58----------
for everyone but mine cheated on me so


---------66:01----------
it was easy for me to kind of cut yeah


---------66:04----------
like a bad thing the more time and space


---------66:07----------
you have away from them I think the


---------66:09----------
easier it gets


---------66:10----------
yeah okay yeah that's that's all I can


---------66:13----------
think


---------66:14----------
Haley so just to kind of echo what


---------66:15----------
Lily's saying I want you guys to


---------66:17----------
understand that your mind is going to


---------66:20----------
think about what it gets exposed to


---------66:23----------
right so like if you think about like


---------66:25----------
why did we start talking about Tammy


---------66:27----------
because Tammy was here yeah and Tammy


---------66:30----------
Bart and


---------66:31----------
can be presented and himself yeah he's a


---------66:33----------
boy she's so so she presented herself


---------66:38----------
and so we started thinking about her


---------66:39----------
like if you you know if you watch like


---------66:43----------
twitch and you watch gaming on Twitch


---------66:46----------
and you like watch a game then like


---------66:47----------
you're gonna be more prone to play it


---------66:49----------
because it's gonna be like kind of top


---------66:50----------
of mind for you so in in I think Lily's


---------66:53----------
point is really spot-on that like time


---------66:55----------
and space is very important because you


---------66:57----------
want to decrease the exposure that you


---------67:00----------
have to your ex now the other important


---------67:03----------
part here is that you also need


---------67:04----------
additional exposures because if you


---------67:06----------
don't give your mind something else to


---------67:08----------
focus on it's gonna sit with the


---------67:11----------
thoughts that it has from your ex and


---------67:13----------
you can just me in your room you're


---------67:14----------
gonna be thinking about your ex all the


---------67:15----------
time so the more that you reduce contact


---------67:18----------
and the more that you give your mind to


---------67:20----------
other exposures the less mechanically


---------67:22----------
like your mind will automatically spend


---------67:24----------
less time thinking about it so basically


---------67:27----------
exactly what Lily said so another one


---------67:34----------
for you Lily so you ready to put on your


---------67:36----------
your Zen master hat okay how do you be


---------67:41----------
very happy but still understand it won't


---------67:43----------
last forever


---------67:45----------
um this is my opinion okay I'm just


---------67:51----------
gonna if I if I'm happy and there's a


---------67:54----------
reason to be happy I just want to enjoy


---------67:57----------
it while it's there I mean I think the


---------68:00----------
fact that it's not there forever it


---------68:02----------
makes it even more special and it makes


---------68:04----------
me want to treat it even better does


---------68:07----------
that make sense it's like living freely


---------68:09----------
honestly where I'm gonna die one day


---------68:11----------
but sorry that sounded really weak you


---------68:13----------
know keep going but it's but it's true


---------68:16----------
that we're all living now and I'm happy


---------68:19----------
now so I'm gonna enjoy it while it lasts


---------68:21----------
it's how I feel about living in the


---------68:24----------
content creator house - with all my


---------68:25----------
friends I'm happy now I know it's not


---------68:27----------
going to last so that makes me even more


---------68:29----------
special cuz I know it's temporary yeah


---------68:32----------
beautiful [ __ ] [ __ ] beautiful oh


---------68:36----------
and here I thought that for a moment


---------68:38----------
that that asking you to put your your


---------68:40----------
Zen master hat on would create in you a


---------68:43----------
sense of expectation


---------68:44----------
that would prevent you from accessing


---------68:46----------
your Zen master


---------68:47----------
but you access to your Zen master I


---------68:49----------
completely agree so I want you guys to


---------68:51----------
think about this how do you be very


---------68:52----------
happy but still understand it won't last


---------68:55----------
forever the only way to be really happy


---------68:58----------
is to understand that it's not gonna


---------69:00----------
last forever that's okay right so if if


---------69:05----------
you like if if you think that something


---------69:07----------
is going to last forever and that's what


---------69:09----------
you expect you won't actually be happy


---------69:13----------
happiness exists in the present it


---------69:16----------
doesn't exist in the future and the more


---------69:18----------
that you think about holding on to


---------69:20----------
something the more that you want it to


---------69:23----------
stay this way like like them the less


---------69:25----------
happy you're going to become you're


---------69:27----------
gonna become like a miser who's like you


---------69:30----------
know hoards a bunch of money but never


---------69:32----------
spends it because they want to like be


---------69:34----------
rich and that's not like that's not no


---------69:35----------
way to live life right money is there to


---------69:37----------
be used happiness like these experiences


---------69:39----------
are meant to be enjoyed for what they


---------69:41----------
are in the present now they're not meant


---------69:44----------
to be like you held on to for the future


---------69:48----------
so then the question becomes why do


---------69:50----------
people try to hold on to things that


---------69:53----------
last forever so that's not an issue of


---------69:55----------
happiness it's an issue of security it's


---------69:58----------
an issue of insecurity right why do you


---------70:02----------
need guarantees that something is gonna


---------70:04----------
last forever because you're not


---------70:05----------
confident that you will be able to find


---------70:08----------
happiness without it so if you are


---------70:13----------
trying to make your happiness last


---------70:14----------
forever like you that's just not going


---------70:16----------
to work it's an oxymoron happiness comes


---------70:18----------
from being in the present just like Lily


---------70:20----------
said it's actually the the temporariness


---------70:22----------
of the flower that enhances its beauty


---------70:26----------
it allows us to sit with it fully


---------70:28----------
presently in the moment now and do what


---------70:31----------
it is like appreciate it for what it is


---------70:34----------
and I think that's what I hear from lily


---------70:36----------
is like she's just living like in the


---------70:38----------
present and she understands this stuff


---------70:39----------
isn't gonna last forever so be it but


---------70:42----------
something has changed where she started


---------70:43----------
to be confident about the future and


---------70:45----------
being confident about the future is


---------70:47----------
about being comfortable with yourself


---------70:49----------
today


---------70:50----------
and that's really what I sense from you


---------70:52----------
and that comes that goes back to her


---------70:54----------
acceptance right so she accepts that


---------70:56----------
this is the person that she is and she's


---------70:58----------
not perfect she's emotionally sensitive


---------70:59----------
people are gonna hurt her it still


---------71:01----------
causes her problems but yeah I don't


---------71:03----------
know if you guys can see this but like


---------71:04----------
her acceptance of that is what allows


---------71:07----------
her to treasure that's what allows her


---------71:09----------
to tolerate the transience of the


---------71:12----------
present because she's like accepting it


---------71:15----------
and like that that's what gives her the


---------71:17----------
strength to appreciate and enjoy and


---------71:19----------
love what she has now it was great


---------71:22----------
fantastic okay can we keep going cuz


---------71:28----------
you're doing a great job grace


---------71:30----------
how do you how did you learn how to


---------71:32----------
trust people again I can't imagine how


---------71:34----------
I'd ever convince myself to trust again


---------71:43----------
everything is a risk you only live once


---------71:46----------
and every time I feel when we fall in


---------71:49----------
love with someone you're kind of


---------71:51----------
accepting the fight yeah things can go


---------71:53----------
bad but I don't that's just a risk I'm


---------71:57----------
willing to take [ __ ] it


---------71:59----------
like why not yeah so beautiful I like


---------72:03----------
him he likes me and we're willing to try


---------72:05----------
that's always I mean I guess yeah okay


---------72:08----------
so beautiful so so when she says [ __ ] it


---------72:11----------
there's a Sun script word for that that


---------72:14----------
word is Vairagya and Vairagya means


---------72:17----------
detachment so we've talked about this on


---------72:20----------
stream before what I see Lily doing is


---------72:23----------
not trying to control the outcome of


---------72:26----------
this relationship you acknowledge that


---------72:29----------
there's a risk you acknowledge that


---------72:31----------
failure is an option and yet you give it


---------72:34----------
your all yes right so this is the


---------72:37----------
essence of living in the present this is


---------72:40----------
the essence of focusing on the action


---------72:42----------
instead of the outcome a lot of


---------72:44----------
suffering that people have is because


---------72:46----------
they get caught up in the outcome they


---------72:49----------
only want a relationship if it's gonna


---------72:50----------
last forever they want an a on the test


---------72:52----------
they want to make a million dollars they


---------72:55----------
want to get hired they want to do that


---------72:56----------
it's all about outcomes outcomes


---------72:58----------
outcomes it's about something happening


---------73:00----------
in the external world but here's the


---------73:02----------
crazy thing we actually don't control an


---------73:04----------
of that there is nothing Lily can do to


---------73:07----------
make her relationship successful she


---------73:10----------
can't do it I know it sounds bizarre


---------73:11----------
there's no way that she can control this


---------73:14----------
the outcome of this relationship she


---------73:16----------
can't there's nothing she can do to live


---------73:18----------
happily ever after it's impossible all


---------73:23----------
she can do is live today she can focus


---------73:26----------
on trying to make she can focus on


---------73:28----------
moving her relationship in the direction


---------73:29----------
it needs to go today you can have


---------73:32----------
another conversation to clarify


---------73:33----------
communication so that you guys are


---------73:35----------
better off for tomorrow but there's


---------73:37----------
nothing you can do to control that


---------73:38----------
you're gonna be happily ever after right


---------73:42----------
and I'll kind of say this about my own


---------73:44----------
relationship so I'm really happy for my


---------73:46----------
relationship and I've come to realize


---------73:48----------
how fragile of a thing it is that no


---------73:51----------
amount of years behind us means that


---------73:54----------
we've got it like in the clear that our


---------73:57----------
relationship has new challenges and new


---------73:59----------
stresses and despite loving each other


---------74:02----------
very much that like you know bad [ __ ]


---------74:04----------
can happen in a relationship even if


---------74:06----------
it's a really good relationship and


---------74:07----------
requires constant work you have to focus


---------74:09----------
on on your actions today instead of


---------74:12----------
trying to like secure an outcome for


---------74:14----------
tomorrow and the more that you do that


---------74:17----------
and that's what I hear from really like


---------74:18----------
so Lily's not saying so her ability to


---------74:21----------
be like peaceful in this relationship


---------74:23----------
doesn't come out of her controlling the


---------74:25----------
risk of something bad happening it


---------74:28----------
actually comes from her surrendering to


---------74:30----------
that risk she acknowledges that there's


---------74:34----------
a chance they may this may not work out


---------74:36----------
but you know [ __ ] it I'm gonna try I'm


---------74:38----------
gonna try I'm gonna try so you can't


---------74:43----------
convince yourself to trust people again


---------74:46----------
all you can do is trust people again and


---------74:48----------
understand that you're gonna get hurt


---------74:50----------
you could get hurt but you have to let


---------74:53----------
yourself be willing to embrace the pain


---------74:55----------
and the biggest problem that I see from


---------74:58----------
people that I work with and to a certain


---------75:00----------
degree twitch chat is that people are so


---------75:03----------
then their fear of pain allows them or


---------75:08----------
prevents them from living today they're


---------75:10----------
so concerned about being hurt again that


---------75:13----------
they never engage in a relationship


---------75:14----------
you're stuck Ness comes from a fear


---------75:18----------
of pain about what could happen it


---------75:21----------
doesn't come from actual pain it comes


---------75:22----------
from the hypothetical possibility of


---------75:24----------
pain down the road and so then you won't


---------75:26----------
you won't let yourself trust again


---------75:28----------
you won't open yourself up you won't


---------75:30----------
give yourself over to someone else and


---------75:33----------
let them like give them the potential to


---------75:34----------
hurt you and it's just not how how it


---------75:36----------
works like you're gonna be stuck and


---------75:39----------
what lily has done is say [ __ ] it and


---------75:44----------
she has she has possibly opened herself


---------75:46----------
up to even more hurt than she felt


---------75:48----------
before and also is is enjoying it in the


---------75:53----------
moment right and and you know Lily we're


---------75:58----------
here to support you of things you know


---------75:59----------
if you're struggling in some way by the


---------76:02----------
way just that way but I think it's I


---------76:06----------
have a good feeling about this oh man if


---------76:09----------
it doesn't work out you're the first


---------76:10----------
person I'm gonna mess up septic well


---------76:12----------
they're little you could blame me okay


---------76:16----------
so okay so last question how do you move


---------76:22----------
past the honeymoon phase and continue to


---------76:24----------
make it work we used to have open


---------76:26----------
communications like Lily has has been


---------76:28----------
talking about but he has retreated back


---------76:30----------
into his more loner type shell recently


---------76:32----------
and it's hard to get him to talk talk to


---------76:35----------
me about deeper things anymore I was


---------76:41----------
thinking the same thing I can't relate


---------76:45----------
to this right now yeah it's hard because


---------76:49----------
I mean in the beginning you think yeah


---------76:52----------
we're always going to communicate with


---------76:54----------
each other we're always going to be


---------76:55----------
honest with each other but things can


---------76:57----------
change and that sounds really difficult


---------77:01----------
I'm not I don't know I don't know if I


---------77:03----------
have a good answer for this yeah so so


---------77:05----------
let me try to take a stab at it so I


---------77:09----------
think the first thing is that when


---------77:10----------
people retreat back into their like


---------77:12----------
previous personalities like they're kind


---------77:15----------
of maladaptive personalities there's


---------77:17----------
usually a cause for that right and and I


---------77:21----------
think that trying to understand a little


---------77:24----------
bit about like what has changed in that


---------77:26----------
person's life that's causing them to


---------77:28----------
kind of go back to comfort


---------77:29----------
so the loner type shell is sort of like


---------77:32----------
a comfortable place because he doesn't


---------77:34----------
have to let people in and and he can


---------77:36----------
kind of you know isolate his negative


---------77:38----------
feelings from other people he doesn't


---------77:39----------
want to show anyone he doesn't want to


---------77:41----------
you know he wants to just kind of


---------77:42----------
retreat into himself and um you know I


---------77:46----------
don't know exactly what the gender of


---------77:47----------
the asker is but I'm just gonna assume


---------77:50----------
for a moment that there that she's


---------77:51----------
female and so I think that your ability


---------77:54----------
to like be empathic and recognize that


---------77:58----------
there are deeper things that he's not


---------77:59----------
talking about he may not really


---------78:01----------
understand that right so he may not be


---------78:03----------
able to like put the pieces of the


---------78:05----------
puzzle together in the way that you are


---------78:07----------
that they're deeper things going on and


---------78:09----------
that's why he's retreating he may not


---------78:10----------
understand that he may just think that


---------78:12----------
he's behaving exactly like he used to


---------78:13----------
and the really sad thing about this is


---------78:15----------
that there's not necessarily anything


---------78:17----------
that you can do doesn't mean that you


---------78:19----------
can't do anything but I'm saying like


---------78:22----------
what we're talking about here with Lilly


---------78:24----------
is that you can't control what happens


---------78:26----------
in a relationship you can only try so


---------78:29----------
there's no magic answer here that's


---------78:31----------
going to get him to open up you can


---------78:33----------
certainly try in their conversations


---------78:35----------
that you can have but the first thing


---------78:36----------
that you have to accept is that if you


---------78:38----------
want your communication to go back to


---------78:40----------
the honeymoon phase you can't do that on


---------78:42----------
your own it takes two people and we


---------78:44----------
heard that from Lilly today right so it


---------78:46----------
sounds like the person that we shall not


---------78:48----------
name is also makes a sincere effort to


---------78:53----------
like communicate and be open and and it


---------78:56----------
takes two to communicate so the the best


---------78:59----------
that that I can kind of offer you is to


---------79:02----------
like start by asking an open-ended


---------79:03----------
question so ask your partner like what


---------79:06----------
it like how do you feel about how a


---------79:08----------
relationship is going are there things


---------79:10----------
about it that you're concerned about or


---------79:12----------
the things about it that you're happy


---------79:13----------
about like what what are we doing well


---------79:15----------
and what are we doing not so well and


---------79:17----------
then be transparent with them about


---------79:19----------
saying hey I feel like you're kind of


---------79:21----------
retreating into yourself and that we


---------79:23----------
used to talk a lot more this is the


---------79:26----------
really tricky thing once you say


---------79:28----------
something like that they're gonna get


---------79:29----------
defensive and the main thing that you


---------79:31----------
have want to do is disarm that defensive


---------79:33----------
miss in the way you disarm that


---------79:35----------
defensiveness is by making it an us


---------79:37----------
issue and not a you issue right so


---------79:40----------
instead of saying you're retreating into


---------79:41----------
your loner shell can you please change


---------79:43----------
say like hey what's going on like how


---------79:46----------
can we understand like I used to feel


---------79:48----------
more connected to you and I'm having


---------79:50----------
trouble like feeling that way can you


---------79:53----------
help me understand like how how can I


---------79:56----------
feel like I don't know if it's on me


---------79:57----------
right because this could be on you too


---------80:00----------
it may not be that he's a loner it may


---------80:01----------
just be that you're suddenly like more


---------80:04----------
needing more emotional support and maybe


---------80:06----------
you're the one that's changed so


---------80:08----------
acknowledge that possibility to them and


---------80:10----------
just acknowledge that you feel like we


---------80:12----------
used to commit communicate a lot more


---------80:14----------
and you feel like we're not


---------80:16----------
communicating as much and then ask your


---------80:19----------
partner what they think about that and


---------80:20----------
what can the two of you do about that


---------80:21----------
together is there something that you're


---------80:24----------
saying that causes him to retreat or is


---------80:27----------
he frustrated by things but just make it


---------80:28----------
about us this is the big thing big big


---------80:31----------
big big thing and this is why I'm also


---------80:32----------
optimistic about lily is because it


---------80:35----------
sounds like the relationship is a


---------80:37----------
two-way street it's it's not about two


---------80:40----------
individuals in a relationship the


---------80:42----------
relationship becomes the unit it's not


---------80:45----------
no longer about me and you it's about us


---------80:47----------
and we and the more that you kind of


---------80:49----------
frame things towards like that I think


---------80:51----------
the less you'll disarm defensiveness got


---------80:56----------
it


---------80:59----------
alright last thoughts or questions Louie


---------81:05----------
no this was a nice conversation yeah I


---------81:08----------

---------81:11----------
