---------00:00----------
and then that's all you need and then


---------00:01----------
like just be straight with her because


---------00:02----------
if if this is what you're doing the


---------00:04----------
whole time if you're just going like


---------00:05----------
this like hey hey hey hey hey that's


---------00:14----------
[ __ ] creepy right


---------00:16----------
so like flirting too much is like how


---------00:18----------
you become a creep


---------00:23----------
so the first question comes from Andrew


---------00:26----------
H I have difficulty meeting women and I


---------00:28----------
feel like I want to curb my sexual


---------00:30----------
desire because that's something I can't


---------00:32----------
have even though I still want it also I


---------00:35----------
know that focusing on my life and


---------00:37----------
improving myself for better pathways to


---------00:38----------
finding a relationship I just get the


---------00:41----------
feeling that if I just focus on myself


---------00:42----------
all the time then I will miss avoid


---------00:44----------
opportunities that come up how would you


---------00:47----------
suggest to reconcile those two feelings


---------00:51----------
also most of the social events outings I


---------00:54----------
attend are mostly male-dominated on the


---------00:57----------
other hand the things that I do go go


---------00:59----------
too with women I end up focusing on the


---------01:01----------
event and enjoying myself do you think


---------01:03----------
you could shed any light on my situation


---------01:06----------
talk about a good question okay so let's


---------01:11----------
just think about this for a second okay


---------01:13----------
so the first thing that he's saying is


---------01:17----------
so it sounds like Andrews done his


---------01:19----------
homework right so there's a common sense


---------01:21----------
so if you're interested in meeting let's


---------01:24----------
just assume a heterosexual relationship


---------01:26----------
where we're thinking from the


---------01:27----------
perspective of the man for a moment so


---------01:30----------
if you're a dude who's interested in


---------01:31----------
meeting women one of the most common


---------01:33----------
pieces of advice is that you should just


---------01:35----------
focus on yourself and like the women


---------01:37----------
will come I think that's a really great


---------01:39----------
attitude and we'll talk a little bit


---------01:42----------
about why that is but I think Andrews


---------01:45----------
question is really good because he's you


---------01:47----------
know he's done some research and he's


---------01:48----------
sort of found out that okay like for


---------01:50----------
example he goes to an event and he just


---------01:52----------
ends up like trying to enjoy himself and


---------01:54----------
what he's heard is that unless you know


---------01:57----------
if you just focus on yourself and you


---------01:59----------
you try to have a good time that like


---------02:01----------
the women will come and then he's doing


---------02:03----------
that he's like dude where are the women


---------02:04----------
I was promised the women like where are


---------02:06----------
the women I'm focusing on myself I'm not


---------02:08----------
chasing after people I'm not being a


---------02:10----------
nice guy there's no one itis you know


---------02:14----------
that that's the like I was promised


---------02:17----------
women so he's trying to figure out how


---------02:20----------
can i reconcile finding a relationship


---------02:24----------
and looking for a relationship with sort


---------02:27----------
of this idea of just focusing on


---------02:29----------
yourself and I think that's in a weird


---------02:32----------
way there's there's no simple answer


---------02:35----------
there except that it's a balance between


---------02:37----------
the two so I think the reason that


---------02:41----------
people say that you should focus on


---------02:43----------
yourself is because a lot of dudes focus


---------02:46----------
too much on a relationship right and


---------02:49----------
what happens is they start to invest


---------02:51----------
their time in a particular person so


---------02:54----------
let's talk a little bit about nice guys


---------02:57----------
in the friend zone and like how guys end


---------02:59----------
up in the friend zone so the friend zone


---------03:02----------
starts with a lack of confidence so if


---------03:05----------
you're interested in a woman and you're


---------03:08----------
afraid that if you ask her out she's


---------03:10----------
gonna say no you exhibit some degree of


---------03:13----------
avoidance oh you don't put yourself out


---------03:15----------
there you don't ask her out and then


---------03:17----------
you're kind of afraid that like she's


---------03:20----------
gonna


---------03:20----------
nooo so like what do you do in that


---------03:22----------
situation you want to increase your


---------03:24----------
chances of her saying yes and how do you


---------03:27----------
do that like you do nice stuff for her


---------03:29----------
right so if you can get her to like you


---------03:31----------
more then when you ask her out she's


---------03:34----------
more likely to say yes it's completely


---------03:36----------
logical so you start to invest in the


---------03:38----------
relationship you start to pick her up


---------03:41----------
from the airport you start


---------03:44----------
help her out when she's sick you bring


---------03:47----------
her chicken soup you help her with her


---------03:50----------
homework and then there's like the most


---------03:52----------
dreaded thing which is that like you


---------03:54----------
listen to her when she you know is


---------03:58----------
bitching about the dudes that she's


---------03:59----------
dating and then like if you get like


---------04:02----------
really deep into it and you really lose


---------04:04----------
sight of all perspective then you do


---------04:07----------
things like get her flowers on


---------04:08----------
Valentine's Day as a friend


---------04:11----------
right yes I'm at the Stromer saying you


---------04:14----------
powerlevel her in mmo's


---------04:15----------
abso-fucking-lutely


---------04:17----------
that's it right so you invest and the


---------04:20----------
idea here is in your mind there's a part


---------04:22----------
of your mind that says she's gonna turn


---------04:24----------
me down if I say no if I ask her out


---------04:26----------
so what can I do to like increase the


---------04:28----------
chances of her liking how can I


---------04:30----------
demonstrate my value to her and you


---------04:33----------
invest in the relationship you invest in


---------04:35----------
the relationship and you invest in the


---------04:36----------
relationship and then one day your love


---------04:39----------
reaches a critical mass and you confess


---------04:41----------
your love for her right it's not you


---------04:42----------
don't ask her out like you confess your


---------04:44----------
love like that's it apples and oranges


---------04:46----------
the scenario that we're talking about is


---------04:48----------
that your love and the tension around


---------04:50----------
that love Rises and Rises and Rises and


---------04:53----------
then there's a confession there's I've


---------04:55----------
loved you like a goddamn anime you


---------04:59----------
confess your love for her and not what


---------05:02----------
happens as she says the dreaded words I


---------05:05----------
think of you like a friend I don't think


---------05:08----------
of you that right and so then what does


---------05:11----------
that do to your confidence it knocks


---------05:14----------
your confidence down a peg


---------05:16----------
and so you kind of get over it you meet


---------05:19----------
another girl


---------05:21----------
and then your confidence is even lower


---------05:25----------
so as you enter the second relationship


---------05:28----------
you feel like you have to invest more


---------05:30----------
because the problem was that you didn't


---------05:32----------
do enough for her you didn't demonstrate


---------05:34----------
your value you didn't get her to see


---------05:35----------
that that


---------05:37----------
you didn't like show her how caring you


---------05:39----------
are so you kind of double down on your


---------05:41----------
strategy and then you like go back to


---------05:43----------
like doing even more stuff for her


---------05:48----------
and so that cycle repeats itself and


---------05:50----------
each time you get rejected you feel less


---------05:52----------
confident


---------05:54----------
and then you


---------05:57----------
feel like you have to do a lot more


---------05:58----------
stuff to win her over and then at some


---------06:01----------
point these people get so frustrated


---------06:03----------
that they like go to the Internet and


---------06:05----------
then someone tells them or like friends


---------06:06----------
they tell them hey man like stop


---------06:07----------
investing all your time and women just


---------06:09----------
invest your time in yourself like just


---------06:12----------
go to the gym work out take care of


---------06:14----------
yourself and then as confidence Rises


---------06:16----------
because you're taking care of yourself


---------06:17----------
and it becomes easier to


---------06:21----------
ask women out so like that's where the


---------06:23----------
conundrum comes from right like do you


---------06:24----------
chase after women or do you invest in


---------06:27----------
yourself and I think that the simple


---------06:29----------
answer is like it's got to be a little


---------06:31----------
bit of both right because I think what


---------06:33----------
what Andrew H I unfortunately is


---------06:36----------
discovering is that just because you


---------06:37----------
start investing in yourself doesn't mean


---------06:39----------
that women start throwing themselves at


---------06:40----------
you in this this this is a brutal truth


---------06:43----------
that especially people who are doctors


---------06:45----------
realize like like a bunch of my buddies


---------06:47----------
from med school they're kind of thinking


---------06:49----------
like oh you know like chicks dig doctors


---------06:51----------
so once I've become a doctor I'm gonna


---------06:54----------
have to beat them off with a stick and


---------06:56----------
they become a doctor and then suddenly


---------07:02----------
nothing happens


---------07:05----------
that's just and they're surprised so I


---------07:08----------
think what you've got to do is something


---------07:09----------
in the middle right so like understand


---------07:11----------
that investing in a particular


---------07:12----------
relationship with the hope that she's


---------07:15----------
going to fall in love with you is


---------07:17----------
generally speaking a mistake


---------07:20----------
and just waiting for women to come along


---------07:23----------
or the gender that you're attracted to


---------07:25----------
to just come along and be amazed by it


---------07:28----------
how amazing you are is also going to


---------07:32----------
fail so instead if you meet a girl I


---------07:36----------
think you should be authentic with her


---------07:38----------
and generally speaking what women find


---------07:40----------
creepy is not just like is not you


---------07:43----------
asking them out but just you know like


---------07:46----------
is like when you kind of you flirt and


---------07:49----------
you're kind of like unclear or you're


---------07:52----------
you you like nag them and all that other


---------07:54----------
[ __ ] that people swear by on on like the


---------07:56----------
red pill and the pickup artist forums


---------08:00----------
and things like that


---------08:01----------
you just like treat them like a human


---------08:03----------
being and you say like you walk up to


---------08:04----------
them you say hey


---------08:08----------
are things going like


---------08:11----------
I've really enjoyed being in class with


---------08:13----------
you even past couple of weeks and I'd


---------08:15----------
like to get to know you better


---------08:16----------
are you interested in grabbing dinner


---------08:19----------
sometime


---------08:21----------
and that's it and then if you want to


---------08:24----------
you can even throw in a little bit of


---------08:25----------
flirt right like you can


---------08:27----------
like you'll grab dinner sometime that's


---------08:30----------
all it takes


---------08:33----------
I see that you guys want to see how well


---------08:36----------
that works you guys should watch the


---------08:37----------
interview with Anna


---------08:39----------
right did you guys wear you guys like


---------08:41----------
are you guys there and we can we get a


---------08:43----------
clip of that


---------08:44----------
[Music]


---------08:47----------
I'm pretty sure that there was a


---------08:50----------
so I mean you can be flirtatious we can


---------08:53----------
we can teach you how to flirt


---------08:55----------
like you guys see that right like the


---------08:57----------
facial expression we played this game


---------08:58----------
before like the facial expression game


---------09:00----------
but it's like hey


---------09:03----------
I don't


---------09:05----------
that's all it takes okay it's not hard


---------09:09----------
you don't have to you don't have to have


---------09:10----------
a long speech like you know just


---------09:15----------
yeah like you know it's and and you


---------09:17----------
don't want to overdo it right it just


---------09:19----------
you need just a little bit of it


---------09:22----------
and and then that's all you need and


---------09:26----------
then like just be straight with her


---------09:27----------
because if if this is what you're doing


---------09:29----------
the whole time if you're just going like


---------09:30----------
this like hey hey hey hey hey hey that's


---------09:39----------
[ __ ] creepy right


---------09:41----------
so like flirting too much is like how


---------09:43----------
you become a creep like just a little


---------09:46----------
bit of flirt a lot of authenticity and


---------09:49----------
then move on I think that's what you got


---------09:52----------
to do and so what I would tell Andrew


---------09:55----------
h-i is like yeah you should continue


---------09:57----------
like investing in yourself


---------09:59----------
and


---------10:01----------
like just you know focus on yourself but


---------10:03----------
if you see a girl that you're attracted


---------10:06----------
to or a dude that you can throw in a


---------10:10----------
little bit of flirt and a lot of the


---------10:12----------
flirt is in the eyebrows like flirting


---------10:14----------
comes from confidence and stuff like


---------10:15----------
that right and then


---------10:18----------
and then just ask about be authentic


---------10:24----------
[Music]


---------10:29----------
yeah so I mean the other simple thing


---------10:32----------
that Andrew is is is not doing if we


---------10:36----------
listen to his questions this doesn't


---------10:37----------
sound he like he's actually asking women


---------10:39----------
out right like like I'm just gonna read


---------10:42----------
this to you again but um I have I have


---------10:46----------
difficulty meeting women and I feel like


---------10:47----------
I want to curb my sexual desire because


---------10:49----------
that's something I can't have even


---------10:51----------
though I still want it so that also is a


---------10:53----------
whole different complex like I I mean


---------10:54----------
curve your sexual desire in terms of you


---------10:57----------
know don't be it sexually inappropriate


---------10:59----------
with people but if you have sexual


---------11:00----------
desire that's fine I think it's fine to


---------11:02----------
you know want to be sexually active with


---------11:05----------
someone or with in general or with


---------11:08----------
someone also I know that focusing on my


---------11:10----------
life in improving myself or better what


---------11:12----------
pathways to finding relationship I just


---------11:13----------
get the feeling that if I focus on


---------11:15----------
myself all the time then I will miss


---------11:16----------
avoid opportunities that come up that's


---------11:18----------
absolutely true so you don't want to


---------11:19----------
focus on yourself all the time you want


---------11:22----------
to focus on yourself for most of the


---------11:23----------
time and when you go to an event where


---------11:24----------
there's a woman that you're attracted to


---------11:26----------
like even if you've never met her you


---------11:28----------
can just walk up to her at the end of


---------11:29----------
the event and say hey you know I'm at


---------11:32----------
this event and I'm here to just have a


---------11:35----------
good time with my buddies but to be


---------11:37----------
completely honest I just cannot like I


---------11:39----------
keep on looking at you and I'm sorry but


---------11:42----------
I was just wondering is there any way


---------11:43----------
that I could buy you dinner sometime


---------11:47----------
and then even if she shoots you down


---------11:50----------
like you know she's gonna smile and you


---------11:52----------
know she's gonna laugh


---------11:54----------
and let your ego just take a dose of


---------11:57----------
that right because like even if she


---------11:59----------
turns you down she's gonna feel amazing


---------12:01----------
and you can feel amazing we're letting


---------12:04----------
her feel amazing if you're not [ __ ]


---------12:06----------
caught up in your head


---------12:13----------
yeah


---------12:16----------
so it it sounds it sounds like I'm just


---------12:22----------
tapping in a twitch chat for a second


---------12:30----------
and so I'm confused about whether people


---------12:33----------
want dating advice or they want to date


---------12:35----------
me


---------12:43----------
how do you work up the courage to do


---------12:45----------
that you know what is courage like what


---------12:48----------
do you mean courage


---------12:51----------
but what are you afraid of


---------12:54----------
right like what are you afraid of that


---------12:56----------
she's gonna say no what there's a decent


---------12:59----------
chance she's gonna say no


---------13:03----------
like this is something so if you guys


---------13:05----------
are having trouble meeting women you


---------13:06----------
guys got to come on stream and we got to


---------13:08----------
talk about this


---------13:10----------
because like your you're so afraid of


---------13:12----------
the possible outcome that you're not


---------13:16----------
willing to even try like that's the


---------13:18----------
problem


---------13:20----------
like what are you afraid of that she's


---------13:22----------
gonna say no like you're gonna that's


---------13:24----------
fine like why isn't it okay for her to


---------13:28----------
say no


---------13:31----------
and this is where like you have to think


---------13:32----------
a little bit about how you view yourself


---------13:34----------
right so you're afraid that you're not


---------13:37----------
worth dating and so since you try to


---------13:40----------
keep that fear of your lack of value as


---------13:43----------
a partner at bay you try to like put


---------13:45----------
your head in the sand and if you get any


---------13:47----------
sort of external evidence to support the


---------13:49----------
idea that you're not worth dating then


---------13:51----------
that's too much for you to bear


---------13:55----------
so like if you want to be like this all


---------13:57----------
has to if you're having trouble asking


---------13:59----------
women out like you've got to stop and


---------14:00----------
think a little bit about yourself and


---------14:02----------
think like what do i how do you feel


---------14:05----------
about yourself do you feel like you're


---------14:08----------
worthwhile today do you think like


---------14:09----------
you're a worthy person to date


---------14:15----------
like


---------14:17----------
what what is the answer to that question


---------14:20----------
I think that's what we really have to


---------14:21----------
dig into like why do you feel like


---------14:23----------
you're not worthy of dating because if


---------14:26----------
you feel like you're worthy of dating


---------14:27----------
you should be comfortable enough to ask


---------14:28----------
someone out and you just acknowledge


---------14:30----------
that you know chances are like like


---------14:32----------
let's say 50 60 % of women are in


---------14:35----------
relationships


---------14:37----------
forty percent I don't know I don't know


---------14:38----------
what the number is and if they're in


---------14:41----------
relationships like there's a decent


---------14:42----------
chance they're gonna say no but what I


---------14:44----------
want you to do when you ask a girl out


---------14:45----------
is like I want you to watch her face and


---------14:47----------
then ask yourself did I make her feel


---------14:50----------
good by asking her out because this is


---------14:53----------
an important thing because if your


---------14:54----------
[ __ ] creeper and you pay attention to


---------14:56----------
them then you're gonna see that you


---------14:59----------
didn't make them feel good and that's a


---------15:00----------
problem


---------15:03----------
should know that


---------15:08----------
and if you did like even if she turns


---------15:10----------
you down like if you make her feel good


---------15:11----------
like that's you know that's fine


---------15:16----------
you could that's okay like you made her


---------15:19----------
feel good like what that means is that


---------15:21----------
if she was available like if you made


---------15:22----------
one girl like like feel appreciated and


---------15:25----------
you made her feel attractive by asking


---------15:28----------
her out like you can do that again just


---------15:30----------
get out of your own head


---------15:34----------
all right moving on to the next question
