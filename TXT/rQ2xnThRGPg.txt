---------00:00----------
so this stream is going to be kind of


---------00:02----------
interesting because i think that


---------00:03----------
for those of you that are like


---------00:05----------
relatively familiar with our work and


---------00:06----------
have questions about ayurveda i think


---------00:08----------
it's going to be fantastic


---------00:10----------
and for those of you who don't really


---------00:12----------
know too much about ayurveda you may be


---------00:14----------
a little bit lost


---------00:16----------
so um you know one of the challenges


---------00:18----------
that we have is that we'll


---------00:20----------
teach a little bit about ayurveda but


---------00:22----------
ayurveda is like it's a


---------00:23----------
big system right so it's a system that's


---------00:25----------
been developed for thousands of years


---------00:28----------
if you want to understand ayurveda from


---------00:29----------
start to finish it's like a five-year


---------00:31----------
education like full-time medical


---------00:33----------
education and that's just


---------00:35----------
the end of school right so then you


---------00:36----------
start to practice and you learn a lot


---------00:38----------
about nuances and things like that


---------00:40----------
so we introduce ayurveda um you know in


---------00:43----------
a basic way and there's like a lot more


---------00:45----------
information about it in dr k's guide


---------00:48----------
but i thought what we would do today is


---------00:50----------
actually like


---------00:51----------
explain some of the more detailed or


---------00:53----------
nuanced things


---------00:54----------
because a lot of the way that i talk


---------00:56----------
about ayurveda is very simplified


---------00:58----------
and may also be incorrect to be blunt


---------01:00----------
because


---------01:01----------
i'm not actually a trained ayurvedic


---------01:02----------
physician i'm someone who


---------01:04----------
started studying ayurveda at the age of


---------01:06----------
21 studied it sort of like informally


---------01:09----------
and then you know i've studied it for a


---------01:11----------
long time but i'm essentially an amateur


---------01:14----------
the interesting the cool thing about


---------01:15----------
being an amateur is that there's a lot


---------01:17----------
of traditional


---------01:18----------
there's a lot of stuff in ayurveda that


---------01:19----------
has become like shaped


---------01:21----------
over time um and they've actually


---------01:24----------
like lost sight of like a lot of it so


---------01:27----------
the biggest example of this is like


---------01:28----------
psychiatry and mental health


---------01:30----------
so if you look at ayurveda there's to my


---------01:32----------
knowledge really only one ayurvedic


---------01:34----------
hospital


---------01:35----------
in india anyway and arguably the world


---------01:38----------
that specializes in psychiatry i've only


---------01:41----------
been able to find one there may be more


---------01:43----------
um so so it's kind of interesting


---------01:45----------
because like even if you look at some of


---------01:46----------
the old texts on ayurveda


---------01:49----------
that you know two of the major texts on


---------01:52----------
ayurveda


---------01:54----------
will sort of acknowledge that when they


---------01:56----------
were written there were like


---------01:58----------
ayurvedic psychiatrists and that if you


---------02:00----------
want to learn


---------02:02----------
about that branch you should read this


---------02:05----------
third dude's text


---------02:07----------
the challenge is that it appears that


---------02:09----------
that third dude's


---------02:11----------
text has been sort of like lost over


---------02:13----------
time


---------02:14----------
so i think that there's a lot of room


---------02:16----------
for development


---------02:17----------
of ayurvedic perspectives on mental


---------02:20----------
health


---------02:20----------
and there's another kind of important


---------02:22----------
reason why the ayurvedic perspective on


---------02:24----------
mental health is like a little bit


---------02:25----------
lacking


---------02:26----------
is that mental health and like the way


---------02:28----------
that the mind work


---------02:29----------
works was actually more traditionally


---------02:31----------
like a part of yoga


---------02:32----------
as opposed to the system of medicine so


---------02:35----------
this is kind of like thinking about you


---------02:37----------
know we have psychology


---------02:38----------
and we have psychiatry and psychology is


---------02:41----------
like


---------02:41----------
a basic science uh that


---------02:44----------
studies the mind and psychiatry is a


---------02:47----------
branch of medicine right so it's about


---------02:49----------
the application


---------02:50----------
and pathology of the mind and so in that


---------02:53----------
same way


---------02:54----------
in the eastern system you had the


---------02:55----------
ayurvedic folks who were medical


---------02:57----------
professionals


---------02:58----------
and then you had the yogis who were like


---------03:00----------
sort of the basic science here's how the


---------03:02----------
mind works


---------03:03----------
so a lot of what we would call ayurvedic


---------03:05----------
psychiatry is actually


---------03:06----------
found in like yogic texts


---------03:10----------
so this is kind of all a roundabout way


---------03:12----------
of saying


---------03:13----------
you know i think that what i'm talking


---------03:16----------
about has some merit and at the same


---------03:18----------
time


---------03:19----------
you know i'm i'm not actually like


---------03:20----------
formally trained in it


---------03:22----------
so you got to take it with a grain of


---------03:24----------
salt okay


---------03:26----------
so let's kind of start off with this so


---------03:28----------
we saw


---------03:29----------
so our structure today is going to be


---------03:30----------
we're going to look at a couple of


---------03:32----------
reddit posts and i love these reddit


---------03:33----------
posts because


---------03:34----------
you know i think they speak to


---------03:36----------
deficiencies


---------03:37----------
in what we've explained so far so like


---------03:40----------
sometimes when we'll teach about art


---------03:41----------
because i do simplify things there's


---------03:43----------
like a lot of people who are like


---------03:45----------
wait but there's stuff missing here and


---------03:46----------
you're absolutely right


---------03:48----------
so there's absolute deficiencies in what


---------03:51----------
we've shared with you there may even be


---------03:52----------
deficiencies in my learning i'm not sure


---------03:54----------
which one


---------03:55----------
is you know more accurate but so today


---------03:58----------
what we're going to do is like do a


---------04:00----------
deeper dive into like


---------04:02----------
a couple of subtle concepts around


---------04:04----------
ayurvedic doshas


---------04:05----------
and more importantly we're going to


---------04:06----------
explain like doshik combinations


---------04:09----------
okay and and the way that we're going to


---------04:11----------
kind of explain this stuff


---------04:12----------
is going to be like actually more from


---------04:14----------
like a corporate consulting standpoint


---------04:16----------
so one of the things that i do is


---------04:18----------
corporate consulting


---------04:20----------
so i'll go to a company and i'll teach


---------04:22----------
them about ayurveda because the basic


---------04:24----------
idea


---------04:25----------
that i'll share with them is that you


---------04:27----------
know not all people are the same


---------04:28----------
and if you look at western psychology


---------04:30----------
like western psychology i know it sounds


---------04:32----------
kind of weird


---------04:32----------
but sort of has the assumption that all


---------04:34----------
people are the same


---------04:36----------
so if you look at like psychiatry they


---------04:38----------
will diagnose a person with depression


---------04:41----------
and the depression is a disease that is


---------04:43----------
independent of the person


---------04:45----------
right if you look at like something like


---------04:47----------
cancer like cancer is an


---------04:48----------
independent process that can affect


---------04:51----------
people


---------04:51----------
but is not intertwined with the person


---------04:54----------
and so we've taken that medical aspect


---------04:57----------
which also has to do with like you know


---------04:58----------
was informed like our system of


---------05:00----------
science and medicine was heavily


---------05:02----------
informed by things like um


---------05:03----------
you know microbiology where there's like


---------05:05----------
an agent that causes an


---------05:07----------
infection and the agent is independent


---------05:10----------
of the person


---------05:11----------
and we took that idea of like disease is


---------05:14----------
an


---------05:14----------
independent process uh that we found in


---------05:17----------
western medici


---------05:19----------
like sorry physical medicine and we also


---------05:22----------
applied that paradigm to psychology and


---------05:24----------
psychiatry


---------05:25----------
where we said anxiety is an independent


---------05:28----------
process


---------05:28----------
you are you and the anxiety is over here


---------05:30----------
and the anxiety affects you


---------05:32----------
the two are not actually intertwined so


---------05:34----------
ayurveda is a little bit different and


---------05:36----------
ayurveda says that you can't have a


---------05:38----------
disease


---------05:39----------
outside of a person that there are


---------05:41----------
specific


---------05:42----------
aspects of your dorsi balance which will


---------05:46----------
affect the way that the disease


---------05:48----------
manifests within you


---------05:51----------
and there's some really interesting


---------05:53----------
support for this scientific hypothesis i


---------05:55----------
mean this ayurvedic hypothesis


---------05:57----------
so for example if you look at like the


---------05:58----------
way that we diagnose depression they're


---------06:00----------
essentially three types of depression


---------06:03----------
and like this is like according to


---------06:04----------
western science okay


---------06:06----------
there is an anxious depression which is


---------06:09----------
like


---------06:09----------
depression that's characterized by


---------06:11----------
insomnia


---------06:12----------
restlessness fidgeting rumination


---------06:16----------
a lot of thoughts and then there's a


---------06:18----------
neuro-vegetative depression which is


---------06:20----------
characterized by


---------06:21----------
hypersomnia weight gain low energy


---------06:24----------
difficulty moving and like thoughts that


---------06:27----------
sort of


---------06:28----------
aren't all over the place but focus on


---------06:30----------
one thing in sort of a sluggish


---------06:32----------
and rigid way and it's kind of weird


---------06:34----------
because literally if you look at the


---------06:36----------
diagnostic criteria for


---------06:38----------
depression it can include weight loss


---------06:42----------
or weight gain hypersomnia


---------06:45----------
or insomnia and not moving a whole lot


---------06:48----------
or moving too much and if you just kind


---------06:50----------
of think about it logically like


---------06:52----------
those sound like opposite ends of


---------06:55----------
manifestations right like


---------06:57----------
it's not like you get you know back pain


---------06:59----------
and back pleasure


---------07:00----------
as part of rheumatoid arthritis it's not


---------07:02----------
like you get


---------07:03----------
you know fever and hypothermia is part


---------07:06----------
of an infection


---------07:08----------
you know usually it's like it's kind of


---------07:09----------
bizarre but like two polar opposites are


---------07:12----------
not the same disease


---------07:13----------
like it's kind of like so simple but


---------07:15----------
that's the way that our western medicine


---------07:17----------
has evolved


---------07:18----------
and there's a third lesser known type of


---------07:20----------
depression


---------07:21----------
which is called depression with anger


---------07:23----------
attacks so these are people that like


---------07:25----------
experience depression but they their


---------07:28----------
primary manifestation is actually


---------07:30----------
like irritability and like anger so they


---------07:32----------
don't necessarily feel


---------07:34----------
sad but what they do is feel like


---------07:36----------
incredible incredible amounts of


---------07:37----------
frustration


---------07:38----------
and it's also really interesting because


---------07:39----------
if you look at pediatric presentations


---------07:42----------
and adolescent presentations of


---------07:44----------
depression


---------07:45----------
it appears that in pediatric populations


---------07:47----------
depression doesn't manifest as


---------07:50----------
sadness it manifests as moodiness and


---------07:52----------
irritability


---------07:54----------
so it's kind of interesting because even


---------07:55----------
in western science we're sort of


---------07:56----------
figuring out okay there are these three


---------07:58----------
types of depressions but the really


---------08:02----------
fascinating thing is ayurveda actually


---------08:03----------
says that if you take an


---------08:05----------
independent disease process and you plug


---------08:07----------
it into a person


---------08:08----------
you will manifest in three different


---------08:11----------
ways depending on what the person's


---------08:13----------
contribution is okay so when i go to a


---------08:15----------
corporation i'll say like hey


---------08:17----------
i can teach your staff to be healthier


---------08:19----------
and like


---------08:20----------
work with each other more harmoniously


---------08:23----------
and the way that i can teach all that is


---------08:24----------
by teaching you about ayurveda because


---------08:26----------
it'll help you understand


---------08:28----------
your temperament and once you understand


---------08:30----------
your temperament the way that your mot


---------08:32----------
your individual mind functions it will


---------08:34----------
become clear


---------08:35----------
why there is workplace conflict because


---------08:37----------
you'll have a vata who doesn't like


---------08:39----------
structure and likes to innovate


---------08:41----------
and likes to you know explore and you'll


---------08:43----------
have a kapha who's like


---------08:45----------
no no no we need like structure like we


---------08:47----------
have processes for a reason


---------08:49----------
we are organized for a reason like like


---------08:51----------
when you stick to the processes when you


---------08:53----------
get the best


---------08:54----------
result and the vata is like let's go


---------08:56----------
let's figure it out we'll figure it out


---------08:57----------
don't worry man like why are you so


---------08:59----------
stuck up


---------08:59----------
bro like what's going on and the kapha


---------09:01----------
is like oh my god


---------09:03----------
okay so you'll get a lot of like a


---------09:05----------
workplace conflict because of


---------09:07----------
uh differences so what we're gonna do


---------09:11----------
is is


---------09:14----------
yeah so anyone can be a bully so we're


---------09:16----------
gonna do is actually start


---------09:17----------
with um taking a look at um a couple of


---------09:20----------
posts


---------09:21----------
okay and then what we're going to do is


---------09:24----------
explain a little bit more about like how


---------09:27----------
to approach


---------09:28----------
vata pitta and kapha from sort of like a


---------09:30----------
workplace setting


---------09:32----------
um and then what we'll do is like think


---------09:34----------
a little bit about like workplace


---------09:35----------
temperaments and job roles


---------09:37----------
as they relate to combinations because


---------09:40----------
people will ask like if i'm a vata kafa


---------09:42----------
then what do i do and so we'll sort of


---------09:44----------
look at different job roles in which


---------09:45----------
those kinds of people


---------09:47----------
tend to operate well and then lastly


---------09:50----------
we'll kind of explore explore a couple


---------09:52----------
of nuances of doshas


---------09:54----------
and then we'll have a meditation


---------09:56----------
technique which is sort of related to


---------09:58----------
ayurveda towards the end okay um so one


---------10:01----------
last thing about science okay for a


---------10:03----------
second


---------10:04----------
so i gotta say this so at the beginning


---------10:07----------
of what i'm gonna explain to you guys


---------10:09----------
it is very scientifically valid the


---------10:12----------
further we go


---------10:13----------
in today's teaching the more we're gonna


---------10:16----------
leave science behind


---------10:17----------
okay so it's we're gonna start like very


---------10:19----------
scientifically grounded and i'll


---------10:21----------
show you all a couple of papers which


---------10:22----------
i've shown before and then like the more


---------10:24----------
that we get towards the corporate


---------10:26----------
consulting side i want you all to


---------10:27----------
understand there have not been


---------10:29----------
studies about the specificity of what


---------10:32----------
i'm teaching


---------10:33----------
it's anecdotally very useful people love


---------10:35----------
it people get better i've certainly


---------10:37----------
loved it i think there is science there


---------10:39----------
but the studies have not reached that


---------10:41----------
point right we're at the very


---------10:43----------
basic level of studying ayurveda


---------10:45----------
scientifically and it's been incredibly


---------10:47----------
fascinating


---------10:48----------
but the closer we get to application the


---------10:51----------
more we're going to leave the solid


---------10:53----------
foundation of evidence and sort of


---------10:55----------
extrapolate from the evidence to come up


---------10:57----------
with theories and conclusions


---------10:59----------
but a lot of the stuff that i'm gonna


---------11:00----------
teach y'all towards the end some of it


---------11:02----------
has been actually verified through


---------11:04----------
some personality assessments and things


---------11:06----------
like that but


---------11:07----------
really we're gonna like leave the


---------11:08----------
evidence behind and it's gonna be a lot


---------11:10----------
more like clinically focused


---------11:12----------
okay so um you know just i


---------11:16----------
want to just toss out that disclaimer


---------11:17----------
okay questions


---------11:19----------
yeah so one of the things that we try to


---------11:22----------
do so i want you all to understand this


---------11:23----------
okay about leaving science behind


---------11:25----------
so i'm a clinician so i know it sounds


---------11:27----------
kind of weird but most of clinical


---------11:29----------
medicine is not scientific


---------11:31----------
and it sounds kind of weird but you know


---------11:32----------
we have scientific trials right so we'll


---------11:34----------
have trials that tell us okay this


---------11:36----------
antidepressant you should use first this


---------11:38----------
antidepressant you should use next this


---------11:40----------
antidepressant you should use third


---------11:42----------
and when an actual human being comes


---------11:44----------
into my office


---------11:46----------
there's a protocol of the standard of


---------11:49----------
like


---------11:49----------
what is you know on average the most


---------11:52----------
effective


---------11:53----------
but what i want y'all to realize is that


---------11:54----------
like on average


---------11:56----------
what may be the most effective is not


---------11:58----------
very effective for like 40


---------12:00----------
of the population right so the goal of


---------12:02----------
clinical medicine


---------12:04----------
is to take a scientific foundation which


---------12:06----------
is very well grounded


---------12:08----------
and it to an individual case


---------12:11----------
and if we want to be really precise


---------12:12----------
about it there are no randomized


---------12:15----------
controlled trials


---------12:16----------
about you there is not a single


---------12:19----------
randomized controlled trial


---------12:20----------
that looks at what antidepressant will


---------12:23----------
be effective


---------12:24----------
in you right i know it sounds kind of


---------12:26----------
weird all of the trials are


---------12:28----------
what's effective on average but if you


---------12:30----------
think about where you are


---------12:32----------
and where average is there can be a big


---------12:34----------
gap there right like


---------12:35----------
you are a very different person from the


---------12:37----------
average person


---------12:39----------
each of us has like a different height


---------12:41----------
and you may be above average or below


---------12:42----------
average


---------12:43----------
the other way to kind of think about it


---------12:44----------
is if i'm a fashion consultant


---------12:46----------
i can look at data and i can say like


---------12:48----------
okay on average what do people wear


---------12:51----------
okay what's the average size people are


---------12:53----------
a medium what's the average color


---------12:55----------
okay most people wear like blue what's


---------12:58----------
the average of what people wear okay


---------13:00----------
people where


---------13:00----------
are wearing this nowadays based on


---------13:02----------
fashion trends and all of those averages


---------13:05----------
may not apply to you if you're


---------13:06----------
4 foot 11 or 7 foot right like we we


---------13:09----------
want to


---------13:10----------
cater to the individual and use a


---------13:14----------
foundation


---------13:15----------
of what science tells us okay


---------13:21----------
okay all right so last point is i'm


---------13:26----------
hearing a lot of people you know i saw


---------13:27----------
one question that's like i'm becoming


---------13:29----------
more vat that what do i do about it


---------13:30----------
so unfortunately today the focus is not


---------13:33----------
going to be what


---------13:34----------
to do about your vata the focus today is


---------13:37----------
going to be


---------13:37----------
all of the people who are asking what


---------13:40----------
kind of dosha


---------13:41----------
am i and how can i understand my dosha


---------13:43----------
there's going to be a little bit less on


---------13:45----------
the intervention side because what we


---------13:46----------
really want to focus on


---------13:48----------
is the nuance of like like you know dual


---------13:51----------
doshik people


---------13:52----------
and trying to understand that okay so


---------13:54----------
first we're it's a little bit more of a


---------13:55----------
diagnostic


---------13:56----------
and explanatory as opposed to like this


---------13:58----------
is what you do about it


---------13:59----------
um so i apologize for that but that's


---------14:02----------
sort of why we have


---------14:03----------
anyway just occurred yeah i can't teach


---------14:05----------
everything all at once okay


---------14:07----------
so we're gonna do things in chunks all


---------14:09----------
right so let's get started


---------14:11----------
you all okay with this chat is this good


---------14:14----------
ah what's the difference between about


---------14:15----------
then adhd okay so save all your


---------14:16----------
questions


---------14:17----------
for the end okay all right


---------14:20----------
okay so number one your dosha is not


---------14:23----------
your pokemon type


---------14:24----------
look i get it you found a new framework


---------14:27----------
you're very excited about it you heard


---------14:29----------
about a new structure for understanding


---------14:30----------
the self and your immediate impulse


---------14:32----------
is something like as long as i can


---------14:34----------
figure this out the best way to harness


---------14:36----------
my coffee strengths and shore up my


---------14:38----------
the corresponding weaknesses i'll be


---------14:40----------
able to solve my problems


---------14:41----------
and maybe you will whatever works works


---------14:43----------
and i'm not here to tell you that you


---------14:44----------
need to abandon the idea


---------14:46----------
for the sake of some sort of immortal


---------14:47----------
truth if categorizing yourself is


---------14:50----------
a bit the somehow ameliorates your


---------14:52----------
issues


---------14:53----------
there but for the grace of god go i have


---------14:56----------
fun


---------14:57----------
what i'm trying to make clear is that


---------14:58----------
dosha the dosha concept


---------15:00----------
is not some rigorous definition of


---------15:02----------
individual character


---------15:04----------
it is like stated above a framework for


---------15:06----------
introspection


---------15:07----------
like many other classifications of human


---------15:09----------
personality types


---------15:11----------
it's primarily useful as a tool to get


---------15:13----------
the individual to look inward and


---------15:15----------
examine pathways


---------15:16----------
that may not be obvious at first glance


---------15:19----------
understanding your dorsa


---------15:20----------
whatever that may mean is not a solution


---------15:23----------
in its in and of itself


---------15:25----------
it's only a tool to enhance


---------15:27----------
self-exploration


---------15:28----------
more importantly it's a tool that is


---------15:30----------
only relevant to the person using it


---------15:32----------
your classification is of minimal


---------15:34----------
importance to the people around you


---------15:36----------
it's an entirely personal concept as a


---------15:39----------
result the people


---------15:40----------
asking for advice on how to approach a


---------15:43----------
situation as


---------15:44----------
insert dosha type here are fundamentally


---------15:46----------
misguided because this whole framework


---------15:48----------
isn't going to provide you a solution


---------15:50----------
there's all sorts of solutions to all


---------15:52----------
sorts of problems and trying to peg an


---------15:55----------
individualized solution to a dosha type


---------15:58----------
as though you're figuring out the best


---------15:59----------
weaknesses to exploit


---------16:01----------
in a pokemon battle is completely


---------16:03----------
orthogonal to what you actually need


---------16:06----------
framing your personal issues purely


---------16:08----------
within the dosha framework is going to


---------16:10----------
lead you astray because


---------16:11----------
introspection doesn't solve problems it


---------16:13----------
helps you solve problems more


---------16:15----------
effectively


---------16:16----------
the resolution is ultimately on you as


---------16:18----------
an individual the framework can't step


---------16:20----------
into your place


---------16:22----------
okay now this is a wonderful post i


---------16:25----------
uploaded it right


---------16:26----------
loved the post it's a fantastic post


---------16:30----------
and unfortunately


---------16:33----------
there are huge swaths of it that are


---------16:35----------
kind of wrong


---------16:36----------
okay so let's take a look at this so


---------16:40----------
this person's argument is that there are


---------16:41----------
a lot of


---------16:42----------
systems of let's look at this okay so


---------16:46----------
like many other classifications of human


---------16:48----------
personality types it's primarily useful


---------16:50----------
tool


---------16:51----------
to get the individual to look inward and


---------16:53----------
examine pathways that are not


---------16:55----------
that may not be obvious at a first


---------16:57----------
glance so this person is correct


---------16:59----------
in in some of these fundamentals okay so


---------17:02----------
and like woefully incorrect in others so


---------17:03----------
let's try to understand


---------17:05----------
what's correct about this and sort of


---------17:07----------
what isn't or my opinion on what isn't


---------17:10----------
so the first is okay we've got a lot of


---------17:12----------
different personality types right like


---------17:14----------
what


---------17:14----------
hogwarts house are you you know what is


---------17:17----------
what's your myers-briggs type


---------17:19----------
um what's your balance on the five


---------17:21----------
factor model


---------17:22----------
and it's it's good because even


---------17:24----------
astrology right so like


---------17:26----------
astrology can be useful as a framework


---------17:28----------
for introspection


---------17:29----------
so this person is kind of coming from


---------17:31----------
the stance that personality analyses


---------17:34----------
are useful as frameworks for


---------17:36----------
introspection


---------17:37----------
you can use it to guide your internal


---------17:40----------
journey


---------17:41----------
you know use as a tool to self to


---------17:43----------
enhance self-exploration


---------17:45----------
and that that tool is only relevant to


---------17:47----------
the person using it right so like if i'm


---------17:49----------
big into astrology


---------17:51----------
and like it i'm like oh my god i'm such


---------17:53----------
a libra i'm such a libra like


---------17:55----------
no one else really cares whether i'm a


---------17:56----------
libra or not i can still use libra to


---------17:59----------
help understand


---------18:00----------
my own internal kind of perspective


---------18:03----------
um and and that can be beneficial to me


---------18:05----------
and i can still gain value out of it


---------18:07----------
and that's sort of that's that's


---------18:09----------
absolutely true like this argument is


---------18:10----------
like theoretically like spot on right


---------18:13----------
so we even know from psychological


---------18:15----------
research that


---------18:16----------
astrology is essentially a projective


---------18:19----------
test


---------18:20----------
so in psychology there are certain tests


---------18:23----------
like the rorschach or inkblot test is


---------18:25----------
the best example of this


---------18:26----------
that's a projective test and so the


---------18:28----------
value isn't


---------18:30----------
you know that something is objectively


---------18:32----------
correct but that we can


---------18:33----------
use particular things to help people


---------18:36----------
understand


---------18:38----------
and serve as frameworks for


---------18:39----------
introspection


---------18:41----------
and that if you provide someone with a


---------18:42----------
framework of introspection the framework


---------18:44----------
doesn't need to be objectively correct


---------18:47----------
the value is in the introspection okay


---------18:50----------
that's what this person's


---------18:51----------
cases and he's absolutely correct that


---------18:53----------
in most situations a personality


---------18:55----------
analysis this happens to be true


---------18:58----------
as it turns out ayurveda is actually a


---------19:00----------
little bit different


---------19:02----------
and the main reason for that is that


---------19:04----------
ayurveda is not


---------19:07----------
just a system of introspection it's


---------19:09----------
something that


---------19:10----------
is correlated to your genomics right so


---------19:13----------
people have done studies


---------19:15----------
which show that your doshik balance is


---------19:18----------
not just something that you use for


---------19:20----------
introspection


---------19:21----------
but can actually be genetically


---------19:22----------
identified so if we look at


---------19:25----------
the spectrum of human beings we realize


---------19:28----------
that some people


---------19:29----------
are more prone to experiencing anxiety


---------19:32----------
and some people are more prone to ulcers


---------19:34----------
and some people


---------19:35----------
are more prone to anger so if we look at


---------19:38----------
human beings and we do a scientific


---------19:40----------
study and we stress


---------19:41----------
a hundred people out 33 of those people


---------19:44----------
will become


---------19:45----------
anxious as a response to the stress 33


---------19:48----------
of those people will become angry and


---------19:50----------
irritable with response to those stress


---------19:52----------
and 33 people will become isolated and


---------19:55----------
depressed with a response to the stress


---------19:57----------
now those numbers i actually don't know


---------19:58----------
if those are true or not but the point


---------20:00----------
is that we can make very


---------20:01----------
real scientific observations about


---------20:04----------
variances within the human population


---------20:06----------
and as we study ayurveda what we


---------20:08----------
discover


---------20:09----------
is that these um all of these variations


---------20:13----------
which we can detect with people


---------20:16----------
are actually like correlated to their


---------20:18----------
genome


---------20:19----------
right we can actually look at these


---------20:20----------
people who all get anxious


---------20:22----------
we can look at their genome and see oh


---------20:25----------
wow


---------20:25----------
all of the people who are prone to


---------20:27----------
anxiety


---------20:29----------
actually share common genes let me show


---------20:31----------
you guys


---------20:34----------
this okay so here's just an example of


---------20:37----------
this


---------20:38----------
so like here you know you can say that


---------20:39----------
okay so like there are three types of


---------20:42----------
people you can use this as a frame


---------20:43----------
uh you know an interest a framework for


---------20:46----------
introspective


---------20:47----------
introspection but what's really


---------20:49----------
interesting is that if you actually look


---------20:50----------
at like


---------20:52----------
um you know papers that


---------20:55----------
look at science what you discover is


---------20:58----------
that


---------20:58----------
three basic genocycle somatotypes or


---------21:01----------
birth constitutions


---------21:03----------
have different nuclear receptors which


---------21:05----------
are expected to regulate


---------21:06----------
the expression of specific genes thereby


---------21:09----------
controlling embryonic development


---------21:11----------
adult homeostasis and human metabolism


---------21:14----------
of the human organism in a profound way


---------21:17----------
this is not a framework for


---------21:19----------
introspection my friend


---------21:20----------
this is something that has been


---------21:22----------
scientifically shown to be


---------21:23----------
baked into genes okay so this is why i


---------21:27----------
emphasize ayurveda


---------21:29----------
over astrology or so because i've


---------21:32----------
studied a lot of stuff


---------21:33----------
okay guys i've studied like vedic


---------21:35----------
astrology


---------21:36----------
not so much western astrology i learned


---------21:39----------
how to read tarot cards


---------21:40----------
i'm an energy healer i don't talk about


---------21:43----------
any of that crap


---------21:44----------
i'm also somewhat familiar with


---------21:45----------
myers-briggs but i steer it away from


---------21:48----------
myers-briggs


---------21:48----------
the reason i steered away from


---------21:50----------
myers-briggs is because when i looked


---------21:51----------
for evidence for it


---------21:53----------
what i found is that there's the


---------21:54----------
myers-briggs institute


---------21:56----------
which publishes a lot of evidence but


---------21:58----------
there is very little


---------22:00----------
independent verification of the


---------22:02----------
myers-briggs model


---------22:03----------
which i have been able to find okay


---------22:06----------
so like ayurvedic genomics establishing


---------22:10----------
a genetic basis for mind-body typologies


---------22:14----------
right so like this is kind of


---------22:15----------
interesting so there's a significant


---------22:17----------
correlation between


---------22:18----------
hla type and prakriti that's really


---------22:21----------
fascinating


---------22:21----------
so hla types are sort of individual


---------22:24----------
receptors


---------22:26----------
on some of our immunes on our cells


---------22:28----------
which immune cells recognize and stuff


---------22:29----------
like that


---------22:30----------
but it actually that hla types so these


---------22:33----------
are


---------22:33----------
things that are sort of like blood


---------22:34----------
groups right that they actually


---------22:36----------
correlate with vata pitta and kapha


---------22:39----------
so it's sort of fascinating because i do


---------22:41----------
think that where i disagree with this


---------22:42----------
person


---------22:43----------
is that ayurveda is simply a framework


---------22:46----------
for introspection


---------22:47----------
now some of the ways that we talk about


---------22:49----------
it we use it as framework


---------22:51----------
for introspection so in that sense this


---------22:52----------
person is absolutely correct


---------22:54----------
because when i tell you guys hey this is


---------22:56----------
what avata is this is what a pitta is


---------22:58----------
this is what a kapha is


---------23:00----------
i'm not doing genetic analysis on each


---------23:02----------
and every one of you and sort of


---------23:04----------
you know determining your ayurvedic type


---------23:06----------
so


---------23:07----------
in this sense like we sort of you know


---------23:09----------
we do use it like a pokemon type right


---------23:11----------
like


---------23:11----------
the way that i explain ayurveda is


---------23:15----------
from a sort of like take a personality


---------23:17----------
test and it's what you identify with


---------23:20----------
so in that sense our application of


---------23:23----------
understanding ayurvedic doshas are sort


---------23:26----------
of a framework of for introspection


---------23:28----------
which is exactly what this person is


---------23:29----------
saying and at the same time


---------23:32----------
i want everyone to understand that


---------23:34----------
ayurveda is not just a framework


---------23:36----------
for introspection the reason that we


---------23:39----------
that's the way we're using it


---------23:40----------
absolutely but there is actually


---------23:43----------
overwhelming evidence that ayurveda is


---------23:45----------
not


---------23:46----------
like the other systems of personality


---------23:48----------
because i don't know of


---------23:50----------
any systems of personality that have


---------23:51----------
done this much correlation to like


---------23:54----------
genetics and sort of figuring out okay


---------23:56----------
this personality type


---------23:58----------
actually is developed due to a


---------24:01----------
combination of genetics


---------24:02----------
gene expression embryonic environment


---------24:04----------
like that is absolutely wild


---------24:06----------
chat but there is a huge difference


---------24:10----------
in my experience between ayurveda and


---------24:12----------
other systems of personality analysis


---------24:14----------
so even if you look at things like the


---------24:16----------
five factor model which are also systems


---------24:18----------
of personality


---------24:19----------
analysis that have been very well


---------24:20----------
validated i don't know i haven't really


---------24:23----------
looked at this because i'm not an expert


---------24:24----------
in five factor research because you


---------24:26----------
can't be an expert in everything


---------24:27----------
unfortunately


---------24:28----------
but i don't know what degree of genetic


---------24:30----------
correlation has been done with five


---------24:32----------
factor research and sort of like looking


---------24:34----------
at people's genes


---------24:35----------
so this is kind of a it's a it's a


---------24:37----------
fantastic post and i think the person's


---------24:39----------
um you know like very correct about a


---------24:42----------
lot of things


---------24:43----------
but i i do think that this is where


---------24:45----------
actually in my experience this is not


---------24:47----------
the case


---------24:48----------
so more importantly it's a tool that is


---------24:51----------
only relevant to the person using it


---------24:53----------
and so we'll talk about this a little


---------24:55----------
bit down the line but like literally


---------24:57----------
i'll do


---------24:57----------
consulting for corporations where it's


---------25:00----------
not


---------25:00----------
only relevant to the person using it but


---------25:03----------
when everyone in your team


---------25:05----------
understands everyone's ayurvedic dosha


---------25:08----------
it becomes very relevant and this will


---------25:11----------
become a little bit more clear once we


---------25:12----------
get to


---------25:13----------
the framework that i'm going to share


---------25:14----------
with you guys today but understanding


---------25:16----------
that you're avata


---------25:17----------
and understanding that someone else is a


---------25:19----------
guffa will help you


---------25:21----------
change the way that your mind or realize


---------25:24----------
which way your mind is defaulting to


---------25:26----------
thinking


---------25:27----------
and acknowledge someone else's default


---------25:29----------
thought and it actually


---------25:30----------
really really helps with like conflict


---------25:33----------
resolution and team harmony


---------25:34----------
once you realize what your pokemon type


---------25:37----------
is


---------25:37----------
which the person is fair to say that we


---------25:40----------
don't really have good scientific


---------25:42----------
ways of connecting the genetics to the


---------25:45----------
pokemon type


---------25:46----------
so we are sort of basically determining


---------25:48----------
a pokemon type


---------25:49----------
but i i have kind of two important


---------25:51----------
caveats which is one is that like


---------25:53----------
it's not just a framework for


---------25:55----------
introspection that's how we're using it


---------25:57----------
in these cases


---------25:58----------
absolutely and it has all of the


---------26:00----------
shortcomings of that but it does appear


---------26:02----------
that your ayurvedic dosha


---------26:04----------
actually correlates with genetics and


---------26:05----------
other kinds of things which were you


---------26:07----------
know i can go into more detail but


---------26:09----------
you know even for example like some of


---------26:10----------
my uh ayurvedic colleagues in india


---------26:14----------
have been able to predict complications


---------26:17----------
of kovid


---------26:18----------
based on the dosha of of the patient so


---------26:21----------
covid is one thing right


---------26:22----------
but whether this person uh needs icu


---------26:25----------
stuff


---------26:26----------
or they have cognitive stuff or they


---------26:28----------
have gi symptoms from covid


---------26:30----------
appears to correlate with their


---------26:31----------
ayurvedic dosha which is incredibly


---------26:34----------
fascinating


---------26:35----------
right so unfortunately studies haven't


---------26:37----------
really been published


---------26:38----------
on this yet we'll see if they ever kind


---------26:39----------
of get published um


---------26:41----------
but it does appear that like you know


---------26:43----------
physicians are able to sort of predict


---------26:45----------
okay does this person need to watch out


---------26:46----------
for stroke does this person need to


---------26:48----------
watch out for gi complications


---------26:50----------
cognitive complications or respiratory


---------26:52----------
complications


---------26:53----------
because covid can cause all kinds of


---------26:54----------
random crap in random people


---------26:56----------
but if you really think about it you


---------26:57----------
know i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------26:59----------
there's absolutely biology and science


---------27:02----------
that


---------27:03----------
leads to a complication of covid it's


---------27:05----------
not random it's not truly random right


---------27:07----------
we just don't have an understanding of


---------27:09----------
biology that's that's strong enough


---------27:11----------
to where we can predict which kinds of


---------27:13----------
complications are going to happen


---------27:14----------
happen with which people in western


---------27:16----------
medicine so it's really fascinating


---------27:19----------
okay so um so this is also where you


---------27:24----------
know


---------27:24----------
uh you know the kind of says that


---------27:26----------
they're fundamentally misguided because


---------27:27----------
this whole framework isn't going to


---------27:29----------
provide you with a solution


---------27:30----------
and that's where i'd say like you know


---------27:32----------
that's not something so i'm going to say


---------27:34----------
that i disagree but this is where


---------27:37----------
neither i am right nor this person is


---------27:39----------
right you know to really


---------27:41----------
understand whether this framework will


---------27:44----------
provide you with a solution or not is


---------27:46----------
going to require data


---------27:48----------
right so what really the way that we


---------27:49----------
need to answer this question


---------27:51----------
is we take you know a hundred let's take


---------27:54----------
200 people


---------27:55----------
in a workplace setting and um and we're


---------27:59----------
we're not really thinking about doing


---------28:00----------
this study yet but you know i have


---------28:02----------
multiple corporate clients and


---------28:04----------
have some connections at academic


---------28:06----------
institutions and stuff like that so


---------28:07----------
this study may arise within the next


---------28:09----------
couple of years


---------28:10----------
and what we're going to do is is teach


---------28:12----------
100 people about their dosha


---------28:14----------
and we're going to have some kind of


---------28:16----------
control group where you know we're not


---------28:18----------
going to teach people about their dosha


---------28:20----------
and then the interesting thing is that


---------28:22----------
we can actually measure


---------28:23----------
whether teaching people about their


---------28:25----------
dosha actually leads to measurable


---------28:27----------
effects right so it's not about my


---------28:29----------
opinion or this person's opinion


---------28:30----------
this is absolutely a situation where


---------28:32----------
like over time


---------28:33----------
i think the goal is going to be to


---------28:35----------
actually measure and test some of these


---------28:37----------
hypotheses


---------28:38----------
because this statement more importantly


---------28:40----------
it's it's a it's a tool that is only


---------28:43----------
relevant to the person


---------28:44----------
using it that's a fair opinion i have my


---------28:46----------
fair opinion i'm not saying i mean i


---------28:48----------
believe i'm right and i believe this


---------28:49----------
person is incorrect


---------28:50----------
but i can't really say that right the


---------28:52----------
real money is going to be


---------28:54----------
when we actually have an ayurvedic


---------28:56----------
intervention


---------28:57----------
and whether we can actually measure some


---------28:59----------
degree of change


---------29:01----------
okay um so


---------29:04----------
but generally speaking i think that this


---------29:06----------
person's sentiment is absolutely correct


---------29:09----------
that generally speaking person systems


---------29:11----------
of personality analysis


---------29:13----------
are useful as frameworks for


---------29:14----------
introspection and that


---------29:16----------
the goal is to introspect learn


---------29:18----------
something about yourself


---------29:20----------
and then use that to solve problems more


---------29:22----------
effectively like i think that's


---------29:24----------
absolutely a wonderful and reasonable


---------29:26----------
logical change


---------29:28----------
and at the same time i do believe that


---------29:30----------
ayurveda


---------29:31----------
has scientific evidence which elevates


---------29:34----------
it


---------29:35----------
beyond just the system of framework for


---------29:37----------
introspection


---------29:39----------
and the caveat to that is that what i'm


---------29:41----------
going to teach you all today


---------29:42----------
is absolutely closer to a framework of


---------29:45----------
for introspection than it is


---------29:47----------
uh you know like genetically verified


---------29:49----------
right because we're going to apply this


---------29:50----------
extrapolate this more as a framework for


---------29:53----------
introspection


---------29:55----------
okay great fantastic post


---------29:59----------
love it and by the way um


---------30:03----------
you know i really hope that so i want


---------30:06----------
y'all to understand this


---------30:08----------
i love this post so much because


---------30:12----------
our subreddit is not a place for dr k to


---------30:16----------
be right


---------30:17----------
our subreddit is absolutely a place for


---------30:20----------
anyone to be right and anyone to be


---------30:22----------
wrong so someone i i sometimes post on


---------30:24----------
the subreddit


---------30:25----------
and someone like realized that like i


---------30:28----------
my response was dr k and they're like


---------30:31----------
hey man you should have flair so that


---------30:33----------
people know when you're talking


---------30:35----------
and i'm like no bro i really should not


---------30:37----------
right so that what's really great about


---------30:39----------
that is that


---------30:40----------
i rarely have the top comment on


---------30:43----------
responses to the subreddit which is


---------30:46----------
absolutely the way that it's supposed to


---------30:47----------
be


---------30:48----------
right we this is not a post reddit of dr


---------30:51----------
k is right and everyone needs to know


---------30:52----------
when dr k


---------30:53----------
opens his mouth i have a platform where


---------30:55----------
i get to be right and everyone gets to


---------30:57----------
listen to what i say


---------30:58----------
the point of the subreddit i know it's


---------30:59----------
shocking chat uh the point of the


---------31:01----------
subreddit is that there are people


---------31:03----------
out there who have better and more


---------31:05----------
impactful responses


---------31:07----------
than i do and that's why the subreddit


---------31:10----------
exists


---------31:11----------
it's a space for people to share awesome


---------31:13----------
opinions like this


---------31:14----------
right and so it's a space where you guys


---------31:17----------
can support each other you can challenge


---------31:18----------
each other


---------31:19----------
and like it's not like my word is like


---------31:22----------
the end-all


---------31:23----------
i'm allowed to disagree with you and


---------31:25----------
there's sort of like an inherent power


---------31:26----------
dynamic right because dr k is saying


---------31:27----------
you're wrong


---------31:28----------
but like i really want to emphasize that


---------31:30----------
this is exactly the kind of discussion


---------31:32----------
we need because i may not like i'm not


---------31:34----------
the arbiter of truth chat


---------31:35----------
like i know a lot but i'm not the


---------31:37----------
arbiter of truth and what i really love


---------31:39----------
about the subreddit is that a lot of


---------31:40----------
people post


---------31:41----------
right a lot of people discuss a lot of


---------31:43----------
people help each other out


---------31:44----------
and like they actually do a better job


---------31:46----------
of it than i do which is like exactly


---------31:48----------
what it's there for right we're


---------31:49----------
we're a community that fosters like you


---------31:52----------
know growth of each and every individual


---------31:54----------
in the community


---------31:55----------
we're not actually like a dr k says it


---------31:58----------
so it must be true community at least i


---------31:59----------
don't think so


---------32:00----------
we joke about memeing about being a cult


---------32:03----------
but i think it's these meta-level


---------32:04----------
discussions that keep us from becoming a


---------32:06----------
call


---------32:08----------
so it's fantastic love the post really


---------32:11----------
appreciate this kind of discussion


---------32:14----------
okay oh no i don't have water


---------32:18----------
okay why don't you guys start reading


---------32:20----------
this and i'm gonna go grab water


---------32:22----------
so hgg old heads will remember the


---------32:24----------
classic lectures on the vedic model of


---------32:26----------
the mind


---------32:27----------
vata pitta and kapha three doshas okay


---------32:30----------
so the first thing to understand is the


---------32:31----------
vedic model of the mind is not ayurveda


---------32:34----------
those are different things okay


---------32:36----------
but we'll get to that just a


---------32:38----------
clarification


---------32:40----------
um so vata being like wind the mind


---------32:42----------
constantly bouncing around between


---------32:44----------
whatever grabs its attention


---------32:46----------
if a vat that plants 20 20 trees they


---------32:48----------
may succeed at getting all of them to


---------32:50----------
blossom


---------32:50----------
but struggle to give anyone enough


---------32:52----------
attention to flourish


---------32:54----------
pitha being like fire burning intensely


---------32:56----------
on whatever it's


---------32:57----------
it it's focused they plant one tree give


---------32:59----------
it a constant attention


---------33:01----------
and care until they see the fruit and


---------33:03----------
then plant their next tree


---------33:05----------
guffa being like earth moving slowly but


---------33:07----------
gradually building


---------33:08----------
into something great they might only


---------33:10----------
ever plant one tree but over many years


---------33:12----------
cultivate it


---------33:12----------
into something truly magnificent i've


---------33:15----------
tried to analyze


---------33:16----------
myself using this framework and i think


---------33:18----------
i'm a pretty strong vata kapha hybrid


---------33:20----------
which i don't believe dr k has ever


---------33:22----------
talked about


---------33:24----------
i've always learned new things very


---------33:25----------
quickly and on a day-to-day basis i'm


---------33:27----------
constantly bouncing around


---------33:28----------
obsessing about whatever grabs my


---------33:30----------
attention however over the long term i'm


---------33:32----------
very slow moving resistant to change and


---------33:34----------
very attached to the trees i've planted


---------33:37----------
i find myself always coming back to the


---------33:39----------
same handful of things


---------33:40----------
improving them at at them in a short


---------33:43----------
burst of time


---------33:44----------
moving on to something else and then


---------33:46----------
weeks or months later when the wind


---------33:48----------
pulls me back sad and disappointed at


---------33:50----------
how i've neglected it


---------33:52----------
this fuels the obsession once again with


---------33:55----------
much of the


---------33:55----------
time spent playing catch up only to lose


---------33:58----------
interest


---------33:59----------
once i get a feeling of okay i think


---------34:01----------
i've made up for the neglect


---------34:02----------
but what about my other trees i'm now


---------34:05----------
hesitant to ever commit to something


---------34:06----------
entirely new paralyzed by the anxiety of


---------34:09----------
letting my oldest trees


---------34:10----------
wither and die caught in an endless


---------34:13----------
cycle of trying to maintain what i have


---------34:15----------
yet feeling like nothing i do will ever


---------34:16----------
reach its full potential


---------34:18----------
this affects my relationships my hobbies


---------34:20----------
my responsibilities and my job


---------34:22----------
what should i do to play into my


---------34:23----------
strengths and mitigate my weaknesses


---------34:25----------
when there are so many


---------34:27----------
when they are so naturally in conflict


---------34:29----------
beautiful


---------34:30----------
uh beautiful post okay


---------34:34----------
now the lecture


---------34:38----------
is about to begin chat


---------34:41----------
okay so the first problem


---------34:44----------
is that when i teach ayurveda i tend to


---------34:48----------
teach it


---------34:49----------
as if vatas and kaphas are opposites


---------34:52----------
right if we think about wind and earth


---------34:54----------
we sort of think about them as opposites


---------34:57----------
but the truth is that vata and kapha are


---------34:58----------
not opposites they're actually like


---------35:00----------
independent


---------35:01----------
okay and the idea that they are


---------35:04----------
opposites


---------35:06----------
um comes from sort of essentially like a


---------35:08----------
simplification of the doshas


---------35:11----------
so what we're gonna do is explain


---------35:14----------
in more detail how to understand your


---------35:16----------
doshas okay


---------35:18----------
so for people who are new let's start


---------35:20----------
with the basics


---------35:21----------
okay so ayurveda is a system of medicine


---------35:23----------
that's about 5000 years old


---------35:26----------
that posits that are not all people are


---------35:28----------
the same


---------35:30----------
and that each person has an elemental


---------35:32----------
balance


---------35:33----------
of three types vata pitta


---------35:36----------
and kapha so vata is like the wind


---------35:40----------
bit is like fire and kapha is like earth


---------35:44----------
okay i know i said five but let's focus


---------35:46----------
on these three that's another


---------35:47----------
simplification


---------35:49----------
so what they sort of noticed is that


---------35:50----------
some people are like the wind their mind


---------35:52----------
is very dynamic


---------35:54----------
they learn things very easily they're


---------35:56----------
quick studies but they also forget


---------35:58----------
things very easily kind of like the wind


---------36:01----------
they blow really hard in one direction


---------36:03----------
and can die down kind of randomly and


---------36:04----------
then they can blow really hard in


---------36:06----------
another direction


---------36:07----------
a lot of people sort of identify with


---------36:10----------
vata especially because our society


---------36:13----------
right now is very vatagenic so if you


---------36:15----------
look at things like notifications and


---------36:17----------
like the pace of society


---------36:19----------
our minds are becoming more dynamic you


---------36:22----------
have to deal with more stimuli and it's


---------36:23----------
like becoming like


---------36:24----------
you know stimulus overload so all of our


---------36:27----------
society


---------36:28----------
makes people more vata bitters are like


---------36:32----------
fire they're organized they're focused


---------36:34----------
they discriminate which means they tease


---------36:35----------
apart things


---------36:36----------
they try to really like understand


---------36:39----------
processes


---------36:40----------
and they tend to be like ambitious and


---------36:41----------
driven and focused


---------36:43----------
our society currently rewards pittas


---------36:46----------
so if you think about school and you


---------36:48----------
think about like promotions and things


---------36:50----------
like that


---------36:51----------
so i saw a statistic that if you want to


---------36:53----------
earn the highest salary


---------36:54----------
you should move jobs every two years


---------36:57----------
that generally speaking if you stay at


---------36:59----------
one company for a prolonged period of


---------37:01----------
time


---------37:01----------
your promotion schedule is going to be


---------37:04----------
slower than if you hop around


---------37:06----------
if you hop around too quickly like


---------37:09----------
avatar would


---------37:10----------
you won't earn as much and if you stay


---------37:12----------
around


---------37:13----------
too long like a kapha would you won't


---------37:15----------
earn as much so


---------37:16----------
our society tends to be like very like


---------37:18----------
bit the rewarding


---------37:19----------
right so we we tend to emphasize and


---------37:22----------
reward people who are like ambitious


---------37:25----------
driven focused those are the things that


---------37:28----------
we believe lead to success


---------37:30----------
and then you have the kapha types which


---------37:32----------
are stable resilient


---------37:33----------
arguably slow so they're like the earth


---------37:36----------
resistant to change hard to move


---------37:38----------
but can be very very dedicated to one


---------37:40----------
thing


---------37:41----------
so it's really nice to be in a


---------37:43----------
relationship with a kapha person because


---------37:45----------
the kapha person


---------37:46----------
generally speaking will be able to like


---------37:48----------
tolerate a lot of your stuff


---------37:50----------
it can be very difficult to be a coffee


---------37:52----------
person because often times you'll stay


---------37:54----------
in situations


---------37:55----------
longer than you should because of your


---------37:57----------
high ability of tolerance


---------37:59----------
right so the video gaming analogy that i


---------38:01----------
use for kaphas is like


---------38:02----------
if i'm sitting in a pool of acid and i'm


---------38:04----------
avata i get out of it really really


---------38:06----------
quickly because


---------38:08----------
i have a low hp pool and if you're a


---------38:10----------
kapha you can just kind of tank that


---------38:11----------
damage for a while


---------38:12----------
it's like not a big deal and even though


---------38:14----------
you should leave there's not a whole lot


---------38:16----------
of like pressure for you to leave


---------38:17----------
because your ability to


---------38:19----------
withstand is pretty high okay


---------38:22----------
so quick uh you know take on doshas


---------38:26----------
so what we tend to have is we've got


---------38:28----------
vatas


---------38:29----------
so the way that it works and this is


---------38:30----------
determined by our genetics


---------38:33----------
is that we have levels of vata pittan


---------38:35----------
kapha so let's say here's the baseline


---------38:37----------
and any human being based on their


---------38:39----------
genetics will have


---------38:40----------
you know avata that's up here maybe


---------38:43----------
a pitta that's down here and then maybe


---------38:46----------
a kapha that's like


---------38:48----------
over here okay so these are our natural


---------38:50----------
levels that are genetically determined


---------38:52----------
we've seen good evidence


---------38:53----------
evidence of that and then what happens


---------38:55----------
so this is called our prakruti


---------38:57----------
and then what happens is that based on


---------38:59----------
our environment based on our diet based


---------39:01----------
on other kinds of influential things


---------39:04----------
our levels can change and that's called


---------39:06----------
our vikrti


---------39:07----------
so let's say that my vata level is here


---------39:10----------
i


---------39:11----------
i force myself to go to a lot of like


---------39:13----------
entrepreneurship


---------39:14----------
and ambition and networking events so my


---------39:16----------
pitta is going to be kind of baseline


---------39:18----------
and um since i'm sort of in a very


---------39:21----------
technological society and i don't take


---------39:22----------
care of myself well


---------39:24----------
my kapha is going to actually be reduced


---------39:26----------
okay


---------39:27----------
so this is called vikrti and vikruti is


---------39:30----------
your current balance


---------39:32----------
of your doshik elements that is can be


---------39:34----------
altered


---------39:35----------
okay so remember that and then what


---------39:38----------
happens is if we kind of look at it like


---------39:39----------
let's say this is the threshold


---------39:44----------
for illness so


---------39:47----------
if your vikruti crosses this barrier


---------39:50----------
then you will manifest with illness if


---------39:54----------
your


---------39:54----------
vikruti crosses this barrier you will


---------39:56----------
manifest this illness


---------39:58----------
so someone earlier was asking about adhd


---------40:01----------
so i have a very active and dynamic mind


---------40:04----------
and if i'm not careful it gets to the


---------40:07----------
point where like my


---------40:08----------
active and dynamic mind if i cross this


---------40:11----------
threshold with


---------40:11----------
which it's very easy for me to do i end


---------40:14----------
up with


---------40:15----------
like being so vata that it actually


---------40:17----------
negatively


---------40:18----------
impacts my life so like it's nice like i


---------40:22----------
can juggle five balls but if my


---------40:24----------
vata like elevates too much and then i'm


---------40:26----------
juggling ten balls then i start dropping


---------40:28----------
them left and right


---------40:29----------
okay so that is an example of


---------40:32----------
uh prakruti which is your genetic basis


---------40:35----------
and vikruti which can be changed over


---------40:37----------
time


---------40:38----------
okay so this is an overview of vata


---------40:42----------
so like for example vata elevations can


---------40:44----------
result


---------40:45----------
in adhd or anxiety


---------40:49----------
right when you cross the bit the


---------40:52----------
threshold


---------40:52----------
you're going to get angry and you're


---------40:54----------
going to snap at people and when you


---------40:55----------
cross the cuff of threshold you're going


---------40:57----------
to be depressed


---------40:58----------
okay now the other interesting thing is


---------41:01----------
let's take a look at depression for


---------41:03----------
example


---------41:05----------
all right so let's say that here's our


---------41:07----------
vata pitta kafa


---------41:08----------
and so let's say that i have an


---------41:12----------
avata person a pit the person


---------41:16----------
and a kapha person okay


---------41:19----------
and then in each of these three people


---------41:22----------
if if their kapha


---------41:23----------
elevates over here then i'll get an


---------41:26----------
anxious depression if this person's


---------41:28----------
kapha elevates to over here


---------41:30----------
then i'll get depression with anger


---------41:31----------
attacks and if this person's kapha


---------41:33----------
elevates to over here which remember we


---------41:35----------
don't need a whole lot of


---------41:36----------
then this is neuro-vegetative depression


---------41:38----------
do you guys see how that works


---------41:40----------
so depression is a kapha imbalance but


---------41:42----------
depending on what your


---------41:44----------
prakruti is it will manifest in a


---------41:47----------
different way and the really interesting


---------41:48----------
thing is that there's decent science to


---------41:50----------
support this so like we know there are


---------41:51----------
three kinds of


---------41:53----------
um you know depressions and we don't we


---------41:56----------
haven't quite done the study i actually


---------41:58----------
published a paper about this about


---------42:00----------
how they huh what


---------42:04----------
what is this why are you talking about


---------42:07----------
me


---------42:08----------
hack


---------42:13----------
weird oh


---------42:16----------
we deleted it all what is happening


---------42:22----------
okay let's just start from the top okay


---------42:25----------
so um so essentially like depression can


---------42:30----------
happen in any um


---------42:33----------
uh in any kind of person and depending


---------42:36----------
on what kind of person they have


---------42:38----------
it'll manifest in a different way okay


---------42:41----------
so now what we're gonna do so that's


---------42:42----------
just kind of basics of


---------42:44----------
ayurveda okay so now what we're going to


---------42:46----------
do is we're going to talk about the


---------42:47----------
hybrids


---------42:48----------
and the way that we're going to high uh


---------42:51----------
or talk about the hybrids


---------42:52----------
is we're going to actually refer to like


---------42:56----------
work related stuff and this is where


---------42:58----------
we're definitely going to go more


---------42:59----------
towards the framework of introspection


---------43:01----------
there's less science to support this so


---------43:03----------
there's a ton of science to support the


---------43:05----------
genetic stuff


---------43:06----------
there's a decent amount of science to


---------43:07----------
support the clinical stuff


---------43:09----------
and now we're really getting into the


---------43:11----------
place where there's very little signs


---------43:12----------
okay


---------43:13----------
so i'd say about vatas is that they're


---------43:15----------
innovators


---------43:17----------
but those are organizers


---------43:21----------
and kaphas are like structure oriented


---------43:25----------
okay so like what avata does is just


---------43:28----------
puts random things out there


---------43:30----------
what a bit that does is take these


---------43:32----------
random things and like organize them


---------43:34----------
into structure


---------43:38----------
okay so like we're going to organize


---------43:39----------
this and what akapha is going to do is


---------43:41----------
start off from the get-go by making


---------43:43----------
things nice


---------43:44----------
and structured so like i know it sounds


---------43:47----------
kind of weird but like


---------43:49----------
this may sound like the same thing but


---------43:50----------
it's fundamentally different like


---------43:52----------
yeah i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------43:54----------
it just is and we'll we'll explain that


---------43:56----------
later okay


---------43:57----------
so let's kind of look at um some


---------44:00----------
combinations now okay


---------44:02----------
so if i have a vata bit the person so


---------44:05----------
let's start with a straight vata


---------44:06----------
so these people are innovators so they


---------44:09----------
come up with ideas


---------44:11----------
but generally speaking can't see them to


---------44:14----------
fruition


---------44:15----------
because they sort of lack an organizing


---------44:17----------
component or structural component


---------44:19----------
so like avata can be like a visionary


---------44:24----------
okay so like sometimes what what you'll


---------44:26----------
have like sometimes actually ceos can be


---------44:28----------
vata


---------44:29----------
um but generally if they're if they need


---------44:31----------
if they're vata so this is the kind of


---------44:32----------
corporate consulting that i'll do


---------44:34----------
you need like a strong bitta or a strong


---------44:36----------
guffa is a ceo


---------44:38----------
so if you've got a ceo that's vata you


---------44:40----------
need to balance it


---------44:41----------
with a coo that's either bitter or kaffa


---------44:44----------
okay and then you may say like okay what


---------44:47----------
is avata


---------44:48----------
plus pitta so the vata is like the


---------44:52----------
inventor


---------44:52----------
hey i came up with this cool blockchain


---------44:55----------
cool


---------44:56----------
the pit the vata pitta hybrid is


---------44:58----------
actually the entrepreneur


---------45:00----------
so if you think about it like what's the


---------45:02----------
difference between an innovator


---------45:04----------
and an entrepreneur right so like the


---------45:06----------
the entrepreneur is someone who has the


---------45:08----------
innovation capability


---------45:10----------
but also the ability to organize it so


---------45:13----------
like then you can actually like


---------45:14----------
start a company right because you've got


---------45:17----------
that


---------45:18----------
certain amount of ambition you've got


---------45:19----------
that drive you can sort of organize your


---------45:21----------
information


---------45:22----------
things like that whereas like you know


---------45:24----------
if you're a pure vata


---------45:26----------
what you what you've got is like you're


---------45:27----------
the guy who makes the discovery but you


---------45:29----------
can't


---------45:30----------
start the business and then if we've got


---------45:32----------
like you know


---------45:33----------
another kind of bitter so you also have


---------45:35----------
like people who will


---------45:37----------
so for example like the dod kind of does


---------45:39----------
this right where


---------45:40----------
the dod will go around and find


---------45:43----------
inventors


---------45:44----------
and what they'll do is like they'll take


---------45:46----------
the invention and then they'll like


---------45:48----------
turn it into a thing right so you'll


---------45:51----------
have people who will go out and like


---------45:52----------
purchase patents they're not the patent


---------45:55----------
developer


---------45:56----------
right so this is also like another kind


---------45:57----------
of entrepreneur but it's sort of like a


---------46:00----------
you know let's call this the patent


---------46:01----------
purchaser


---------46:03----------
so what they're gonna do is come to


---------46:05----------
people with inventions and we'll help


---------46:07----------
you bring your invention to market


---------46:09----------
i'm good at the ambition i'm good at


---------46:11----------
like you know all this stuff


---------46:13----------
i'm gonna kind of bring it to market


---------46:15----------
which is a little bit different because


---------46:17----------
we're not quite


---------46:17----------
innovating and the entrepreneur sort of


---------46:20----------
does like both of those pieces right if


---------46:22----------
you really look at successful


---------46:23----------
entrepreneurs they usually


---------46:24----------
you know do both of the pieces or they


---------46:27----------
find teams


---------46:28----------
where they can they can supplement like


---------46:30----------
their weak points


---------46:31----------
okay so now let's get to some other kind


---------46:34----------
of interesting things so like


---------46:37----------
um so let's look at


---------46:40----------
pitta kapha


---------46:44----------
okay so the pitta kapha is sort of like


---------46:46----------
an analyst


---------46:48----------
so what we're gonna do is like look at


---------46:50----------
this organizing


---------46:52----------
information and we're gonna kind of like


---------46:53----------
develop a structure based on it


---------46:56----------
so like bitter kaphas are like really


---------46:57----------
really good at analyzing data


---------46:59----------
um so they're good at sort of like you


---------47:01----------
know piecing things together and working


---------47:03----------
well within structure


---------47:06----------
um the other kind of oh actually sorry


---------47:08----------
sorry this is wrong


---------47:12----------
this is actually a kapha pitta so


---------47:13----------
remember that you can have a primary and


---------47:15----------
a secondary


---------47:19----------
okay and then a bit the kapha so this is


---------47:22----------
the other point to illustrate


---------47:24----------
so is a kapha pitta the same as a bitter


---------47:26----------
kapha and i'd say no


---------47:28----------
so a pitta kapha is a good strategic


---------47:30----------
planner


---------47:32----------
so if you ask yourself like what's the


---------47:34----------
difference between like an analyst and a


---------47:36----------
strategic planner all right so pithas


---------47:38----------
are going to kind of organize


---------47:40----------
information and then sort of develop a


---------47:43----------
strategy going forward


---------47:45----------
they're not just about creating


---------47:46----------
structure for the sake of structure


---------47:47----------
they're sort of like


---------47:48----------
you know like kind of forward thinking


---------47:50----------
and they're really good at sort of like


---------47:52----------
creating a structure that we can build


---------47:54----------
towards


---------47:55----------
uh kaffa pitta may be a little bit


---------47:56----------
better in analysis they're not so


---------47:58----------
concerned about forward thinking they're


---------47:59----------
really thinking about okay


---------48:01----------
how can we look at what we have that


---------48:03----------
exists and sort of like analyze it and


---------48:05----------
sort of like iterate or improve on it


---------48:07----------
and i know it's it it sort of sounds


---------48:09----------
kind of like this may be overlapping and


---------48:12----------
this is why we really are getting kind


---------48:13----------
of away from science


---------48:14----------
but this is just sort of observationally


---------48:16----------
like what i've seen


---------48:17----------
okay and now we're going to get to the


---------48:20----------
combo that people are talking about so


---------48:21----------
like what about


---------48:23----------
a kapha vata so i think kaphavatas excel


---------48:27----------
at something like program development


---------48:31----------
so what does this mean so if you look at


---------48:33----------
program development we're going to make


---------48:35----------
something new it requires some degree of


---------48:37----------
innovation


---------48:38----------
but if you want to develop a program it


---------48:40----------
requires a certain amount of structure


---------48:42----------
right like you want the innovation


---------48:44----------
but you really need some kind of


---------48:46----------
structure around it so


---------48:48----------
it's kind of interesting but even if you


---------48:49----------
look at like the ayurvedic dosha of like


---------48:51----------
the people who


---------48:53----------
you know wind up in different piece


---------48:55----------
places within healthy gamer


---------48:57----------
like our strongest program developers


---------49:00----------
are like program development people


---------49:02----------
actually have a healthy dose of vata and


---------49:04----------
kapha


---------49:06----------
and so it's really fascinating but when


---------49:07----------
i go to a corporation you kind of think


---------49:09----------
about okay what do you need for program


---------49:11----------
development


---------49:11----------
you don't necessarily need ambition what


---------49:13----------
you need is like you're creating


---------49:14----------
something new so you need


---------49:16----------
like this innovative kind of component


---------49:18----------
but you also need like a structural


---------49:20----------
component so i'm actually like


---------49:22----------
good at some aspects of program


---------49:24----------
development and i suck in other aspects


---------49:27----------
so i'm really good at sketching out


---------49:28----------
ideas and coming up with the innovations


---------49:31----------
but i'm very bad at creating the


---------49:33----------
policies and procedures


---------49:36----------
that are based on the innovation so a


---------49:38----------
really strong kapha vata


---------49:40----------
is awesome because they can sort of


---------49:41----------
innovate a little bit but they can also


---------49:43----------
create like the policies and procedures


---------49:46----------
around that program when it's new and if


---------49:49----------
you look at something like a more kapha


---------49:50----------
pitta


---------49:51----------
the kapha pitta will be a lot stronger


---------49:53----------
maybe not quite


---------49:54----------
developing them but once we have them


---------49:57----------
analyze them to kind of see what's


---------49:58----------
working and how to improve


---------50:01----------
okay so now what i'm going to do


---------50:04----------
is is kind of like just touch on you


---------50:06----------
know a couple of other combinations


---------50:09----------
and sort of help you all sort of


---------50:10----------
understand like


---------50:12----------
what kind of thought processes or


---------50:14----------
approaches they have okay


---------50:15----------
so let's look at vata pettas so


---------50:20----------
like kind of a spectrum okay so let's


---------50:22----------
look at the vata the vata says


---------50:24----------
let's try it out let's see what happens


---------50:32----------
okay this is going to be kind of like


---------50:34----------
you know now we're getting into the what


---------50:35----------
harry potter type are you what pokemon


---------50:37----------
are you okay


---------50:38----------
and then the bit that says let's try it


---------50:42----------
out


---------50:45----------
and measure it


---------50:49----------
okay like let's like organize let's not


---------50:51----------
just see what happens


---------50:53----------
and rely on intuition


---------50:56----------
let's use analysis


---------51:00----------
do you guys get the difference like some


---------51:01----------
people like i'm like this where


---------51:04----------
you know so we're thinking about how to


---------51:06----------
improve particular things in healthy


---------51:08----------
gamer


---------51:09----------
because it's an ongoing process where


---------51:10----------
we're trying to get better at stuff and


---------51:12----------
so my approach is like


---------51:13----------
i'm just going to go and like watch


---------51:15----------
other coaches


---------51:17----------
for example and that and i'll rely on my


---------51:20----------
intuition to tell me like what these


---------51:22----------
people need to do differently


---------51:23----------
i'm not going to design a curriculum yet


---------51:25----------
i'm going to just go and like watch and


---------51:27----------
rely on my intuition


---------51:28----------
and vata pittas are like let go ahead


---------51:30----------
let's try it out but let's make sure we


---------51:31----------
measure it


---------51:33----------
okay and what about the pittavata


---------51:37----------
so what the pittavata says is let's


---------51:42----------
measure what we've got


---------51:50----------
and see what we should try


---------51:56----------
you guys see the difference here like


---------51:59----------
the difference between a vata pitta and


---------52:00----------
a pittavata


---------52:04----------
okay because there's a huge difference


---------52:06----------
like if you work with


---------52:07----------
human beings you will see that their


---------52:11----------
cognition literally the way their brain


---------52:13----------
works


---------52:15----------
is gonna fall into these buckets like


---------52:17----------
some people like i know it sounds weird


---------52:19----------
but like i'm pretty sure


---------52:20----------
that this is scientifically verifiable


---------52:23----------
okay


---------52:24----------
some people are more intuitive


---------52:28----------
like their approach to problem solving


---------52:30----------
is like


---------52:31----------
i'ma show up and i'ma figure it out


---------52:34----------
we'll figure it out we'll figure it out


---------52:37----------
and that


---------52:38----------
pisses some people off so much


---------52:41----------
what do you mean we're going to figure


---------52:42----------
out how are we going to figure it out


---------52:45----------
what methodology are you going to use to


---------52:46----------
figure it out what do you mean man we're


---------52:48----------
going to figure it out


---------52:49----------
you can't just show up and figure it out


---------52:51----------
what if you don't figure it out


---------52:52----------
it's infuriating for them other people


---------52:56----------
are like a little bit more about like


---------52:59----------
analysis and measurement right


---------53:01----------
cool let's give it a shot but let's be


---------53:03----------
structured


---------53:05----------
in the way that we're gonna give it a


---------53:07----------
shot


---------53:08----------
right that's totally fine like let's try


---------53:10----------
white water rafting let's do a little


---------53:12----------
bit of research ahead of time and figure


---------53:14----------
out let's do one day of class one rapids


---------53:16----------
one day of class two rapids and one day


---------53:19----------
of class three rapids


---------53:20----------
and the vata is just going to show up


---------53:21----------
and he's like hey i'm here to white


---------53:23----------
water raft


---------53:24----------
let's go and then the bitter vata will


---------53:27----------
be like okay


---------53:28----------
let me read about let me read about


---------53:30----------
class one rapids class two rapids and


---------53:32----------
class


---------53:32----------
three rapids okay so it seems like class


---------53:35----------
one you can do if you're nine and older


---------53:37----------
and we're all adults


---------53:38----------
so actually why don't we try class two


---------53:40----------
first


---------53:41----------
and if we like class 2 or if it feels


---------53:44----------
too easy for us then we'll try class


---------53:46----------
3. you know it's kind of interesting but


---------53:48----------
like i know it sounds weird but


---------53:51----------
different humans default


---------53:54----------
to these different patterns this is an


---------53:57----------
observation that i am like 99 sure


---------54:01----------
if you tested and measured and i'm


---------54:02----------
pretty sure it has been in some way


---------54:04----------
so there's some like um research on


---------54:06----------
carnation for example which sort of like


---------54:08----------
verifies some of this stuff um that you


---------54:11----------
will discover that different humans


---------54:13----------
approach problems in different ways and


---------54:15----------
like you can just observe that in your


---------54:16----------
own life right like


---------54:18----------
you may just be like a hey let's just


---------54:19----------
see what happens kind of person


---------54:21----------
and like your partner is sort of like


---------54:23----------
let's organize


---------54:24----------
you know and and then people are going


---------54:26----------
to be kind of in the middle


---------54:29----------
so what what this sort of indicates is


---------54:31----------
that like when you


---------54:32----------
when you understand like what you are so


---------54:34----------
this is like what you know


---------54:35----------
different combinations of doshas look


---------54:38----------
like


---------54:39----------
so it's not just like innovation or


---------54:41----------
versus structure it's not like those are


---------54:43----------
you know mutually exclusive they're


---------54:45----------
actually like independent things so like


---------54:47----------
innovation plus structure


---------54:49----------
and then you kind of wind up with like


---------54:50----------
someone who's like a good program


---------54:51----------
developer


---------54:52----------
right so they can innovate but they're


---------54:54----------
going to create a lot of structure


---------54:55----------
around it


---------54:57----------
um so the next thing that we're going to


---------55:00----------
talk about


---------55:02----------
is remember we've got vata


---------55:08----------
right and then we've got the upper


---------55:10----------
threshold and the lower threshold


---------55:13----------
so remember that vata likes to innovate


---------55:16----------
so what happens if your vata is down


---------55:18----------
here


---------55:19----------
what happens if your pitta is down here


---------55:22----------
and what happens if your kapha is down


---------55:23----------
here


---------55:24----------
so there is a difference between having


---------55:27----------
low vata


---------55:29----------
and high kapha this is not the same


---------55:33----------
these are actually different things so


---------55:36----------
when we kind of when we simplify it what


---------55:38----------
we say


---------55:38----------
is that okay vat like wind and earth are


---------55:41----------
opposites


---------55:42----------
but the truth is that you can have a low


---------55:44----------
level of wind


---------55:46----------
or a high level of kapha and those may


---------55:48----------
appear to be the same


---------55:50----------
but they're not actually the same they


---------55:53----------
may overlap


---------55:54----------
but in in actuality the more you dig


---------55:56----------
into the details the more you'll see


---------55:58----------
their like nuanced perspectives here


---------56:00----------
so low vatas are


---------56:03----------
resistant to change right so you can say


---------56:07----------
oh


---------56:07----------
isn't that a guff of quality like yeah


---------56:09----------
sort of but you'll see kind of


---------56:13----------
differences right um so


---------56:17----------
uh lovatas are also tend to lack urgency


---------56:22----------
one of my favorites okay so like


---------56:25----------
they're not prone to panic easily


---------56:28----------
and then they also have um


---------56:30----------
[Music]


---------56:33----------
yeah so they lack urgency okay so then


---------56:35----------
you've got low kaphas


---------56:38----------
right so this person


---------56:41----------
and so low kaphas are going to


---------56:45----------
avoid procedures


---------56:50----------
and they're going to fight the system


---------56:54----------
right so this is a good example of like


---------56:57----------
so


---------56:58----------
i have some kapha


---------57:01----------
so the interesting thing is that i'm


---------57:03----------
willing to


---------57:04----------
jump in and innovate that's my


---------57:07----------
preference i don't want to develop a


---------57:08----------
structure ahead of time


---------57:10----------
but i'm not necessarily like resistant


---------57:12----------
to the system for the sake of being


---------57:14----------
resistant to the system


---------57:15----------
i will have some resistance to the


---------57:17----------
system but generally speaking like i


---------57:19----------
understand and see the value in systems


---------57:21----------
i think systems are fantastic i just


---------57:24----------
don't


---------57:25----------
care to develop them myself i'm like


---------57:27----------
that's great you guys build the system


---------57:29----------
i think the system is fantastic whereas


---------57:31----------
people who have very very low kapha will


---------57:33----------
be like


---------57:34----------
actively resistant to the system because


---------57:36----------
remember this is the threshold of


---------57:38----------
pathology right


---------57:39----------
so below this is when we start to see


---------57:42----------
negative


---------57:42----------
impacts so my cough is over here let's


---------57:45----------
say


---------57:47----------
and so it's like i still see the value


---------57:48----------
of a system i don't need to actively


---------57:50----------
fight against it


---------57:51----------
but when if my kapha gets drops kind of


---------57:53----------
a little bit too low then i'm going to


---------57:55----------
be like screw the system


---------57:56----------
the system sucks i don't want to use a


---------57:58----------
system i want to be free i want to be


---------58:00----------
uncaged


---------58:01----------
and that also you can say okay doesn't


---------58:02----------
that sound like very high vata in a


---------58:04----------
sense yes there's some overlap


---------58:06----------
but the more you get into the nuance


---------58:08----------
there's a difference between being high


---------58:10----------
vata and not


---------58:12----------
intuitively building a system


---------58:16----------
versus actively resisting the system


---------58:20----------
does that make sense and then let's talk


---------58:23----------
about lopez


---------58:28----------
so um


---------58:31----------
so lopez does have little attention to


---------58:34----------
detail


---------58:39----------
and tend to not resolve complexities


---------58:46----------
they tend to like keep things


---------58:48----------
disorganized


---------58:54----------
so now like you know now it's getting


---------58:56----------
kind of interesting right because like


---------58:57----------
i thought low vata was the opposite of i


---------59:00----------
mean uh high vota was the opposite of lo


---------59:02----------
kapha but


---------59:03----------
i'm super disorganized and isn't that


---------59:05----------
high vata


---------59:06----------
well it could be because you know


---------59:08----------
disorganization


---------59:10----------
much like you know vata kapha like


---------59:11----------
there's a there's a spectrum there right


---------59:14----------
and so lopita can actually have a


---------59:15----------
spectrum so this low bit that can have a


---------59:18----------
spectrum with high kapha


---------59:20----------
and a spectrum with high vata you guys


---------59:22----------
see that so it's not like


---------59:24----------
the two are actually opposite which is


---------59:25----------
sort of how i teach in a simplistic


---------59:27----------
sense


---------59:28----------
but the truth is that like the low level


---------59:30----------
of that thing manifests


---------59:32----------
in its own way right so like


---------59:35----------
and you may even say that you know low


---------59:37----------
people who have like


---------59:38----------
um very lopita have a pathologic


---------59:42----------
and you guys may know people like this


---------59:45----------
lack of


---------59:46----------
anger right so lope what the


---------59:50----------
bit does are not when we think about


---------59:51----------
someone who is a doormat


---------59:53----------
we may think okay if this person has a


---------59:55----------
high hp pool and they're a kapha


---------59:57----------
and they're like they're not gonna move


---------59:59----------
easily maybe they're a doormat


---------60:01----------
you may think okay kapha is like a


---------60:03----------
doormat is a cafe imbalance


---------60:06----------
but being a doormat could be having a


---------60:08----------
very low pitta


---------60:09----------
so like you just have a pathologically


---------60:11----------
low level of anger


---------60:13----------
and so you let people push you around


---------60:14----------
because you you're like not ambitious


---------60:17----------
right you're you're you have you lack


---------60:18----------
you have too little ambition


---------60:20----------
so you don't advocate for yourself you


---------60:22----------
don't fight for the promotion


---------60:24----------
and there could be cases of like lopet


---------60:26----------
then high guff in which case the problem


---------60:27----------
is exacerbated


---------60:29----------
um but you could also have you know


---------60:31----------
situations where like their kapha is


---------60:33----------
okay and like they're they're bitters


---------60:35----------
they're not like you know their cuff is


---------60:37----------
actually within balance and then they're


---------60:39----------
really the pathology is lopita okay


---------60:44----------
so this is sort of a more nuanced


---------60:48----------
perspective


---------60:49----------
and what you really find is that you


---------60:50----------
know human beings if you look at our


---------60:52----------
genetics right


---------60:53----------
the genetics behind vata pita and kapha


---------60:56----------
are very complicated so it's not like


---------60:58----------
there's one vata gene one bit the gene


---------61:00----------
and one coffee gene there are thousands


---------61:03----------
of different or tens of thousands or i


---------61:05----------
don't even know


---------61:06----------
really how many locations are but there


---------61:08----------
are tons and tons of locations


---------61:10----------
genes and there are different alleles


---------61:12----------
that may represent different levels of


---------61:14----------
vata


---------61:15----------
than kapha and so it's a whole symphony


---------61:18----------
of genetic stuff that creates an


---------61:20----------
individual balance


---------61:22----------
and in order to try to understand that


---------61:24----------
from a heuristic perspective which goes


---------61:26----------
back to


---------61:27----------
creating the framework there is no such


---------61:29----------
thing as vata pitta and kapha it just


---------61:31----------
correlates with your genes so this is a


---------61:33----------
simplified way of creating a framework


---------61:36----------
for introspection


---------61:37----------
but it does appear to correlate with


---------61:39----------
your actual genes


---------61:45----------
so now let's get to how do you determine


---------61:48----------
what you are


---------61:53----------
okay so if i've left somebody all in the


---------61:54----------
dust i apologize but


---------61:56----------
sorry this is like you really have to


---------61:57----------
understand the basics


---------61:59----------
um so


---------62:02----------
an ayurvedic physician does not take a


---------62:05----------
quiz


---------62:06----------
right that's not how they determine bush


---------62:08----------
an ayurvedic physician will do an


---------62:10----------
actual like complete body and mind


---------62:13----------
analysis


---------62:14----------
of a person so for example they will


---------62:16----------
look at your tongue


---------62:17----------
and people who are vata dominant have a


---------62:19----------
particular pattern of crap on their


---------62:21----------
tongue


---------62:22----------
bit the dominant will have a different


---------62:24----------
pattern of crap and guff


---------62:25----------
dominant will have a different pattern


---------62:27----------
of crap bittes


---------62:29----------
vatas tend to have crooked teeth pithas


---------62:32----------
tend to have back teeth that are yellow


---------62:34----------
kaphas tend to have like pretty


---------62:36----------
organized and straight teeth


---------62:39----------
they will look at your hair right so


---------62:41----------
like pittas will have a receding


---------62:44----------
hairline


---------62:45----------
and be prone to baldness vatas may have


---------62:48----------
a full head of hair but their hair will


---------62:50----------
be kinky and wavy


---------62:52----------
guffas will have sort of like smooth


---------62:54----------
straight luxurious hair


---------62:57----------
they'll also look at your mental


---------62:58----------
temperament so under stress do you


---------63:00----------
respond


---------63:01----------
when you're stressed out do you get


---------63:02----------
anxious do you get angry do you get


---------63:04----------
depressed


---------63:05----------
that's a component as well they'll also


---------63:07----------
look at things like your stools because


---------63:09----------
the digestions of people are different


---------63:11----------
vatas tend to be prone to hard stool and


---------63:15----------
complicate


---------63:15----------
uh constipation guffas will lay out


---------63:19----------
really solid logs that can be like kind


---------63:21----------
of a little bit


---------63:22----------
on the wetter side but this can have


---------63:26----------
kind of like watery stools mucousy


---------63:29----------
stools things like that


---------63:31----------
so it's kind of interesting like there's


---------63:33----------
all kinds of different correlations


---------63:34----------
right and if you think about what the


---------63:36----------
ayurvedic physicians were doing


---------63:38----------
and it sort of makes sense right because


---------63:39----------
your genes are going to affect a lot of


---------63:41----------
different processes


---------63:43----------
so you have like a gene that's active in


---------63:45----------
the mitochondria


---------63:46----------
and so if it affects your mitochondrial


---------63:48----------
function


---------63:50----------
the result of that mitochondria in a


---------63:53----------
gastrointestinal cell


---------63:55----------
will create one effect in a lung cell


---------63:58----------
will create a different effect


---------63:59----------
and in your brain will create a third


---------64:01----------
effect and your skin will create a


---------64:03----------
fourth effect


---------64:04----------
which is how we get to the fact that


---------64:06----------
like they correlate


---------64:07----------
vata with skin stool


---------64:10----------
right because this remember that there's


---------64:12----------
this is a genetic basis so it's not


---------64:14----------
organ system dependent our our system of


---------64:17----------
science


---------64:18----------
in the west is very organ system


---------64:19----------
dependent we think about the liver as


---------64:21----------
being completely separate from the heart


---------64:23----------
but if you go on a deeper level and you


---------64:25----------
look at the genetic level


---------64:26----------
there may be some kind of metabolic


---------64:28----------
effects which are


---------64:29----------
at the cellular or genetic level which


---------64:32----------
will manifest


---------64:33----------
in different ways depending on which


---------64:35----------
organ you're looking at and that's


---------64:36----------
literally what ayurvedic physicians do


---------64:39----------
it's fascinating okay


---------64:42----------
so how do you determine your dosha a


---------64:44----------
real ayurvedic physician will look at


---------64:46----------
all of these things


---------64:47----------
but one of the key things that they do


---------64:49----------
which works really well is pulse


---------64:51----------
diagnosis


---------64:52----------
so we're going to teach you this today


---------64:54----------
okay


---------64:55----------
so what they'll do is look at your pulse


---------64:57----------
and your pulse has a lot more


---------65:00----------
than rate and rhythm to it according to


---------65:03----------
the ayurvedic physicians


---------65:04----------
what they claim is that you can actually


---------65:07----------
make


---------65:07----------
correlations between your pulse and your


---------65:11----------
dosha


---------65:12----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------65:13----------
we're going to teach all this today so


---------65:15----------
like


---------65:16----------
this is what i want you to do i want you


---------65:18----------
to take your left hand


---------65:20----------
and i want you to take three fingers so


---------65:21----------
in ayurveda they say that


---------65:23----------
the pulse should be checked in men on


---------65:25----------
the right wrist


---------65:26----------
and in women on the left wrist i don't


---------65:29----------
really know why


---------65:30----------
but we're gonna i'm gonna just teach you


---------65:31----------
guys right wrist i don't know what


---------65:33----------
happens if you're transgender


---------65:35----------
i don't know um so we're going to take


---------65:38----------
three fingers


---------65:39----------
okay so you have your index finger


---------65:43----------
your middle finger and your ring finger


---------65:46----------
and what we're gonna do


---------65:48----------
is place it on the radial


---------65:51----------
artery which is right here okay so what


---------65:54----------
you're gonna find i don't


---------65:55----------
like this is like you're gonna be able


---------65:58----------
to feel your like you guys know how you


---------65:59----------
check your pulse right here


---------66:01----------
right you feel over here


---------66:05----------
okay and you should be able to check


---------66:07----------
your pulse so the first thing that we're


---------66:09----------
going to do and this is going to be our


---------66:10----------
meditation for the day okay


---------66:12----------
is i want you guys to be able to feel


---------66:14----------
your pulse at your radial artery with a


---------66:18----------
single finger or right hand facing up


---------66:24----------
okay so


---------66:28----------
feel around a little bit so what you'll


---------66:29----------
feel is there's a bone right here


---------66:32----------
let me see if i can there's a bone right


---------66:33----------
here and right to the left


---------66:35----------
i mean sorry yeah to the left of the


---------66:38----------
bone


---------66:39----------
on your right hand is going to be where


---------66:41----------
you can feel the pulse


---------66:46----------
yeah move a little bit more proximal so


---------66:48----------
move towards the elbow


---------66:50----------
okay


---------66:54----------
full screen the bone okay


---------66:58----------
let's see if we can find you guys


---------67:15----------
okay


---------67:21----------
so here's your radial artery here's the


---------67:23----------
radius


---------67:24----------
and the bone that you're going to feel


---------67:27----------
is probably the


---------67:28----------
head of the radius which is right here


---------67:30----------
so this


---------67:31----------
bump is what you're going to feel is the


---------67:32----------
bone and the the radial artery is right


---------67:35----------
next to it


---------67:37----------
okay let me see if i can find another


---------67:39----------
here we go


---------67:42----------
oh jesus okay


---------67:45----------
so here's the


---------67:50----------
conventional radial artery i suppose


---------67:53----------
right so it's like right here so it's


---------67:54----------
kind of like below your thenar eminence


---------67:57----------
so this fat part of your thumb


---------68:01----------
i've it's been a while guys i'm a


---------68:03----------
psychiatrist so i don't do a whole lot


---------68:04----------
of anatomy


---------68:05----------
but if you know medical school 11 years


---------68:08----------
ago


---------68:10----------
rusty then our eminence and if you kind


---------68:13----------
of go


---------68:14----------
beneath the thenar eminence right on the


---------68:17----------
left side


---------68:17----------
like at the end of the thenar eminence


---------68:20----------
so if you look at my hand


---------68:22----------
like right here like below this is the


---------68:24----------
radial artery you guys see


---------68:25----------
like this is my thenar eminence


---------68:29----------
and then you kind of go below it okay


---------68:32----------
i know chat listen i didn't say today


---------68:35----------
was gonna be easy


---------68:36----------
okay or this is for advanced people


---------68:41----------
okay so what we're gonna do is and


---------68:44----------
once you find the the


---------68:48----------
the radial artery then what we're gonna


---------68:49----------
do is we're gonna take three fingers and


---------68:51----------
we're going to put them kind of next to


---------68:52----------
each other


---------68:53----------
and then what i want you guys to do is


---------68:55----------
press on your radial artery so that you


---------68:57----------
can feel


---------68:58----------
all three so you can feel the pulse


---------69:01----------
under all three fingers


---------69:02----------
and what you're going to need to do is


---------69:04----------
probably press a little bit harder on


---------69:06----------
this finger


---------69:08----------
sorry like harder on this finger like a


---------69:11----------
little harder on the middle finger and


---------69:13----------
then this finger can be quite light


---------69:14----------
so you're actually going to press down


---------69:16----------
like this


---------69:17----------
so the least pressure over here a little


---------69:19----------
bit more pressure over here


---------69:21----------
and the most pressure over here okay


---------69:28----------
and then what i want you to do is pay


---------69:29----------
attention


---------69:31----------
to the feeling of your pulse


---------69:35----------
and what you'll see is that it's not


---------69:37----------
uniform


---------69:38----------
across all three


---------69:42----------
okay don't need to apply lube


---------69:45----------
don't press too hard just press press


---------69:48----------
just enough to feel it


---------69:53----------
okay and what you'll discover


---------69:56----------
i'll show you guys in a second what


---------69:59----------
you'll discover


---------70:01----------
is


---------70:07----------
that the pulse is not uniform so one


---------70:10----------
person


---------70:11----------
may have a pulse like this


---------70:14----------
one person may have a pulse like this


---------70:18----------
one person may have a pulse like this


---------70:22----------
and so actually when people were teach


---------70:24----------
pulse diagnosis


---------70:26----------
what they equate it to is animal gait


---------70:29----------
so there's a rabbit pulse there's an


---------70:33----------
ox pulse there is a goat pulse


---------70:37----------
there's a deer pulse there's a horse


---------70:39----------
pulse


---------70:40----------
and what they're essentially doing is


---------70:42----------
finding these different patterns


---------70:44----------
of pulsation right so or your pulse


---------70:46----------
could be like this


---------70:49----------
and so what i want you all to do for a


---------70:51----------
few seconds is just close your eyes


---------70:54----------
and see snake pulse is actually one of


---------70:56----------
them


---------70:58----------
and see if you can feel the pulse


---------71:04----------
right and this is where you may say oh


---------71:06----------
okay but like it feels the strongest


---------71:08----------
with my ring finger


---------71:11----------
and so if you press down a little bit


---------71:12----------
that's why we're going to alter the


---------71:13----------
pressure


---------71:14----------
and the pressure really shouldn't affect


---------71:16----------
the pulse i know it sounds bizarre


---------71:18----------
um just like other bizarre things did


---------71:20----------
you know that


---------71:21----------
how hard you breathe out how forcefully


---------71:23----------
you exhale does not


---------71:24----------
affect the length of your exhalation


---------71:27----------
it's crazy


---------71:30----------
um you exhale the same the same distance


---------71:33----------
every breath


---------71:34----------
no matter how hard you breathe a lot of


---------71:37----------
weird things about the body that the


---------71:38----------
yogis discovered


---------71:41----------
so just close your eyes and feel the


---------71:42----------
pulse right feel where you feel it


---------71:47----------
and you may also notice that not every


---------71:49----------
beat is the same


---------72:06----------
okay


---------72:14----------
so the um i'm not sure if this is


---------72:18----------
actually correct but


---------72:19----------
i'm using my ring finger on top like


---------72:22----------
closest to the edge of my hand so the


---------72:25----------
ring finger is closest to the thenar


---------72:27----------
eminence in your palm


---------72:29----------
so it goes so


---------72:32----------
okay yeah


---------72:37----------
so this is how i'm doing it this is the


---------72:40----------
ring finger right and this is


---------72:42----------
the hand so you can also do i mean you


---------72:46----------
could do it like this but i'm i'm doing


---------72:48----------
it like this


---------72:50----------
it's hard to show oh my god how can i


---------72:52----------
show this


---------72:54----------
there we go if that can see that that's


---------72:56----------
how i'm doing it


---------72:58----------
okay


---------73:03----------
so


---------73:06----------
you know it's kind of weird i i get it's


---------73:09----------
a weird experience


---------73:11----------
so in terms of the meditation technique


---------73:13----------
here's


---------73:14----------
how we can sort of use it as a dot or


---------73:16----------
not right so


---------73:17----------
we don't know i mean i i'm not qualified


---------73:19----------
i don't know pulse diagnosis


---------73:22----------
so i've i've met some ayurvedic


---------73:23----------
physicians for example that can diagnose


---------73:25----------
pregnancy


---------73:26----------
impulse diagnosis it is wild


---------73:30----------
um and and so it's it's it's bizarre


---------73:33----------
like they can accurately diagnose


---------73:35----------
pregnancy through pulse diagnosis which


---------73:36----------
sounds unbelievable


---------73:38----------
um but uh


---------73:42----------
you know i don't know pulse diagnosis


---------73:46----------
um but i i do think that it can be a


---------73:49----------
useful kind of like meditation right so


---------73:51----------
it's


---------73:51----------
hard enough so like remember that the


---------73:53----------
goals of a toddler are to bring your


---------73:54----------
attention to the present


---------73:56----------
and sort of to be able to detect subtle


---------73:57----------
things so you may notice that you know


---------73:59----------
in order to really feel the pulse you


---------74:01----------
have to find the right balance your


---------74:03----------
your fingers have to push just as much


---------74:05----------
as you want them to to feel it


---------74:07----------
and that um uh you also


---------74:11----------
need to concentrate right like if your


---------74:13----------
mind is distracted you're not going to


---------74:14----------
be able to feel the subtle nuances


---------74:18----------
um


---------74:28----------
yeah so how how do we diagnose sardosha


---------74:31----------
so essentially these different patterns


---------74:34----------
will result in different doshas so i


---------74:36----------
forget exactly what it is but i think


---------74:38----------
maybe


---------74:38----------
the um the vata pulse


---------74:42----------
is closest to the so if you have the the


---------74:44----------
strongest spike


---------74:46----------
is near the wrist your dominant if it's


---------74:48----------
in the middle your bit the dominant and


---------74:50----------
if it's


---------74:51----------
deeper in your cuff if it's closest to


---------74:53----------
your shoulder it's kapha dominant it


---------74:55----------
could be wrong it's one one way or the


---------74:57----------
other


---------74:57----------
but i think that's just a very simple


---------74:59----------
thing i i think the real people who


---------75:00----------
understand pulse diagnosis will look at


---------75:02----------
that pattern


---------75:03----------
and based on the pattern of the three


---------75:05----------
things they'll determine your dosha


---------75:09----------
now the tricky thing there is that if


---------75:10----------
you look at it anatomically


---------75:14----------
the radial artery is the most


---------75:17----------
superficial closest to the palm which


---------75:20----------
means that just like


---------75:21----------
based on anatomy you're gonna everyone


---------75:23----------
is gonna feel


---------75:24----------
the strongest pulse in uh closest to the


---------75:28----------
palm


---------75:28----------
so everyone will diagnose themselves as


---------75:30----------
vata but and that's why you have to


---------75:32----------
learn how to press


---------75:34----------
with more force to balance


---------75:37----------
the depth of the tissue


---------75:42----------
right so yeah


---------75:46----------
and that's pulse diagnosis so the the


---------75:47----------
question of okay how do i determine


---------75:50----------
my dorsha we can give you questionnaires


---------75:52----------
like so


---------75:53----------
to my knowledge no questionnaire has


---------75:55----------
actually been like scientifically


---------75:57----------
validated


---------75:57----------
in a very rigorous way


---------76:01----------
um you know actual physicians will use


---------76:04----------
different kinds of like features and


---------76:06----------
they'll sort of be able to tell


---------76:08----------
so i'm like pretty decent at diagnosing


---------76:10----------
people as like mata pete and kaffa


---------76:12----------
um but you know my system has to do a


---------76:15----------
lot with like bone structure


---------76:16----------
the prominence of veins on the back of


---------76:18----------
your hand


---------76:20----------
also will determine your dosha


---------76:24----------
so like all of those factors then you'll


---------76:25----------
kind of see okay this person is like six


---------76:27----------
predominantly vata predominantly fit the


---------76:29----------
predominantly kapha


---------76:31----------
and i do believe that in our lifetime we


---------76:34----------
will have


---------76:35----------
hopefully personalized genetic tests


---------76:38----------
which will tell you what your dosha is


---------76:42----------
right so things


---------76:46----------
so it's hard to see but


---------76:51----------
so like if you look at the veins i guess


---------76:53----------
it's hard to see this way but


---------76:58----------
um or actually just look at look at the


---------77:01----------
my tendons you guys see how my tendons


---------77:02----------
are very visible when i flex my hand


---------77:05----------
like my hand is like thin so like you


---------77:07----------
can see the tendons like popping out


---------77:10----------
right like this so that's like it's a


---------77:12----------
very vata hand


---------77:13----------
because there's not like flesh or tissue


---------77:16----------
over it


---------77:17----------
those are tendons but it's hard to see


---------77:19----------
on camera with the veins


---------77:21----------
oh man i wish i could hear let me just


---------77:22----------
shoot this


---------77:24----------
so hard to see you guys see that


---------77:28----------
that's about the hand


---------77:31----------
it's hard because i have to hold up my


---------77:33----------
hand


---------77:38----------
and then when i hold it up the veins


---------77:39----------
start to


---------77:41----------
sink in a little bit right so like


---------77:44----------
you'll have like


---------77:45----------
thickness of different people's like


---------77:48----------
hands like some people like you won't


---------77:50----------
they won't stick out


---------77:54----------
right and so if we think about it um


---------78:03----------
so so it's complicated because remember


---------78:05----------
that the whole point so once you


---------78:07----------
once we recognize that ayurveda


---------78:09----------
correlates with your genetics your genes


---------78:11----------
are in


---------78:12----------
every cell and therefore your your dosha


---------78:15----------
will manifest in each part of your body


---------78:19----------
or your being right and so depending on


---------78:22----------
which


---------78:22----------
alleles are at which locations that's


---------78:25----------
what will manifest in a particular


---------78:27----------
like cell so even my mind is


---------78:29----------
predominantly vata


---------78:31----------
but i absolutely have some degree of


---------78:32----------
pitta and


---------78:34----------
emotionally i'm very kapha so it's


---------78:37----------
interesting because like emotionally


---------78:38----------
like i don't get


---------78:39----------
upset easily i thought that was due to


---------78:41----------
my yogic training


---------78:43----------
but i recently spoke with an ayurvedic


---------78:44----------
colleague from mind and she's like no


---------78:46----------
you're actually like it's not your


---------78:48----------
it's not the yogic training you're just


---------78:49----------
emotionally cough i was like damn


---------78:51----------
that's interesting so it's interesting


---------78:55----------
right because each of these dimensions


---------78:57----------
each aspect of your body your teeth your


---------78:59----------
bone structure


---------79:00----------
your hair your eyes um so even like the


---------79:04----------
amount


---------79:04----------
of eyelid over the iris of your eye


---------79:08----------
effect is correlated with your dosha


---------79:11----------
your stool


---------79:11----------
your your digestion your hunger all of


---------79:14----------
that stuff correlates with ayurveda


---------79:17----------
so we've got a time for a couple things


---------79:20----------
so we can do


---------79:22----------
two options one is i can teach all a


---------79:25----------
little bit about conflict


---------79:27----------
between different doshas um


---------79:31----------
and or what we can do is uh


---------79:34----------
oh so another just simple example or


---------79:36----------
what we can do is just answer questions


---------79:38----------
and i'm leaning towards


---------79:39----------
answering questions um


---------79:43----------
what did i want to say i wanted to say


---------79:45----------
something oh yeah and the other thing is


---------79:46----------
metabolism oh my god metabolism is so


---------79:49----------
clearly there are three buckets of


---------79:52----------
people right so like


---------79:53----------
if you guys have heard the terms um


---------79:56----------
ectomorph endomorph and mesomorph these


---------79:59----------
like this is people have noticed that


---------80:01----------
there are big boned people


---------80:02----------
and people with fast metabolisms and you


---------80:05----------
can feed both people the same stuff


---------80:07----------
and they like one will not gain weight


---------80:09----------
and one will gain weight


---------80:11----------
right so this is something that we've


---------80:12----------
like observed in like there's been


---------80:14----------
science


---------80:14----------
scientific exploration of the three


---------80:17----------
metabolic types which is like


---------80:18----------
yeah i've just been saying that for


---------80:20----------
thousands of years


---------80:30----------
okay okay let's do questions


---------80:40----------
okay what questions let me see actually


---------80:42----------
real quick um


---------80:54----------
what about vatakapha


---------80:58----------
okay


---------81:00----------
so people with high metabolisms are vata


---------81:02----------
is generally speaking yes


---------81:04----------
so remember when we say arvatas


---------81:10----------
any one part of your body does not


---------81:12----------
determine your dosha right like so the


---------81:14----------
doshik determinant


---------81:15----------
is based on all the aspects of your body


---------81:18----------
so you may have


---------81:19----------
avata metabolism but may have like a


---------81:22----------
kapha mind


---------81:23----------
or like you know bit the veins


---------81:26----------
so the way that we determine is that


---------81:28----------
like you know the more


---------81:29----------
the greater percentage of your genes


---------81:31----------
that are vata


---------81:33----------
the higher number of vata features


---------81:36----------
you'll have


---------81:37----------
does that make sense


---------81:43----------
uh you missed scafavata what do you mean


---------81:46----------
i missed scuff i thought we talked about


---------81:47----------
program development


---------81:51----------
so like that's a good example of um


---------81:55----------
what okay so if you guys want to


---------81:56----------
understand of vata kapha so remember


---------81:59----------
that there


---------82:00----------
are different dimensions of it okay so


---------82:03----------
like


---------82:03----------
um you know your metabolism or bone


---------82:06----------
structure so i've seen this a lot where


---------82:08----------
you'll have


---------82:09----------
kapha body types with vata mines so like


---------82:12----------
you can be


---------82:13----------
big boned and have really really bad


---------82:15----------
adhd


---------82:16----------
right it's not like everyone who's big


---------82:19----------
boned has depression


---------82:20----------
you can have really bad anxiety and and


---------82:23----------
be big boat


---------82:25----------
um so there's absolutely like vata kapha


---------82:28----------
hybrids uh i even said myself like so


---------82:31----------
emotionally i'm very kapha where like


---------82:32----------
it's hard to get me


---------82:34----------
to be really upset so i tend to be like


---------82:36----------
pretty tranquil in that way


---------82:38----------
but i my mind is all over the place um


---------82:41----------
in terms of what's the counterpart


---------82:45----------
to the dev


---------82:49----------
oh oh what's oh i see so so the the


---------82:51----------
kapha vata


---------82:52----------
is a program developer and let me think


---------82:55----------
about avatar


---------82:57----------
um


---------83:01----------
so i'd say like a vata kapha is like


---------83:06----------
an innovator who also like uses a lot of


---------83:09----------
structure


---------83:10----------
so not necessarily organizing but like a


---------83:13----------
avatar kapha maybe someone who is very


---------83:17----------
structured


---------83:17----------
in the way that they innovate for


---------83:20----------
example


---------83:21----------
right so even if you look at researchers


---------83:24----------
so there are different kinds of


---------83:25----------
researchers right there are researchers


---------83:27----------
who will


---------83:27----------
form hypotheses based on intuition


---------83:31----------
and there were researchers who will form


---------83:32----------
hypotheses based on data


---------83:34----------
so i'll go to an academic medical center


---------83:36----------
and talk to a research lab


---------83:39----------
and you know we'll see like vata kapha


---------83:42----------
conflicts within the lab


---------83:44----------
even though everyone's a researcher


---------83:47----------
so i i think that like you know the vata


---------83:49----------
kapha which one did i talk about yeah so


---------83:51----------
coffee vata will be like a program


---------83:52----------
developer


---------83:53----------
and like avata kaffa will be someone


---------83:55----------
who's like structurally focused or even


---------83:57----------
like


---------83:57----------
tools or methodology focused but still


---------84:00----------
be like innovating


---------84:01----------
so they may be all about so even like


---------84:04----------
this


---------84:04----------
you know so i think if you wanted to


---------84:06----------
develop a system of ayurvedic


---------84:08----------
personality analysis


---------84:09----------
i think avatar kapha would be a really


---------84:11----------
good person for it


---------84:13----------
right because they're they're going to


---------84:14----------
be thinking a little bit about how do i


---------84:15----------
create this structure


---------84:17----------
for systematically assessing


---------84:21----------
a relatively new concept


---------84:25----------
does that help do animals have doshas


---------84:29----------
yes


---------84:32----------
so this is the other interesting thing


---------84:35----------
ayurvedic physicians are veterinarians


---------84:38----------
there's no difference


---------84:42----------
it's neat


---------84:46----------
they'll prescribe medicine to pet snakes


---------84:50----------
they'll treat cows for illness


---------84:58----------
no difference they're trained in it i


---------85:01----------
don't know about nowadays but


---------85:02----------
historically


---------85:03----------
like if you go to like indian villages


---------85:06----------
right and there's like a village doctor


---------85:08----------
they will treat your goat and they will


---------85:10----------
treat your child


---------85:18----------
if you kind of think about it right like


---------85:20----------
i mean like i was thinking about doing a


---------85:22----------
little bit of veterinary


---------85:23----------
medicine you know doing a little pet


---------85:25----------
therapy we prescribe ssris apparently to


---------85:28----------
like dogs with anxiety now


---------85:30----------
right part of my therapy practice is


---------85:33----------
cats


---------85:34----------
they show up for their hourly


---------85:36----------
appointment once a week


---------85:37----------
you know i sit down they lay down on the


---------85:39----------
freudian couch we do a little bit of


---------85:41----------
psychoanalysis


---------85:43----------
they feel better about themselves it's


---------85:45----------
great


---------85:48----------
pet therapy is a thing chat as is pet


---------85:51----------
antidepressant and anti-anxiety


---------85:53----------
medication


---------85:55----------
so probably within our lifetime we'll


---------85:56----------
also see veterinary psychiatrists


---------86:00----------
right because you can actually diet you


---------86:02----------
can diagnose there


---------86:03----------
are dogs who are on ssris


---------86:07----------
because if you think about it you know


---------86:08----------
what's really like so if you know


---------86:12----------
if i if a dog has a staph infection and


---------86:14----------
i have a staph infection antibiotics is


---------86:16----------
both of it like we know that dogs get


---------86:18----------
cancer right like we know that dogs get


---------86:20----------
heart disease


---------86:26----------
it's interesting yeah someone's like my


---------86:29----------
mom's dog takes prosthetics yeah it


---------86:31----------
blows my mind but


---------86:43----------
ah what about people who have the same


---------86:45----------
amount of each dosha


---------86:47----------
so there are that's a great great


---------86:48----------
question so this is where


---------86:50----------
once again not really scientifically


---------86:51----------
based now okay but more from corporate


---------86:53----------
consulting


---------86:54----------
you all may notice that there are people


---------86:56----------
in your social circles or group projects


---------86:58----------
or whatever who are essentially like


---------87:00----------
mediators and they'll kind of like tap


---------87:04----------
into whatever is deficient so


---------87:07----------
you know like like the the three doshik


---------87:10----------
person


---------87:11----------
is the bard from d and d they do a


---------87:15----------
little bit of everything


---------87:16----------
they're not the best caster they're not


---------87:18----------
the best warrior they've got a couple of


---------87:19----------
thief skills


---------87:20----------
and i think even in 5 5e they can even


---------87:23----------
cast a little bit right they've got some


---------87:24----------
like divine spells and some like


---------87:26----------
arcane spells so like there are people


---------87:29----------
like that


---------87:30----------
like in your social circles there will


---------87:31----------
be like you know the one person who


---------87:33----------
organizes your parties


---------87:35----------
and when that person isn't around


---------87:36----------
someone steps up there's the one person


---------87:39----------
who's sort of like the sympathetic


---------87:40----------
listener and good friend and when


---------87:41----------
they're


---------87:42----------
when that not when they're not around


---------87:44----------
this other person steps up they're sort


---------87:46----------
of the druids


---------87:47----------
from wow right like i've got cat druid


---------87:50----------
i've got bear form i've got healing


---------87:51----------
druid and i've got moonkin


---------87:53----------
i can change shape and sort of tap into


---------87:56----------
whatever role is necessary


---------87:59----------
and and some people may think well isn't


---------88:00----------
that what you want and the answer is


---------88:02----------
like not really because if you get


---------88:04----------
you know a bunch of druids you're not


---------88:07----------
going to get like if you have a party


---------88:08----------
full of bards


---------88:10----------
like it's not necessarily more effective


---------88:13----------
or even as


---------88:14----------
effective as like a party where you've


---------88:16----------
got like a fighter a wizard a cleric and


---------88:18----------
a rogue


---------88:19----------
right sometimes you want specialization


---------88:22----------
and sometimes you want


---------88:23----------
the glue that gets all the pieces to


---------88:25----------
stick together


---------88:28----------
right so when someone's saying no dps no


---------88:30----------
like bards can do some dps


---------88:32----------
right so try dorsi people can do


---------88:35----------
everything to a decent degree


---------88:37----------
but you know i don't know that they'll


---------88:39----------
be like


---------88:40----------
brilliant you know in innovators


---------88:44----------
or develop the best structure they kind


---------88:46----------
of supplement they're kind of hybrid


---------88:48----------
classes


---------88:53----------
yeah jack of all trades master of none


---------88:54----------
is the tradoship person


---------88:57----------
so the the reason that i call them


---------88:59----------
mediators the the real benefit


---------89:01----------
of of um tridoshik people


---------89:04----------
is not so much in the highs it's


---------89:06----------
actually in the absence of lows that's


---------89:08----------
what makes them so good on a team


---------89:11----------
they're like you know the lubricant for


---------89:13----------
the team


---------89:14----------
because the tridoshik people are not


---------89:16----------
resistant


---------89:17----------
to change they're not resistant to


---------89:19----------
structure and they're not resistant to


---------89:21----------
like


---------89:22----------
organization so like they don't get into


---------89:24----------
trouble with anyone


---------89:26----------
i mean they can still be you know like


---------89:28----------
mean and stuff


---------89:29----------
but they don't have like the the


---------89:31----------
workplace kind of conflicts


---------89:34----------
where so like we have this all the time


---------89:35----------
we're like you know i'm vata so one of


---------89:37----------
the biggest


---------89:38----------
challenges here at hg is like i will


---------89:40----------
have an idea


---------89:42----------
and i will say like hey chat let's do


---------89:44----------
this and then everyone's like oh my god


---------89:46----------
now we actually have to make that happen


---------89:48----------
and there's a whole team that's like you


---------89:50----------
can't go around


---------89:51----------
just promising things to chat because we


---------89:54----------
have to make that happen


---------89:57----------
um and so you know there are advantages


---------89:59----------
and disadvantages of each one and a lot


---------90:00----------
of our conflict and a lot of our


---------90:02----------
conflict resolution


---------90:03----------
has been figuring out like how i can


---------90:05----------
work with the more bit the people and


---------90:06----------
how i can work with the more kapha


---------90:08----------
people


---------90:08----------
which i absolutely need because you all


---------90:10----------
may know this but if you have a party


---------90:11----------
full of vatas it's like


---------90:13----------
everyone's got brilliant ideas and


---------90:15----------
nothing ever gets done


---------90:19----------
is laziness tied to dorsa not really


---------90:24----------
so this is where you know there's


---------90:25----------
another concept which we haven't really


---------90:26----------
explained which is


---------90:28----------
gunas


---------90:32----------
um so i think we're gonna actually talk


---------90:34----------
a little bit about this maybe on monday


---------90:37----------
uh but we're gonna give you guys a


---------90:38----------
slightly different perspective on


---------90:39----------
motivation


---------90:40----------
so we think about laziness as a trait


---------90:43----------
right it's an aspect of your personality


---------90:46----------
so like a person is lazy we don't think


---------90:48----------
about laziness


---------90:50----------
as a fluctuating state in our conception


---------90:53----------
but in in reality it absolutely is


---------90:56----------
right there are some days that you're


---------90:57----------
more lazy than other days


---------90:59----------
and so what that actually comes down to


---------91:01----------
the best explanation of the


---------91:03----------
state of laziness which i think western


---------91:05----------
science is very poor at like we don't


---------91:08----------
like you know we think about laziness


---------91:12----------
in terms of things like five factor


---------91:13----------
model where it's like high


---------91:14----------
conscientiousness or low


---------91:16----------
conscientiousness


---------91:17----------
it's an aspect of your personality


---------91:19----------
whereas like all you have to do to be


---------91:20----------
less lazy or more lazy is change your


---------91:23----------
diet you all know this like if i eat


---------91:25----------
six slices of pizza and have a couple


---------91:27----------
beers what happens to my motivation


---------91:31----------
right whereas if i'm like eating food


---------91:33----------
that's healthy if i start to exercise


---------91:34----------
things like that


---------91:35----------
i'm gonna feel more motivated and that


---------91:38----------
has to do with a concept in


---------91:39----------
in kind of eastern thinking called the


---------91:41----------
gunas so there are three gunas there's a


---------91:44----------
sattvas rajas and tamas sattvas is the


---------91:46----------
quality that makes us


---------91:48----------
balanced and clean rajas is the quality


---------91:51----------
that makes


---------91:52----------
us active and passionate and tamas is


---------91:55----------
the


---------91:55----------
quality that makes us dull and inert


---------91:58----------
and our society is overwhelmingly has


---------92:01----------
thompsic influences


---------92:03----------
and vata influences so as a society


---------92:06----------
we are over where our vata is elevated


---------92:10----------
and our thomas is elevated so we tend to


---------92:12----------
be like


---------92:13----------
a little bit like it's hard for us to do


---------92:16----------
stuff


---------92:17----------
and if we look at things like twitter


---------92:19----------
the primary twitter is very rajsic


---------92:22----------
so like twitter like gets people riled


---------92:24----------
up right it doesn't make people


---------92:25----------
calm it gets people like kind of riled


---------92:27----------
up


---------92:29----------
and so in the ayurvedic treatment of


---------92:31----------
depression part of that is if you've got


---------92:32----------
a thumb sick disturbance you actually


---------92:34----------
want to


---------92:34----------
engage rajas first so you want to bring


---------92:37----------
out people's activity and passion


---------92:39----------
and once you have a nice balance between


---------92:42----------
inertia and passion


---------92:43----------
then you can become calm


---------92:47----------
so anyway we'll talk more about this on


---------92:49----------
monday


---------92:51----------
last questions


---------92:56----------
will there be a stream on more spiritual


---------92:58----------
stuff like karma absolutely


---------93:00----------
so this is the challenge that we have i


---------93:01----------
don't know what y'all thought about this


---------93:03----------
i guess


---------93:04----------
okay so not that low but so here's the


---------93:07----------
challenge with stream is i can teach


---------93:09----------
this advanced stuff about ayurveda and


---------93:11----------
like i don't know


---------93:12----------
what percentage of people will be left


---------93:15----------
behind


---------93:17----------
so the real challenge on stream is that


---------93:18----------
people come in and out


---------93:20----------
and that a lot of people may not have


---------93:21----------
the sufficient prereqs


---------93:23----------
this is why it is hard to teach advanced


---------93:26----------
or newest nuanced concepts on stream


---------93:29----------
so this is why we like do things like


---------93:30----------
interviews and q a because we all start


---------93:32----------
in the same place like


---------93:33----------
when someone shows up on stream i have


---------93:35----------
no idea what they're going to talk about


---------93:38----------
and so we're all starting together which


---------93:40----------
makes it a good experience for everyone


---------93:42----------
involved


---------93:43----------
in terms of q a we're also starting


---------93:46----------
together right


---------93:47----------
we all see the question and i'm gonna


---------93:49----------
answer it so we're all in the same place


---------93:52----------
um when it comes to advanced concepts


---------93:57----------
what we're doing so i'd say like you


---------93:59----------
know did you understand this if you guys


---------94:00----------
watch


---------94:01----------
stream on wednesday did you understand


---------94:06----------
i guess that more people would be


---------94:10----------
you know in the yes column um


---------94:14----------
and yeah so people come in later are


---------94:18----------
screwed right so


---------94:19----------
that's that's where if we think about


---------94:21----------
advantages and disadvantages of stream


---------94:23----------
stream is a very like vata oriented


---------94:28----------
platform right it's live it's dynamic


---------94:32----------
there's interaction chat is spamming you


---------94:34----------
during streaming


---------94:35----------
people are coming in people are going


---------94:37----------
out it's very different from a lecture


---------94:39----------
that has a start time


---------94:41----------
and so like there are some kinds of


---------94:43----------
teaching which work better in vata


---------94:45----------
environments


---------94:46----------
right like socratic teaching works


---------94:47----------
really well i can ask you all questions


---------94:49----------
you can ask me questions


---------94:51----------
it's live it's organic it's it's fun and


---------94:54----------
then


---------94:54----------
that's why we made dr k's guide because


---------94:56----------
it's not ideal for everything so


---------94:58----------
if you guys want to learn about mantra


---------95:00----------
and spirituality and stuff like that you


---------95:02----------
have to start at the


---------95:03----------
the basics what is the nature of the


---------95:06----------
universe because unless you understand


---------95:08----------
the nature of the universe


---------95:09----------
how a mantra works is is going to be


---------95:11----------
like you're going to be missing


---------95:12----------
something right


---------95:14----------
um if you want to understand karma like


---------95:16----------
okay what is like what are the


---------95:17----------
assumptions of like the meditative world


---------95:19----------
view like how does


---------95:20----------
how do the yogis view the world and then


---------95:23----------
you can understand karma


---------95:25----------
if you want to understand things like


---------95:27----------
spiritual experience


---------95:28----------
like you have to understand like okay


---------95:30----------
what is a spiritual experience it


---------95:32----------
depends on what a person is


---------95:33----------
what the what the world is what the


---------95:35----------
universe is then you can understand the


---------95:37----------
spiritual experience in the right


---------95:38----------
context


---------95:41----------
um so i think that's kind of the


---------95:43----------
challenge so i think for a lot of these


---------95:44----------
questions and


---------95:45----------
this is what we try to do so you know we


---------95:48----------
made a guide because it's start to


---------95:50----------
finish


---------95:50----------
it's a ton of start to finish


---------95:52----------
information about ayurveda


---------95:54----------
uh the challenge on stream is we've been


---------95:56----------
talking for two hours and i haven't


---------95:57----------
given anyone a solution yet because it's


---------95:59----------
like hard to do every like i can't do


---------96:01----------
everything on stream


---------96:02----------
and the problem with doing everything on


---------96:04----------
stream you're like yeah but like you can


---------96:05----------
but not really because


---------96:07----------
if someone's coming into stream now and


---------96:09----------
i start giving solutions and they


---------96:11----------
haven't heard the first two hours


---------96:12----------
they're going to have even no idea what


---------96:13----------
we're talking about


---------96:15----------
so the effective way to um


---------96:18----------
you know teach like sort of depends like


---------96:20----------
we want to use stream for particular


---------96:22----------
things


---------96:22----------
dr k's guide is like it's going to we're


---------96:24----------
going to explain what ayurveda is


---------96:26----------
kind of like we did today but we also


---------96:28----------
don't want to restrict that information


---------96:29----------
to dr k's guide right so we


---------96:31----------
taught advanced concepts of ayurveda so


---------96:33----------
like there are things that we taught


---------96:34----------
today that aren't in dr k's guide


---------96:36----------
so i encourage you all to you know like


---------96:38----------
check out the guy like look at the intro


---------96:39----------
to ayurveda


---------96:40----------
we also have a lot of dietary guidance


---------96:42----------
and things like that where we'll tell


---------96:43----------
you


---------96:44----------
okay dr k great i am avata kapha and i'm


---------96:47----------
out of balance what do i do about it


---------96:48----------
that's going to be in dr k's guide


---------96:50----------
and if you buy dr k's guide and you kind


---------96:52----------
of check it out and then you're kind of


---------96:54----------
wondering like okay what how can i


---------96:55----------
understand like


---------96:56----------
these dorsi balances like come back and


---------96:58----------
and watch this youtube video


---------97:04----------
uh the tentative drop date is august


---------97:06----------
18th


---------97:07----------
someone's been asking what do i think


---------97:08----------
about homeopathy so


---------97:10----------
i think homeopathy has less biological


---------97:13----------
plausibility


---------97:14----------
than ayurveda uh there's a reason why i


---------97:17----------
chose to study ayurveda instead of


---------97:18----------
homeopathy


---------97:20----------
the clinical evidence is like mixed um


---------97:24----------
i i i don't put a whole lot of stock


---------97:27----------
into it


---------97:27----------
it's kind of bizarre but there is some


---------97:29----------
clinical evidence behind it but the


---------97:31----------
the scientific plausibility is just


---------97:33----------
really makes no sense


---------97:35----------
which doesn't mean that it isn't true it


---------97:36----------
could mean that we don't really


---------97:37----------
understand


---------97:38----------
as much right so for thousands of years


---------97:41----------
or like not thousands of years but


---------97:43----------
you know 60 years ago medical


---------97:45----------
professionals did not


---------97:48----------
understand the mechanism they didn't see


---------97:50----------
a way in which meditation could be used


---------97:52----------
as a treatment for depression


---------97:54----------
they didn't understand i don't


---------97:55----------
understand like you have to talk to


---------97:56----------
people's feelings to make them feel


---------97:58----------
better


---------97:58----------
i don't understand how sitting down and


---------98:00----------
chanting om for 30 minutes


---------98:02----------
is going to help someone's depression


---------98:03----------
there's no like psychology freud would


---------98:05----------
have been confused right because he's


---------98:06----------
like


---------98:07----------
where's the edible complex where's the


---------98:09----------
oral phase where's the anal phase


---------98:10----------
where's the phallic phase


---------98:11----------
it's an understanding of these things


---------98:13----------
and dealing with these issues that helps


---------98:14----------
you treat depression


---------98:17----------
how on earth could sitting there


---------98:19----------
enchanting something for 30 minutes


---------98:21----------
treat depression so just because science


---------98:24----------
does not


---------98:25----------
understand something does not mean it is


---------98:27----------
not real


---------98:30----------
um it just means that we don't


---------98:31----------
understand it which is something that


---------98:33----------
scientists tend to forget a lot right so


---------98:35----------
there's like a camp of people who say


---------98:36----------
that


---------98:38----------
there once something becomes verified it


---------98:42----------
becomes medicine and therefore


---------98:44----------
medicine is defined as what works


---------98:48----------
and if it is not medicine then it is


---------98:50----------
alternative medicine and alternative


---------98:51----------
medicine doesn't work


---------98:53----------
once you study something you once you


---------98:56----------
study alternative medicine and you


---------98:57----------
verify that it works


---------98:59----------
it becomes medicine therefore medicine


---------99:03----------
is defined by what works so this is


---------99:05----------
a common argument for people who are


---------99:07----------
like kind of anti-alternative medicine


---------99:10----------
right


---------99:10----------
they're like medicine is what works and


---------99:12----------
so my question is if we go back a


---------99:14----------
hundred years


---------99:15----------
and people were meditating for


---------99:16----------
depression is it a part of medicine


---------99:20----------
or not because we have no scientific


---------99:22----------
evidence that it works


---------99:26----------
so then it's not a part of medicine


---------99:27----------
right and then the question becomes


---------99:30----------
if it's not a part of medicine did


---------99:32----------
meditation help people with depression


---------99:33----------
100 years ago


---------99:35----------
the answer to that question is yes which


---------99:37----------
then means that


---------99:38----------
alternative medicine works so like the


---------99:42----------
whole argument kind of falls apart


---------99:45----------
so this is where we kind of when we go


---------99:46----------
back to homeopathy like i don't see a


---------99:48----------
whole lot of biological plausibility


---------99:50----------
i don't think that the treatments the


---------99:52----------
evidence that i've seen for homeopathy


---------99:54----------
is not as strong as it is for ayurveda


---------99:56----------
like for example


---------99:58----------
you know ashwagandha is an ayurvedic


---------100:00----------
herb that has been shown to


---------100:03----------
um you know clear beta amyloid which is


---------100:06----------
one of the things that causes


---------100:08----------
dementia from the brain and like


---------100:10----------
ayurvedic folks have been using


---------100:12----------
ashwagandha for like neurological health


---------100:14----------
and psychological health for


---------100:15----------
thousands of years and so we have like


---------100:17----------
scientific verification of their methods


---------100:19----------
whereas the problem with homeopathy for


---------100:21----------
those of you who don't know is they like


---------100:22----------
do serial dilutions


---------100:24----------
so what they do is like they'll i'm


---------100:25----------
gonna take like you know a drop of


---------100:27----------
ashwagandha and put it in a hundred


---------100:28----------
drops of water


---------100:29----------
and shake it around so dilute the


---------100:32----------
ashwagandha


---------100:33----------
to be like one part in a hundred and


---------100:35----------
then i'm going to take one drop of that


---------100:37----------
solution


---------100:38----------
and put it in another vial of water so


---------100:41----------
then it's going to be like


---------100:43----------
1 in 10 000 and then i'm going to take


---------100:45----------
one drop of that dilute solution


---------100:47----------
and i'm going to put it in another


---------100:48----------
solution and then it's going to be like


---------100:51----------
one part per million of the biological


---------100:54----------
compound and then they administer that


---------100:56----------
as medicine


---------100:58----------
and claim that there's a therapeutic


---------101:01----------
benefit so there are some trials that


---------101:04----------
show that homeopathic remedies are


---------101:06----------
effective like i've seen


---------101:07----------
you know homeopathic remedies for you


---------101:09----------
know like


---------101:10----------
um you know i reviewed a paper about


---------101:13----------
homeopathic remedies for


---------101:16----------
uh benign


---------101:20----------
prostate hyper hyperplasia


---------101:23----------
bph and it seemed like their stuff


---------101:27----------
was effective like people saw a


---------101:28----------
reduction in symptoms and it seemed like


---------101:30----------
it worked


---------101:30----------
it's just i don't understand the


---------101:31----------
biological plausibility so i think the


---------101:33----------
evidence is not as strong


---------101:34----------
i don't think that the biological


---------101:36----------
plausibility is really there


---------101:39----------
so you know


---------101:44----------
any tips for pitta kaphas yeah so when


---------101:48----------
it comes to tips so this is where


---------101:49----------
there's like a whole other section right


---------101:51----------
so like the next phase of this is like


---------101:53----------
conflict resolution and like tips and


---------101:55----------
understanding your dosha and stuff like


---------101:57----------
that so for pitta kaphas


---------101:59----------
you know the the biggest gap that you


---------102:01----------
have is in terms of like


---------102:04----------
innovation and being dynamic right so


---------102:07----------
the conflict that you're gonna have is


---------102:08----------
with people who are more dynamic than


---------102:10----------
you are


---------102:11----------
who like wanna d so like the the


---------102:13----------
strategic plan or the pitta


---------102:15----------
okay i'm going to look at the data i'm


---------102:16----------
going to organize it when i come up with


---------102:17----------
a plan we're going to stick to the plan


---------102:19----------
so the biggest problem that betha's run


---------102:21----------
into


---------102:22----------
is that once they've gone through their


---------102:24----------
process it's really hard to get them to


---------102:26----------
change


---------102:27----------
and sometimes they can become too


---------102:29----------
attached to their ideas


---------102:31----------
right like once we've got a plan like


---------102:33----------
don't disturb it


---------102:34----------
even if it's bad and the vata is over


---------102:36----------
there saying bro this isn't working


---------102:38----------
bro this isn't working bro this isn't


---------102:40----------
working we see this in corporations


---------102:43----------
all the time okay so like we see this


---------102:46----------
with


---------102:46----------
um like i think a lot of these


---------102:48----------
catastrophic failures with


---------102:50----------
corporations are like


---------102:53----------
classic examples of like bitter kaffa's


---------102:56----------
gone wild so what you'll have is like


---------102:59----------
you'll have a corporation that goes


---------103:00----------
through a lot of investment


---------103:02----------
to come up with a plan like we're gonna


---------103:04----------
launch


---------103:05----------
coke 2.0 and then like each step of the


---------103:08----------
way


---------103:09----------
there are people who are like or


---------103:11----------
actually you know maybe like cyberpunk


---------103:13----------
is another good example


---------103:15----------
so like i i don't actually know because


---------103:17----------
i don't know the inside of


---------103:18----------
uh you know cd projekt red but like


---------103:21----------
sometimes you'll have these catastrophic


---------103:22----------
launches right


---------103:24----------
and then everyone's scratching there


---------103:26----------
sitting there and like asking themselves


---------103:28----------
how could this company that does such a


---------103:31----------
good job


---------103:34----------
launch such a catastrophic


---------103:37----------
create such a catastrophic mess and what


---------103:39----------
happens


---------103:40----------
is that all along the way you've got


---------103:43----------
the bit the kapha energy which is like


---------103:46----------
here's our strategy


---------103:47----------
we did a good job we did our due


---------103:49----------
diligence we hired consultants


---------103:51----------
they said it was going to be okay let's


---------103:54----------
move forward


---------103:56----------
and then as they move down the process


---------103:59----------
there are vata people in the company who


---------104:01----------
are like


---------104:01----------
hey i think we need to change things hey


---------104:03----------
i think we need to change things


---------104:05----------
hey like the data that we're getting is


---------104:07----------
actually not great


---------104:09----------
hey this is not going well


---------104:12----------
but the energy of the company is pitaka


---------104:16----------
so like this is the plan we strategized


---------104:18----------
it we're sticking to it


---------104:20----------
these are the naysayers this person is


---------104:22----------
in align with our vision


---------104:24----------
this person isn't going to get promoted


---------104:27----------
right because they're like all these


---------104:28----------
promotion kind of things where like even


---------104:30----------
if you know that something's wrong you


---------104:31----------
can't be


---------104:32----------
like it's like absolutely kill the


---------104:34----------
messenger


---------104:35----------
so you no one wants to be the messenger


---------104:38----------
and some guy at the top is like


---------104:40----------
this is my vision it's gonna increase


---------104:42----------
profits 20 percent


---------104:43----------
and the board is like do it


---------104:46----------
and then what happens is they go back


---------104:48----------
and they tell their their employees


---------104:49----------
they're like


---------104:50----------
institute my vision and everyone's like


---------104:52----------
yes


---------104:53----------
and then they ask how are things going


---------104:55----------
and then the manager


---------104:56----------
goes to the associate and he's like hey


---------105:00----------
don't tell anyone that everything is a


---------105:01----------
[ __ ] mess it'll disrupt the plan


---------105:04----------
people won't like it


---------105:05----------
kill the messenger so we're just gonna


---------105:08----------
say


---------105:08----------
everything's okay and then


---------105:12----------
there were a thousand things in


---------105:13----------
hindsight that went wrong and the ceo at


---------105:15----------
the top is like this is going to be


---------105:16----------
great because everyone's thinking


---------105:18----------
telling me it's going to be great


---------105:20----------
catastrophic failure


---------105:22----------
and then the ceo is like how could this


---------105:24----------
happen how could y'all let this happen


---------105:25----------
i was told everything was okay i was


---------105:28----------
told everything was going to be great


---------105:31----------
and it's because there's no room for


---------105:33----------
that vata energy with strategic planning


---------105:35----------
gone


---------105:35----------
that strategic planning gone wild


---------105:39----------
right so the tip is to be aware that


---------105:42----------
you can invest a lot into your strategic


---------105:45----------
plan


---------105:46----------
and listen to people that piss you off


---------105:50----------
when they say hey maybe this is not a


---------105:52----------
great idea


---------105:55----------
that is the tip for pithakafas listen to


---------105:58----------
people who piss you off


---------106:02----------
okay


---------106:06----------
so someone's asking why do vatas have a


---------106:08----------
tendency to make jokes all the time or


---------106:09----------
is it just me so there are multiple


---------106:10----------
layers of this question


---------106:12----------
right so we can take a western


---------106:14----------
psychology process


---------106:15----------
i love this question it's such a great


---------106:16----------
question we can take a western


---------106:17----------
psychology perspective and we can say


---------106:19----------
you make jokes because it's a defensive


---------106:20----------
mechanism you have difficulty tolerating


---------106:23----------
internal negative emotion so we're gonna


---------106:25----------
lighten the mood and you can't sit with


---------106:27----------
tension


---------106:27----------
so we're gonna make a joke is a defense


---------106:29----------
mechanism the defense mechanism can be


---------106:31----------
personal in your head


---------106:32----------
or it can even be a defense mechanism in


---------106:34----------
the group


---------106:36----------
right that's why we make jokes there's


---------106:38----------
an ayurvedic perspective


---------106:40----------
why do vatas make more jokes because


---------106:43----------
vata's minds are bouncing all over the


---------106:45----------
place so vatas tend to be witty


---------106:48----------
and even if you look at different


---------106:49----------
comedians right like you can see the


---------106:51----------
variance of doshas within different


---------106:52----------
comedians


---------106:54----------
some comedians are like have a very


---------106:58----------
clear vision of where they're starting


---------107:00----------
and where they're ending


---------107:01----------
and they make it seem casual but it's


---------107:03----------
very well crafted


---------107:06----------
some uh you know comedians are


---------107:10----------
very kapha right so they'll even be like


---------107:12----------
super like


---------107:13----------
structured um and which may sound a


---------107:16----------
little bit like bit the comedians but


---------107:17----------
then you'll have vata comedians who are


---------107:18----------
like


---------107:19----------
you know they're the ones like some


---------107:21----------
comedians will laugh


---------107:22----------
regularly at their own jokes before they


---------107:25----------
hit the punch line


---------107:27----------
they'll lose it on stage right so


---------107:30----------
there's a touch of the vata in terms of


---------107:31----------
like the


---------107:32----------
dynamicness and the wittiness the


---------107:34----------
audience participation


---------107:36----------
you know


---------107:40----------
so so dave chappelle


---------107:43----------
i can't comment on individual people so


---------107:45----------
i'm gonna steer clear of that


---------107:48----------
ah so when they say old dave chappelle


---------107:50----------
is vata like that's very


---------107:52----------
smart right because dave chappelle's his


---------107:54----------
comedy has changed it's evolved


---------107:59----------
right and then like like i think uh


---------108:01----------
mitch hedberg


---------108:03----------
has a very i'm not going to comment on


---------108:06----------
what he is but if you all know mitch


---------108:07----------
hedberg


---------108:08----------
he has a very vatakapha style of comedy


---------108:12----------
right like it's kind of like random ass


---------108:15----------
thoughts


---------108:16----------
but actually like really like chill and


---------108:19----------
structure


---------108:20----------
he's not really witty but it's like


---------108:22----------
really random


---------108:27----------
i don't know who my [ __ ] is can you


---------108:29----------
become more pita kaffa if you're vata


---------108:31----------
absolutely so remember that


---------108:33----------
you can lower your vata and you can


---------108:35----------
increase your pitta and kapha


---------108:36----------
through particular exercises and diets


---------108:40----------
oh god


---------108:46----------
gg get wrecked get wrecked dr k


---------108:54----------
oh [ __ ] oh man i did not i did not


---------108:57----------
expect that that's good


---------109:00----------
chat that's good


---------109:08----------
okay so last thing that we're gonna do


---------109:14----------
is our boy or girl i don't know what


---------109:17----------
the gender is our homie


---------109:22----------
tramrant one of the


---------109:26----------
greatest meme lords of the internet has


---------109:29----------
made another video


---------109:31----------
so now that we've owned dr k we can just


---------109:34----------
you guys can just you know


---------109:37----------
we can just stick with that theme okay


---------109:40----------
here we go i don't think it's like an


---------109:43----------
issue


---------109:44----------
i don't think it impairs your function i


---------109:45----------
don't think it's a problem


---------109:47----------
i'm perfect the problem's you okay


---------109:50----------
maybe so the first thing is


---------109:54----------
are you stupid i i wouldn't know


---------109:57----------
that makes you stupid is that a bad


---------110:00----------
thing everyone's like how can this


---------110:01----------
person be so stupid


---------110:03----------
oh wow i didn't realize things were that


---------110:05----------
bad okay


---------110:07----------
[ __ ] dumb oh my god can i just think


---------110:10----------
for a second and try to figure out how


---------110:12----------
to say this


---------110:24----------
what are you what are you thinking right


---------110:25----------
now i just uh i forgot


---------110:28----------
like that's what you can't even remember


---------110:30----------
what you were talking about now yeah


---------110:32----------
i forgot give me a second all you're


---------110:34----------
doing


---------110:35----------
is opening and closing your [ __ ] eyes


---------110:37----------
what do you mean by that


---------110:38----------
it's not going to alter wildly in the


---------110:40----------
span of 90 seconds whether you're doing


---------110:42----------
this


---------110:43----------
or doing this um so what can i do

---------112:45----------
and then we've got folks who are like


---------112:47----------
