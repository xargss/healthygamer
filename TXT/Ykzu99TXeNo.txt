---------00:00----------
so so I mean my experience has been that


---------00:03----------
oftentimes attractiveness especially for


---------00:05----------
women


---------00:06----------
gets them a bad shake


---------00:13----------
okay so do people know what sparked you


---------00:17----------
coming on do people know this well I


---------00:20----------
think maybe some people in chat do but I


---------00:23----------
think some people might have the wrong


---------00:25----------
impression okay so why don't you tell us


---------00:29----------
what happened and what we're doing today


---------00:30----------
okay so I'm how do I put this in am


---------00:36----------
without misconstruing again so I made a


---------00:40----------
tweet that people didn't agree with and


---------00:41----------
that's totally fine


---------00:42----------
they're not no one asks agree with


---------00:44----------
anything I say that's how it is


---------00:47----------
but people took it in the wrong light


---------00:48----------
basically called me sexist and I guess


---------00:52----------
the main issue here is that it got put


---------00:55----------
into a bigger streamers discord that


---------00:57----------
basically is like known for like a


---------00:59----------
negative community and also on the


---------01:00----------
subreddit that can be somewhat negative


---------01:02----------
as well so it turned into me getting


---------01:05----------
like death threats basically like in my


---------01:07----------
DMS and stuff and then people making


---------01:10----------
Twitter accounts solely like literally


---------01:12----------
account was just to hate on me like


---------01:15----------
that's what the whole account was made


---------01:16----------
for which is so strange to me and like


---------01:17----------
okay like you know I've dealt with it in


---------01:21----------
small doses but never in like big groups


---------01:25----------
of people so okay yeah so I think that's


---------01:28----------
the biggest she was just for me I don't


---------01:31----------
take it too personally because I don't


---------01:33----------
know me personally I do a pretty good


---------01:37----------
job of not letting it affect me because


---------01:39----------
I don't check the links to like the


---------01:42----------
forums or anything so the only way I


---------01:44----------
knew that that even happen is just


---------01:45----------
because people told me and because I


---------01:47----------
started receiving like lots of nasty


---------01:49----------
messages it's out of the blue because


---------01:50----------
like I don't even stream anymore so it


---------01:52----------
would happen whenever I would stream


---------01:54----------
every once in a while and it's like okay


---------01:56----------
whatever but I was like where's this


---------01:57----------
coming from


---------01:58----------
and so um yeah whenever that happened


---------02:03----------
it's just I think what bothers me more


---------02:05----------
is I try too hard to figure out what's


---------02:07----------
going on in their mind and so that's


---------02:09----------
like what sticks with me it's not what


---------02:10----------
they're saying about me it's not like


---------02:12----------
it's not that you know it's bothering me


---------02:15----------
like oh my gosh like what do people


---------02:16----------
think about me it's more like what is


---------02:18----------
compelling them to do this like yeah so


---------02:22----------
so let's just can I just ask you to be a


---------02:24----------
little bit more specific so like what


---------02:26----------
what happened what did you say and what


---------02:29----------
do you why do you think what you said


---------02:31----------
rubbed people so far as to yeah so what


---------02:35----------
I said was um and I'm gonna emphasize


---------02:37----------
part of it because I think this is a


---------02:39----------
part that people did not read I just


---------02:42----------
said so if like a girl is dating a guy


---------02:45----------
and her he's not doing anything like


---------02:49----------
that's the part not doing anything like


---------02:51----------
not putting any effort or anything like


---------02:53----------
that and she's just completely like


---------02:54----------
taking care of him


---------02:55----------
like that's his mom okay I decided a


---------02:59----------
joke


---------03:00----------
and then people got super mad at that


---------03:03----------
and called me sexist which I'm not quite


---------03:05----------
sure which way they were calling me that


---------03:07----------
anyways because to me it was more like I


---------03:10----------
hope that girls would date someone who


---------03:13----------
is putting an equal effort is them you


---------03:15----------
know if that's something they like find


---------03:17----------
a priority which personally I do I think


---------03:18----------
maybe that's where my standards come


---------03:21----------
into play versus other people's and


---------03:23----------
everyone's allowed to have their own


---------03:24----------
standards agree on doing so


---------03:26----------
yeah and then on the other hand like I


---------03:28----------
would hope like I would always hope to


---------03:31----------
help someone figure out what they want


---------03:33----------
to do and I think a lot of people my


---------03:34----------
personal life I know that as well


---------03:36----------
that if someone's like not motivated for


---------03:38----------
something like even if I can't help them


---------03:40----------
cuz I mean you can't help someone who


---------03:41----------
doesn't want to have help so um I would


---------03:44----------
still want to be like Oh like you know


---------03:45----------
maybe you'd be interested in this or


---------03:46----------
like here's some options for this and so


---------03:48----------
I hope either side like no one would


---------03:51----------
just be sitting there doing nothing


---------03:51----------
because I think that makes you unhappy


---------03:53----------
in general so I think that might have


---------03:56----------
been the part though a lot of people


---------03:56----------
related to and think maybe I was kind of


---------03:58----------
[ __ ] talking that um well I'm sorry what


---------04:01----------
are they relating to I think maybe they


---------04:03----------
are relating to not having something


---------04:07----------
that brings in motivation or happiness


---------04:08----------
in their life because I feel like that


---------04:11----------
could be a population that it got the


---------04:15----------
reason I think that's the population it


---------04:17----------
got advertised to is just because I knew


---------04:19----------
that it did get put in a streamers


---------04:20----------
discord that was you know who else would


---------04:25----------
come and attack people for the reason


---------04:26----------
like not happy people not people who are


---------04:29----------
doing something in their life that um


---------04:30----------
you know they wouldn't have time to do


---------04:32----------
that they wouldn't care enough to do it


---------04:33----------
and I think generally whatever if


---------04:34----------
somebody just disagrees with someone


---------04:36----------
they just kind of move on because I know


---------04:38----------
a thing I see things that I disagree


---------04:39----------
time and I'm just like okay like that's


---------04:44----------
fine so it sounds like like there are a


---------04:46----------
couple of different things going on one


---------04:47----------
is that like so you're allowed to


---------04:49----------
disagree with anyone on the internet and


---------04:50----------
you're gonna disagree with anyone on the


---------04:52----------
internet but something about what you


---------04:54----------
said rubbed people the wrong way to the


---------04:56----------
extent of evoking some sort of like


---------04:59----------
response or action right right yeah


---------05:03----------
what what do you think you evoked in


---------05:06----------
them I think um trying to find the right


---------05:12----------
word for it but maybe a feeling that


---------05:13----------
they're not good enough in some part of


---------05:15----------
their life okay and it could have to do


---------05:18----------
you know I don't know but it could have


---------05:20----------
to do with having a girlfriend or it


---------05:22----------
could have to do with they didn't feel


---------05:24----------
they were being successful in some part


---------05:25----------
of their life yeah I think there's some


---------05:28----------
void there which like I think we all


---------05:30----------
experience that I mean I know I have to


---------05:32----------
so it's not like it's like I'm looking


---------05:34----------
down on anyone it's just I think that's


---------05:37----------
probably what pisses people off okay so


---------05:41----------
you know it's it seemed like so I from


---------05:44----------
what I'm just trying to find that the


---------05:46----------
Twitter exchange because I don't


---------05:47----------
remember exactly what it said but you


---------05:49----------
know so my recollection was that you


---------05:51----------
made a statement that you know about


---------05:53----------
women dating men who were basically not


---------05:56----------
doing anything in life and then you're


---------05:57----------
you're their mom and then someone


---------05:59----------
essentially reversed the genders right


---------06:02----------
oh yeah yeah and then and then they sort


---------06:05----------
of said that if a guy is dating a girl


---------06:08----------
who isn't putting anything in then


---------06:11----------
they're you're their dad and then right


---------06:15----------
you disagreed with that yeah that has to


---------06:20----------
do with just my mmm personal a mix of


---------06:25----------
personal standards and because they kind


---------06:28----------
of irritated me by just like trying to


---------06:29----------
your date so okay


---------06:31----------
firstly it got to me and I was just like


---------06:32----------
oh like that's annoying and just like


---------06:34----------
replied kind of like you know I don't


---------06:38----------
know I was just trying I mean we ha


---------06:40----------
people are where do they get in that but


---------06:42----------
um yeah so I think people took that the


---------06:44----------
wrong way too but how do you think they


---------06:47----------
took it I'm not


---------06:52----------
honestly I'm not quite sure that's kind


---------06:53----------
of where it's been getting to me where


---------06:55----------
I'm like I don't know why that made


---------06:59----------
people so angry so actually going on in


---------07:04----------
their head absolutely completely unfair


---------07:06----------
so so you know we were talking about how


---------07:09----------
when something strikes a chord with you


---------07:10----------
it evokes people to like argue or


---------07:13----------
disagree yeah yeah so what about what


---------07:16----------
that person said struck a chord with you


---------07:18----------
so that you tweeted back right exactly I


---------07:21----------
think the same thing happened there and


---------07:23----------
like I guess before I answer that it's


---------07:26----------
like that's I know where to stop myself


---------07:28----------
I guess because like I could be you know


---------07:30----------
if I see or whatever but I always try to


---------07:32----------
keep it in check and I know like you


---------07:34----------
need to be respectful of other people so


---------07:35----------
um


---------07:36----------
I think what struck a chord with me


---------07:39----------
there is that of course like a


---------07:42----------
disagreement but um


---------07:44----------
more so I had also started receiving DMS


---------07:49----------
from like the person who tweeted that


---------07:51----------
and also other people and they were like


---------07:54----------
starting to come at me with like the


---------07:57----------
death threats and stuff already and so I


---------07:59----------
was like that that just made me mad you


---------08:01----------
know I was like okay well I'm not going


---------08:04----------
to not stand up for myself in a way so


---------08:06----------
yeah I think there's always a fine line


---------08:08----------
of like juice let people walk all over


---------08:11----------
you and not respond and not give them


---------08:12----------
satisfaction that way or do you stand up


---------08:15----------
for yourself a little bit and you never


---------08:18----------
know where that's gonna go okay yeah do


---------08:22----------
you think that the people who are


---------08:24----------
messaging you are in their minds


---------08:26----------
standing up for themselves in some way


---------08:28----------
oh I think they could be actually yeah


---------08:30----------
so not that they're doing I don't think


---------08:36----------
and okay - and then yeah and then I'm


---------08:40----------
gonna apply for like a master's program


---------08:42----------
before okay back yeah before post back


---------08:47----------
no I'm in the apply for a post back


---------08:49----------
before med school okay what I mean if


---------08:52----------
you've done okay so it looks like we're


---------08:54----------
back okay so I think some people were


---------08:57----------
confused about what you were saying so


---------08:58----------
is it I'm gonna just show people the


---------09:01----------
tweets is that okay


---------09:02----------
yeah that's fine okay just so because I


---------09:04----------
think people are confused because we're


---------09:05----------
referencing weird stops oh so I'm gonna


---------09:08----------
just do this real quick so these are the


---------09:10----------
tweets chat this Bud Light ad what is


---------09:16----------
there an ad okay so these are the tweets


---------09:19----------
right so Farrell says some girls are


---------09:21----------
really out here dating boys with no job


---------09:23----------
not in school having to pay his rent and


---------09:25----------
food and then call that a relationship


---------09:26----------
girl you're his mom I think that that's


---------09:28----------
funny some dudes be dating girls with no


---------09:32----------
job not in school having to pay her rent


---------09:33----------
and food and call that a relationship


---------09:35----------
boy you're her dad and then you


---------09:38----------
responded what doesn't work that way -


---------09:40----------
I'll try again well okay so hopefully


---------09:46----------
people saw that and now you guys


---------09:47----------
understand what we're talking about so I


---------09:49----------
think fair like here's you know so I


---------09:52----------
think you what you said makes a lot of


---------09:53----------
sense in terms of like you're striking a


---------09:55----------
chord with people yeah and and you know


---------09:58----------
there's a certain amount of you can also


---------10:00----------
use the language of like you know how


---------10:02----------
much do you fight against the Internet


---------10:04----------
how much do you sort of take things like


---------10:06----------
let things slide how much do you stick


---------10:08----------
up for yourself and I don't think that


---------10:11----------
you know we can talk a little bit about


---------10:13----------
internet trolls but you know so I wonder


---------10:18----------
like do you so when I when I read


---------10:20----------
something like this in general like when


---------10:21----------
I read statements where one gender has


---------10:23----------
been so if you take a statement and then


---------10:26----------
you just change out the gender of


---------10:27----------
people's reaction towards it differs


---------10:30----------
depending on which gender you're talking


---------10:32----------
about sometimes that appears to people


---------10:34----------
to be like a double standard what do you


---------10:36----------
think yeah I can see it I can see that


---------10:38----------
for sure and that's again where I think


---------10:40----------
it got kind of misconstrued because I I


---------10:44----------
wasn't meeting it that way but I can


---------10:46----------
like what a hundred percent see how it


---------10:48----------
was taken that way how does how did you


---------10:51----------
mean your disagreement yeah so I kind of


---------10:54----------
said earlier I don't know if it was


---------10:55----------
Buffy then but um I meant it as in like


---------10:59----------
I think both sides should put in the


---------11:01----------
effort you know I mean I said think you


---------11:04----------
know it doesn't just apply like guy to


---------11:06----------
girl relationship you know really real


---------11:07----------
guy whatever so I think both sides


---------11:09----------
should put in effort equally on how they


---------11:13----------
agreed as well you know like some for


---------11:16----------
some people they may want like one


---------11:18----------
person to be the provider


---------11:19----------
to not be or both or whatever I think


---------11:22----------
just as long as no one's feeling like


---------11:25----------
minimize in the relationship I think


---------11:27----------
that makes a good relationship so as


---------11:30----------
long as you can agree and openly


---------11:32----------
communicate and I think that's um more


---------11:34----------
than I meant is whenever I was saying it


---------11:36----------
it was more being like maybe that wasn't


---------11:40----------
something that was agreed on beforehand


---------11:41----------
and you know the guy I mean isn't


---------11:44----------
motivated to do anything with his life


---------11:46----------
and to me like if that was my situation


---------11:51----------
I would just feel at a disadvantage like


---------11:52----------
I was doing everything and then


---------11:53----------
potentially you know having to raise


---------11:56----------
kids at the same time and like that's


---------11:57----------
not having someone who wouldn't want to


---------11:59----------
contribute in any way I just think yeah


---------12:01----------
so that would just be a personal issue


---------12:04----------
for me and like you know no one has to


---------12:06----------
hear that either so so so yeah I mean it


---------12:08----------
sounds like what you're kind of saying


---------12:09----------
is that you know your treat so this is I


---------12:12----------
think the big problem with Twitter is


---------12:14----------
that like you know people aren't allowed


---------12:15----------
to have nuanced and deep views on


---------12:19----------
Twitter right everything is like that's


---------12:21----------
the sentence I said that's exactly what


---------12:23----------
I meant that's it yeah and that's just


---------12:25----------
kind of how Twitter is and I think


---------12:27----------
that's why it's funny like I don't know


---------12:28----------
if you guys ever read stuff on like


---------12:29----------
Twitter but I love to it longer


---------12:32----------
yeah actually to explain yourself yeah


---------12:36----------
there was a there was a really great I


---------12:38----------
don't know if you guys are following any


---------12:40----------
of this like Hong Kong Blizzard


---------12:41----------
controversy like it was big a couple of


---------12:44----------
weeks ago but there was a hearthstone


---------12:46----------
player who posted something on to it


---------12:48----------
longer which I thought was really good


---------12:50----------
and he was kind of talking about


---------12:51----------
different sides of the issue but so so


---------12:55----------
like feral so you're not streaming


---------12:57----------
anymore I'm not have you read the


---------13:01----------
comments on the reddit thread


---------13:02----------
I have not okay that's why I keep my


---------13:05----------
sanity yes so the comments on the reddit


---------13:07----------
thread are not very nice and yeah I was


---------13:10----------
just but it sounds like people are


---------13:12----------
messaging you a lot of this stuff how do


---------13:14----------
you handle that in turn like how does


---------13:16----------
that make you like I've never gotten a


---------13:18----------
death threat DM before so I don't know


---------13:20----------
how that feels how does that feel well I


---------13:22----------
got one the first day I ever stream so I


---------13:25----------
was prepared for it a little bit um why


---------13:27----------
do you think you got one the first day


---------13:28----------
you streamed I'm not quite sure I just


---------13:32----------
wouldn't told


---------13:33----------
I wouldn't play a game with them and all


---------13:35----------
of a sudden that was the end of the


---------13:36----------
world for them so um not quite sure on


---------13:39----------
that one


---------13:40----------
but um I didn't I didn't do anything


---------13:41----------
controversial there um but yes I think


---------13:44----------
in small doses like I don't I don't take


---------13:48----------
them seriously other than just be like


---------13:50----------
well you know I mean I take my safety


---------13:52----------
seriously but at the same time I'm not


---------13:55----------
gonna take it to heart because I feel


---------13:56----------
like that's just unhealthy for me in the


---------13:58----------
long run mmm of course it gets to me a


---------14:01----------
little bit like how cabin you sit there


---------14:03----------
in Rita and it not get to you yeah I


---------14:05----------
have no idea yeah pretty good job of it


---------14:09----------
yeah I mean it sounds like you're


---------14:10----------
handling it pretty well I think I've


---------14:11----------
just seen it happen to other people so


---------14:13----------
many times it's really unfortunate um


---------14:15----------
like that mob mentality sort of thing


---------14:18----------
you know if they can hop on that and


---------14:20----------
just like have that group of people


---------14:21----------
that's attacking one person and just


---------14:22----------
make like a villain out of them they


---------14:24----------
feel good about themselves which I mean


---------14:26----------
I'm not sure why on that to you that's


---------14:28----------
that's what gets to me I'm like I don't


---------14:29----------
know why that makes you feel good so


---------14:32----------
that gets to me


---------14:33----------
not the exact like messages I'm


---------14:35----------
receiving I'm just like it's annoying


---------14:37----------
because I have to put everything on


---------14:38----------
private and like I got II will interact


---------14:40----------
with the people I normally interact with


---------14:41----------
normal sure yeah and I'm sure


---------14:43----------
circumstance but so so would you say


---------14:46----------
that it almost sounds like like by by


---------14:50----------
undermining is so attacking the how can


---------14:56----------
I say this attacking


---------15:01----------
one else makes you feel better about


---------15:03----------
your insecurities that's what I assume


---------15:07----------
the reason is but I'm like there has to


---------15:10----------
be something else like I'm sure for each


---------15:12----------
person it's a different specific


---------15:13----------
researcher so it's like I can't figure


---------15:16----------
it out for everyone so what sucks like I


---------15:19----------
want to yeah I don't know why I want to


---------15:21----------
but I do I'm kind of curious about this


---------15:24----------
whole like brigade egg thing because I


---------15:25----------
think that then you know the internet


---------15:27----------
really loves their pitchforks they like


---------15:29----------
man do they love their pitchforks and


---------15:31----------
I'm kind of curious I mentioned this on


---------15:33----------
stream one or two times before but you


---------15:35----------
know I'm I would love to talk to someone


---------15:37----------
who is actually like a pitchfork


---------15:39----------
wielding internet troll yeah yeah


---------15:41----------
leigh-anne


---------15:42----------
and I I'd love to understand you know


---------15:45----------
when you wield your pitchfork on the


---------15:46----------
Internet and then you go and you you


---------15:48----------
burn a witch like what does that do for


---------15:51----------
you yeah and I just don't understand I I


---------15:55----------
think that the interesting thing is that


---------15:57----------
you know when you this is kind of like a


---------16:00----------
random thought but like when you when we


---------16:03----------
call people trolls on the Internet I


---------16:05----------
wonder if in you know in a weird way


---------16:07----------
that actually is attacking them and does


---------16:09----------
that make us feel good about ourselves


---------16:11----------
right um I thought I had a different


---------16:17----------
view on this when I was streaming


---------16:18----------
because they're like oh it's just trolls


---------16:21----------
but I feel like it's almost actually a


---------16:24----------
neutral term for them because if you


---------16:28----------
just say it's just trolls you're just


---------16:29----------
dismissing it like I guess for them it's


---------16:31----------
like oh you're not important but at the


---------16:34----------
same time I think that just doesn't do


---------16:36----------
it justice like I could sit there and


---------16:38----------
have people whenever I did stream in my


---------16:40----------
chat saying like awful things like I


---------16:41----------
would just ignore it it's just trolls


---------16:43----------
like you aren't supposed to feel


---------16:44----------
anything about it because they don't


---------16:45----------
matter


---------16:46----------
mm-hmm well first of all like any person


---------16:49----------
matters so the person on their side that


---------16:52----------
does matter and secondly my feelings


---------16:55----------
also matter so it's just this weird like


---------16:57----------
disconnect between the person and the


---------17:00----------
troll yeah it sounds like look what


---------17:02----------
happens is that people are sort of


---------17:04----------
getting acclimatized to trolls behaviors


---------17:06----------
so they just sort of like let it slide


---------17:08----------
and I kind of factor it in into like the


---------17:11----------
norm yeah I almost think that with


---------17:14----------
people like not


---------17:15----------
seriously that they would even take it


---------17:17----------
farther for people to take them


---------17:19----------
seriously so yeah all right yeah why do


---------17:23----------
you think that is well I think their


---------17:26----------
main thing like whatever their


---------17:28----------
individual reasons are is just to be


---------17:29----------
heard because maybe they don't feel like


---------17:31----------
that in their everyday life and so


---------17:35----------
whenever people you know they think


---------17:37----------
they're I mean there's no way a good way


---------17:39----------
to go to pass it but they think they're


---------17:40----------
doing the right thing by not responding


---------17:42----------
to someone but in the long-term is that


---------17:46----------
the best thing you know like because


---------17:48----------
they're just gonna keep doing it and


---------17:49----------
they're gonna do it for the response and


---------17:51----------
until they get a response so something


---------17:53----------
has to change


---------17:54----------
I don't know what it is good something


---------17:57----------
has to change where I mean I no longer


---------17:59----------
feel the need to do that so so I mean I


---------18:02----------
I think you know I wonder a little bit


---------18:04----------
about people and stream are talking


---------18:07----------
about stuff like attention and and


---------18:08----------
things like that I mean right so I think


---------18:11----------
like trolling on the Internet is a big


---------18:13----------
problem and I'm wondering like feral


---------18:15----------
what do you think we can do about it oh


---------18:17----------
man I thought about this a lot actually


---------18:22----------
yeah especially when I was straining


---------18:25----------
because it was more of a I always want a


---------18:28----------
positive atmosphere like whenever I was


---------18:30----------
streaming or like even though I'm like


---------18:32----------
social media now or whatever I'm active


---------18:34----------
in like I always want to keep it to


---------18:36----------
where people feel comfortable enough to


---------18:38----------
be themselves and they don't feel judged


---------18:40----------
and they feel like you know just a happy


---------18:43----------
place like I don't want to be that space


---------18:45----------
where the like quote-unquote trolls like


---------18:47----------
build up and go attack someone


---------18:48----------
so um I the way I did one little thing


---------18:56----------
to try to help with that is made like oh


---------18:58----------
I mean I guess pretty much like your


---------19:00----------
discord is completely but cut like a


---------19:02----------
safe space channel a my discord or


---------19:04----------
anyone could just talk about their


---------19:05----------
problems and not feel judged because


---------19:08----------
it's really hard to do on stream if


---------19:10----------
you're not doing what you do like I


---------19:12----------
can't even give them good advice because


---------19:14----------
I'm not a psychiatrist so it's like I


---------19:15----------
would try my best to help everyone but


---------19:17----------
the best way for me to do that is allow


---------19:19----------
them a space to like just maybe let it


---------19:22----------
out to a positive for people like I can


---------19:24----------
tell what you're saying this is to


---------19:25----------
create a space where a troll feels safe


---------19:27----------
so like a case


---------19:33----------
yes I need a little K for them yeah so


---------19:36----------
let's let's make it let's make a troll


---------19:37----------
cave honor our disco yeah but I need


---------19:41----------
honestly like I don't know any other


---------19:43----------
like way that's better than just


---------19:45----------
literally the stream that would come bat


---------19:47----------
it because I don't think people listen


---------19:48----------
can I can I ask you for a bizarre favor


---------19:51----------
okay so feral if you get a DM again like


---------19:55----------
so I don't I want you to think about


---------19:57----------
this before you agree to it cuz I don't


---------19:59----------
know if this is any good or bad so


---------20:00----------
generally speaking when you get a death


---------20:02----------
threat you you just ignore them right


---------20:04----------
because any chaos wants them yeah so any


---------20:07----------
kind of response that you give them is


---------20:09----------
going to probably evoke more behavior


---------20:10----------
yeah and and at the same time like I


---------20:14----------
wish there was some way that I could


---------20:15----------
respond to them and I don't know or


---------20:17----------
actually maybe maybe this maybe if


---------20:19----------
they've sent you a DM instead of you


---------20:21----------
responding directly just tell them that


---------20:22----------
that I want to talk to tell me who they


---------20:26----------
are and then all message them personally


---------20:27----------
okay and that I'd like to talk to them


---------20:30----------
because I think I think if they're


---------20:32----------
approaching you then like I would love


---------20:34----------
it if you could just send them my way


---------20:35----------
because I would love to hear their side


---------20:37----------
of the story like why why do they feel


---------20:39----------
so angry about what you said do they


---------20:41----------
feel like it's a double standard like


---------20:42----------
some people in twitch chat feel like


---------20:43----------
it's a double standard yeah I can see


---------20:45----------
that


---------20:46----------
and yeah I mean so like I you know I


---------20:51----------
just I send them my way okay I can do


---------20:55----------
that now but at the same time like I


---------20:57----------
don't you know I don't want you to


---------20:58----------
engage with them and open yourself up to


---------20:59----------
like further kinds of stuff so if you


---------21:01----------
feel like it's safe or if you want to


---------21:03----------
post something on like whatever you feel


---------21:05----------
comfortable with you can even just email


---------21:06----------
me their like their names on discord


---------21:08----------
like they were DM everyone discord or


---------21:10----------
Twitter oh no so I I can't answer on


---------21:14----------
Instagram because once you open a


---------21:15----------
message you pretty much have to keep it


---------21:18----------
open well I guess unless I block them


---------21:19----------
but um you can do it on Twitter or I


---------21:24----------
closed off pretty much everything so


---------21:25----------
I've kind of gotten anything in a while


---------21:27----------
but um I'm sure I have a few lying


---------21:29----------
around so that I didn't get to block yes


---------21:32----------
I can just


---------21:33----------
oh so you said that all this stuff came


---------21:35----------
from a discord right there's a streamer


---------21:37----------
who yes but I can't say who or else you


---------21:39----------
might get banned so


---------21:41----------
okay yeah I don't want you to say who


---------21:46----------
because I might get banned but help me


---------21:47----------
understand how that works


---------21:49----------
why would I get banned for you saying


---------21:51----------
someone's so well maybe not but it's


---------21:55----------
really out chance but I just want our


---------21:57----------
yeah yeah I think it's against TOS to


---------22:00----------
kind of like talk negatively about other


---------22:02----------
twitch partners so I see yeah that's why


---------22:05----------
huzzah but then why don't they get


---------22:07----------
banned fur that's a good question I


---------22:10----------
don't think they didn't so I don't think


---------22:13----------
I can get banned on their community


---------22:15----------
unless they themselves are doing


---------22:17----------
something so if the street didn't send


---------22:20----------
people after me because like he probably


---------22:22----------
the name check is discord so big yeah


---------22:23----------
but um yeah then what can I do you know


---------22:27----------
and they are subscribing to these people


---------22:29----------
so okay so so I'm just trying to figure


---------22:32----------
out like how does yes so how do how does


---------22:34----------
the troll contact me that's the question


---------22:38----------
so it looks like they can they can


---------22:40----------
message us on Twitter


---------22:41----------
you guys can sign up on the about Me


---------22:43----------
section of our twitch but I mean I I


---------22:47----------
genuinely do want to understand like


---------22:49----------
other people's perspectives yeah yeah


---------22:52----------
and I I think that you know I thank you


---------22:55----------
for coming on and sort of sharing your


---------22:57----------
thoughts I I know that was there


---------22:59----------
something in particular like did you I


---------23:00----------
know we'd sort of floated the idea of


---------23:02----------
talking about relationships in general


---------23:03----------
but I feel like you kind of explained


---------23:06----------
your perspective on that some yeah I


---------23:08----------
think something that everyone can agree


---------23:11----------
on if they want to healthy relationship


---------23:13----------
was just open communication having


---------23:16----------
effort both ways what in whatever form


---------23:18----------
that may be yeah I I think that's a


---------23:22----------
non-controversial way to be a


---------23:24----------
relationship right like that's pretty


---------23:25----------
normal


---------23:26----------
I would agree so I'm gonna ask twitch


---------23:29----------
chat if they have questions for you okay


---------23:31----------
or us but did you have anything else


---------23:34----------
that you wanted to share I mean I I feel


---------23:35----------
like you explained things pretty well


---------23:37----------
yeah not not too much okay


---------23:44----------
yes so you stopped streaming mm-hmm


---------23:47----------
what's that about is that a question for


---------23:49----------
me yeah yeah yeah I'm just waiting I'm


---------23:51----------
buying time we're still alive yeah so


---------23:53----------
okay


---------23:54----------
so I stopped streaming partially because


---------23:57----------
I wasn't enjoying it okay the reason I


---------24:01----------
wasn't enjoying it is because I wasn't


---------24:03----------
able to find a way to actually help


---------24:05----------
people with my stream like yeah maybe I


---------24:08----------
was providing entertainment value or


---------24:09----------
whatever but for me I always want to be


---------24:12----------
able to like actually impact someone's


---------24:13----------
life in a way well in it with anything I


---------24:15----------
do so I was avoiding med school because


---------24:20----------
that's why I came by the first stream


---------24:21----------
partially I don't think I'm good enough


---------24:23----------
to go or whatever


---------24:24----------
so um yes I disabuse you of that notion


---------24:27----------
right yes no I I don't care how long it


---------24:30----------
takes me to get there so that's why I


---------24:32----------
stopped streaming as well because it


---------24:34----------
just good for you for about what was


---------24:36----------
beneficial to me and it wasn't it so


---------24:39----------
yeah yeah you know if you're just


---------24:41----------
offline you get you're welcome to


---------24:43----------
contact me because there's a fair number


---------24:44----------
of people in our community who are


---------24:46----------
trying to sort of get a handle on their


---------24:48----------
life and right and we've been able to I


---------24:51----------
think support them a little bit in


---------24:53----------
getting to their career goals on some of


---------24:56----------
those include med schools so we have our


---------24:57----------
fingers crossed for people that are


---------24:59----------
applying to cycle and unfortunately that


---------25:02----------
means that they'll probably stop helping


---------25:05----------
us out because they'll be busy but if


---------25:06----------
there's any way that I can personally


---------25:07----------
help you figure things out or you know


---------25:10----------
even if you want like some people I've


---------25:11----------
had like sort of help out with healthy


---------25:13----------
gamer and that if they'll do some


---------25:16----------
research or something like that and then


---------25:17----------
I can write them a letter right right


---------25:19----------
and things like that so if you and I are


---------25:22----------
kind of involved in our recovery coach


---------25:23----------
program so I think that is a great in


---------25:25----------
and you could put that on your


---------25:26----------
application but it sounds like you're


---------25:30----------
still over a year away from applying


---------25:32----------
right right right yeah so so as things


---------25:35----------
get down the road and if there's some


---------25:36----------
way we can help let us know awesome


---------25:38----------
thanks because I I think it's awesome


---------25:40----------
the mission that you kind of adopted for


---------25:42----------
yourself to help the world yeah and we'd


---------25:47----------
love to support you and I think a lot of


---------25:48----------
people on punch in chatter sending


---------25:51----------
positive vibes your way thank you


---------25:54----------
I need it and then I guess someone was


---------25:57----------
asking have you stopped using social


---------25:59----------
media because of everything that


---------26:01----------
happened um that's a that's an


---------26:04----------
interesting answer so I took a step away


---------26:09----------
from it only just because it was like


---------26:11----------
too much spamming for me and I'm in the


---------26:13----------
middle of midterms so it's like a bit


---------26:15----------
distracting for me to deal with anything


---------26:17----------
extra than what I normally do and I


---------26:19----------
didn't because in my mind I was like


---------26:21----------
well the trolls would win if they did so


---------26:24----------
I'm not yeah yeah you don't want the


---------26:27----------
trolls to win yeah so yes and no more


---------26:29----------
from my own sake for just exams right


---------26:31----------
now so that someone asks why did feral


---------26:34----------
disagree with the tweet if she agrees


---------26:35----------
that both sides should put an effort


---------26:37----------
care to elaborate yeah so um well I


---------26:42----------
don't know if you heard what I said


---------26:43----------
earlier but I was a little bit irritated


---------26:45----------
but somebody like tweeting that back to


---------26:47----------
me and just like that's when all this


---------26:48----------
stuff started so partially out an


---------26:50----------
irritation secondly I guess if they were


---------26:55----------
like just referring to financially or


---------26:57----------
whatever like that's personally someone


---------26:59----------
something I wouldn't be against like for


---------27:02----------
myself so that's why but yeah someone


---------27:05----------
else wanted that I don't care I mean I'm


---------27:08----------
gonna jump in and sort of qualify that


---------27:11----------
because I think you didn't mention this


---------27:12----------
earlier feral so I think my sense is


---------27:13----------
that something that they said and I you


---------27:16----------
know we've talked about a lot of people


---------27:18----------
have challenges in terms of their


---------27:19----------
confidence and their worth and something


---------27:21----------
like that and I know that it sounds like


---------27:22----------
you're making great strides and sort of


---------27:23----------
figuring out who you are and you know


---------27:26----------
you're kind of saying well oh yeah come


---------27:28----------
hell or high water you know you're gonna


---------27:30----------
end up going to medical school and I


---------27:31----------
think that's the wonderful attitude to


---------27:34----------
have and at the same time if I heard you


---------27:36----------
correctly I think something that they


---------27:37----------
said may have struck a personal chord


---------27:39----------
with you yeah yeah and and so what you


---------27:41----------
were really responding to is that like


---------27:43----------
what they said like felt like a little


---------27:45----------
bit of a personal attack which it may


---------27:47----------
not have been an intended that way but


---------27:49----------
at the same time you know sometimes I


---------27:51----------
think that happens where people make a


---------27:55----------
generalization we feel like they're


---------27:57----------
talking about us or like strikes a chord


---------27:59----------
yeah I mean that's why what they thought


---------28:00----------
too so yes right is the best way like


---------28:03----------
little battle there yes so I and that's


---------28:05----------
the interesting theme of this as it


---------28:07----------
sounds like you know


---------28:08----------
of what you were imagining they


---------28:10----------
experienced maybe you understand because


---------28:12----------
you were experiencing it too I think it


---------28:15----------
sounds like you're you're you sort of


---------28:16----------
channel a lot of those impulses and


---------28:18----------
feelings in a slightly more productive


---------28:20----------
way I don't you know we don't really


---------28:21----------
know that asked yeah are you DMing


---------28:25----------
people death threats okay well not bad


---------28:27----------
but you know just playing to my sleeve


---------28:29----------
legends sure talk about toxicity okay so


---------28:35----------
someone else asks do you think that the


---------28:38----------
fact that she is attractive fueled the


---------28:40----------
hate to spread even more and if yes why


---------28:42----------
do you think that is what do you think


---------28:44----------
Farrell oh um well thank you first of


---------28:47----------
all um also yes I think so just because


---------28:53----------
hmm I think this happens a lot I just


---------28:57----------
with streamers in general they're like


---------28:58----------
oh it's a pretty girl playing games you


---------29:00----------
know people just come up with all their


---------29:02----------
assumptions already so hmm I'm not quite


---------29:05----------
sure how that might have fueled it I


---------29:06----------
think you did so so I mean my experience


---------29:11----------
has been that oftentimes attractiveness


---------29:13----------
especially for women gets them a bad


---------29:15----------
shake yeah because I think in real life


---------29:20----------
people don't take me seriously you know


---------29:22----------
for things like oh well you know you're


---------29:25----------
just blonde or like this is this and


---------29:27----------
it's like I have to prove myself like


---------29:29----------
two times more than other people just to


---------29:31----------
be taken seriously or for people to


---------29:33----------
think that you know I'm smart or like


---------29:35----------
whatever so yeah it's bizarre III think


---------29:38----------
I've heard so I'm a psychiatrist so I


---------29:41----------
talked to people about you know what's


---------29:42----------
stressful in their life and the number


---------29:44----------
of times that I've heard from men in


---------29:47----------
workplaces about how attractive women


---------29:51----------
are primarily mistreated by other women


---------29:53----------
in the workplace is staggering like the


---------29:56----------
most common and this is just anecdotal


---------29:58----------
so I don't know I mean maybe there's


---------30:00----------
studies about this I'm not familiar with


---------30:01----------
them but it seems that like most of the


---------30:04----------
mistreatment that I hear people complain


---------30:06----------
about of women in the workplace it's


---------30:08----------
more commonly from other women than it


---------30:10----------
is for men which doesn't mean that women


---------30:12----------
don't mistreat men in the workplace or


---------30:13----------
vice versa right but the most bizarre


---------30:16----------
thing that I've you know when people


---------30:17----------
just talk to me about the dynamics of


---------30:19----------
their workplace it seems like especially


---------30:21----------
the women for example


---------30:22----------
my female patients feel far more


---------30:24----------
attacked by their female colleagues and


---------30:26----------
female superiors than the other way then


---------30:28----------
then by matin braces which is really


---------30:32----------
strange I don't really get that yeah


---------30:35----------
well it's interesting because it was


---------30:37----------
only men who are mad at my tweet not


---------30:39----------
women so that's why I went over I was


---------30:42----------
like called sexist I was like I was


---------30:46----------
confused with direction they thought I


---------30:47----------
was because I got a lot of diems for


---------30:50----------
other women who are like I totally agree


---------30:52----------
with you and that made me feel like


---------30:53----------
super horrible a lot myselfs like just


---------30:55----------
date he's the one who wasn't putting in


---------30:56----------
any effort in their life at all so I was


---------30:58----------
like yes so just say hear from so I know


---------31:02----------
that there are a couple of women in our


---------31:04----------
chat who seem to be agreeing that women


---------31:06----------
are pretty horrible to each other and a


---------31:08----------
lot of women I work with tend to snitch


---------31:09----------
on each other even though they're all


---------31:11----------
friends outside of work so I'm not quite


---------31:13----------
sure what's going on there so I think we


---------31:14----------
have one or two more questions is that


---------31:16----------
okay for you Farrell oh yes you have


---------31:18----------
studying that you need to be doing


---------31:19----------
instead


---------31:19----------
I knew but it's okay so what would what


---------31:26----------
would the trolls call themselves who


---------31:28----------
were hating on feral cat what's the


---------31:30----------
proper term they would call themselves


---------31:32----------
like what do you how do you think


---------31:33----------
control sees season themselves yeah I


---------31:37----------
mean I have some fun but I mean I assume


---------31:43----------
there I mean I feel like everyone feels


---------31:46----------
about themselves just to what degree


---------31:48----------
they act on it you know lacking in some


---------31:49----------
area and I guess due to that tweet maybe


---------31:54----------
they were just lacking in an area that I


---------31:56----------
may have sparked so so let me ask you


---------31:59----------
this Farrell how did you feel when you


---------32:00----------
tweeted your response to that other


---------32:02----------
treat to me do you remember how you felt


---------32:04----------
I think I just rolled my eyes honestly


---------32:08----------
and kind of moving on but um I I thought


---------32:14----------
he was more of a I felt like I had to


---------32:15----------
stand up for myself sort of thing so I'm


---------32:17----------
not sure if that's what they're feeling


---------32:18----------
but it might be so my guess is that they


---------32:20----------
would feel righteous yeah any sense I


---------32:24----------
think I can describe both sides for sure


---------32:26----------
yeah I mean I I think that like when


---------32:29----------
people you know they feel like they're


---------32:30----------
so the sense that I get is there was


---------32:32----------
like there's a sense of like correcting


---------32:34----------
a wrong there's like


---------32:35----------
fixing an investor's yeah and then


---------32:38----------
someone was asking me specifically what


---------32:40----------
do I think about the gender reversal


---------32:41----------
tweet I mean I think Farrell's


---------32:43----------
explanation makes sense but at the same


---------32:45----------
time I think taken on face value it I


---------32:47----------
mean it looks like a double standard


---------32:48----------
right mm-hmm


---------32:49----------
there's just yeah it's not like I just


---------32:52----------
sat back and was like like I'm right


---------32:54----------
y'all are stupid you know it's like of


---------32:56----------
course like with any criticism yeah I


---------32:58----------
think there's a line where you have to


---------32:59----------
say is am I gonna take this as


---------33:01----------
constructive criticism is that what it


---------33:04----------
is or is it just straight hatred you


---------33:07----------
know yeah so I don't know I like like


---------33:09----------
right now I'm putting myself in a pretty


---------33:11----------
uncomfortable position being here so I


---------33:14----------
like to do that to myself just to keep


---------33:16----------
myself in check and like keep growing I


---------33:19----------
guess like yeah I think it's you know


---------33:23----------
I'm grateful you came on and I can


---------33:25----------
imagine that you're risking the wrath of


---------33:27----------
the Internet so it's actually you know


---------33:28----------
kind of ballsy move on your part but I'm


---------33:32----------
glad you're talking about things openly


---------33:34----------
and and also demonstrating some degree


---------33:36----------
of like curiosity about yourself and


---------33:38----------
yeah and I think that a lot of people do


---------33:42----------
sort of get brigaded by the internet and


---------33:44----------
it can be for all kinds of random [ __ ]


---------33:46----------
yeah you never know what people are


---------33:48----------
gonna see and what's kind of pull up and


---------33:50----------
what you know what's gonna bring you


---------33:51----------
attention so yes so so I think the last


---------33:55----------
question we're gonna do today someone


---------33:57----------
was asking me how how do I respond


---------33:59----------
personally the role reversal tweet and I


---------34:01----------
think so I will say that I think that


---------34:03----------
there's a lot of discrimination that


---------34:05----------
does go on against men I think men and


---------34:07----------
women are treated differently in our


---------34:09----------
society and sometimes that's to the


---------34:11----------
benefit of men and sometimes it's to the


---------34:12----------
benefit of women i I'm not trying to say


---------34:15----------
that either one is correct but I do


---------34:17----------
think that so I think a very common


---------34:19----------
mistake that a lot of people make is


---------34:20----------
that discrimination is like a seesaw and


---------34:25----------
so that if you discriminate towards a


---------34:27----------
particular group it means that the other


---------34:29----------
group is not discriminated against and I


---------34:33----------
do believe that things like privilege


---------34:34----------
and stuff like that are statistically


---------34:36----------
real so for example like you know if you


---------34:39----------
just look at data on like race and jail


---------34:42----------
times and things like that like I


---------34:43----------
remember one of the most shocking things


---------34:45----------
that I didn't even realize so


---------34:48----------
I was working in a jail and on the third


---------34:50----------
week of working in the jail I was like


---------34:52----------
something was weird about something was


---------34:54----------
different about today and I was trying


---------34:55----------
to figure out like what is it that's


---------34:56----------
different


---------34:57----------
what is it different that's different


---------34:58----------
about today and finally it hit me on the


---------35:02----------
third Thursday so I'd been working in


---------35:05----------
the jail now for 14 days was the first


---------35:07----------
time I saw a white person isn't inmate


---------35:11----------
and so like there's that just it blew my


---------35:14----------
mind like it was like I couldn't


---------35:16----------
understand like it took me a little


---------35:17----------
while to realize like what what was what


---------35:19----------
was different about that oh use white


---------35:20----------
and that's when it was just shocking


---------35:22----------
because everyone else was like Hispanic


---------35:24----------
or Latino X or black and so I do think


---------35:32----------
that there is you know racism and


---------35:34----------
discrimination I think the the flip side


---------35:36----------
of it is that I do think sometimes


---------35:37----------
privileged classes or genders oftentimes


---------35:40----------
get sort of a bad rap so for example


---------35:44----------
like eight out of every ten suicides in


---------35:48----------
this country or men so more men have


---------35:50----------
killed themselves in the last year than


---------35:52----------
in the last decade of armed conflict in


---------35:55----------
the United States so you take every


---------35:57----------
casualty of war that the US has suffered


---------35:59----------
from in the last decade and more men


---------36:01----------
chose to kill themselves in the last


---------36:03----------
year so that to me is like shocking and


---------36:07----------
then the other thing is I mean I work


---------36:09----------
with some people who are executives at


---------36:11----------
major companies and they actually have


---------36:13----------
policies that that they sort of have


---------36:16----------
sanding policies to preferentially


---------36:17----------
promote women and minorities and so it's


---------36:22----------
kind of odd I mean they're not never


---------36:23----------
gonna say it openly because that'll get


---------36:25----------
that'll get them sued but that's you


---------36:26----------
know discrimination against men does


---------36:28----------
happen yeah for sure


---------36:30----------
and I I don't think that and there are a


---------36:33----------
lot of other statistics like I'm not I'm


---------36:35----------
not like a red pill kind of guy or


---------36:37----------
anything like that but I think if you


---------36:38----------
look at data you can understand that


---------36:40----------
it's possible for like multiple classes


---------36:43----------
so I'm in some ways I'm in a minority in


---------36:45----------
some ways I'm I'm a privileged class so


---------36:48----------
I'm like an Indian doctor of which there


---------36:50----------
are no shortages and at the same time


---------36:52----------
you know statistically I was


---------36:55----------
discriminated against when I applied to


---------36:56----------
medical school because on average if


---------36:58----------
you're indian or asian you have to score


---------37:01----------
two points higher than the average MCAT


---------37:04----------
score I don't know what the scores are


---------37:05----------
now but back when I was like so Indians


---------37:08----------
have to score two points higher in order


---------37:10----------
to get in and depending on your race you


---------37:13----------
actually have to have a different MCAT


---------37:15----------
score I'm not saying that that's fair or


---------37:17----------
unfair I think if we just look at it a


---------37:19----------
lot of people make arguments about you


---------37:21----------
know that sort of I think these


---------37:23----------
arguments are valid that like that sort


---------37:25----------
of ends up working out because like


---------37:29----------
education was highly emphasized and in


---------37:31----------
my household and I had a lot of


---------37:33----------
advantages that sort of enabled me to


---------37:34----------
score higher at the same time you know


---------37:36----------
it is it is kind of a differential


---------37:39----------
quantitative was the way that my scores


---------37:42----------
are looked at or influenced based on my


---------37:44----------
gender which I think implies that my


---------37:47----------
gender isn't is people I'm being


---------37:49----------
discriminated against is that okay I


---------37:51----------
don't know so that that's kind of my


---------37:53----------
long-ass question


---------37:54----------
[Music]


---------37:56----------
I'm sorry long-ass answer but any


---------37:59----------
closing thoughts Farrell hmm I don't


---------38:04----------
think so by the way you may be


---------38:07----------
discriminated against when you apply to


---------38:09----------
medical school because at this point


---------38:10----------
more than 50% of women are more than 50%


---------38:14----------
of medical students or women so before


---------38:17----------
long men may actually have an advantage


---------38:19----------
of thing if trends continue going the


---------38:20----------
way they are yeah so apply fast


---------38:25----------
yeah I'm trying well thanks a lot


---------38:30----------
Farrell for coming on and you know thank


---------38:31----------
you for facing the courage of the


---------38:33----------
internet and if you do happen to engage


---------38:35----------
with any trolls feel free to send them


---------38:37----------
my way and I will welcome them with open


---------38:39----------
arms


---------38:39----------
oh don't respond to them if you feel


---------38:42----------
like that's gonna inflame them further


---------38:43----------
all right don't lastly if anyone knows


---------38:46----------
trolls that we could kind of get in in


---------38:48----------
touch with you know let us know message


---------38:56----------
your local trolls yeah message your


---------38:58----------
local trolls and tell them that we want


---------39:01----------
to create a cave for them yeah yes so if


---------39:03----------
you used to be a troll like you should


---------39:05----------

decide to go to medical school in the


---------39:30----------
end or if you end up and get getting in

a psychiatrist alright take care all


---------39:39----------
