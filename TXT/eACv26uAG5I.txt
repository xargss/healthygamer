---------01:02----------
what motivated you to


---------01:03----------
to come on stream today so


---------01:08----------
i've been wanting to come on stream for


---------01:09----------
a while now i think i've been trying


---------01:12----------
for six months or so but oh wow


---------01:17----------
well i'm glad you're here today yeah i


---------01:19----------
think i just wanted to


---------01:21----------
share my story and um i don't know get


---------01:24----------
support and all that sure


---------01:27----------
um and yeah i want to talk about


---------01:31----------
over analysis and fear of failure


---------01:34----------
and i also have social anxiety and


---------01:38----------
all that fun stuff yep


---------01:42----------
um so yeah can you tell us your story


---------01:46----------
yeah so um


---------01:49----------
i guess this year was my second year at


---------01:53----------
university


---------01:55----------
and


---------01:58----------
so it didn't start off great i sort of


---------02:01----------
took on more than i can handle and i can


---------02:04----------
say that how i dealt with it wasn't


---------02:07----------
very good for my mental health


---------02:11----------
um so


---------02:14----------
i had a lot of courses i had a lot of


---------02:17----------
work to do and all that


---------02:18----------
and i started getting depressed


---------02:23----------
um i wasn't performing as well and so


---------02:27----------
like i it was getting sort of


---------02:30----------
difficult so i started like oh shoot you


---------02:34----------
can't do


---------02:34----------
some simple homework like gotta get on


---------02:37----------
this and


---------02:38----------
started beating myself up about it


---------02:40----------
calling myself a failure


---------02:43----------
and like um started getting afraid


---------02:47----------
it's like oh shoot what if i can't do


---------02:49----------
this


---------02:50----------
and uh it all sort of spiraled downhill


---------02:54----------
from there


---------02:55----------
i think i met you in december


---------02:58----------
was when i started watching your streams


---------03:00----------
and i've been making progress since then


---------03:04----------
um i changed majors


---------03:08----------
because i found that the one i was doing


---------03:11----------
sort of felt meaningless


---------03:15----------
purposeless in a way it's like why am i


---------03:18----------
even doing this


---------03:20----------
and so yeah i just sort of dropped


---------03:22----------
everything and changed pictures


---------03:24----------
okay and i think


---------03:27----------
um i have a lot of fear of failure


---------03:30----------
because it's like


---------03:32----------
i sort of can't mess this up like if i


---------03:35----------
mess up university then i mess up


---------03:38----------
my life pretty much and


---------03:42----------
it's like that for a lot of things um


---------03:45----------
what else are


---------03:46----------
you afraid of messing up


---------03:50----------
so i tried getting a job this summer


---------03:55----------
um i applied for a few places and like i


---------03:59----------
sort of gave up pretty quickly and like


---------04:02----------
even if they hired me like who's gonna


---------04:04----------
want


---------04:05----------
me working for them like i'm just gonna


---------04:07----------
disappoint them and all that


---------04:10----------
um i don't know i felt like a pretty big


---------04:13----------
failure and


---------04:15----------
sort of just sort of hid in my room for


---------04:19----------
most this year barely going outside or


---------04:22----------
anything


---------04:23----------
just playing games and what are you


---------04:26----------
playing um


---------04:28----------
so i play minecraft i play starblast.io


---------04:32----------
which is


---------04:33----------
an internet browser game uh


---------04:36----------
kerbal space program


---------04:40----------
cool stuff i i think those are my main


---------04:42----------
games


---------04:43----------
[Music]


---------04:45----------
cool so and


---------04:48----------
and so uh i'm sorry i didn't mean to


---------04:50----------
interrupt your float you were telling a


---------04:52----------
really great narrative


---------04:54----------
um so you were saying you're afraid of


---------04:57----------
you tried to get a job this summer um it


---------05:00----------
was kind of hard to


---------05:02----------
even kind of apply and stuff because you


---------05:05----------
were concerned that people


---------05:07----------
wouldn't even want to hire you anyway so


---------05:10----------
you kind of gave up a little bit


---------05:12----------
easily yeah yeah i hardly felt in the


---------05:15----------
state


---------05:16----------
to like have a job and um


---------05:21----------
okay i think it's like that for a lot of


---------05:24----------
things actually


---------05:26----------
like what um so there's the job


---------05:31----------
um i


---------05:35----------
i'm supposed to be um going to a dentist


---------05:38----------
which i haven't really done i think i


---------05:42----------
need to update my health card


---------05:44----------
and i don't know i just have trouble


---------05:46----------
talking to people


---------05:48----------
especially over the phone and getting


---------05:51----------
that all set


---------05:52----------
up and i have i'm afraid of talking to


---------05:55----------
my family because


---------05:56----------
i haven't really been completely honest


---------05:58----------
with them with


---------05:59----------
what was happening um


---------06:03----------
what is it that they don't know


---------06:07----------
so they know that this year was


---------06:09----------
particularly hard for me


---------06:11----------
they don't know that i failed my


---------06:14----------
degree and um they do know that i


---------06:18----------
switched majors and my dad isn't


---------06:20----------
particularly happy about that


---------06:23----------
um he doesn't think i'll be able to do


---------06:26----------
physics


---------06:28----------
which is what i switched to and what did


---------06:30----------
you switch from


---------06:32----------
i switched from marine biology


---------06:36----------
okay so he doesn't think you're gonna be


---------06:39----------
able to do


---------06:40----------
physics yeah


---------06:48----------
which is fair because physics is pretty


---------06:50----------
hard right


---------06:53----------
sure does your dad


---------06:56----------
is your dad disappointed in you


---------07:02----------
um i


---------07:06----------
it's hard to tell i know if i told him


---------07:10----------
everything that maybe he would be


---------07:14----------
i think he is a little yeah okay


---------07:18----------
and so it sounds to me like


---------07:22----------
you're afraid of telling people things


---------07:23----------
because


---------07:25----------
yeah they may be disappointed if they


---------07:27----------
knew everything


---------07:29----------
yeah if they saw the real you


---------07:34----------
yeah so do you feel like you try to hide


---------07:37----------
who you really are


---------07:42----------
yeah i think so um


---------07:45----------
i've been


---------07:49----------
working on my mental health this summer


---------07:51----------
and i've been opening up a little more


---------07:52----------
but


---------07:53----------
mainly just online i don't


---------07:57----------
trust anyone in real life with anything


---------08:01----------
okay what about like a mental health


---------08:03----------
provider


---------08:05----------
like a therapist um i looked into that


---------08:09----------
but they only have over the phone


---------08:11----------
appointments because of kovit and


---------08:14----------
again i have a fear of talking on the


---------08:15----------
phone much rather go there in person


---------08:19----------
do they not do like video chat they


---------08:21----------
should do video chat they do like phone


---------08:23----------
phone


---------08:24----------
like boomer phone i think so i haven't


---------08:27----------
looked into it that much


---------08:29----------
because most providers are shifting to


---------08:31----------
tele


---------08:32----------
health which usually involves video


---------08:34----------
nowadays


---------08:36----------
okay but just something to think about


---------08:39----------
um


---------08:41----------
okay and so i'm not hearing anything so


---------08:45----------
i'm hearing about fear of failure


---------08:47----------
i'm getting the sense that you feel like


---------08:49----------
you're inevitably gonna disappoint


---------08:51----------
people


---------08:52----------
yeah are you disappointed in yourself


---------08:59----------
i think um considering


---------09:02----------
everything that has happened in my past


---------09:05----------
and everything


---------09:06----------
i think i was sort of destined to fail


---------09:08----------
like


---------09:10----------
there was definitely warning signs early


---------09:12----------
on and i didn't really know better but


---------09:15----------
i think it was something that was bound


---------09:17----------
to happen just because i didn't


---------09:19----------
really know what was going on wha what


---------09:22----------
do you mean warning signs


---------09:24----------
what were your warning signs


---------09:27----------
so even before


---------09:30----------
second year like i've been sort of


---------09:35----------
ignoring problems um


---------09:38----------
i know in high school


---------09:43----------
i had this fear of death


---------09:46----------
which um i think that


---------09:50----------
sort of what happened was so my brother


---------09:53----------
went off to university


---------09:56----------
um and i was in grade nine and then i


---------09:58----------
was sort of left on my own to figure out


---------10:02----------
life and i don't know my brother was a


---------10:04----------
big part of my life and so


---------10:07----------
everything sort of felt pointless and


---------10:09----------
meaningless after that and i started to


---------10:11----------
like


---------10:12----------
question why am i even here and all that


---------10:15----------
i think part of that was trying to


---------10:17----------
navigate the family situation at home


---------10:20----------
because my parents are divorced


---------10:24----------
and it's sort of like a week on week off


---------10:26----------
thing where i switch houses


---------10:29----------
and my mother found someone else to live


---------10:32----------
with who has


---------10:33----------
a drinking problem and


---------10:36----------
an anger problem which don't go well


---------10:39----------
together


---------10:41----------
so i think that's where my um


---------10:46----------
where i started getting addicted to


---------10:47----------
video games because it was an easy


---------10:49----------
escape


---------10:50----------
sure and what i think all that added up


---------10:54----------
to


---------10:55----------
what happened this year


---------10:58----------
so you feel destined to fail


---------11:01----------
yeah also sounds like your brother was a


---------11:04----------
really stabilizing influence in your


---------11:06----------
life


---------11:09----------
yeah i'd say that


---------11:12----------
it's hard to lose someone like that


---------11:13----------
especially at such a formative


---------11:16----------
time of your life like ninth grade


---------11:19----------
when did your mom start living with this


---------11:22----------
other person


---------11:26----------
probably when i was


---------11:30----------
seven or eight okay so that sounds like


---------11:32----------
that's been


---------11:33----------
in your life for most of what you can


---------11:35----------
remember


---------11:36----------
yeah okay my parents


---------11:39----------
i remember when my parents divorced


---------11:42----------
i was going into grade four my dad was


---------11:46----------
driving me to school and they're like


---------11:49----------
sorry you're not registered with the


---------11:50----------
school anymore


---------11:52----------
apparently my mom had just like switch


---------11:55----------
schools without telling anyone


---------11:57----------
and so it's like oh i'm at a new school


---------11:59----------
now


---------12:02----------
that feel


---------12:07----------
i was frustrating i


---------12:10----------
i didn't understand like her reasoning


---------12:14----------
why she didn't tell anyone


---------12:16----------
and it's like i don't know


---------12:19----------
it's yeah my life's been pretty chaotic


---------12:23----------
i'd say


---------12:25----------
yeah i was kind of thinking that it it


---------12:28----------
seems to me like


---------12:30----------
your life isn't really something that


---------12:31----------
you have a whole lot of control over


---------12:35----------
no not really yeah it sounds to me like


---------12:38----------
you're getting


---------12:38----------
pushed around by events in life like


---------12:41----------
your parents divorce


---------12:43----------
who your mom chooses to live with your


---------12:46----------
brother leaving


---------12:48----------
and and so it sounds tough it it feels


---------12:52----------
to me like


---------12:53----------
you may be feeling or it seems to me


---------12:55----------
like maybe you're feeling powerless


---------13:00----------
yeah i think so a little it's like


---------13:04----------
i don't know what to do anymore yep


---------13:07----------
and um so one of the things was like


---------13:13----------
i know probably around


---------13:16----------
like grade 10 or so when i was dealing


---------13:20----------
with all this on my own i'm like


---------13:23----------
yeah i will um i sort of made a promise


---------13:26----------
to myself that i would


---------13:27----------
despite how bad things would get i would


---------13:30----------
never


---------13:31----------
consider suicide as an option


---------13:34----------
so i think that's helped


---------13:38----------
and um sort of at grade 12


---------13:42----------
i was really anxious to get out of there


---------13:46----------
really anxious to go off to university


---------13:48----------
and live on my own so i could just


---------13:50----------
escape it all what were you escaping


---------13:57----------
everything really the whole


---------14:00----------
situation at home and everything that's


---------14:04----------
been going on


---------14:06----------
um switching back and forth between


---------14:09----------
houses


---------14:10----------
um sort of means that


---------14:13----------
everything that i own has to sort of fit


---------14:16----------
in a backpack


---------14:16----------
so i can carry it with me where i go


---------14:20----------
um escaping


---------14:22----------
[Music]


---------14:23----------
you know the verbal


---------14:26----------
the anger and stuff of my stepfather


---------14:30----------
um my mother tends to be over


---------14:33----------
controlling


---------14:34----------
she likes to do everything for me and i


---------14:37----------
wanted to escape that as well


---------14:40----------
so yeah sort of everything


---------14:47----------
wow that's a lot bro


---------14:53----------
that's a little


---------14:56----------
do you really feel that way or are you


---------14:58----------
just making a joke


---------15:02----------
i i don't think it's as much as some


---------15:04----------
people go through


---------15:10----------
okay so what does that mean for you


---------15:14----------
some people have it worse than you do


---------15:17----------
yeah


---------15:18----------
so


---------15:21----------
i think despite everything that happened


---------15:25----------
i should


---------15:26----------
have still been able to find a way


---------15:27----------
through and


---------15:29----------
i shouldn't have ended up where i was


---------15:31----------
where i am


---------15:33----------
sort of thing where should have you


---------15:35----------
ended up


---------15:38----------
um


---------15:42----------
should i pass this year at university


---------15:45----------
um and


---------15:49----------
i don't know i should have just been


---------15:51----------
destined for success


---------15:55----------
i was supposed to be successful


---------15:59----------
and what got in the way


---------16:05----------
[Music]


---------16:06----------
um


---------16:08----------
shitty life syndrome i guess um


---------16:11----------
i felt very lonely and isolated


---------16:15----------
this year which didn't help


---------16:18----------
and i never talked to anyone about how i


---------16:21----------
was feeling or what i was going through


---------16:23----------
because


---------16:24----------
i was afraid of how they would um


---------16:28----------
judge me for it and like they'd brush it


---------16:30----------
off and say oh it's nothing


---------16:32----------
just keep going like you'll get over it


---------16:36----------
have people told you that before


---------16:41----------
uh i think my dad tends to um


---------16:45----------
he's not very emotional um i mean he is


---------16:49----------
sometimes


---------16:50----------
but like it's like you just gotta do it


---------16:53----------
and like


---------16:54----------
ignore what you're feeling just do it


---------16:57----------
right


---------16:58----------
yep and he was always pushing for my


---------17:00----------
independence


---------17:01----------
and all that being successful


---------17:05----------
yep so


---------17:11----------
and and where is your brother throughout


---------17:13----------
all this


---------17:16----------
uh he's in university he's


---------17:20----------
i think he graduated last year


---------17:23----------
with a degree in software engineering


---------17:28----------
and i also have a sister she's off in


---------17:31----------
alberta


---------17:33----------
she got married she has


---------17:36----------
just had a baby this summer


---------17:41----------
and she's doing pretty good


---------17:44----------
she's an accountant and then there's me


---------17:48----------
and i failed


---------17:51----------
yeah so it so it feels


---------17:54----------
right and so also practically it sounds


---------17:56----------
like you actually failed some coursework


---------18:00----------
yeah i stopped doing my assignments okay


---------18:04----------
so asriel i'm gonna point out a couple


---------18:08----------
of things and i'd love to ask you a few


---------18:09----------
more questions


---------18:10----------
is that okay yeah so i


---------18:14----------
see something that really confuses me so


---------18:17----------
earlier


---------18:18----------
so recently you said that you were


---------18:20----------
supposed to be successful you were


---------18:21----------
destined for success


---------18:23----------
but that something got in the way yeah


---------18:26----------
right but earlier when we


---------18:29----------
we when we were talking to you also said


---------18:31----------
like when you


---------18:32----------
applied for a job you were just going to


---------18:34----------
disappointment


---------18:35----------
disappoint them even if you got the job


---------18:38----------
and that you were destined to fail like


---------18:40----------
i asked you


---------18:41----------
you know like what do you think about


---------18:42----------
your current situation you were like


---------18:43----------
well


---------18:44----------
now that i look back on it i saw that


---------18:46----------
like my failure was actually inevitable


---------18:49----------
and started many years ago


---------18:52----------
so i'm just i'm going to point out to


---------18:53----------
you and we'll explore this that there's


---------18:56----------
yeah decide what was that what did you


---------18:59----------
just feel


---------19:01----------
what is it like hearing me point that


---------19:02----------
out to you


---------19:05----------
um


---------19:09----------
i i think i'm still a little nervous for


---------19:11----------
being on stream


---------19:12----------
and um


---------19:16----------
i i'm just confused like my thoughts are


---------19:19----------
crazy


---------19:20----------
yep i can imagine that and that's what


---------19:23----------
i'm pointing out to you


---------19:25----------
is that i'm seeing a lot of conflicting


---------19:27----------
thoughts


---------19:28----------
because on the one hand asriel was


---------19:30----------
supposed to succeed and everything was


---------19:32----------
supposed to work out


---------19:33----------
and on the other hand you sure got


---------19:35----------
[ __ ] in life


---------19:38----------
yeah and what are you feeling now


---------19:49----------
powerless yeah hopeless


---------19:53----------
and so here's what i'm seeing asriel it


---------19:55----------
wasn't supposed to be this way


---------19:59----------
this was the life you were supposed to


---------20:02----------
live this life


---------20:04----------
and then something happened and then


---------20:06----------
that life is now


---------20:07----------
completely gone and now you've


---------20:10----------
shifted into this other life


---------20:16----------
and now this is what your future is and


---------20:18----------
every step you take on the road


---------20:21----------
towards failure reminds you that the


---------20:24----------
road towards success is getting further


---------20:27----------
and further away


---------20:32----------
yeah what does that feel like


---------20:42----------
i don't know um


---------20:48----------
i don't know about it it's like


---------20:56----------
i i'm trying sort of


---------20:59----------
everything to try and recover and get


---------21:01----------
back where i was


---------21:03----------
um i'm trying to avoid that road as much


---------21:07----------
as possible


---------21:10----------
can you


---------21:14----------
maybe if i try hard enough


---------21:17----------
okay


---------21:21----------
that's a good answer maybe is actually


---------21:23----------
the right answer


---------21:25----------
i don't know is also acceptable so i


---------21:28----------
think what i'm hearing the first thing


---------21:30----------
that i want to point out asriel is that


---------21:31----------
you have a deterministic view of life


---------21:35----------
destined to fail or destined to succeed


---------21:37----------
it's not how life works bro


---------21:40----------
right life is a maybe okay


---------21:44----------
right like you just can't because like


---------21:45----------
you were destined to succeed and then


---------21:47----------
what happened


---------21:48----------
i failed right so like


---------21:51----------
that the idea of destiny in and of


---------21:54----------
itself is false


---------21:55----------
because like clearly it's not true


---------21:59----------
what do you think about that


---------22:03----------
um


---------22:04----------
[Music]


---------22:10----------
i


---------22:14----------
i i don't know that's sort of one of the


---------22:17----------
debates i've been having is like


---------22:20----------
you know is is are things destined to


---------22:24----------
happen


---------22:24----------
or do i have a choice and it's like


---------22:27----------
well i make the choice based on


---------22:31----------
what i have to deal with right now and


---------22:35----------
it's like


---------22:36----------
i'm doing the best i can so


---------22:40----------
and yet i am still failing so


---------22:43----------
part of it seems like destiny okay


---------22:46----------
sure um


---------22:49----------
and so let me ask you a question


---------22:53----------
so if you were destined to succeed and


---------22:55----------
you ended up failing


---------22:58----------
is it possible to be destined to fail


---------23:01----------
and end up succeeding


---------23:08----------
does it go both ways i hope so


---------23:12----------
i hope so too right but that's like it's


---------23:14----------
interesting because if we want to be


---------23:15----------
scientific about it


---------23:17----------
and if things were destined and then you


---------23:19----------
ended up failing like maybe


---------23:21----------
even though you're hurtling towards


---------23:22----------
failure a hundred percent


---------23:26----------
i actually think you should you could be


---------23:27----------
okay like i'm not kidding


---------23:31----------
what do you think about that


---------23:35----------
i think i could be too um but it's gonna


---------23:38----------
take a lot of work for sure


---------23:41----------
yeah i think it'll take work


---------23:44----------
i also think that it's gonna take more


---------23:46----------
than work


---------23:48----------
what do you think about that


---------23:52----------
what more is there than work luck


---------23:55----------
my bro that's true


---------24:02----------
um


---------24:06----------
i i don't i don't know if i really


---------24:12----------
i don't know how i feel about luck


---------24:15----------
good when you say i don't know how i


---------24:18----------
feel about luck what does that mean


---------24:21----------
because like if it's just


---------24:25----------
luck then why am i able to influence


---------24:30----------
things okay so so there's an important


---------24:33----------
word there


---------24:36----------
if it's just luck


---------24:39----------
yeah so it's not just slack it's not


---------24:42----------
just luck but it's also not


---------24:44----------
just you


---------24:49----------
right so i think this is the hard thing


---------24:51----------
about life


---------24:53----------
is that we're in control of our actions


---------24:57----------
but we're not in control of the results


---------25:00----------
of our actions


---------25:03----------
i can pick up i can pick up the phone


---------25:06----------
and i can talk to someone


---------25:08----------
i can talk to my parents about how i


---------25:10----------
failed this class


---------25:12----------
i'm not in control of how they respond


---------25:16----------
yeah yeah that's true


---------25:21----------
and how does it feel to not be in


---------25:23----------
control of how they respond


---------25:32----------
it's it's hard because i want to make


---------25:35----------
them understand but i can't


---------25:39----------
yeah so so that too


---------25:42----------
you can't make them understand but


---------25:46----------
you also can't make them not understand


---------25:48----------
like that understanding is not


---------25:50----------
determined by you


---------25:52----------
you can talk to them right but there's


---------25:54----------
no guarantee that they're going to


---------25:55----------
understand


---------25:58----------
so what is it like to pick up the phone


---------26:00----------
and tell someone that you failed the


---------26:01----------
correct answer is it's [ __ ]


---------26:03----------
terrifying


---------26:04----------
yes that is the right answer okay


---------26:08----------
right and that's what you feel


---------26:12----------
so now asriel the question that we get


---------26:14----------
to


---------26:15----------
is like how do you as a human being


---------26:18----------
act in the face of complete terror


---------26:26----------
i hide in my room which is also the


---------26:29----------
correct answer


---------26:31----------
this is where there's a part of you


---------26:32----------
that's going to want to say


---------26:34----------
i overcome it with strength and internal


---------26:37----------
fortitude


---------26:38----------
no that's not what happens when we face


---------26:40----------
abject terror we get our asses kicked


---------26:43----------
that's what happens man it crushes us


---------26:46----------
yeah and then you wind up where you are


---------26:48----------
now which is


---------26:49----------
in your room playing minecraft all day


---------26:52----------
avoiding your responsibilities and being


---------26:54----------
crushed by terror


---------26:58----------
yeah now comes the next question


---------27:01----------
is that okay


---------27:06----------
now incorrect


---------27:11----------
what do you think about that


---------27:18----------
i


---------27:21----------
i feel like despite everything that's


---------27:25----------
going on i should be able to


---------27:26----------
do something and i shouldn't be hiding


---------27:30----------
in my room so when you say um


---------27:37----------
when you say this is the right thing to


---------27:39----------
do i


---------27:40----------
don't understand that good


---------27:43----------
that's what we're here for right so like


---------27:48----------
so is it the right thing to do no


---------27:51----------
is it the expected thing to do


---------27:53----------
absolutely


---------27:55----------
can we blame you for doing it


---------27:58----------
absolutely i mean sorry like not really


---------28:01----------
right like we can't


---------28:03----------
you know like in a sense like i don't


---------28:05----------
blame you for responding the way that


---------28:07----------
you have


---------28:10----------
does that make sense yeah


---------28:15----------
like it's understandable and i think


---------28:17----------
we've got to start there right so i


---------28:19----------
think


---------28:19----------
one of the biggest things about taking


---------28:21----------
control of your life asriel


---------28:23----------
is starting where you're at instead of


---------28:25----------
where you should be


---------28:28----------
think about this with me for a second


---------28:29----------
okay


---------28:31----------
we live our lives and we come up with


---------28:34----------
solutions for our life based on where we


---------28:38----------
should be not where we are


---------28:42----------
and then we're confused when it doesn't


---------28:44----------
work


---------28:47----------
and it's like man


---------28:51----------
you know i i can't even come up with an


---------28:54----------
analogy but do you see how ridiculous


---------28:55----------
that is


---------28:58----------
yeah it's like i should be able to fly


---------29:01----------
like a bird


---------29:02----------
so i'm gonna flap my wings and like then


---------29:04----------
i get upset with myself for not being


---------29:06----------
able to fly


---------29:09----------
right it's crazy because you keep on


---------29:11----------
talking about what you should be like


---------29:12----------
you should be able to overcome that fear


---------29:15----------
well like if you were a dude who could


---------29:16----------
overcome that fear then you would have


---------29:18----------
done it by now


---------29:20----------
so okay you can't overcome fear here's


---------29:23----------
the wild thing


---------29:24----------
is i think that you can still be


---------29:26----------
successful as long as you acknowledge


---------29:28----------
that you're [ __ ] up in some way


---------29:34----------
all right right because then at least


---------29:35----------
like you know what you're playing it's


---------29:36----------
sort of like


---------29:38----------
you know like i don't know like i don't


---------29:39----------
know if you've ever played dark souls


---------29:40----------
but like


---------29:42----------
you know i kind of think about there's a


---------29:43----------
class in dark souls called deprived


---------29:46----------
which is like you start the game naked


---------29:48----------
with a club


---------29:50----------
and if you think like you can also start


---------29:52----------
the game in like chainmail armor


---------29:54----------
with a sword and shield and then you can


---------29:56----------
play dark souls like pretending that you


---------29:58----------
have a sword and shield and armor


---------30:00----------
and then you're gonna lose but if you


---------30:03----------
like start with the get-go which is like


---------30:04----------
i'm a naked dude with a club


---------30:07----------
you can actually play the game but you


---------30:08----------
just have to like accept that you've got


---------30:10----------
a club instead of like


---------30:11----------
armor and a sword you can accept that


---------30:16----------
something about the way that you were


---------30:18----------
raised and we're gonna get into this


---------30:20----------
has made it hard for you to be confident


---------30:23----------
in yourself and have faith in yourself


---------30:25----------
that i don't think is your fault so no


---------30:27----------
wonder like


---------30:28----------
you don't have like so you say i'm just


---------30:30----------
going to disappoint them like where the


---------30:32----------
[ __ ] what what do you base that on


---------30:37----------
um past experience um


---------30:41----------
exactly right but here's the thing i


---------30:43----------
don't know if you know this


---------30:44----------
but when human beings are born


---------30:49----------
it's not like natural that they believe


---------30:51----------
that they're inevitably going to


---------30:52----------
disappoint people


---------30:54----------
like people have done studies on the


---------30:56----------
brain and there's no like i'm going to


---------30:58----------
disappoint everyone in life center of


---------31:00----------
the brain


---------31:03----------
we're taught that we're going to


---------31:04----------
disappoint people


---------31:06----------
so the beliefs that you have about


---------31:08----------
yourself are very reasonable


---------31:10----------
even if they're wrong what do you think


---------31:13----------
about that think that makes sense


---------31:20----------
i don't think they're wrong yep


---------31:24----------
i know that you and they're they they're


---------31:25----------
not wrong for you right because


---------31:27----------
you're not a dumb guy and why do you


---------31:29----------
believe the things that you believe


---------31:33----------
because i learned them absolutely


---------31:35----------
because of


---------31:36----------
past experience now here's the thing


---------31:41----------
does past experience determine future


---------31:44----------
experience


---------31:47----------
now you sure about that


---------31:58----------
um


---------32:01----------
yeah i guess it could


---------32:05----------
it depends like if it's the same person


---------32:07----------
then yes


---------32:08----------
but if it's a different person then


---------32:11----------
things are


---------32:11----------
could be different okay are you the same


---------32:14----------
person you were yesterday


---------32:18----------
no okay so


---------32:22----------
right so that's kind of interesting


---------32:23----------
because what you're shaking like what


---------32:25----------
you're doing there


---------32:26----------
if i were to accept your answers what


---------32:27----------
you seem to be suggesting to me


---------32:29----------
is that you do have some limited control


---------32:32----------
over your future


---------32:35----------
yeah how does that sit with you


---------32:40----------
yeah that makes sense okay so now we get


---------32:43----------
to the important question


---------32:44----------
is it enough


---------32:50----------
well i'm figuring that out now because


---------32:54----------
with everything i'm trying i hope it's


---------32:56----------
enough


---------32:57----------
that also is the right answer so there's


---------33:00----------
a


---------33:00----------
subtle shift in your language asriel and


---------33:03----------
i'm optimistic for you by the way


---------33:06----------
and is like you you started out by


---------33:08----------
saying


---------33:09----------
i'm just going to disappoint them i'm


---------33:11----------
destined to fail


---------33:13----------
i'm destined to be successful i'm


---------33:15----------
supposed to be this


---------33:16----------
i should be this right


---------33:20----------
yeah and and then the question becomes


---------33:23----------
like like


---------33:24----------
so those are very deterministic


---------33:25----------
statements they're black and white


---------33:27----------
thinking


---------33:29----------
and now what you're saying is like


---------33:33----------
maybe or i hope do you


---------33:36----------
usually think thoughts like that


---------33:40----------
hold on a second there seemed to be like


---------33:42----------
a thousand people getting


---------33:44----------
messages deleted i don't understand


---------33:48----------
anyway um what what do you think about


---------33:52----------
i'm gonna just realize that


---------33:56----------
what do you think about like you know


---------33:58----------
like shades of grey statements versus


---------34:00----------
deterministic


---------34:02----------
like do you usually think in in terms of


---------34:04----------
like this is going to happen


---------34:09----------
um uh


---------34:12----------
not entirely


---------34:16----------
it's sort of like i have no clue what


---------34:18----------
will happen


---------34:19----------
but i think it's gonna be bad okay


---------34:22----------
right so that makes sense because it


---------34:25----------
sounds like there have been times in


---------34:27----------
your life


---------34:27----------
where you weren't sure what was gonna


---------34:29----------
happen and what usually happened was


---------34:33----------
bad so that's a reasonable thing to


---------34:37----------
expect


---------34:38----------
right so now if it's okay i'm going to


---------34:40----------
ask you a couple questions


---------34:42----------
about your your life and your upbringing


---------34:44----------
so


---------34:46----------
um so i'm going to just run through like


---------34:50----------
what i understood your story to be


---------34:53----------
actually before we do that can i ask you


---------34:56----------
so i understand that over


---------34:57----------
analyzing is part of the like what you


---------35:00----------
wanted to talk about today i'm not


---------35:01----------
hearing any sort of over analysis so far


---------35:04----------
can you tell us about that


---------35:07----------
i think i think that's um sort of like


---------35:16----------
like what we were just talking about


---------35:18----------
where it's like


---------35:20----------
i'm uncertain what will happen but i


---------35:22----------
know it will be bad and i can analyze


---------35:24----------
that


---------35:24----------
in like so many different ways as oh


---------35:27----------
this could happen this could happen this


---------35:29----------
could happen this could happen


---------35:33----------
i'm gonna have to think about this more


---------35:35----------
before i take action


---------35:37----------
it's like and like in all the bad things


---------35:42----------
that can happen i can only have one


---------35:44----------
good outcome which is that it succeeds


---------35:47----------
and the bad outweighs the good in most


---------35:50----------
cases


---------35:51----------
yep right so let's let's look at that


---------35:53----------
because that's fascinating


---------35:55----------
so what i'm hearing you say is that the


---------35:58----------
more you


---------35:58----------
analyze does that


---------36:01----------
make it easier for you to act or harder


---------36:04----------
for you to act


---------36:06----------
harder and generally speaking when we


---------36:09----------
think about analyzing a problem what is


---------36:12----------
the goal of analysis


---------36:15----------
to come to a solution so that you can


---------36:18----------
act


---------36:19----------
absolutely accordingly which is weird


---------36:21----------
right


---------36:22----------
so the reason that we like use our head


---------36:24----------
is to figure out how to do things


---------36:27----------
and yet somehow the more you think the


---------36:30----------
harder it becomes to do things


---------36:33----------
yeah and so


---------36:36----------
what do you think about that


---------36:43----------
i think i think that's how i was raised


---------36:47----------
is


---------36:48----------
um there's only one good outcome in the


---------36:51----------
restaurant bed and like


---------36:54----------
i i gotta make the right decisions or


---------36:56----------
i'm gonna mess up


---------36:57----------
and things are gonna be bad um


---------37:01----------
can you tell us what you mean by that's


---------37:04----------
how i was raised


---------37:07----------
like if i didn't get do my homework then


---------37:10----------
i was gonna get in trouble


---------37:11----------
if i didn't ask my stepfather if he


---------37:14----------
needed help then he was gonna get angry


---------37:17----------
at dinner if


---------37:21----------
i don't know if


---------37:26----------
if i left my room when he was in


---------37:30----------
one of his bad moods i was likely to get


---------37:32----------
in trouble


---------37:34----------
and what is getting in trouble look like


---------37:40----------
well


---------37:44----------
he sort of gets um


---------37:47----------
angry right and he


---------37:51----------
he takes it out on me because it's like


---------37:53----------
oh this is your fault somehow


---------37:56----------
funds a way to blame me for it um


---------37:59----------
and i try all that i can to try and stop


---------38:03----------
stop


---------38:04----------
that from happening um


---------38:08----------
but it's not physical it's only verbal


---------38:11----------
so and then


---------38:16----------
in the beginning my mother sort of


---------38:19----------
supported him


---------38:22----------
but i think near the end


---------38:25----------
i started to become more vocal about


---------38:28----------
like


---------38:29----------
this isn't right i sort of started to


---------38:32----------
stand up for myself and


---------38:34----------
i think near the end things were


---------38:36----------
starting to change


---------38:39----------
um i know he started seeking help for


---------38:43----------
his problems a little


---------38:46----------
um


---------38:46----------
[Music]


---------38:49----------
yeah how do you feel about that


---------38:56----------
it's hard because


---------39:01----------
when my brother was there it's like oh


---------39:03----------
we can get through this together but


---------39:05----------
when it's just me it's like oh


---------39:07----------
i have to figure this out on my own what


---------39:09----------
do i do


---------39:12----------
it was hard but


---------39:15----------
i think like i understand


---------39:19----------
that he was going through his own


---------39:21----------
problems


---------39:26----------
but doesn't make it right


---------39:33----------
yeah i mean you know in a bizarre way


---------39:36----------
asriel i feel


---------39:37----------
sadder for you now


---------39:40----------
because it's like now he's on the


---------39:43----------
journey of self-discovery and


---------39:44----------
improvement


---------39:45----------
and like that [ __ ] needed to happen way


---------39:48----------
earlier


---------39:50----------
and you started standing up for yourself


---------39:53----------
and then like you know you needed


---------39:56----------
someone to do that for you when you were


---------39:59----------
young


---------40:01----------
it sounds to me like too little too late


---------40:03----------
which is almost worse than like nothing


---------40:05----------
at all


---------40:12----------
maybe we got there in the end i guess


---------40:16----------
so what


---------40:20----------
still [ __ ] you up before he got there


---------40:25----------
sure


---------40:31----------
asriel i'm not getting much anger from


---------40:33----------
you


---------40:35----------
no i'm not an angry person i


---------40:39----------
tend to sympathize with others even if


---------40:42----------
they've done me wrong yeah what do you


---------40:45----------
think about that


---------40:49----------
i think that's just


---------40:53----------
because i can always see their side of


---------40:54----------
the story


---------40:56----------
and it's i understand that there are


---------40:59----------
going through their own troubles


---------41:02----------
and what does it do to your hurt


---------41:06----------
when you can see their side of the story


---------41:11----------
well it takes the blame off of me a


---------41:14----------
little i guess


---------41:18----------
sure it


---------41:20----------
means that i can sort of


---------41:24----------
find ways of helping them so that


---------41:30----------
because if i help them then maybe


---------41:34----------
they'll stop


---------41:39----------
okay


---------41:44----------
i'm gonna need a second to think is that


---------41:46----------
okay sure


---------42:08----------
so that makes a lot of sense to me


---------42:09----------
asriel and it's just


---------42:11----------
so [ __ ] up i want you to listen to


---------42:14----------
what you're saying


---------42:15----------
okay i'm going to repeat it back to you


---------42:17----------
you have an abusive stepfather


---------42:21----------
and you try to understand him


---------42:24----------
and the conclusion that you come to is


---------42:26----------
that if you can help him


---------42:28----------
because he needs help


---------42:31----------
then you'll feel better


---------42:35----------
whereas like that's not really where


---------42:37----------
like it's not


---------42:38----------
on you


---------42:42----------
yeah right and and so i get what you


---------42:44----------
mean about sort of deflecting blame i


---------42:46----------
think the interesting thing is that


---------42:47----------
the other person that you're protecting


---------42:49----------
by doing that what you also do is you


---------42:51----------
like prevent yourself from blaming them


---------42:58----------
yeah so one last psychological point i


---------43:02----------
want to make or one


---------43:02----------
kind of psychological point that i want


---------43:04----------
to make is that


---------43:06----------
some people believe that depression is


---------43:08----------
anger turned against the self


---------43:13----------
that that describes my experience pretty


---------43:16----------
well yeah


---------43:17----------
okay so


---------43:22----------
here's what i think could be going on


---------43:24----------
with you because i think you have


---------43:26----------
so when someone grows up in an abusive


---------43:28----------
household


---------43:30----------
and when their step parent is abusive


---------43:32----------
and their


---------43:33----------
actual parent is even supportive of it


---------43:37----------
how much anger do you think that that


---------43:38----------
person should feel


---------43:43----------
they should be frustrated


---------43:46----------
that's the understatement of the year my


---------43:47----------
friend


---------43:50----------
right like how fair is that


---------43:54----------
like your mom should be protecting you


---------43:59----------
again i understand why she wasn't


---------44:02----------
because


---------44:03----------
she herself was a little afraid too


---------44:06----------
yup and i understand that you understand


---------44:08----------
that which is cool


---------44:11----------
and at the same time she should have


---------44:13----------
been protecting you


---------44:16----------
and i'm not talking about blaming her or


---------44:18----------
things like that in your particular case


---------44:20----------
i want you to think about this like


---------44:21----------
other people


---------44:23----------
like when you have a step parent who's


---------44:25----------
abusive towards a child what is the


---------44:27----------
parent supposed to do


---------44:30----------
you're supposed to step in absolutely


---------44:34----------
right so and i i know that you're going


---------44:35----------
to have your mind is going to generate


---------44:38----------
certain thoughts


---------44:39----------
like you're going to want to get go


---------44:40----------
ahead and give me the counterpoint


---------44:43----------
when you said that you wanted to say


---------44:45----------
something else right and explain things


---------44:47----------
and protect her go ahead protect her


---------44:50----------
well


---------44:52----------
i think she herself was also um


---------44:55----------
a victim of it too um


---------44:59----------
i think she was doing the best that she


---------45:01----------
could um


---------45:05----------
maybe she didn't understand the


---------45:07----------
situation as well


---------45:09----------
sure yeah all those things are fair i'm


---------45:12----------
not trying to demonize your mom do you


---------45:14----------
feel like we're beating up your mom


---------45:17----------
asking if you feel that way no


---------45:20----------
okay i don't think so because it's not


---------45:23----------
it's genuinely not my intention


---------45:25----------
so now the question becomes if someone


---------45:27----------
like you know if someone grows up in


---------45:28----------
that situation


---------45:29----------
like sure i understand that you are


---------45:31----------
understanding


---------45:33----------
but i think that what's going on is


---------45:35----------
you're accumulating anger


---------45:38----------
you're not sending it towards them


---------45:39----------
you're just accumulating it and then


---------45:41----------
where does it go


---------45:44----------
i push it down pretend it doesn't exist


---------45:47----------
and then it bursts out in second year


---------45:49----------
university


---------45:51----------
how so what is it target


---------45:54----------
because it's energy it's got to go


---------45:56----------
somewhere


---------45:58----------
targets me absolutely


---------46:02----------
gotta go somewhere


---------46:06----------
right so like now this is how emotions


---------46:08----------
work


---------46:10----------
if i win the lottery i'm filled with joy


---------46:13----------
and then what do i do i spread it around


---------46:16----------
it's got to go somewhere i can't contain


---------46:19----------
it it's got to go somewhere


---------46:22----------
and in your case filled with anger


---------46:26----------
doesn't have anywhere to go got to keep


---------46:28----------
it inside


---------46:30----------
and then now left feel it no of course


---------46:32----------
you don't


---------46:33----------
what it feels like is depression


---------46:37----------
you don't think that i'm just going to


---------46:39----------
disappoint them


---------46:40----------
is you being an [ __ ] to yourself


---------46:45----------
yeah it is there it is it just feels


---------46:47----------
different


---------46:49----------
you've gotten so good at not feeling


---------46:52----------
anger you don't even know what it looks


---------46:54----------
like


---------46:54----------
anymore my dude you are


---------46:58----------
in an abusive relationship with yourself


---------47:03----------
yep right


---------47:06----------
and that's like really sad and it's


---------47:10----------
it's like why why are you that way with


---------47:13----------
your song


---------47:22----------
um


---------47:25----------
i blame myself for everything because


---------47:28----------
there's always something i could have


---------47:30----------
done differently


---------47:31----------
and maybe it would have worked yep right


---------47:34----------
so right so


---------47:35----------
that's the thought process that's the


---------47:37----------
content of your mind i'm asking


---------47:39----------
why does your mind think in that way


---------47:42----------
and it's because you were taught


---------47:45----------
that things are your fault


---------47:50----------
right like your stepdad was like it's


---------47:52----------
your fault i'm angry


---------47:55----------
everything in the world is whose fault


---------47:57----------
asriel


---------48:00----------
mine absolutely


---------48:03----------
right so then like like we asked the


---------48:04----------
question why do you blame yourself it's


---------48:06----------
because


---------48:07----------
those are the rules of the game if you


---------48:09----------
log on to the game of life


---------48:11----------
and you're playing this game with


---------48:13----------
minecraft where you're asriel


---------48:15----------
and then something burns down halfway


---------48:17----------
across the world


---------48:18----------
and then everyone on the server is like


---------48:20----------
[ __ ] that guy asriel


---------48:23----------
and it's so [ __ ] up my dude


---------48:27----------
but we see this a lot right like we see


---------48:29----------
like you know like i'm gonna just give


---------48:31----------
you an example of another abusive


---------48:32----------
relationship so let's say there's like a


---------48:34----------
husband and wife and


---------48:35----------
like the husband is physically abusive


---------48:37----------
and i've dealt with this a lot


---------48:39----------
and then the wife like i talked to the


---------48:41----------
wife and she's like yeah he hit me


---------48:43----------
and then i was like oh like tell me


---------48:45----------
about that she's like well it's because


---------48:48----------
you know like i didn't have dinner ready


---------48:49----------
on time


---------48:51----------
and if i had dinner ready on time


---------48:54----------
he wouldn't have hit me which is


---------48:58----------
true right and like it it's true


---------49:03----------
but it's also [ __ ] up it doesn't make


---------49:07----------
it okay


---------49:07----------
even if it's true and i think the


---------49:11----------
problem


---------49:11----------
that i'm seeing in you is that like


---------49:13----------
there's a lot of truth in your mind of


---------49:14----------
things which i think unfortunately


---------49:16----------
you're a smart guy


---------49:18----------
like if you were stupider i could


---------49:20----------
convince you that you were wrong


---------49:24----------
but i think that you learned and this is


---------49:26----------
what happens when kids grow up right


---------49:28----------
like this is a survival mechanism


---------49:31----------
if i have a dog that i'm physically


---------49:33----------
abusive to the dog learns how to not get


---------49:36----------
hit


---------49:38----------
and you learned because he sure as hell


---------49:40----------
isn't taking any of the blame in the


---------49:42----------
relationship


---------49:43----------
and your mom is also reinforcing like


---------49:45----------
whose fault is it that he's mean to you


---------49:49----------
it's mine right and generally speaking


---------49:52----------
she's supposed to tell you the opposite


---------49:55----------
and so you've learned that everything is


---------49:58----------
your fault


---------49:59----------
even things that aren't your fault and


---------50:02----------
then let me ask you something what is a


---------50:03----------
kid


---------50:04----------
who feels like things that are not their


---------50:06----------
fault are their fault


---------50:08----------
how do they think about their ability to


---------50:10----------
control the future


---------50:17----------
um they think that


---------50:21----------
they can control everything and if


---------50:23----------
something doesn't happen


---------50:25----------
correctly it's their fault yep


---------50:29----------
it's bizarre right


---------50:32----------
and that's what we see in you


---------50:36----------
you feel like you have perfect control


---------50:39----------
all of the responsibility actually it's


---------50:41----------
not


---------50:42----------
control i'm going to use the word


---------50:43----------
responsibility you feel like you are


---------50:46----------
responsible for controlling your


---------50:48----------
future and at the same time you feel


---------50:52----------
powerless


---------50:54----------
and why do you feel powerless


---------50:58----------
because deep down you recognize that you


---------51:01----------
actually don't control your stepdad


---------51:04----------
right so that kid is conflicted because


---------51:06----------
everyone is telling him


---------51:07----------
you are in control of the situation but


---------51:10----------
then there are horrible truths that you


---------51:12----------
can't control your stepdad's behavior


---------51:15----------
and it's this core conflict of like


---------51:18----------
i'm in control but i'm actually


---------51:20----------
powerless


---------51:22----------
does that make sense yeah


---------51:26----------
is that how you feel


---------51:32----------
yeah it's like i'm powerless now


---------51:36----------
but if i work a little harder i'll be in


---------51:38----------
control


---------51:40----------
yeah right so like if you had asked your


---------51:42----------
dad for help


---------51:43----------
then then you'll be okay


---------51:47----------
and so so it's interesting because


---------51:49----------
subtly and i i think you're right there


---------51:50----------
that like


---------51:51----------
you have this idea that if you do


---------51:53----------
something that something will happen but


---------51:55----------
i think unfortunately as you've learned


---------51:57----------
you can't really control


---------51:58----------
what's gonna happen and what i'm hearing


---------52:02----------
you actually try to do and and this may


---------52:04----------
be a bit abstract


---------52:07----------
you're trying to shift your life back


---------52:09----------
into the world of [ __ ]


---------52:11----------
like this is the way your life should be


---------52:13----------
and if you could just get back on that


---------52:15----------
track


---------52:15----------
then everything's gonna be fine


---------52:19----------
that's what i feel from you it's like i


---------52:22----------
just need to board that train and then


---------52:23----------
the train will take me where i need to


---------52:25----------
go


---------52:27----------
you're living in fantasy it's not how it


---------52:30----------
works man


---------52:31----------
it's sad all right


---------52:35----------
huh


---------52:38----------
i i think that could be true yeah


---------52:42----------
what makes you think that could be true


---------52:47----------
i tend to um i tend to fantasize a lot


---------52:51----------
i'm a big dreamer i


---------52:54----------
like to dream of the future and


---------52:58----------
even if it's not relating to me i like


---------53:00----------
to think of


---------53:01----------
you know epic space battles and


---------53:05----------
civilizations on the edge of the


---------53:06----------
universe and all that


---------53:09----------
that's cool man it is


---------53:14----------
so it sounds like you're familiar with


---------53:15----------
fantasy are you familiar with hope


---------53:23----------
[Music]


---------53:27----------
not so much right


---------53:30----------
and i think here's the problem is that


---------53:34----------
fantasy doesn't actually help us move


---------53:36----------
forward


---------53:39----------
what do you think about that


---------53:46----------
i i disagree okay because like


---------53:50----------
it's like this is where i want to go


---------53:54----------
which is the fantasy and it's like all


---------53:56----------
right how do i get there


---------53:59----------
and then i can plan it out


---------54:02----------
and hopefully go in the direction i want


---------54:05----------
okay


---------54:06----------
so that's i i stand corrected


---------54:09----------
i concede the point so when you plan it


---------54:13----------
out


---------54:14----------
does it help you get there


---------54:17----------
yes i think so


---------54:23----------
now i'm really confused because


---------54:26----------
this doesn't sound to me like someone


---------54:28----------
who's destined to fail


---------54:40----------
help me help me understand are you


---------54:41----------
destined to fail


---------54:47----------
no are you just saying that because


---------54:50----------
that's the right answer or do you


---------54:51----------
actually believe that


---------54:53----------
because this is like healthy gamer dr k


---------54:56----------
and i'm supposed to be inspirational


---------54:58----------
no i i don't i don't think i'm


---------55:02----------
destined to fail


---------55:05----------
but in order to succeed i would need to


---------55:08----------
work really hard


---------55:09----------
for it okay and what do you need to


---------55:12----------
work really hard towards


---------55:17----------
getting my life back where it was


---------55:20----------
getting back on the success train


---------55:23----------
okay so i think that's the wrong answer


---------55:28----------
so here's why i think the success train


---------55:30----------
is an illusion


---------55:33----------
it's it's wishing you had chain mail and


---------55:35----------
a sword


---------55:38----------
right so i understand i i think you can


---------55:40----------
be successful


---------55:42----------
but i think like instead of chasing that


---------55:44----------
fantasy of the success train i think


---------55:46----------
it's like way


---------55:48----------
dirtier than that


---------55:51----------
there's something about that that seems


---------55:53----------
like very clean and beautiful


---------55:55----------
and alluring to me i think there's


---------55:57----------
absolutely hope and i think i


---------55:58----------
absolutely see success in your future i


---------56:01----------
just think it's gonna be like


---------56:02----------
messier than you or that i'm getting


---------56:05----------
from you now


---------56:09----------
maybe i like to think that everything


---------56:13----------
will just work


---------56:14----------
out but


---------56:18----------
that's not the case obviously


---------56:22----------
yeah so that can be a comforting thought


---------56:25----------
asriel and now i think we get into like


---------56:26----------
some really nuanced territory


---------56:29----------
where i don't think that everything is


---------56:31----------
just going to work out


---------56:33----------
i think you can build the life that you


---------56:35----------
want to and if you're studying physics


---------56:37----------
because you want to discover


---------56:38----------
extraterrestrial life one day


---------56:40----------
i'd say [ __ ] dude go for it


---------56:44----------
you know and and like you're interested


---------56:46----------
in science fiction and understanding


---------56:48----------
like how the universe works and like the


---------56:50----------
frontiers of like


---------56:51----------
space travel and all that kind of i'd


---------56:52----------
say go for it man i just think it's


---------56:54----------
gonna be messy


---------56:59----------
yeah and i don't think that that's


---------57:03----------
necessarily bad


---------57:10----------
okay right because i i think what you're


---------57:14----------
doing and now we're going to kind of go


---------57:16----------
back to some of your like psychological


---------57:18----------
patterns


---------57:19----------
because what you're always doing is


---------57:21----------
looking for the perfect solution


---------57:23----------
because let me tell you why you think


---------57:26----------
you have a fear of failure


---------57:28----------
and the reason that you think is to get


---------57:31----------
rid of the fear of failure because if


---------57:32----------
you can find that perfect solution where


---------57:34----------
there's no chance of failure


---------57:36----------
then do you need to have fear you know


---------57:39----------
that's what you try to do right you try


---------57:41----------
to remove fear through thinking


---------57:44----------
agreed yep and that's a perfect solution


---------57:48----------
there it is again do you see the fantasy


---------57:50----------
of that if i can find that


---------57:52----------
magical road then i don't have to deal


---------57:55----------
with the fear it's so clean and it's so


---------57:57----------
beautiful


---------57:58----------
and i can figure out the perfect thing


---------57:59----------
to say and then i can pick up the phone


---------58:01----------
and i can talk to someone


---------58:02----------
all i need to know to pick up the phone


---------58:05----------
and talk to someone is i have to figure


---------58:07----------
out what's the


---------58:08----------
perfect thing to say yeah


---------58:11----------
because that's what you do man you look


---------58:12----------
for it like how can i tell my dad


---------58:14----------
that i failed and how can i phrase it


---------58:18----------
so that he doesn't judge me


---------58:22----------
it's the magical train how do i board


---------58:24----------
that train if i


---------58:25----------
think really really hard and i analyze


---------58:28----------
and analyze and analyze


---------58:29----------
i can find i can board the magic train


---------58:32----------
and he won't be disappointed


---------58:36----------
so you're overthinking and you're


---------58:40----------
you're your search for fantasy is to


---------58:43----------
protect you


---------58:45----------
from fear it's your antidote to fear


---------58:51----------
and it's paralyzing because


---------58:54----------
there isn't a perfect solution


---------58:58----------
and so you're searching for a cure to


---------59:00----------
fear that doesn't exist do you disagree


---------59:05----------
[Music]


---------59:09----------
i think there's always a perfect


---------59:11----------
solution but


---------59:15----------
like i don't think things have to be


---------59:18----------
messy


---------59:19----------
okay i think that's a fair point


---------59:23----------
so here's my question to you


---------59:27----------
so actually it's not a question i'm just


---------59:28----------
gonna make a point for you to think


---------59:29----------
about okay


---------59:31----------
i think that there may be perfect


---------59:32----------
solutions and i certainly have felt that


---------59:35----------
i think there are times in my life for


---------59:37----------
example like as a psychiatrist sometimes


---------59:39----------
i deal with people


---------59:40----------
who are suicidal and then i think that


---------59:42----------
sometimes there is like the perfect


---------59:44----------
thing to say


---------59:46----------
and this is someone who's like wants to


---------59:47----------
kill themselves


---------59:49----------
and then you like you gotta say the


---------59:50----------
right thing can't say the wrong thing


---------59:53----------
and so i do believe that those things


---------59:54----------
exist i'm with you


---------59:57----------
what i have found and this is something


---------59:59----------
you've got to think about this isn't


---------60:01----------
something that i can ask you questions


---------60:03----------
because you're a smart guy i think


---------60:04----------
you've got to come to your own


---------60:05----------
conclusion


---------60:06----------
is that building a strategy based on


---------60:08----------
perfect solutions


---------60:10----------
is a bad strategy


---------60:14----------
because perfect solutions are few and


---------60:17----------
far between


---------60:18----------
and they're hard to find whereas


---------60:21----------
building a strategy based on solutions


---------60:23----------
that are good enough


---------60:26----------
tends to be a better strategy


---------60:30----------
and while it ain't perfect it's actually


---------60:32----------
gonna get you to where you go like you


---------60:34----------
know i just think about cooking


---------60:36----------
and it's like you can't like sure you


---------60:38----------
can make a perfect cookie but


---------60:42----------
that's hard making a decent cookie


---------60:44----------
actually gets you most of the way there


---------60:47----------
what do you think about that


---------60:51----------
i think that's true


---------60:55----------
i do a lot of cooking and it's sort of


---------60:57----------
like i just improvise and


---------61:00----------
figure out what works what doesn't just


---------61:03----------
by trial and error


---------61:05----------
okay interesting right so why can you do


---------61:09----------
that with cooking but you can't do that


---------61:11----------
with other things in your life


---------61:16----------
because with cooking it's just me


---------61:19----------
and it's like if i mess this up oh well


---------61:22----------
it's like the consequences aren't that


---------61:25----------
big i just have


---------61:26----------
bad food


---------61:32----------
now i'm gonna say something that's


---------61:33----------
absolutely go ahead sorry


---------61:35----------
yeah sorry it's like um


---------61:39----------
you know i could have bad food but most


---------61:41----------
time it turns out pretty good


---------61:43----------
so i i think it works


---------61:47----------
and and so what makes real life


---------61:50----------
different


---------61:54----------
because in real life you only have one


---------61:57----------
shot


---------61:57----------
to make it pretty good


---------62:05----------
because like if i fail


---------62:09----------
and i waste all that money in university


---------62:12----------
then i'm gonna end up broke and i'm not


---------62:15----------
gonna have a degree and i'm not gonna


---------62:16----------
have a job


---------62:18----------
and then i will be nowhere and i can't


---------62:22----------
how would i recover from that i can't go


---------62:24----------
back to university because i'll just


---------62:26----------
waste more money that i don't have


---------62:29----------
so i only have one shot


---------62:33----------
right yeah i can see why you think that


---------62:38----------
way


---------62:39----------
and as someone who


---------62:42----------
also failed a lot


---------62:45----------
like i mean i you know i had


---------62:49----------
i had a d average after two years of


---------62:53----------
college


---------62:55----------
had a lot of f's took me five years


---------62:57----------
probably took would have taken me five


---------62:59----------
and a half or six years to graduate


---------63:01----------
really busted my ass in my fifth year


---------63:04----------
and and managed to graduate


---------63:07----------
just one year late i don't know what the


---------63:11----------
is it canadian uses of four canadian


---------63:13----------
schools use


---------63:14----------
a four-point gpa system


---------63:17----------
yeah so i graduated with a 2.5 and had


---------63:20----------
less than a 2.0 after two years


---------63:23----------
and what you're saying is logical


---------63:26----------
and in my experience real life turns out


---------63:29----------
to be way more like cooking than you


---------63:31----------
would imagine


---------63:36----------
and i'm not saying that the steaks


---------63:37----------
aren't the same like if you overcook


---------63:39----------
your chicken like not that big of a deal


---------63:41----------
being a hundred thousand dollars in debt


---------63:43----------
slightly bigger deal


---------63:46----------
and at the same time i i just don't


---------63:49----------
that's not


---------63:50----------
it's just not how life works man like


---------63:52----------
one relationship is not


---------63:54----------
you know like even when it comes to your


---------63:56----------
your mom and your stepdad


---------63:58----------
they kind of [ __ ] you up and at the


---------64:01----------
same time


---------64:04----------
doesn't mean that they can't try to fix


---------64:06----------
it


---------64:10----------
what do you think about that


---------64:18----------
um i don't think


---------64:22----------
i think it's up to me to fix it honestly


---------64:25----------
who's surprised you said that


---------64:31----------
right because what are you doing there


---------64:34----------
i'm blaming myself for what happened


---------64:38----------
yep you see how quick you are to do that


---------64:44----------
yeah and and and so it's so hard because


---------64:47----------
when you blame yourself for what


---------64:48----------
happened it's like it


---------64:49----------
like really raises the stakes right it's


---------64:51----------
like kind of it's hard it's a hard way


---------64:53----------
to live man


---------64:56----------
and you know i


---------65:02----------
i feel like this is sort of an abstract


---------65:04----------
or theoretical discussion is this


---------65:06----------
helpful for you


---------65:11----------
um


---------65:14----------
i think so how so


---------65:17----------
i think it helps me understand sort of


---------65:21----------
what's going on um


---------65:27----------
i don't know i tend to be pretty


---------65:29----------
abstract


---------65:32----------
yeah i think you're a thinker yeah


---------65:35----------
yeah i am too i really enjoy it


---------65:39----------
at the same time i'm i'm noticing a


---------65:41----------
little bit of a pressure within me


---------65:42----------
to try to make this practically


---------65:44----------
applicable to you


---------65:47----------
yeah i think so okay


---------65:50----------
so here's can we do that for a little


---------65:53----------
bit


---------65:54----------
sure so it's cool like we like have


---------65:56----------
contemplated like oh like what is your


---------65:58----------
psychology like man


---------66:01----------
and then it's like today is august 5th


---------66:03----------
and you're going to wake up tomorrow


---------66:05----------
morning and it's going to be august 6th


---------66:07----------
and like what the [ __ ] do you do with


---------66:10----------
all this


---------66:14----------
right so like let's talk about that for


---------66:16----------
a second because i don't know


---------66:18----------
i mean have i helped you today like sure


---------66:20----------
we've jerked each other off


---------66:21----------
intellectually


---------66:22----------
and philosophized but


---------66:26----------
you know it's like is this actually


---------66:28----------
gonna help you like


---------66:29----------
maybe down the road or something sure


---------66:31----------
but like let's think about


---------66:32----------
how to actually help you so here's the


---------66:36----------
first thing that i want you to


---------66:37----------
really recognize i want you to see that


---------66:40----------
you have a pattern within yourself


---------66:43----------
that you consider


---------66:46----------
failure so you have a fear of


---------66:49----------
disappointing people


---------66:50----------
and you have a fear of messing up


---------66:51----------
because ultimately you're responsible


---------66:54----------
and if you screw up you screw up and


---------66:57----------
that


---------66:57----------
the way that your mind tries to fix that


---------67:00----------
fear is by analysis


---------67:04----------
until you find a perfect solution


---------67:08----------
and that in turn paralyzes you


---------67:11----------
it keeps you from acting as we talked


---------67:13----------
about analysis


---------67:15----------
normally is designed to help you act and


---------67:18----------
what it does is the exact opposite


---------67:21----------
and if you don't act your life is going


---------67:23----------
to continue going down


---------67:27----------
yeah so bizarrely what you need to do is


---------67:30----------
make


---------67:31----------
to based on bad decisions


---------67:35----------
because your decision is not nearly it's


---------67:37----------
not going to be perfect and in your mind


---------67:39----------
any solution that is not perfect is


---------67:43----------
it's gonna i'm gonna fail yep


---------67:47----------
but that's not how things work really


---------67:49----------
right


---------67:50----------
like it's not like if you overcook your


---------67:52----------
chicken it's inedible


---------67:55----------
like there tend to be some things that


---------67:57----------
are gonna really mess up your life


---------67:59----------
and then there's like a perfect solution


---------68:01----------
but like most of the things that you're


---------68:02----------
gonna do are gonna kind of work out okay


---------68:07----------
like that i mean that's just been my


---------68:08----------
experience


---------68:10----------
but i i want you to more importantly


---------68:12----------
like even even despite challenging that


---------68:14----------
i think the more important thing is to


---------68:15----------
recognize that when you


---------68:17----------
act when you try to act that you're


---------68:21----------
gonna look for a perfect solution


---------68:23----------
and then that that search for the


---------68:24----------
perfect solution is going to impede your


---------68:27----------
actual action


---------68:31----------
which in turn is going to hold you back


---------68:33----------
in life


---------68:35----------
and that when you've actually grown and


---------68:37----------
become confident in something you did it


---------68:39----------
through trial and error


---------68:42----------
not painstaking research and perfect


---------68:44----------
solutions through trial and error


---------68:46----------
and honestly asriel that is exactly what


---------68:48----------
my experience was


---------68:53----------
i started my third year of college and i


---------68:55----------
was like this isn't working


---------68:57----------
and i haven't figured out how to fix it


---------68:59----------
but i gotta do something


---------69:03----------
and like i didn't turn like i didn't go


---------69:06----------
from


---------69:06----------
2.0 to 4.0 it was like 2.6


---------69:10----------
the next semester and then it was like


---------69:13----------
3.1


---------69:14----------
and then it was like 3.0 and then it was


---------69:17----------
like 3.4


---------69:19----------
and i sort of wound up with a 2.5


---------69:22----------
which is not that much better


---------69:26----------
you know than i mean it's it's good


---------69:28----------
enough


---------69:30----------
so i want you to just recognize that


---------69:32----------
your fear


---------69:33----------
like you're going to have this very


---------69:34----------
tangible fear that's going to keep you


---------69:36----------
from acting


---------69:37----------
and that your mind is going to analyze


---------69:39----------
to try to make the fear go away


---------69:42----------
but that actually what it does is like


---------69:45----------
paralyzes you further


---------69:47----------
so your solution is actually your


---------69:49----------
problem


---------69:53----------
so then so yep when i would just


---------69:57----------
would i just act on my first instance


---------70:01----------
that's going to be impossible for you


---------70:03----------
because the programming is pretty deep


---------70:06----------
yeah right so you can't just act on your


---------70:08----------
first


---------70:09----------
instinct what you need to do is like


---------70:11----------
notice this pattern within yourself


---------70:14----------
and then as best as you can try to set


---------70:16----------
it aside in the tiniest ways


---------70:19----------
so like i think for example you should


---------70:21----------
try to find a therapist


---------70:24----------
and what's happening is you're afraid of


---------70:26----------
talking to them on the phone


---------70:27----------
and so notice that fear and then run a


---------70:30----------
little experiment because you're a


---------70:31----------
physicist at heart


---------70:33----------
and what you need to do as real like so


---------70:36----------
all of your


---------70:37----------
current hypotheses are based on the data


---------70:41----------
of the past


---------70:42----------
and what i would really love it if you


---------70:44----------
could do is collect your own experiment


---------70:47----------
that does not involve your stepfather


---------70:50----------
i mean collect your own data run a


---------70:52----------
[ __ ] experiment without him


---------70:55----------
because i can almost guarantee you it's


---------70:57----------
going to give you different data


---------71:00----------
your sense of confidence in yourself


---------71:03----------
is based on like him interfering with


---------71:06----------
your [ __ ] experiment


---------71:09----------
so like no wonder you think that you're


---------71:11----------
incapable of doing everything and


---------71:12----------
everything is your fault because that's


---------71:15----------
like


---------71:16----------
that's what he taught you


---------71:20----------
and when it turns out like you know did


---------71:22----------
your stepfather think you were a good


---------71:24----------
cook


---------71:26----------
i didn't cook much fascinating


---------71:29----------
it's almost as if you like learned good


---------71:32----------
things and life skills when he wasn't


---------71:33----------
around


---------71:37----------
right so like notice that you have the


---------71:39----------
fear and like just run a couple


---------71:41----------
experiments right so like try picking up


---------71:42----------
the phone


---------71:43----------
and recognize that you have this beast


---------71:45----------
within you that's going to say


---------71:46----------
oh my god you're going to screw it up


---------71:48----------
you're going to screw it up you're going


---------71:49----------
to say the wrong thing


---------71:50----------
they're going to say who is this idiot


---------71:52----------
who's calling me he's not even worth my


---------71:53----------
time as a therapist like he's too dumb


---------71:56----------
you're gonna have all these like random


---------71:57----------
thoughts and it's like


---------71:59----------
like what did you think was gonna happen


---------72:01----------
today


---------72:03----------
i thought i was gonna mess up how are


---------72:07----------
you doing


---------72:10----------
fine i'm pretty good


---------72:16----------
well


---------72:19----------
i i do i have to admit that


---------72:22----------
i was trying to control the situation


---------72:24----------
before i got on


---------72:26----------
actually this morning and got a webcam


---------72:30----------
and a mic


---------72:31----------
just for this well i plan on using it


---------72:34----------
for other things too but good for you


---------72:39----------
i'm confused though like how like did


---------72:40----------
you find the perfect solution to this


---------72:45----------
did you figure it out


---------72:49----------
well it felt like a pretty good solution


---------72:52----------
um


---------72:53----------
yeah i'd agree


---------72:56----------
so can i tell you what i saw today


---------72:58----------
asriel


---------73:00----------
i saw a guy who showed up and gave it


---------73:02----------
his best shot


---------73:04----------
with no guarantees took a [ __ ] risk


---------73:09----------
yeah like the chance that like maybe dr


---------73:13----------
k


---------73:13----------
is gonna think i'm an idiot and everyone


---------73:15----------
on twitch that is gonna think i'm stupid


---------73:18----------
and i may disappoint not only your


---------73:21----------
family


---------73:22----------
but this thing called the internet


---------73:29----------
and you didn't cause here's the crazy


---------73:32----------
thing asriel i think you're actually a


---------73:34----------
pretty capable guy


---------73:37----------
i think you're smart you're compelling


---------73:41----------
you have a nice smile


---------73:45----------
i think you try really hard you're a


---------73:47----------
compassionate person you care about


---------73:49----------
other people sometimes to the detriment


---------73:50----------
of yourself


---------73:53----------
and if you can stop stop being angry


---------73:56----------
with yourself and cut yourself a break


---------73:58----------
i think you're gonna do great


---------74:02----------
i don't need you to be perfect i just


---------74:04----------
need you to be you


---------74:06----------
i don't need you to be on that track


---------74:08----------
that you should be and think about all


---------74:10----------
the preparation you could have done


---------74:12----------
instead of what you did


---------74:15----------
what you did was like the minimum


---------74:17----------
necessary which is you got a webcam and


---------74:19----------
a mic


---------74:20----------
and thank you for that because if you


---------74:21----------
hadn't done that this would have sucked


---------74:25----------
well i already had a a webcam and a mic


---------74:29----------
on my computer it was just bad quality


---------74:32----------
so like that's that's i think a perfect


---------74:34----------
example my dude


---------74:36----------
because like this is the amount of


---------74:37----------
control that you have in life


---------74:40----------
you could have made this experience


---------74:42----------
worse but instead


---------74:44----------
you put forth a little bit of effort and


---------74:45----------
you made it a little bit better


---------74:48----------
and that i think is all you need to do


---------74:52----------
it's going to be anxiety provoking


---------74:53----------
there's a chance you're going to


---------74:54----------
disappoint people


---------74:56----------
and that monster of fear is gonna be


---------74:58----------
there


---------75:01----------
and at the same time like it takes huge


---------75:03----------
balls to come on here


---------75:06----------
especially six months after you signed


---------75:07----------
up like there's a certain amount of like


---------75:10----------
idiotic adrenaline when you sign up and


---------75:12----------
if we're like yeah come on next week


---------75:14----------
we don't give your mind time to like


---------75:16----------
think through things


---------75:19----------
if i'm honest it's um i sort of signed


---------75:22----------
up multiple times


---------75:24----------
it sort of like took multiple shots in


---------75:26----------
the dark


---------75:27----------
okay um


---------75:32----------
but yeah each time i refined my response


---------75:34----------
to be a little better until


---------75:35----------
finally it worked and i'm like wow and


---------75:38----------
actually think i'd be on today


---------75:41----------
yeah interesting i wonder if that means


---------75:44----------
that everyone else is going to refine


---------75:46----------
their responses


---------75:47----------
but i i i wouldn't are you sure it's


---------75:50----------
anyway we don't need to get into that


---------75:52----------
but that also is like kind of cool right


---------75:54----------
like so that's kind of respectable


---------75:56----------
like if at first you don't like but i


---------75:58----------
thought you just got one shot at stuff


---------75:59----------
i'm confused


---------76:04----------
now i'm confused because what you're


---------76:05----------
describing is that the road to success


---------76:07----------
is trial and error


---------76:09----------
and not to do things perfectly out of


---------76:10----------
the gate


---------76:13----------
i think um i think that's what i'm


---------76:16----------
learning now is sort of


---------76:18----------
trial and error but that's not how i


---------76:20----------
used to think


---------76:22----------
um i do trial and error for some things


---------76:25----------
but for other things


---------76:26----------
the risk is too great yep


---------76:30----------
that's that's yeah how i think of it yep


---------76:33----------
and that's okay


---------76:34----------
right so i want you to notice like


---------76:35----------
you're going to have a conversation with


---------76:37----------
yourself


---------76:39----------
and asriel is going to ask terrifying


---------76:41----------
asriel


---------76:43----------
hey buddy can we try this


---------76:46----------
and then sometime terrified astral is


---------76:48----------
going to be like absolutely not


---------76:49----------
no way we are not going to ask that


---------76:52----------
person out on a date


---------76:53----------
cannot do it


---------76:58----------
and and there are going to be some


---------76:59----------
things like hey can we get go on the


---------77:01----------
internet and bear our deepest darkest


---------77:03----------
feelings to random people on twitch


---------77:05----------
and be judged by them because we have


---------77:07----------
social anxiety


---------77:08----------
and then terrified asriel is like go for


---------77:11----------
it


---------77:14----------
that's the funny thing is that i


---------77:16----------
actually i trust twitch


---------77:18----------
more than i trust real people


---------77:21----------
and that's i know people call that funny


---------77:24----------
but i'm with you


---------77:25----------
i'm with you bro because i think we have


---------77:29----------
this perception that twitch is like full


---------77:31----------
of


---------77:31----------
[ __ ] but like the crazy thing


---------77:34----------
is it's like the exact opposite


---------77:38----------
like all you have to do is give people


---------77:39----------
an opportunity to like be


---------77:41----------
decent human beings and they amaze me


---------77:45----------
can't let them take advantage of you


---------77:46----------
though because they'll still troll you


---------77:48----------
i'll get you


---------77:50----------
they catch you with your pants down but


---------77:52----------
yeah it's cool right it's amazing like


---------77:54----------
how much people on the internet


---------77:58----------
can help you and support you and how


---------78:01----------
loving and caring


---------78:02----------
of individuals they can be


---------78:05----------
it's wild it is


---------78:12----------
so last thing i'm gonna ask you asriel


---------78:14----------
is like


---------78:15----------
i want concretely like what are you


---------78:18----------
gonna


---------78:18----------
do like today is august 5th


---------78:22----------
and what are you going to do tomorrow


---------78:26----------
or today


---------78:30----------
um well i have a list of all the things


---------78:35----------
that i'm supposed to do


---------78:40----------
great i love making lists of things that


---------78:42----------
i'm supposed to do that i never end up


---------78:43----------
doing


---------78:44----------
it's one of my favorite pastimes


---------78:47----------
yep


---------78:50----------
i i guess i'm just gonna try things


---------78:55----------
um so i'd be more concrete i'd pick one


---------78:59----------
of those things on your list


---------79:00----------
one of those what's just pick one


---------79:05----------
all right um


---------79:11----------
i am


---------79:17----------
what if i i picked the most the least


---------79:20----------
important one fine


---------79:22----------
you can pick whatever you want what's


---------79:24----------
the very important one


---------79:30----------
actually it's pretty important but um


---------79:33----------
i sort of have a minecraft mod pack that


---------79:35----------
i'm working on


---------79:37----------
and um it's pretty much


---------79:40----------
ready it's just that i'm trying to


---------79:42----------
release like


---------79:44----------
get the description and everything so


---------79:46----------
people know what it's about


---------79:48----------
and the fear i have with that is like oh


---------79:52----------
no one's going to be interested


---------79:53----------
but i i can try it anyways


---------79:57----------
i guess see what happens so so


---------80:01----------
so this is what i want you to do i want


---------80:03----------
you to notice that fear


---------80:04----------
as if it's like a part of you


---------80:08----------
right so there's going to be like a


---------80:09----------
little corner of your mind or a big


---------80:11----------
corner of your mind that's filled with


---------80:12----------
that fear


---------80:14----------
and that fear is going to tell you no


---------80:16----------
you can't release that description


---------80:18----------
because the description isn't good


---------80:19----------
enough


---------80:22----------
you need to revise it more


---------80:25----------
don't half-ass it right don't just show


---------80:28----------
up today with your like inbuilt camera


---------80:31----------
but at the same time don't cancel and


---------80:34----------
not come on stream


---------80:36----------
find that middle road of okay like i'm


---------80:38----------
gonna make it give it a decent shot


---------80:41----------
i'm gonna spend an hour coming up with


---------80:42----------
the description i'm gonna sleep on it


---------80:45----------
so i want you to come up with the


---------80:46----------
description today sleep on it


---------80:49----------
give it a pass tomorrow and then


---------80:52----------
everyone into a chat is asking for the


---------80:53----------
link


---------80:56----------
oh boy right so


---------81:00----------
so when you say oh boy what happened


---------81:02----------
what happened when i told you that


---------81:04----------
what happened within you


---------81:07----------
it's like


---------81:11----------
it's not ready yet so but what is that


---------81:14----------
don't tell me don't tell me the content


---------81:16----------
notice what happens there's like


---------81:18----------
a serpent that is uncoiling and right


---------81:21----------
it's like a cobra that's like rearing up


---------81:22----------
and it's flaring its hood


---------81:24----------
you feel that yeah


---------81:28----------
like like what what are they gonna think


---------81:31----------
so so notice that thing don't get lost


---------81:33----------
in the thoughts themselves now we're


---------81:34----------
gonna meditate but sort of a weird


---------81:36----------
meditation


---------81:36----------
close your eyes okay one sec


---------81:42----------
yep


---------81:49----------
okay so you're gonna draft a description


---------81:53----------
today


---------81:53----------
can you do that


---------81:58----------
i can start how long is a description


---------82:04----------
well i'm trying to describe every little


---------82:06----------
thing


---------82:08----------
so it's pretty long description so don't


---------82:11----------
describe every little thing


---------82:16----------
so you can list as much as you want to


---------82:18----------
but the description should be like one


---------82:19----------
paragraph


---------82:21----------
i think i don't know how mind packed


---------82:24----------
mods


---------82:25----------
minecraft mod packs or whatever how long


---------82:27----------
their descriptions are


---------82:29----------
but like they're nice to be like i have


---------82:32----------
the description it's just i'm trying to


---------82:34----------
describe all the features involved and


---------82:36----------
all that


---------82:37----------
okay so are we talking about like a


---------82:38----------
notepad text file that has the full


---------82:40----------
description


---------82:41----------
are we talking about the blurb that


---------82:42----------
people like download


---------82:45----------
like that describes the mod before they


---------82:47----------
download it


---------82:50----------
the full description okay so the full so


---------82:52----------
this is like in a text file


---------82:54----------
and it can be like a hundred pages right


---------82:57----------
yeah okay okay okay fine okay so i want


---------83:00----------
you to just


---------83:01----------
think about that description for a


---------83:02----------
second you're gonna try to work on it


---------83:04----------
today


---------83:04----------
you're gonna sleep on what you did


---------83:06----------
you're gonna work on it tomorrow


---------83:08----------
how do you feel emotionally and what


---------83:10----------
what are you thinking in your head


---------83:16----------
um i think i can do that okay


---------83:20----------
i don't feel anything okay


---------83:23----------
great so this is what i'm gonna do i'm


---------83:25----------
gonna ask everyone else to sit up


---------83:27----------
straight


---------83:28----------
and i want you guys to pick something so


---------83:31----------
we're gonna give you guys about 30


---------83:32----------
seconds to


---------83:33----------
think of something that you want to do


---------83:37----------
that's like on your to-do list that is


---------83:39----------
hard for you to do or that you're


---------83:40----------
procrastinating about


---------83:42----------
or whatever it's ideally something that


---------83:46----------
you're afraid of doing


---------83:47----------
so this is going to be like a


---------83:48----------
fear-oriented meditation


---------83:51----------
okay now i'm going to say something


---------83:54----------
asriel to trigger you


---------83:59----------
okay and this is going to be hard


---------84:01----------
because then what i want you guys at


---------84:03----------
home to do


---------84:03----------
is think about the scenario


---------84:07----------
that you're trying to avoid


---------84:10----------
so in your case we're going to think


---------84:11----------
about like what's going to evoke


---------84:12----------
judgment


---------84:13----------
so asriel everyone on twitch wants the


---------84:17----------
link


---------84:20----------
and what happens watch it catch it


---------84:22----------
experiment


---------84:24----------
what happens within you um


---------84:30----------
felt something in my chest yep


---------84:39----------
that that's all i felt okay and what's


---------84:42----------
happening in your mind


---------84:51----------
i i don't know


---------84:56----------
it's sort of


---------85:01----------
sort of blank okay so hold on a second


---------85:06----------
i thought that when we talked about


---------85:07----------
sharing the link you would be paralyzed


---------85:09----------
with fear


---------85:14----------
because that's what started to happen


---------85:16----------
when i first said it right


---------85:18----------
the first time i thought you're a legit


---------85:20----------
i'm still legit


---------85:22----------
oh they want the link


---------85:27----------
like on friday like people are gonna ask


---------85:29----------
me about it and if you've got your [ __ ]


---------85:31----------
together


---------85:31----------
see we're gonna make it real for you now


---------85:33----------
you can't gotta play with live ammo


---------85:36----------
they're gonna ask me on friday when i


---------85:37----------
stream next they're like where's the


---------85:39----------
link


---------85:39----------
and i'm gonna be like okay here it is


---------85:44----------
now what do you see what's happening


---------85:46----------
with you asriel


---------85:49----------
i gotta do it now okay


---------85:55----------
they're they're depending on me how does


---------85:57----------
that feel


---------86:06----------
um


---------86:08----------
tightness in the chest a little fidgety


---------86:11----------
okay um


---------86:17----------
heart rate's increased okay so you're


---------86:20----------
noticing all these physical sensations


---------86:22----------
good


---------86:22----------
are you afraid


---------86:33----------
a little bit but it's sort of like


---------86:36----------
well now i know what i have to do


---------86:41----------
is having to do it does that feel like


---------86:45----------
good or bad


---------86:56----------
i i think that feels good [ __ ] weird


---------87:00----------
right so now i want to point out


---------87:04----------
something very subtle in your language


---------87:06----------
this entire conversation we've been


---------87:09----------
talking about the outcome


---------87:11----------
we've been talking about people are


---------87:12----------
going to be disappointed this is going


---------87:14----------
to happen


---------87:14----------
we've been talking about the effects the


---------87:16----------
results


---------87:18----------
they're going to be disappointed to have


---------87:19----------
me work with them anyway i'm destined to


---------87:21----------
fail i'm going to fail out of college


---------87:22----------
i'm going to be in debt


---------87:24----------
those are all outcomes they're not


---------87:25----------
actions


---------87:28----------
the way to move forward in life it's


---------87:30----------
what i have to do


---------87:31----------
it's not about what happens it's about


---------87:34----------
what i have to do it's about what you


---------87:36----------
have to do


---------87:36----------
not about what has to happen because you


---------87:39----------
can't [ __ ] control that


---------87:41----------
and now we come to the crux of it which


---------87:43----------
is as a human being in life you are


---------87:45----------
entitled to your actions


---------87:46----------
you're not entitled to results


---------87:50----------
you have to work on your mind craft pack


---------87:53----------
or whatever


---------87:54----------
and write your description and upload it


---------87:56----------
because that's what you have to do


---------87:58----------
you can't control whether people are


---------88:00----------
gonna like it or gonna hate it


---------88:03----------
you could be traumatized because of how


---------88:05----------
bad it is


---------88:06----------
in their response so be it


---------88:10----------
trial and [ __ ] error my friend


---------88:15----------
all right


---------88:20----------
how you feeling


---------88:27----------
um


---------88:32----------
determined good


---------88:36----------
right it's like kerbal space program


---------88:37----------
like sometimes stuff crashes but you


---------88:42----------
gotta do it


---------88:44----------
and so people say like oh just do it i'm


---------88:46----------
not saying just do it


---------88:47----------
what i'm saying is like look at doing it


---------88:53----------
recognize the horrible fear that lives


---------88:56----------
within you


---------88:57----------
the sense that you're a piece of [ __ ]


---------88:59----------
and that you're inevitably going to


---------89:00----------
disappoint


---------89:01----------
and give them the finger and then do it


---------89:04----------
anyway


---------89:06----------
don't just do it recognize all of these


---------89:08----------
things that hold you back


---------89:10----------
recognize how terrible of a person


---------89:12----------
you've been taught that you


---------89:13----------
are and then say you know what i'm not


---------89:16----------
going to give into that


---------89:19----------
i'm going to try anyway don't just do it


---------89:22----------
do it in spite of all of the reasons to


---------89:25----------
not do it


---------89:26----------
you're telling me that there's one road


---------89:27----------
to success and there are a thousand


---------89:29----------
roads to failure


---------89:30----------
and what i'm telling you is that you can


---------89:32----------
have a thousand reasons to not do


---------89:34----------
something


---------89:34----------
and all you need is one to just [ __ ]


---------89:36----------
do it


---------89:41----------
that which you think holds you back in


---------89:43----------
life is actually like completely


---------89:45----------
irrelevant


---------89:45----------
they can try to hold you back as much as


---------89:47----------
they want to for a thousand different


---------89:48----------
reasons as real


---------89:49----------
and all you need is one good reason to


---------89:51----------
upload and you're gonna [ __ ] upload


---------89:52----------
it and they can go [ __ ] themselves if


---------89:54----------
they don't like it


---------90:05----------
all right how do you feel


---------90:10----------
um


---------90:15----------
all right i feel all right okay all


---------90:18----------
right


---------90:18----------
okay good i'll take it you can open your


---------90:21----------
eyes


---------90:28----------
all right man so that's what i got


---------90:32----------
any questions


---------90:39----------
so


---------90:43----------
it's not about just doing it


---------90:46----------
it's a it's about


---------90:51----------
i'm gonna do it


---------90:56----------
so don't just do it do it in spite of


---------90:59----------
everything


---------91:01----------
in spite of the thousand reasons


---------91:04----------
that that are holding me back


---------91:09----------
because just do it absolutely just do it


---------91:11----------
implies


---------91:12----------
ignore all of these parts of yourself


---------91:15----------
just just do it man just


---------91:16----------
ignore all that crap just ignore it and


---------91:18----------
just do it i'm saying


---------91:19----------
that doesn't work you can't ignore it


---------91:22----------
what you need to do is embrace it


---------91:26----------
you know it's like when you're playing


---------91:28----------
dark souls you can't just pretend to


---------91:29----------
have chain mail and then just


---------91:31----------
just just pretend that you've got


---------91:33----------
chainmail and go and like


---------91:34----------
just pretend ignore


---------91:37----------
live the life pretend you're in the life


---------91:39----------
of your fantasy


---------91:40----------
and act that way it doesn't work


---------91:44----------
start from where you are don't just do


---------91:46----------
it you can't just


---------91:47----------
do it you have to do it anyway but


---------91:50----------
you've got to do it in spite of all the


---------91:52----------
baggage that you've got


---------91:54----------
right you got to play the hand that


---------91:55----------
you're dealt not the hand that you want


---------91:58----------
and that involves acknowledging and


---------92:01----------
accepting that you have this fear


---------92:03----------
that you've been taught that you're


---------92:05----------
destined for failure


---------92:06----------
it doesn't mean that it's actually true


---------92:08----------
it's just what you were taught


---------92:10----------
it's like people who are taught that the


---------92:11----------
earth is flat


---------92:13----------
it's just what you were taught doesn't


---------92:14----------
make it real


---------92:17----------
right and now the flat earthers on


---------92:20----------
twitch are going to tell me


---------92:21----------
but so be it


---------92:25----------
but like that's cool man it's it's okay


---------92:27----------
that you think you're a failure it's


---------92:28----------
okay that


---------92:29----------
you're inevitable to fail and then also


---------92:32----------
like


---------92:32----------
collect your own data as real because


---------92:34----------
this is not the life


---------92:36----------
you are not the person that your


---------92:37----------
stepfather thinks you are you're the


---------92:39----------
person


---------92:40----------
actually that you are you don't even


---------92:41----------
know who you are


---------92:43----------
so try to collect some data


---------92:47----------
and do it in spite of everything


---------92:50----------
then you'll succeed at least it's


---------92:54----------
worked for me your mileage may vary


---------92:59----------
all right all right man


---------93:02----------
any last questions or thoughts that was


---------93:04----------
a great summary by the way


---------93:08----------
um i i think i'm good


---------93:11----------
okay i'll i'll try and see what i can do


---------93:15----------
that's all we ask and what i will tell


---------93:19----------
you is that


---------93:20----------
if you do have a link that we can share


---------93:22----------
on friday that would be awesome


---------93:26----------
today is wednesday so that gives me two


---------93:29----------
days


---------93:29----------
yep and at the same time


---------93:33----------
twitch chat how are we gonna feel about


---------93:35----------
him if we don't have a link


---------93:36----------
on friday


---------93:40----------
what's our sentiment


---------93:52----------
okay okay


---------93:55----------
so i don't know if you can predict do


---------93:57----------
you can you imagine what


---------93:58----------
twitch had to say


---------94:03----------
i want to say disappointed no they're


---------94:06----------
not going to be disappointed


---------94:08----------
apparently they're going to burn the


---------94:09----------
world down


---------94:11----------
or they love you it's a little bit


---------94:14----------
unclear


---------94:17----------
so they're gonna riot they're not gonna


---------94:19----------
be disappointed


---------94:20----------
they're gonna riot or they'll they'll


---------94:23----------
forgive you


---------94:24----------
which so you know that's like right like


---------94:28----------
trial and error sometimes means that you


---------94:30----------
get error it's not trial and success


---------94:32----------
it's trial and error so it can be both


---------94:36----------
so you know do the best that you can i


---------94:38----------
suspect twitch chat will forgive you


---------94:40----------
but also that they really do want to see


---------94:42----------
they want because here's the thing like


---------94:43----------
here's the thing


---------94:44----------
if you can do it they can do it


---------94:48----------
so there is a big burden on your


---------94:49----------
shoulders which is that now you come


---------94:51----------
on on the stream and they're counting on


---------94:53----------
you


---------94:55----------
and so i do i know it's crazy but i i i


---------94:57----------
think that you can disappoint them


---------95:00----------
which is a real possibility on the other


---------95:02----------
hand what you can also do since you're a


---------95:04----------
compassionate person is like


---------95:05----------
you can set your own feelings aside


---------95:08----------
about judgment


---------95:09----------
and recognize that if you can share with


---------95:10----------
us a link on friday sure there's a lot


---------95:12----------
of pressure and i recognize i'm putting


---------95:14----------
it on you


---------95:15----------
but like that's what people see right


---------95:18----------
like they want to see progress


---------95:20----------
and you can give them hope which is a


---------95:21----------
big burden to place on your shoulders


---------95:25----------
but i'm telling you um asriel i can't do


---------95:28----------
this alone


---------95:31----------
we need we need your mind crackling


---------95:35----------
all right all right so it seems like


---------95:39----------
they love you it's apparently one person


---------95:41----------
wants to smell you


---------95:44----------
i don't think they do it's a little hot


---------95:47----------
here


---------95:48----------
be careful i mean don't assume that you


---------95:50----------
know what twitch chat wants


---------95:52----------
oh oh right because they'll be like


---------95:55----------
challenge accepted


---------95:57----------
that they want my urine or bathwater or


---------96:00----------
whatever


---------96:00----------
right that's oh boy


---------96:04----------
all right man this is turning south real


---------96:06----------
quick so i'm gonna say goodbye


---------96:08----------
and good luck and um i look forward to


---------96:11----------
hearing from you man and and no sweat if


---------96:13----------
you can't


---------96:14----------
all right all right take care man all


---------96:17----------
right you too


---------96:18----------
bye bye okay


---------96:22----------
chat


---------96:27----------
yeah so that's you know that's life


---------96:28----------
you're you're trying to


---------96:30----------
graduate from college and then suddenly


---------96:33----------
you know your sense and odors become


---------96:35----------
the rage of the internet


---------96:39----------
and and really i want you guys to like


---------96:41----------
think long and hard if you guys struggle


---------96:43----------
with this kind of over analysis fear of


---------96:45----------
failure thing


---------96:46----------
because this is a very poorly understood


---------96:49----------
um little mechanism which is that


---------96:53----------
the reason we overthink is to alleviate


---------96:56----------
fear from ourselves but the funny thing


---------96:59----------
is that the more we think the smarter we


---------97:01----------
are


---------97:02----------
the more possibilities our mind


---------97:06----------
generates


---------97:07----------
about how things can go wrong and it's a


---------97:09----------
vicious cycle because if i generate 10


---------97:11----------
possibilities


---------97:12----------
then i need to think through each of


---------97:14----------
those to remove that fear


---------97:16----------
and each time i think about removing the


---------97:18----------
fear i generate more possibilities


---------97:21----------
and this is why we get stuck


---------97:27----------
how do i overcome the fear of failure


---------97:30----------
first you understand where the fear of


---------97:32----------
failure comes from


---------97:34----------
and then you recognize that your


---------97:36----------
solutions to the fear of failure


---------97:38----------
are actually propagating their feel of


---------97:40----------
failure and no wonder y'all can't


---------97:42----------
overcome it


---------97:44----------
it's like how many holes do i need to


---------97:46----------
poke


---------97:47----------
in my tire to fill it up with air


---------97:50----------
because the more holes that i put in my


---------97:52----------
tire the more places air can go in


---------97:57----------
how many holes do i need to poke and


---------97:59----------
it's like no man you don't poke holes


---------98:03----------
it's bizarre but the solutions that our


---------98:05----------
mind sometimes comes up with


---------98:07----------
are actually the very problem that keeps


---------98:09----------
us paralyzed


---------98:11----------
and so the way that you overcome your


---------98:13----------
fear of failures first of all in


---------98:15----------
recognizing that over analysis can make


---------98:17----------
it worse


---------98:18----------
recognizing that the fear of failure is


---------98:21----------
built upon


---------98:22----------
certain impressions that you have of


---------98:24----------
yourself


---------98:26----------
and that those impressions may have been


---------98:28----------
true of the past but they're not


---------98:29----------
necessarily representative of the future


---------98:32----------
and the third thing is that you don't


---------98:34----------
really overcome your fear of failure


---------98:36----------
that too is fantasy


---------98:37----------
it's sort of like i overcome my fear of


---------98:39----------
failure and then i can go live my life


---------98:43----------
right it's like shifting to the the


---------98:45----------
track of easy success


---------98:48----------
once i overcome my fear of failure then


---------98:50----------
i can start living my life


---------98:52----------
that in of itself is the wrong attitude


---------98:54----------
you never overcome your feeling


---------98:56----------
you just live your life in spite of it


---------98:59----------
so that which you're afraid of


---------99:02----------
think about doing it try to do it and as


---------99:04----------
you try to do it


---------99:05----------
close your eyes and pay attention to


---------99:07----------
yourself and you're going to feel that


---------99:08----------
that serpent coil up


---------99:09----------
the fear is going to uncoil because it's


---------99:12----------
been living deep down in your belly


---------99:14----------
and it's going to rise up and it's going


---------99:15----------
to take over the rest of your body


---------99:19----------
and when it does that be like just sit


---------99:22----------
with it for a second say okay can i do


---------99:23----------
it anyway


---------99:25----------
you don't overcome your feeling fear of


---------99:27----------
failure you act in spite of it


---------99:31----------
and when you start acting in spite of


---------99:34----------
things


---------99:34----------
instead of trying to fix them before you


---------99:37----------
act then you'll stop being stuck


---------99:40----------
because you guys want to fix everything


---------99:43----------
before you do anything


---------99:45----------
i better start working out so i don't


---------99:47----------
embarrass myself at the gym


---------99:51----------
it's like backwards but it makes sense


---------99:58----------
so don't try to fix things just do


---------100:01----------
things


---------100:03----------
just do things don't just do things


---------100:06----------
recognize that


---------100:07----------
try to do something and notice what


---------100:09----------
comes up and give yourself some time and


---------100:11----------
some space


---------100:12----------
that some of these battles you're going


---------100:13----------
to win and some of them you're going to


---------100:14----------
lose sometimes the fear is going to win


---------100:18----------
and sometimes you're going to act in


---------100:20----------
spite of the fear and the cool thing


---------100:22----------
that happens


---------100:23----------
is like as you act in spite of the fear


---------100:26----------
what actually happens is when you can


---------100:28----------
act in spite of the fear


---------100:30----------
then next time around the fear isn't as


---------100:33----------
powerful


---------100:34----------
because it's like oh that fear was


---------100:36----------
predicting all these problems and that


---------100:38----------
actually didn't work


---------100:39----------
and so this tiny voice is going to start


---------100:41----------
to grow with inside


---------100:43----------
inside you it's like oh maybe i don't


---------100:45----------
need to worry about the fear


---------100:48----------
and then you struggle again and the fear


---------100:50----------
rises up


---------100:51----------
sometimes you win sometimes you lose you


---------100:54----------
act again and it's like oh


---------100:56----------
maybe i didn't need to worry about it


---------100:58----------
it's not so bad


---------101:01----------
and the more that you do that that's


---------101:03----------
called confidence


---------101:06----------
and confidence isn't about in this last


---------101:08----------
thing i'll kind of like explain


---------101:10----------
so analysis to


---------101:15----------
bypass fear or negate fear does not lead


---------101:18----------
to


---------101:18----------
confidence in fact all it does is like


---------101:21----------
give in to the fear


---------101:22----------
because you're accepting the fear it's


---------101:23----------
not courage it's removing fear from the


---------101:26----------
equation


---------101:27----------
that's not overcoming your fear that's


---------101:29----------
just removing it from the equation


---------101:33----------
confidence is about acting in the face


---------101:36----------
of uncertainty


---------101:37----------
because you believe that you can manage


---------101:39----------
what comes


---------101:41----------
right if you're like confident in a


---------101:42----------
video game and like let's say it's a


---------101:43----------
multiplayer game


---------101:45----------
you're like confident that like there


---------101:46----------
could be a good person on the other team


---------101:48----------
but like i'm gonna be able to handle it


---------101:50----------
and i'm gonna do the best that i can


---------101:51----------
some games i'll win some games i'll lose


---------101:56----------
and so if you want to build confidence


---------101:57----------
and overcome fear


---------101:59----------
don't try to solve so that the fear is


---------102:01----------
no longer an issue that's not how you do


---------102:03----------
it it's in fact it's the exact opposite


---------102:05----------
the way you do it is by like actually


---------102:09----------
acting in spite of the fear and then you


---------102:11----------
realize oh like the fear doesn't


---------102:12----------
actually have a hold on me


---------102:16----------
you guys don't need to overcome the fear


---------102:18----------
you need to be like


---------102:19----------
buff your fear resistance and the fear


---------102:22----------
can be whatever it wants to but if


---------102:23----------
you've got like


---------102:24----------
90 fear resistance then like it's not


---------102:26----------
going to control you anymore


---------102:33----------
so hopefully that makes sense it's not


---------102:36----------
ignorance


---------102:38----------
it's actually pure awareness it's the


---------102:40----------
opposite of ignorance


---------102:41----------
it's acknowledging and understanding


---------102:43----------
that sometimes the fear will control you


---------102:45----------
and sometimes it won't and that the more


---------102:48----------
that you practice and the more you try


---------102:50----------
the less it'll start to control you and


---------102:52----------
then you'll start to believe in yourself


---------102:54----------
and then the fear can be as big as it is


---------102:57----------
but your confidence is going to be big


---------102:59----------
too and you'll be able to handle it


---------103:05----------
yeah you have to level up your fear


---------103:06----------
resistance absolutely okay twitch who


---------103:08----------
are you rating
