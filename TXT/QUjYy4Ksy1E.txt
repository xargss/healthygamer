---------00:00----------
so oh boy i sure do love being perceived


---------00:02----------
as a gifted child i hope i don't end up


---------00:04----------
as being a perfectionist perfectionist


---------00:06----------
burnout with


---------00:08----------
burnt out i suppose with depression


---------00:10----------
anxiety unfulfilled expectations and no


---------00:12----------
real interests or goals


---------00:14----------
so this is something that someone


---------00:16----------
cross-posted to our subreddit you know


---------00:17----------
it's a meme we've had a couple of


---------00:19----------
streams about burnout and gifted kids


---------00:24----------
so today what i'd like to talk to you


---------00:25----------
all a little bit about is


---------00:28----------
the pathway from gifted child to burnt


---------00:32----------
out perfectionist


---------00:34----------
as well as sort of the way that society


---------00:37----------
actually sets gifted children up to kind


---------00:39----------
of fail


---------00:41----------
so i know it's kind of interesting but


---------00:42----------
when we think about a gifted child


---------00:45----------
we think about we perceive


---------00:47----------
gifted as an advantage


---------00:49----------
but in my experience working with a lot


---------00:51----------
of gifted children it's not always an


---------00:53----------
advantage and in fact oftentimes it can


---------00:55----------
be a burden


---------00:56----------
and so i've seen this a lot in our


---------00:58----------
community i've worked with a lot of


---------00:59----------
people who kind of fall into that this


---------01:01----------
category i suppose i sort of fall into


---------01:02----------
it as well


---------01:04----------
where i grew up kind of get i'm gifted


---------01:06----------
right so like school was easy for me i


---------01:08----------
was told from a very young age that i


---------01:09----------
was smart


---------01:11----------
i was also kind of held accountable for


---------01:14----------
like not studying right there like i'd


---------01:16----------
kind of like not study very much and


---------01:18----------
maybe get a b plus or an a minus


---------01:21----------
and my teachers would tell my parents


---------01:23----------
the same thing every single


---------01:25----------
parent-teacher conference they'd always


---------01:26----------
say well if all look just applied


---------01:28----------
himself he would be the best student in


---------01:30----------
the class


---------01:31----------
if he only just like


---------01:33----------
studied more he'd be the best student in


---------01:34----------
the class right they were like he's


---------01:35----------
super smart he has a lot of potential


---------01:38----------
right so they use these words like they


---------01:40----------
talk about how smart i am they talk


---------01:41----------
about all the potential i have and if i


---------01:43----------
just applied myself i'd be you know i'd


---------01:45----------
be such a


---------01:46----------
i'd be the best student


---------01:49----------
so it's kind of interesting because we


---------01:50----------
perceive giftedness as an advantage


---------01:53----------
but as one of my teachers once told me


---------01:55----------
we'll kind of get to this towards the


---------01:56----------
end


---------01:57----------
they once explained to me that um this


---------01:59----------
is in in not in medical school but when


---------02:01----------
i was training to become a psychiatrist


---------02:02----------
i had a supervisor who once told me that


---------02:04----------
gifted gifted children or special needs


---------02:06----------
children and what that literally means


---------02:08----------
is that like the needs of a child who's


---------02:11----------
gifted are actually different from the


---------02:13----------
average child and the parents who


---------02:15----------
recognize that and recognize that this


---------02:17----------
child is going to need like a slightly


---------02:19----------
different structure a different


---------02:20----------
curriculum or a different way of being


---------02:22----------
raised are the ones that end up sort of


---------02:24----------
doing a really good job and oddly enough


---------02:26----------
in her clinical experience she found


---------02:29----------
that much like any other special needs


---------02:31----------
children um


---------02:32----------
you know kids that were not


---------02:36----------
treated appropriately despite their


---------02:38----------
gifts were the ones that kind of


---------02:40----------
struggled so this statement when i first


---------02:42----------
heard it i thought was like absolutely


---------02:43----------
ridiculous kind of blew my mind a little


---------02:45----------
bit but i respected the supervisor a lot


---------02:47----------
and i started thinking about it


---------02:49----------
so what i'd like to share with you all


---------02:50----------
today is sort of the pathway that a


---------02:53----------
gifted child takes


---------02:55----------
how a society treats them how parents


---------02:57----------
treat them the kind of struggles they


---------02:59----------
face or the influences that they have


---------03:00----------
let's not even call it a struggle


---------03:01----------
because it may not be a struggle and


---------03:03----------
then sort of how they end up so i'd like


---------03:05----------
to kind of share with that with you all


---------03:06----------
today okay


---------03:08----------
so the first thing that tends to happen


---------03:10----------
is when a child is gifted they


---------03:13----------
te school tends to be easy right so if


---------03:15----------
you kind of think about it


---------03:16----------
developmentally


---------03:17----------
there are a lot of different things that


---------03:18----------
happen in school so let's talk about


---------03:20----------
school so school is a place where you


---------03:22----------
get you socialize right so you get


---------03:24----------
socialization skills it's a place that


---------03:26----------
you learn and people think that school


---------03:28----------
is primarily about learning and it is


---------03:30----------
primarily about learning but it's just


---------03:31----------
not about


---------03:32----------
learning that the subject material so


---------03:34----------
sure we learn like arithmetic and


---------03:36----------
mathematics and all that kind of stuff


---------03:38----------
we learn history and science and all


---------03:39----------
that good stuff


---------03:41----------
but really school if you kind of look at


---------03:42----------
it developmentally is a wonderful


---------03:44----------
opportunity to learn certain key things


---------03:47----------
socialization is a really important


---------03:49----------
piece the other thing is like habits and


---------03:52----------
how to study and this is the first sort


---------03:54----------
of disadvantage that i think gifted


---------03:55----------
children sort of face


---------03:57----------
is that you know if you're young and


---------03:58----------
you're gifted school is so easy that you


---------04:01----------
sort of get by without the luxury of


---------04:03----------
studying and so we kind of perceive this


---------04:06----------
as an advantage right like if you have


---------04:07----------
to if you go through school and you


---------04:09----------
don't study like that's easy like it's


---------04:11----------
easy easy clap right


---------04:13----------
and so it is and that sort of makes


---------04:15----------
sense


---------04:16----------
but the the interesting thing that i


---------04:18----------
found is that oftentimes being


---------04:20----------
intelligent especially when you're super


---------04:22----------
young as a kid actually sets you up for


---------04:24----------
failure down the road because you never


---------04:27----------
need to learn


---------04:28----------
the habituated study like


---------04:31----------
technique that you kind of need to that


---------04:33----------
that you need to succeed later on so for


---------04:35----------
a normal kid what tends to happen is


---------04:37----------
like they don't have to study like in


---------04:38----------
first grade but maybe like second grade


---------04:39----------
third grade they have to learn how to


---------04:41----------
study like once a week maybe they like


---------04:43----------
learn how to study the night before the


---------04:45----------
test because it doesn't come easily to


---------04:46----------
them


---------04:47----------
and then fourth grade fifth grade now


---------04:49----------
you're you're doing homework a couple


---------04:50----------
days a week you know you're studying two


---------04:52----------
or three days before the test then you


---------04:54----------
kind of hit middle school where maybe


---------04:55----------
you're studying like four days before


---------04:57----------
the test and so there's this very


---------04:58----------
graduated sense of increasing


---------05:01----------
responsibility as you go further and


---------05:03----------
further in school


---------05:04----------
and it's sort of designed that way right


---------05:06----------
we're not like no teacher has a six six


---------05:09----------
year old that they're like giving 14


---------05:11----------
hours of homework a week to it's just


---------05:13----------
absurd and then at the top end of the


---------05:15----------
spectrum in terms of study habits and


---------05:17----------
what we demand of students you have


---------05:18----------
something like let's say law school or


---------05:20----------
medical school or things like that where


---------05:21----------
people are regular studying like 60


---------05:24----------
hours a week 80 hours a week in medical


---------05:25----------
school because you know people have have


---------05:28----------
grown up and have built enough of a


---------05:30----------
study habit where they can actually


---------05:32----------
handle that pace of study


---------05:34----------
so what happens with the gifted kid so


---------05:36----------
the gifted kid you know when you sort of


---------05:38----------
level up your skill to level one like in


---------05:41----------
the first grade and then you level up


---------05:42----------
your studying skill to level two in the


---------05:44----------
second grade and level three in the


---------05:45----------
third grade so the gifted kid never


---------05:47----------
actually has to like grind that xp for


---------05:50----------
levels like one through five of studying


---------05:52----------
habits


---------05:53----------
and so they sort of managed to get b's


---------05:55----------
or a's without really minimal with


---------05:57----------
minimal studying or no studying at all


---------05:59----------
and then seventh grade rolls around


---------06:01----------
eighth grade rolls around they start to


---------06:02----------
struggle a little bit maybe they get b's


---------06:04----------
they're still not learning how to study


---------06:05----------
because they sort of skipped that part


---------06:07----------
of of the you know the skill building


---------06:10----------
and we'll kind of get to that later and


---------06:12----------
then what tends to happen with gifted


---------06:13----------
kids is that they don't need to study


---------06:15----------
don't need to study don't need to study


---------06:16----------
and then they hit a wall


---------06:18----------
they finally get into some kind of


---------06:20----------
situation where their raw intellect


---------06:22----------
cannot


---------06:24----------
is no longer sufficient to handle the


---------06:26----------
schoolwork that they're supposed to


---------06:28----------
handle


---------06:28----------
but they've trained themselves at that


---------06:30----------
point they've customized themselves at


---------06:32----------
that point to managing school with raw


---------06:35----------
intellect


---------06:36----------
and so when that kind of falls short


---------06:38----------
they like they really kind of really hit


---------06:40----------
a wall it's a very very hard cliff to to


---------06:44----------
overcome


---------06:45----------
and so this is kind of the first thing


---------06:46----------
that that sort of shoots gifted kids in


---------06:48----------
the foot and this also leads to kind of


---------06:50----------
this idea of perfectionism and burnout


---------06:52----------
because then they like you know then


---------06:53----------
they they struggle a lot they don't


---------06:55----------
understand why they can't do it they


---------06:56----------
they try they know they're smart


---------06:58----------
everyone's talking to them about


---------06:59----------
potential they start to feel really bad


---------07:01----------
about themselves so the first kind of


---------07:03----------
interesting thing that gifted kids run


---------07:04----------
into is the fact that they sort of don't


---------07:07----------
develop the proper study habits because


---------07:09----------
you know as a six-year-old it's kind of


---------07:10----------
not your fault because like you're not


---------07:12----------
mature enough as a six-year-old to


---------07:14----------
realize like oh i need you know to have


---------07:16----------
good study habits so even though the


---------07:18----------
teacher said this last tuesday and i


---------07:20----------
understand that i don't need to study


---------07:21----------
i'm going to sit down and like practice


---------07:22----------
my study habits it doesn't make any


---------07:24----------
sense it's like completely artificial


---------07:26----------
so that's the first thing that happens


---------07:28----------
is that they kind of hit this wall of of


---------07:30----------
you know not being able to study


---------07:32----------
the second thing to consider is the


---------07:34----------
expectation so another thing that really


---------07:36----------
leads gifted kids kind of down the wrong


---------07:38----------
path is


---------07:40----------
the burden of expectation that's placed


---------07:42----------
upon them so from a very young age


---------07:44----------
they're told oh you're gifted you're


---------07:45----------
smart you're special you have so much


---------07:47----------
potential and so what that starts to do


---------07:49----------
is it constructs like a very very lofty


---------07:52----------
goal in their minds right so i'm going


---------07:54----------
to use kind of an analogy which is kind


---------07:56----------
of like you know if i think about an


---------07:59----------
amazing home like i think about a


---------08:01----------
mansion it can have a beautiful


---------08:03----------
blueprint and i can buy a gigantic piece


---------08:05----------
of land and i can look at that and i can


---------08:07----------
say like oh like this this home or this


---------08:09----------
this blueprint has so much potential


---------08:12----------
and sometimes we kind of forget that


---------08:14----------
like


---------08:15----------
you can have like you can have a


---------08:16----------
blueprint for a mansion but that's gonna


---------08:18----------
actually take way more work to achieve


---------08:21----------
than like building a shack so the other


---------08:24----------
really interesting thing that that we


---------08:26----------
sort of kind of get wrong societally is


---------08:28----------
that we assume that when someone is


---------08:30----------
gifted


---------08:31----------
things are actually going to be easier


---------08:33----------
for them that they need to work less to


---------08:35----------
accomplish the same amount


---------08:37----------
but in my experience living up to a


---------08:39----------
gifted child's potential involves more


---------08:42----------
work it's sort of like you know it's


---------08:44----------
just like building a shack versus


---------08:46----------
building a mansion like sure the mansion


---------08:48----------
is capable of so much more than the shaq


---------08:50----------
is capable of but let's not forget for a


---------08:53----------
moment that the amount of effort that it


---------08:55----------
goes into building a mansion is actually


---------08:57----------
way more than what's required to build a


---------08:59----------
shack this is the second place that


---------09:01----------
gifted kids kind of get tripped up


---------09:02----------
because everyone around


---------09:04----------
is looking at them and they're sort of


---------09:05----------
saying


---------09:06----------
oh like this is an amazing mansion like


---------09:08----------
you could build such an amazing mansion


---------09:10----------
and we all kind of forget for a moment


---------09:12----------
that like actually living up to that


---------09:14----------
potential is very very difficult and


---------09:16----------
requires a lot more of an investment


---------09:18----------
than building a shack


---------09:20----------
and so this gap between what people


---------09:23----------
expect of you and also the idea that


---------09:25----------
things should be easier for you


---------09:27----------
kind of compound on themselves and sort


---------09:30----------
of end up with gifted kids kind of


---------09:32----------
feeling like they're they're failing at


---------09:33----------
everything right because they have all


---------09:34----------
this potential


---------09:36----------
and they're not they're just not living


---------09:38----------
up to it


---------09:39----------
so the other thing that we'll see in


---------09:40----------
gifted kids is that what what tends to


---------09:42----------
happen is that they will put in some


---------09:44----------
amount of work


---------09:46----------
but they're expecting a mansion when


---------09:49----------
all they've really put in is as much as


---------09:51----------
building a shack


---------09:52----------
i may have lost you a little bit there


---------09:54----------
but let me just explain


---------09:56----------
so


---------09:56----------
you know what a gifted kid will do is


---------09:58----------
they'll like look at their peers right


---------09:59----------
and they'll say like oh like this person


---------10:01----------
did this and they're able to accomplish


---------10:02----------
this so like i should be able to do that


---------10:04----------
too and so if you look at your neighbors


---------10:06----------
who are building a shack and they're


---------10:07----------
like whoa they went to home depot and


---------10:09----------
they got like 100 pounds of wood and


---------10:11----------
they built their shack over a weekend


---------10:13----------
and then like you go and get your 100


---------10:15----------
pounds of wood from home depot and you


---------10:16----------
start like brought to you by home depot


---------10:19----------
i suppose um and you start building your


---------10:21----------
mansion like i know it sounds kind of


---------10:23----------
weird but you know 100 pounds of wood


---------10:25----------
may be enough to build a shack but it's


---------10:26----------
nowhere near enough to build a mansion


---------10:28----------
and then what gifted kids will do is


---------10:30----------
they'll look at like the foundation that


---------10:31----------
they've laid with a hundred pounds of


---------10:32----------
wood and they'll be like where's the i


---------10:34----------
don't even have a shack like you know


---------10:36----------
it's it's like they look at what they've


---------10:38----------
accomplished when they put in the same


---------10:39----------
amount of energy as someone else and


---------10:41----------
they get really confused because this


---------10:42----------
person has a complete shack over here


---------10:44----------
and like i have like barely the


---------10:46----------
beginnings of a mansion and so then that


---------10:48----------
sort of negatively impacts them they


---------10:50----------
start to like feel like they're actually


---------10:52----------
inferior to these other people because


---------10:53----------
they've been told oh you're smarter than


---------10:55----------
the kid next door like why the hell is


---------10:56----------
the kid next door getting into college


---------10:58----------
and like you're not even getting into


---------10:59----------
college and so it all sort of sort of


---------11:01----------
sort of compounds right because even for


---------11:03----------
the gifted kid they're not trying to


---------11:05----------
build a shack because they've been told


---------11:06----------
they've been they're gifted their entire


---------11:07----------
life so it's not enough to be average if


---------11:10----------
you're gifted so what you have to do is


---------11:12----------
you try to you know build a mansion


---------11:13----------
because that's what you've been


---------11:15----------
told that you're capable of that's the


---------11:17----------
expectation you set for yourself and


---------11:19----------
then you're you're left kind of


---------11:20----------
scratching your head and wondering like


---------11:22----------
why you don't even have a shack yet even


---------11:24----------
though you studied for a month and they


---------11:26----------
studied for a month you're not getting


---------11:27----------
as much as that they're getting


---------11:30----------
and it's kind of super bizarre right


---------11:31----------
because we don't we just don't think


---------11:32----------
about it that way we think that if


---------11:34----------
you're gifted that means that everything


---------11:35----------
should be easier for you that it not


---------11:37----------
only they may need a hundred pounds of


---------11:39----------
wood to build a shack but you should be


---------11:41----------
able to build a shack and 50 pounds of


---------11:42----------
wood it should be easier for you but it


---------11:45----------
turns out paradoxically being harder


---------11:47----------
and then we sort of end up with kind of


---------11:49----------
the final state of a gifted kid which if


---------11:51----------
we kind of think about it internally is


---------11:53----------
a state of like really shame and low


---------11:55----------
self-esteem so all this stuff kind of


---------11:57----------
compounds right like you're told you're


---------11:59----------
smart so you set this expectation of


---------12:01----------
what you're capable of like way up here


---------12:03----------
and then like you know first grade goes


---------12:05----------
by and you're up here second grade goes


---------12:07----------
by and you're up here third grade goes


---------12:08----------
by and you're up here boom boom boom


---------12:10----------
fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade


---------12:12----------
10th grade 11th grade and then you kind


---------12:14----------
of tank right and as you go to college


---------12:17----------
suddenly like you don't have the study


---------12:18----------
skills involved and now in the gap


---------12:20----------
between what you're capable of and what


---------12:23----------
you actually accomplish this gap is


---------12:26----------
where shame comes from this is the shame


---------12:28----------
gap that gifted kids inevitably fall


---------12:30----------
into


---------12:31----------
which is when they fall short of what


---------12:32----------
their expectations are and this could be


---------12:35----------
once again


---------12:36----------
due to the fact that you're you know


---------12:38----------
you're setting out to build a mansion


---------12:40----------
and you ended up not even building a


---------12:42----------
shack right so all of these


---------12:44----------
discrepancies between your expectations


---------12:46----------
and your accomplishments


---------12:48----------
in that gap and the bigger the gap is


---------12:50----------
the more it's filled with shame


---------12:52----------
so then what happens is kids are ashamed


---------12:54----------
right because they should be doing more


---------12:56----------
they should be doing better


---------12:58----------
and then like the shame then further


---------13:00----------
compounds and makes it hard to find


---------13:02----------
motivation and this is where you kind of


---------13:03----------
get burnout so then like you have these


---------13:05----------
gifted kids and you're like hey man just


---------13:06----------
like go to a community college you don't


---------13:08----------
have to go to an ivy league school


---------13:09----------
school you don't have to go to like


---------13:10----------
harvard or stanford or mit just like go


---------13:12----------
to your local community college and in


---------13:14----------
that comes a bunch of shame because


---------13:16----------
you've been told your entire life that


---------13:18----------
you're better than that right


---------13:20----------
and so you start to develop this ego


---------13:22----------
of being a super smart kid and then this


---------13:25----------
leads to avoidance of things because all


---------13:27----------
you're left with is the identity of a


---------13:29----------
smart kid so you can never even bring


---------13:31----------
yourself to go to community college


---------13:32----------
because smart kids don't go to community


---------13:35----------
college in your mind that's where the


---------13:37----------
stupid kids go and if you go to


---------13:39----------
community college then suddenly you've


---------13:40----------
lived your entire life for 20 years


---------13:42----------
being told you're a smart kid it's the


---------13:44----------
only that's your biggest strength it's


---------13:45----------
the one that everyone keeps talking


---------13:46----------
about and now like suddenly you have to


---------13:48----------
relegate yourself to being a stupid kid


---------13:51----------
and in that gap is where the shame lives


---------13:53----------
in that gap is where the ego lives okay


---------13:57----------
so it's really really hard right because


---------13:59----------
you're set up with these expectations


---------14:01----------
people don't really acknowledge that


---------14:03----------
because you're capable of a lot it's


---------14:05----------
actually going to take like a lot of


---------14:07----------
work to take that potential and bring it


---------14:09----------
to fruition


---------14:11----------
right and that's like that's the biggest


---------14:12----------
thing is people just lose sight of the


---------14:14----------
fact that building a mansion actually


---------14:16----------
takes more work than building a shack


---------14:18----------
and your entire life people have told


---------14:20----------
you like you should build this mansion


---------14:21----------
because that's what you're capable of


---------14:24----------
and so then we kind of get to all right


---------14:26----------
so like what do we do about it right so


---------14:27----------
if you're a gifted kid who's kind of


---------14:28----------
perfectionistic and burnt out and like


---------14:30----------
society has sort of set you up this way


---------14:32----------
i'm not saying that you're not


---------14:33----------
individually responsible as well but i


---------14:35----------
do think that there's a whole reason so


---------14:37----------
when we have like a generation of burnt


---------14:40----------
out gifted kids i think we have to be


---------14:42----------
fair and be a little bit scientific and


---------14:44----------
kind of acknowledge that this may not be


---------14:46----------
like an individual problem right we've


---------14:48----------
got a generation of kids like this like


---------14:50----------
maybe there's something societal going


---------14:52----------
on and i think paradoxically we sort of


---------14:54----------
set these kids up to


---------14:56----------
struggle and so then the question


---------14:59----------
becomes okay like what do we do about it


---------15:01----------
so the first thing you should do if


---------15:02----------
you're a gifted kid is to stop


---------15:04----------
comparison right like comparison is is


---------15:07----------
the foundation of getting out of this


---------15:09----------
problem


---------15:10----------
because as long as you are comparing


---------15:11----------
yourself and this is part of the issue


---------15:13----------
is that if you think about the word


---------15:15----------
gifted


---------15:16----------
what does the word gifted imply it is a


---------15:18----------
word that has no meaning


---------15:20----------
outside of a comparative framework you


---------15:23----------
guys get that the only way you can be


---------15:25----------
gifted is if there are other people who


---------15:27----------
are not gifted


---------15:28----------
and so essentially what happens is like


---------15:30----------
the whole idea of a gifted kid only


---------15:33----------
exists in relationship to another kid


---------15:36----------
and so what we find in the minds of


---------15:38----------
gifted kids is that they're comparing


---------15:40----------
themselves all the time oh i don't want


---------15:42----------
to go to community college that's where


---------15:43----------
the stupid people go oh i don't know


---------15:45----------
like why i can't do what my friend is


---------15:47----------
capable of like he's able to do so much


---------15:49----------
why am i not able to do so much i have


---------15:51----------
an older sibling who did fantastic


---------15:53----------
and now i have big shoes to fill right


---------15:56----------
there's so much comparison all of the


---------15:58----------
expectations that gifted kids have don't


---------16:01----------
come from themselves


---------16:02----------
right because if you actually based your


---------16:04----------
expectations on what you're capable of


---------16:06----------
you'd be capable of a b c d or an f


---------16:10----------
that's what that would be a realistic


---------16:12----------
expectation but instead you create these


---------16:14----------
artificial expectations that are based


---------16:16----------
on comparison and why do gifted kids do


---------16:18----------
that because it starts with their


---------16:19----------
parents it starts with their teachers


---------16:21----------
we're all told that we're gifted which


---------16:23----------
is by definition a comparison to all of


---------16:26----------
the other kids


---------16:27----------
and so then what happens is you're


---------16:28----------
looking over at the shack and you've got


---------16:30----------
this blueprint for a mansion and they


---------16:32----------
give you some wood and then you try to


---------16:34----------
build the mansion and like you don't


---------16:35----------
even have a roof when this person has a


---------16:37----------
completely built shack and then you kind


---------16:39----------
of look at yourself well like man i must


---------16:40----------
be like a super idiot right like and


---------16:42----------
it's just it's so bizarre that when we


---------16:44----------
set up this kind of when we start with


---------16:46----------
this framework of a comparison


---------16:48----------
we sort of doom ourselves to failure


---------16:50----------
because there's like we're just


---------16:52----------
it's just it's never going to work


---------16:53----------
because you can't ever


---------16:55----------
base the expectations of your life and


---------16:58----------
what you're capable of based on what


---------16:59----------
someone else is doing


---------17:01----------
right if someone else is happy studying


---------17:03----------
chemical engineering it doesn't mean


---------17:05----------
that you're going to be happy studying


---------17:06----------
chemical engineering if somebody else is


---------17:09----------
happy dating someone of the opposite sex


---------17:10----------
it doesn't mean that you're going to be


---------17:11----------
happy dating someone of the opposite sex


---------17:14----------
the whole point is as individuals as


---------17:16----------
humans we're individuals and if you're a


---------17:18----------
gifted kid the first thing you've got to


---------17:19----------
do is let go of all comparison


---------17:23----------
so next thing is to


---------17:25----------
recognize that your road is going to be


---------17:28----------
a rough one right so like when someone


---------17:29----------
sets out to build a mansion they know in


---------17:32----------
their mind that like this is gonna take


---------17:34----------
a while right


---------17:35----------
you can't expect to build a mansion in


---------17:38----------
the same amount of time it would take


---------17:39----------
someone to build a shack


---------17:41----------
and so if you're a gifted kid and you


---------17:43----------
expect a lot from yourself


---------17:45----------
okay


---------17:46----------
recognize that this is going to be a


---------17:48----------
long road and the greater your potential


---------17:50----------
is the longer it's going to take for you


---------17:52----------
to get there and this is something that


---------17:54----------
i can understand in hindsight like so i


---------17:56----------
grew up as a gifted kid and was like in


---------17:59----------
you know the special classes or whatever


---------18:01----------
i actually still remember when i was in


---------18:03----------
eighth grade my grades started to dip


---------18:05----------
and when i went to high school


---------18:08----------
um i didn't qualify for based on my


---------18:11----------
grades like my high school was like yeah


---------18:13----------
he needs to be in like regular english


---------18:15----------
he can't be in like advanced english or


---------18:16----------
he doesn't meet the criteria for


---------18:17----------
advanced english and so my parents were


---------18:19----------
really really not happy with that


---------18:21----------
because they have they have such a smart


---------18:22----------
boy you know he's so smart he just needs


---------18:25----------
to apply himself so they went to the


---------18:26----------
school and i remember having a meeting


---------18:27----------
with the the honors english teacher or


---------18:30----------
whatever and then he's like do you want


---------18:31----------
to be in this class and i was like yeah


---------18:32----------
i want to be in the class and my parents


---------18:33----------
were like yeah he should be he belongs


---------18:35----------
he belongs in the class


---------18:37----------
right and so the teacher was like okay


---------18:38----------
fine because you know


---------18:40----------
i mean you're not gonna you know there


---------18:42----------
are some parents that could potentially


---------18:43----------
be annoying so you're like whatever


---------18:45----------
and so i ended up being in the class


---------18:46----------
that i really didn't belong and i really


---------18:48----------
didn't do very well


---------18:49----------
right because i didn't have the work


---------18:50----------
ethic but it propagates sort of this


---------18:53----------
idea of like you can handle it


---------18:56----------
so like i started off you know going on


---------18:58----------
the wrong track kind of like in in high


---------19:00----------
school it took me


---------19:02----------
i took me five years to graduate from


---------19:04----------
college right with a 2.5 gpa


---------19:07----------
took me another three or four years to


---------19:09----------
even get into medical school


---------19:11----------
and so like my road has been long


---------19:14----------
and like that's just sometimes what it


---------19:16----------
takes if you're a gifted kid right you


---------19:18----------
take the scenic route in life so


---------19:20----------
oftentimes people would ask me you know


---------19:22----------
like


---------19:23----------
about stuff


---------19:24----------
when i remember when i was going to when


---------19:26----------
i started medical school and i saw


---------19:27----------
friends of mine right who were who i was


---------19:29----------
in high school with they're already


---------19:30----------
fully trained doctors and you know


---------19:32----------
flying around and all that good stuff


---------19:34----------
and i'm just like starting medical


---------19:35----------
school and i was like yeah i took the


---------19:36----------
scenic route in life and so recognize


---------19:39----------
that if you're a gifted kid like it's a


---------19:40----------
long road like you're not going to do


---------19:42----------
things faster you're not going to build


---------19:44----------
a mansion


---------19:45----------
as fast as someone else is going to


---------19:47----------
build a shack the other thing to


---------19:48----------
recognize about it being a long road if


---------19:50----------
you're a gifted kid is don't expect to


---------19:53----------
see the form of your mansion for a long


---------19:56----------
time


---------19:57----------
when other people have built their


---------19:59----------
shacks you will still just have the


---------20:01----------
foundation of the mansion it's not going


---------20:03----------
to have a roof for a long time it's not


---------20:04----------
going to have windows for a long time so


---------20:06----------
this is the other problem that gifted


---------20:07----------
kids run into


---------20:08----------
is as they put in an equal amount of


---------20:11----------
effort compared to their colleagues they


---------20:13----------
actually see less return on their


---------20:15----------
investment and that in turn shatters


---------20:18----------
their motivation and what makes them


---------20:20----------
want to give up


---------20:21----------
right because i'm putting in all this


---------20:22----------
effort i'm still not seeing anything yet


---------20:24----------
so it's a long road be patient with


---------20:26----------
yourself and try your best not to


---------20:28----------
compare to other people


---------20:30----------
the last thing to kind of consider is


---------20:32----------
that is the shame so gifted kids


---------20:34----------
oftentimes struggle a lot with


---------20:35----------
self-esteem and shame and that once


---------20:37----------
again is because their expectations are


---------20:39----------
up here and their performance is down


---------20:41----------
here right


---------20:42----------
and so in that gap is where your shame


---------20:45----------
is going to live


---------20:46----------
and so as long as there is a gap in what


---------20:48----------
you expect from yourself


---------20:50----------
with what you accomplish


---------20:52----------
you will have shame and the solution to


---------20:55----------
that oddly enough is one of two ways


---------20:57----------
right


---------20:57----------
one is you can actually


---------20:59----------
live up to the expectations that you


---------21:01----------
have right so you can actually shoot up


---------21:03----------
here and land up here so you can go to


---------21:05----------
an ivy league school or whatever right


---------21:07----------
you can go you can start


---------21:09----------
you can do a tech startup or whatever


---------21:11----------
like you can like


---------21:12----------
do everything that everyone has always


---------21:14----------
known you're capable of doing so you can


---------21:16----------
actually hit all of those metrics that's


---------21:18----------
one option then the shame will go away


---------21:20----------
or what you can do is let go of your


---------21:22----------
expectations


---------21:23----------
and bring yourself down here because the


---------21:25----------
shame exists in the gap so even if you


---------21:28----------
accept yourself as being like sort of a


---------21:30----------
failure oddly enough the shame will go


---------21:33----------
away and as you accept yourself as you


---------21:36----------
are which is not wasted potential but


---------21:39----------
like in the present like you are


---------21:41----------
everything that you're capable of


---------21:42----------
everything that you've ever been capable


---------21:44----------
of is exactly what you've achieved and


---------21:46----------
once you sort of take that attitude


---------21:48----------
bring your expectations down to here you


---------21:50----------
will be amazed at like what happens to


---------21:52----------
your motivation and what you are truly


---------21:54----------
capable of


---------21:55----------
but you can't achieve it as long as


---------21:57----------
there is that shame gap right like in


---------22:00----------
terms of performance


---------22:03----------
so questions


---------22:06----------
anyway so let me just kind of summarize


---------22:08----------
so i think that like


---------22:10----------
you know we see this a lot where a lot


---------22:12----------
of people are gifted


---------22:13----------
and we think of that as an advantage but


---------22:15----------
like i was saying earlier


---------22:17----------
i think that


---------22:18----------
you know sometimes being gifted comes


---------22:21----------
with its own set of needs


---------22:24----------
and by properly addressing those needs


---------22:26----------
we can avoid some of these things like


---------22:27----------
gifted kids you know feeling ashamed of


---------22:29----------
themselves gifted kids


---------22:32----------
you know not like comparing themselves


---------22:34----------
to like all the other normal kids and


---------22:36----------
and finding themselves lacking


---------22:38----------
um and also that we have to kind of


---------22:40----------
acknowledge that our school system is


---------22:42----------
sort of set up in a particular way that


---------22:44----------
oftentimes causes gifted kids to stumble


---------22:47----------
and through understanding like how a


---------22:49----------
gifted kid you know a child who is


---------22:51----------
gifted becomes an adult who's


---------22:53----------
perfectionistic and burnt out


---------22:55----------
we have to understand that whole life


---------22:57----------
cycle in order to sort of


---------22:59----------
start taking steps to change it


---------23:04----------
um


---------23:09----------
okay so i'm sure you've been asked this


---------23:11----------
question before and have answered before


---------23:12----------
so feel free to tell me where i can


---------23:14----------
finally answer this question how are you


---------23:16----------
able to get accepted to harvard medical


---------23:17----------
school let alone medical school alone


---------23:19----------
with such a low gpa when that is such a


---------23:21----------
critical deciding factor


---------23:23----------
how did i stand out so that's a great


---------23:25----------
question so the short answer is so i i


---------23:27----------
did some amount of graduate education so


---------23:29----------
i did a master's degree to boost my gpa


---------23:32----------
the second thing that i did i didn't go


---------23:33----------
to harvard for medical school i went to


---------23:36----------
tufts for medical school and then i did


---------23:38----------
my psychiatry training at harvard at


---------23:40----------
mass general mclean hospital


---------23:42----------
and so the short answer of like how i


---------23:44----------
wound up there is like one step at a


---------23:46----------
time


---------23:47----------
so you have to do you know in each of


---------23:49----------
those things involved like


---------23:53----------
a reality check or some degree of


---------23:55----------
humility in terms of like thinking like


---------23:57----------
i actually don't belong at harvard like


---------24:00----------
i'm never going to wind up there i had


---------24:01----------
to accept that right let alone get into


---------24:03----------
medical school


---------24:04----------
and the more that i accepted like i i


---------24:06----------
did a lot of things that were you know


---------24:10----------
humbling to say the least i wouldn't


---------24:12----------
quite say undignified but i had to


---------24:14----------
really let go of a lot of ego and like


---------24:16----------
take one step at a time it also took


---------24:17----------
perseverance i mean i applied to 120


---------24:19----------
medical schools before i got into a


---------24:21----------
single one and that was the break that i


---------24:23----------
needed


---------24:24----------
and then like understanding having all


---------24:26----------
that failure behind me i really


---------24:28----------
worked hard in medical school


---------24:31----------
and really tried to excel


---------24:33----------
and then i actually did an away rotation


---------24:35----------
for those of you don't know what that is


---------24:37----------
or for those of you do know what that is


---------24:39----------
so i basically did an audition rotation


---------24:41----------
at harvard which is like super


---------24:42----------
competitive you show up there with a


---------24:44----------
bunch of other people who want to go


---------24:45----------
there and it's basically like a test


---------24:47----------
it's like a month-long test of what


---------24:49----------
you're capable of and i did really well


---------24:52----------
so thankfully i had set up you know a


---------24:53----------
lot of good stuff over the last


---------24:56----------
eight years


---------24:57----------
in terms of being myself and like owning


---------24:59----------
the person that i was and not being


---------25:01----------
ashamed of the fact that i failed


---------25:02----------
and you know recognizing that most of


---------25:04----------
the students most of the other students


---------25:06----------
who were auditioning


---------25:08----------
um were four years younger than i was


---------25:10----------
that i was actually older than some of


---------25:11----------
the residents there


---------25:13----------
despite the fact that like they were


---------25:14----------
evaluating me right so like there's


---------25:16----------
someone two years younger who's like


---------25:18----------
giving me a grade


---------25:20----------
so navigating all that stuff was


---------25:21----------
difficult but i did a good job at it and


---------25:23----------
stayed focused and that's how i wound up


---------25:25----------
at harvard so i trained there for four


---------25:27----------
years and that's where i'm faculty now


---------25:33----------
right but it's all about like letting go


---------25:35----------
of the ego


---------25:45----------
um how do you lower expectations


---------25:49----------
uh you lower expectations by accepting


---------25:52----------
what you're capable of


---------25:54----------
like actually and so expectation and and


---------25:57----------
acceptance are at opposite ends of the


---------25:59----------
spectrum


---------26:00----------
okay so


---------26:01----------
practicing acceptance


---------26:03----------
is


---------26:05----------
how you lower expectations


---------26:07----------
so let me give you guys an example so


---------26:09----------
the theme today is


---------26:11----------
right so like let me think about a nyani


---------26:13----------
yoga exercise to let go of expectations


---------26:16----------
um


---------26:21----------
let me just think about this for a


---------26:22----------
second


---------26:29----------
so here's a good example of a nyani yoga


---------26:31----------
exercise actually i don't know if this


---------26:32----------
is a good example


---------26:34----------
this is one of the ones that i feel less


---------26:35----------
confident this is maybe a bad example of


---------26:37----------
a yoga exercise


---------26:39----------
so for the next


---------26:41----------
month or two months


---------26:42----------
when you go to a restaurant


---------26:47----------
and someone asks you what you want to


---------26:49----------
want what you want to order just tell


---------26:50----------
the waiter to surprise you


---------26:54----------
just tell them surprise me


---------26:56----------
and then pay attention


---------26:58----------
to your enjoyment or lack of enjoyment


---------27:01----------
of the food


---------27:04----------
right so when we go to restaurants


---------27:06----------
we have expectations and if we think


---------27:09----------
about the least


---------27:10----------
the worst experience that you can have


---------27:12----------
at a restaurant is not actually to have


---------27:14----------
bad food


---------27:15----------
it's to expect really good food and get


---------27:18----------
bad food that's actually worse than


---------27:19----------
getting bad food if you know a


---------27:20----------
restaurant is crap and you go there and


---------27:22----------
you order something the food that you


---------27:23----------
get is crap like what were you expecting


---------27:25----------
it's totally fine actually right we do


---------27:27----------
that every day like if you go to a fast


---------27:28----------
food like mcdonald's or taco bell or


---------27:30----------
whatever like you're not expecting you


---------27:32----------
know like a gourmet meal you're just


---------27:34----------
expecting some like mediocre arguably


---------27:36----------
incredibly tasty


---------27:38----------
depending on whether you're getting a


---------27:39----------
mexican pizza or not


---------27:40----------
which you can't get anymore because


---------27:42----------
they're out of


---------27:43----------
sad


---------27:44----------
but


---------27:45----------
so like a lot of if you guys want to


---------27:46----------
really understand so this is the way


---------27:48----------
that nyanio works if you really want to


---------27:50----------
understand expectation and acceptance


---------27:53----------
you have to put yourself in situations


---------27:55----------
that are like free from expectation


---------27:58----------
and you can't put yourself in a


---------27:59----------
situation because the expectation


---------28:01----------
doesn't come from the situation right


---------28:04----------
it's even that's


---------28:06----------
even what i said was kind of wrong


---------28:07----------
you have to practice


---------28:10----------
messing with your expectations so go to


---------28:11----------
restaurant just say surprise me


---------28:14----------
or you can ask if they don't know like


---------28:15----------
if they're taking it back you can say


---------28:16----------
what's good here okay i'll take that


---------28:19----------
right if you've got dietary restrictions


---------28:20----------
tell them about the dietary restrictions


---------28:23----------
and just like and then you're like but


---------28:25----------
what if i don't like the food that i get


---------28:27----------
well yeah i mean that's the point right


---------28:29----------
so like just eat what you get and see


---------28:31----------
what happens


---------28:33----------
and they're like but i don't like it and


---------28:34----------
it's like yes so like pay attention to


---------28:36----------
that and be like how hard is it for you


---------28:38----------
to order food that you're not gonna like


---------28:40----------
or you order without expectations what's


---------28:42----------
it like to go to a restaurant and accept


---------28:45----------
that you're going to just get some


---------28:46----------
random pile of food that could be


---------28:48----------
amazing and could be something that you


---------28:49----------
really dislike


---------28:51----------
that's how you gain acceptance that's


---------28:53----------
how you let go of expectations by


---------28:55----------
literally going to a restaurant and like


---------28:57----------
actively letting them go


---------28:58----------
that is the nyani yog


---------29:00----------
and then you may discover all kinds of


---------29:02----------
cool things right you may even discover


---------29:03----------
for example that if you go to the


---------29:06----------
restaurant and you expect


---------29:08----------
crap if you're like this is going to be


---------29:10----------
an absolute train wreck i'm gonna have


---------29:12----------
to go home and like have a bowl of


---------29:14----------
cereal after the meal


---------29:17----------
it'll be really interesting


---------29:20----------
how much you enjoy your meal it'll be


---------29:22----------
really interesting because in that


---------29:23----------
moment what you're doing is letting go


---------29:25----------
of the expectation


---------29:27----------
right and then like suddenly even if you


---------29:29----------
get crap it's not a big deal and if you


---------29:31----------
get something delicious it's like such a


---------29:33----------
huge win and that's what it means to let


---------29:35----------
go of expectation the more you let go of


---------29:38----------
expectation the more you start to enjoy


---------29:39----------
life and the better life gets


---------29:41----------
it's kind of bizarre


---------29:43----------
so literally if you guys wanted nyani


---------29:44----------
yoga practice to let go of expectations


---------29:47----------
and earn acceptance and you can't just


---------29:48----------
do this once right so you can't like


---------29:51----------
wuss out of it


---------29:52----------
you have to do it for a month


---------29:55----------
presuming you're going to go out to eat


---------29:56----------
you know and you can afford that and all


---------29:58----------
that good stuff


---------29:59----------
otherwise like make it three months


---------30:01----------
like


---------30:02----------
you know do it for a while like commit


---------30:04----------
yourself this is my life now gg get


---------30:06----------
wrecked noobs


---------30:09----------
so


---------30:15----------
try it you guys want to learn nyan yog


---------30:17----------
try it


---------30:23----------
okay someone else is asking how should a


---------30:24----------
parent teacher or manager support the


---------30:26----------
special needs of gifted people if what's


---------30:29----------
happening now is bad that's a great


---------30:31----------
question so i'll give you an example


---------30:34----------
so sometimes i get parents that come


---------30:35----------
into my office


---------30:38----------
they have a kid who's addicted to video


---------30:39----------
games why is a kid addicted to video


---------30:41----------
games really simple


---------30:44----------
because video games match the pace of


---------30:46----------
the child right that's why that's why


---------30:47----------
gifted kids in a nutshell the reason


---------30:49----------
that gifted kids get addicted to video


---------30:51----------
games is one very very very simple


---------30:53----------
reason can all be reduced to this


---------30:55----------
games match the pace of the child and


---------30:57----------
school doesn't


---------30:58----------
so you've got a kid goes to school gets


---------31:01----------
a worksheet does the worksheet i still


---------31:03----------
remember i i had this experience i


---------31:04----------
skipped the first grade so this is what


---------31:06----------
happened


---------31:08----------
i went to a school


---------31:10----------
where you know i'd do a worksheet and


---------31:11----------
then like they'd give me another one and


---------31:13----------
so in in my first day of first grade i


---------31:15----------
moved schools i i gave them you know i


---------31:18----------
got a worksheet i did the worksheet i


---------31:19----------
gave it back to them and i said can i


---------31:21----------
have the next one and she's like what do


---------31:23----------
you mean the next one it's like the next


---------31:24----------
one like whatever's next like i'm done


---------31:26----------
with this we've got class for another 45


---------31:28----------
minutes i'm done with this can i have


---------31:29----------
the next one she's like there is no next


---------31:31----------
one i'm like what


---------31:33----------
and it didn't take long where like you


---------31:35----------
know she gave me the then she evaluated


---------31:37----------
me and i got moved up a grade but same


---------31:38----------
problem there


---------31:40----------
and then eventually like what heck is


---------31:41----------
like school moves at the pace of like


---------31:42----------
the slowest person now here's the really


---------31:45----------
addictive thing about a video game now


---------31:46----------
imagine you're just bored at school


---------31:48----------
because it's moving at a snail's pace


---------31:50----------
right because there's like other


---------31:51----------
six-year-olds and like you're a


---------31:52----------
six-year-old two and maybe you're a


---------31:53----------
little smarter than the other


---------31:54----------
six-year-olds now enter a video game


---------31:57----------
what happens when you don't beat level


---------31:59----------
one


---------32:00----------
you replay level one and what happens


---------32:02----------
when you beat level one you go straight


---------32:04----------
to level two and if you beat level two


---------32:06----------
you go straight to level three you beat


---------32:07----------
level three you go straight to level


---------32:09----------
four


---------32:10----------
so games perfectly match


---------32:12----------
the challenge


---------32:14----------
that a human being is capable of right


---------32:17----------
if you get stuck on a boss in dark souls


---------32:19----------
like


---------32:19----------
you don't get to move past the boss


---------32:22----------
because your parents make a phone call


---------32:24----------
to from software and they're like hey my


---------32:26----------
son is really good at video games can


---------32:27----------
you please advance him past this boss


---------32:29----------
and stick him to the next boss it's like


---------32:31----------
you can't do that in dark souls like


---------32:33----------
dark souls doesn't give a


---------32:35----------
right


---------32:36----------
so like kids get addicted to video games


---------32:39----------
because they perfectly match what you're


---------32:42----------
capable of which is exactly what kids


---------32:44----------
like there's this whole thing called


---------32:45----------
intent to mastery we teach all this


---------32:47----------
stuff to parents and things like that


---------32:50----------
so what do you do if you've got a kid


---------32:51----------
who's gifted you challenge them and you


---------32:53----------
don't rely on school to do it for you so


---------32:56----------
when parents come to me and they're like


---------32:58----------
i have a kid who's addicted to video


---------32:59----------
games he's 16. he thinks school is i ask


---------33:01----------
him okay what do you think about schools


---------33:03----------
like school is boring


---------33:04----------
then what i do is i you know i make a


---------33:06----------
couple of phone calls and i'm like we're


---------33:07----------
gonna like you so we were i was back


---------33:09----------
when i was in boston a lot of cool


---------33:11----------
startups in boston so what i'll do is


---------33:12----------
we'll make some phone calls we'll stick


---------33:14----------
them in an internship somewhere like


---------33:15----------
we'll take some college-level internship


---------33:17----------
it's some kind of startup so like we'll


---------33:19----------
look around at like incubators from like


---------33:21----------
mit or whatever like harvard will be


---------33:23----------
like hey like there's a kid do you guys


---------33:26----------
have any internship opportunities


---------33:27----------
available and we'll stick him there and


---------33:29----------
he'll like be he'll work there for the


---------33:30----------
summer and it like turns the kid right


---------33:32----------
around no more video games because he's


---------33:34----------
actually like learning so i stuck one


---------33:36----------
kid in this startup that was


---------33:38----------
that there's an app you take a picture


---------33:41----------
of a mole on your body and it tells you


---------33:42----------
the percentage chance that the mole is


---------33:44----------
cancerous


---------33:45----------
right so we stick the kid there we're


---------33:47----------
like go help them


---------33:49----------
and then like sometimes the kid is like


---------33:51----------
what am i supposed to do like you start


---------33:52----------
by getting them coffee


---------33:54----------
and then maybe you'll learn something


---------33:56----------
and then it's it's actually fantastic


---------33:58----------
like they do they do really well you


---------33:59----------
challenge them right and because the


---------34:00----------
cool thing is that a lot of the startup


---------34:02----------
folks they sort of recognize because


---------34:03----------
some of them are like misfits too so


---------34:06----------
they're like okay there's like a kid


---------34:07----------
here like let's put them to work because


---------34:08----------
they recognize that okay you're 16. so


---------34:10----------
you know how to like manage sql data


---------34:12----------
databases and the kid is like no they're


---------34:14----------
like


---------34:15----------
google it


---------34:16----------
and learn and then you're going to


---------34:18----------
manage our sql database next week


---------34:20----------
and the kid is like what and like yeah


---------34:22----------
and then suddenly the kid is like goes


---------34:23----------
home he's not playing video games he's


---------34:24----------
like reading about sql databases


---------34:27----------
or whatever


---------34:28----------
right just just stick them stick them


---------34:30----------
into it and challenge them


---------34:32----------
so as a parent you know or a teacher


---------34:34----------
like i'd say like ask them so here's the


---------34:36----------
biggest mistake that parents and


---------34:37----------
teachers make with gifted children


---------34:40----------
is that you


---------34:41----------
when when a gifted child fails what we


---------34:44----------
tend to do is slow down instead what you


---------34:46----------
need to do is speed up it's absolutely


---------34:48----------
terrifying so if a gifted child is


---------34:50----------
failing what they need more than


---------34:52----------
anything else is a bigger challenge not


---------34:54----------
like an easier environment now you have


---------34:56----------
to make sure for a couple of other


---------34:57----------
things like you need to make sure


---------34:58----------
there's not adhd going on depression


---------35:00----------
going on learning disabilities or other


---------35:03----------
things like that going on but in the


---------35:05----------
absence of all of those things challenge


---------35:07----------
them more not less


---------35:09----------
ask them to do more give them put them


---------35:10----------
in positions of leadership


---------35:12----------
right


---------35:13----------
and just push them


---------35:15----------
because like it's so fulfilling when


---------35:17----------
when you're a take a kid in that


---------35:19----------
situation and you're like


---------35:21----------
you're gonna need to do this thing and


---------35:22----------
they're like i can't do that thing and


---------35:24----------
you're like okay so then fail


---------35:25----------
but try if you fail like no big deal but


---------35:28----------
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna expect less


---------35:30----------
of you i know it's kind of paradoxical


---------35:31----------
because we just talked about letting go


---------35:32----------
of expectation


---------35:34----------
but it's not really expectations it's


---------35:36----------
really having faith in them it's a


---------35:37----------
subtle difference but be like i have


---------35:39----------
faith in you i think you can handle it


---------35:41----------
so like give it your best shot


---------35:45----------
that's what you do you challenge them


---------35:47----------
respect them


---------35:49----------
is instead of expect things from them


---------36:02----------
you
