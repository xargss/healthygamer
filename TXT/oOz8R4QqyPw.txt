---------00:00----------
um I heard what I was listening to what


---------00:03----------
you're talking about


---------00:03----------
listen you're gonna trigger some stuff I


---------00:05----------
was like no no no no no I don't know I'm


---------00:09----------
gonna trigger some stuff but I wasn't


---------00:11----------
that will pay attention to yeah when the


---------00:15----------
ego is triggered yeah yeah ups and downs


---------00:19----------
but I think yesterday I had a I entered


---------00:22----------
a place where I felt like I was like I


---------00:27----------
can tell that there's two modes that I'm


---------00:29----------
in one is very small and activated and


---------00:32----------
I'm kind of stuck in a in like this hurt


---------00:36----------
anger shame thing and then another which


---------00:38----------
kind of doesn't even understand that you


---------00:41----------
know it's like a much more confident


---------00:42----------
place that so I kind of have noticed


---------00:46----------
that when I'm noticing trying okay


---------00:50----------
trying what well one of the practice


---------00:52----------
that you basically gave me was to notice


---------00:54----------
trying yep because I was trying all the


---------00:57----------
time and I noticed I mean I would love


---------01:01----------
to share the conclusion you know kind of


---------01:03----------
yeah the big reason say that I thought I


---------01:04----------
got it can I do that yeah please


---------01:06----------
so I feel that what I uncovered is this


---------01:11----------
sense so I wrote it down on this little


---------01:14----------
white board but so like I decided long


---------01:17----------
ago that kind of the world and other


---------01:19----------
people are acceptable as they are like I


---------01:22----------
don't really resist what what is the


---------01:24----------
external world's telling me and then


---------01:26----------
like but because people react negatively


---------01:29----------
to me all the time or I felt that they


---------01:31----------
did as a kid that I am unacceptable okay


---------01:33----------
I feel like but I know that deep down I


---------01:38----------
only kind of care about the other people


---------01:41----------
around me or whatever and I'm not gonna


---------01:42----------
hurt them you know and I want to be nice


---------01:44----------
and might want to be friends and so I


---------01:47----------
feel like what I noticed is okay I have


---------01:49----------
this inner sense of I just want to be


---------01:52----------
nice but then the outer response is


---------01:55----------
never that we just be friends and things


---------01:58----------
are simple it's always it in my young


---------02:01----------
part or whatever my young mind it's like


---------02:03----------
it always goes wrong


---------02:05----------
so I decided that


---------02:07----------
basically the problem is somewhere in


---------02:09----------
the middle like there's something going


---------02:10----------
on that's about me where I can't get out


---------02:12----------
that I want to be friends and want to be


---------02:15----------
nice and stuff so what I'm trying to do


---------02:17----------
is I'm kind of trying to control how the


---------02:20----------
stuff that's in gets out into like your


---------02:25----------
brain yeah you are trying you're trying


---------02:29----------
to control that you're trying to control


---------02:30----------
other people's perceptions of you that's


---------02:32----------
a hundred that's what I notice that I'm


---------02:34----------
trying and I also noticed that the


---------02:36----------
trying comes with a sense of panic yes


---------02:38----------
absolutely panicking at a very low level


---------02:41----------
pretty constantly okay and panic to me


---------02:45----------
it's kind of like even if I write


---------02:47----------
something on my hand in big letters I


---------02:49----------
can't see it because I'm like ruffling


---------02:51----------
through the papers of how to fix the


---------02:53----------
thing like the in panic there's like


---------02:55----------
such little awareness it's just on one


---------02:58----------
thing okay so let me just pause okay


---------03:02----------
we're good are we good on volume perfect


---------03:04----------
okay sorry that I was adjusting volume


---------03:06----------
so I I couldn't give you a hundred


---------03:08----------
percent attention but can you tell me


---------03:10----------
that part again about so you accept


---------03:12----------
other people for who they are but


---------03:14----------
somewhere along the way you decided that


---------03:17----------
you yourself were unacceptable that's


---------03:19----------
right and that when you interact with


---------03:24----------
people you feel some degree of panic


---------03:26----------
because so panic is a manifestation of


---------03:29----------
fear and fear is related to a particular


---------03:32----------
outcome yeah what is the outcome that


---------03:36----------
you're afraid of well okay that's


---------03:43----------
interesting so I guess the outcome that


---------03:44----------
I'm afraid of simply is that people are


---------03:46----------
not gonna see the real me okay like that


---------03:49----------
but it's really it's kind of a bigger


---------03:52----------
story where it's my fault


---------03:53----------
you know I'm gonna mess this up again


---------03:56----------
okay so tell me about when you started


---------04:01----------
messing things up so as I thought about


---------04:05----------
it I kind of realized that my thinking


---------04:11----------
that I messed things up started from a


---------04:14----------
very young age I have lashes of you know


---------04:18----------
I remember my uncle John it was hella


---------04:20----------
cool with me I remember the people who


---------04:22----------
felt safe and I remember it was a small


---------04:25----------
list of people and I also remember that


---------04:28----------
circumstances changed and that the safe


---------04:30----------
people would sometimes become unsafe and


---------04:32----------
I didn't know why so I want you to just


---------04:35----------
understand for a minute little [ __ ]


---------04:37----------
we're gonna dig into that for a second


---------04:39----------
okay but the first thing that I want you


---------04:40----------
to understand is that your mind operates


---------04:42----------
in different modes yes right so when


---------04:45----------
you're with safe people the some scar is


---------04:48----------
dormant okay and and so then that


---------04:53----------
complex of like I need to make sure that


---------04:56----------
this person likes me I need to be


---------04:58----------
careful with what I say this like all


---------05:00----------
that complex like that's why you think


---------05:02----------
about your uncle because you're some


---------05:04----------
scar was dormant and then what happens


---------05:07----------
is the some scar activates around other


---------05:09----------
people or some people who you thought


---------05:12----------
were safe do something that activates


---------05:16----------
the where your would be your intellect


---------05:18----------
says oh this actually matches the some


---------05:20----------
scar we're actually not safe right now


---------05:21----------
this is that situation yes it looks like


---------05:25----------
a horse but it's actually a wolf and oh


---------05:30----------
my god we have to be careful it's like a


---------05:31----------
wolf and the horses clothing right so it


---------05:34----------
and it so let's not get the Indians in


---------05:36----------
bad versus it's a bad analysis I was


---------05:39----------
just kind of saying that like it looks


---------05:40----------
like you're saying it looks like one


---------05:43----------
thing but then your mind says actually


---------05:44----------
it's not what you think it is that


---------05:46----------
person is not safe that person is


---------05:49----------
dangerous and we have to be back on we


---------05:51----------
have to go back to controlling the way


---------05:53----------
that they think about us


---------05:55----------
yeah so tell me about tell me about like


---------06:00----------
who like what do you remember about like


---------06:02----------
when you started to feel like you had to


---------06:04----------
control other people's perceptions


---------06:07----------
that's a really good question give me a


---------06:11----------
give me a second I can remember excuse


---------06:17----------
me I can remember being like four or


---------06:19----------
five or whatever and being around aunts


---------06:21----------
and uncles and having the sense that I'm


---------06:25----------
supposed to say something and not


---------06:28----------
knowing what that thing is


---------06:29----------
I also remember pretty clearly the


---------06:34----------
feeling of when I did talk about what


---------06:36----------
was interesting to me which is nerdy


---------06:37----------
[ __ ] no one understood what I was


---------06:40----------
talking about and people would kind of


---------06:43----------
look at each other and everybody would


---------06:44----------
be like oh this is weird and so I guess


---------06:52----------
I didn't draw the conclusion yet that


---------06:54----------
the the answer or the solution was to


---------06:56----------
control but I do remember feeling that


---------06:58----------
feeling that I respond to with the


---------07:00----------
trying at a very young age yeah so does


---------07:04----------
when did I admit when do I remember


---------07:06----------
actually trying though right sure we


---------07:10----------
could we can search you stay where you


---------07:12----------
are


---------07:12----------
so I want you to just put yourself in


---------07:14----------
the mind of a four or five year old who


---------07:16----------
tries to talk to an adult and the adults


---------07:19----------
kind of like it's clear that they sort


---------07:20----------
of care about you but then they kind of


---------07:23----------
yes how does that make the four-year-old


---------07:26----------
feel what happens in the four-year-olds


---------07:29----------
mind you're asking about what I think


---------07:33----------
and different for you I identify so


---------07:35----------
strongly with the four year old that I'm


---------07:36----------
I find that when you ask me that


---------07:38----------
question I feel yours asking me yep okay


---------07:41----------
what happens in your mind what happened


---------07:44----------
you're right it's almost worse right


---------07:46----------
that this person like has to love me and


---------07:48----------
care about me and they can't find what


---------07:50----------
I'm talking about interesting it's like


---------07:51----------
holy [ __ ] I must be so weird and boring


---------07:55----------
or whatever that


---------07:57----------
like the deck stacked in my favor absent


---------08:00----------
its still screwing it up so so so now we


---------08:03----------
see actually that the some scar is


---------08:04----------
enhanced because of their caring of you


---------08:07----------
yeah right the the 100 the heart that


---------08:10----------
you feel your like these people they


---------08:13----------
have to accept me yeah but it's clear to


---------08:16----------
me that they shouldn't want to yes yeah


---------08:22----------
actually as you bring that up I notice


---------08:23----------
like an inherent discomfort with the


---------08:31----------
feeling that someone might accept me or


---------08:35----------
want to be around me because they're


---------08:36----------
compelled to it not that they are


---------08:38----------
voluntarily choosing choosing like I


---------08:42----------
have a Harwich like a hypersensitivity


---------08:43----------
to yep so now we get to also something


---------08:48----------
so I think when you try to control other


---------08:50----------
people's reactions towards you


---------08:53----------
I imagine that that's quite painful for


---------08:56----------
you yeah and you can't help yourself


---------09:02----------
okay could I refine I mean this would be


---------09:05----------
just you know everyday this could be you


---------09:10----------
know you go and stuff I mean I would


---------09:11----------
love help with understanding what's


---------09:12----------
going on in my mind actually


---------09:15----------
my sense is that I carry the sense that


---------09:18----------
I'm unacceptable with me all the time


---------09:20----------
and then I actually am not necessarily


---------09:24----------
trying to control the other person's


---------09:26----------
reaction so much as perfectly filter out


---------09:30----------
what I am putting out there to avoid the


---------09:33----------
part that's like the unacceptable me so


---------09:36----------
I am in a sense trying to control the


---------09:38----------
reaction but from my own locus of


---------09:39----------
control absolutely


---------09:41----------
absolutely my presentation yeah so you


---------09:44----------
know great so so I think you're spot-on


---------09:47----------
so that's what I mean so what I'm what


---------09:49----------
I'm saying is that you're not letting


---------09:50----------
people form a genuine and authentic


---------09:53----------
judgment of you as a person absolutely


---------09:56----------
not I feel I've already made that


---------09:57----------
decision on their behalf actually one of


---------10:00----------
the things I noticed with the trying as


---------10:01----------
I was you know in the past week is that


---------10:04----------
for example if at work I want to get


---------10:07----------
something you know I think that


---------10:08----------
something's really important is the


---------10:09----------
right thing to do I will immediately go


---------10:11----------
to a line of reasoning that's basically


---------10:13----------
like I know that you shouldn't agree


---------10:15----------
with this idea just because I'm saying


---------10:17----------
it I'm so untrustworthy so don't look at


---------10:19----------
me look at the evidence in the document


---------10:22----------
that was produced and like the track


---------10:23----------
record like look at the objective stuff


---------10:25----------
because if you look at me I know that


---------10:27----------
you're gonna conclude that I'm bad and


---------10:29----------
wrong


---------10:30----------
you should do this idea in spite of the


---------10:33----------
fact that I'm attached to it or


---------10:35----------
associated with it


---------10:36----------
does that make sense makes a lot of


---------10:38----------
sense right so freezing term in net yeah


---------10:40----------
so your conclusion is that in that - so


---------10:43----------
you're trying to filter the part of


---------10:45----------
yourself which is unacceptable and in


---------10:48----------
your relying on documentation and logic


---------10:50----------
for people - because if they actually


---------10:53----------
saw you if they're the more they're able


---------10:57----------
to uncouple you from your work product


---------10:59----------
even more the better of the work will be


---------11:02----------
and if they see who you are then they're


---------11:06----------
not gonna have faith in you the you know


---------11:08----------
the work should stand on its own two


---------11:09----------
feet and it shouldn't be like tainted by


---------11:11----------
association with you right so at which


---------11:15----------
slot unfortunately also I think happens


---------11:18----------
to be true in terms of like when I think


---------11:22----------
about ideas for myself I shouldn't just


---------11:23----------
believe what I think because I think it


---------11:25----------
because that's like you know I should be


---------11:27----------
a group just so it's unfortunate that


---------11:29----------
I've kind of that that that's true


---------11:31----------
because I but anyway that was it was a


---------11:33----------
tangent so so let's go - why do you so


---------11:37----------
when you filter what does that feel like


---------11:40----------
for you when you filter who you are and


---------11:44----------
present it to the rest of the world what


---------11:45----------
does that feel like for you yeah it


---------11:48----------
feels terrible what feels terrible it


---------11:52----------
was terrible that mostly what feels


---------11:55----------
terrible about it


---------11:56----------
honestly when it feels really bad is the


---------12:01----------
bigger picture feeling that I have is


---------12:04----------
that I'm here and I just want to be


---------12:07----------
helpful and I don't want to hurt anybody


---------12:09----------
and I don't need anything in return and


---------12:13----------
ah no matter what I do that will never


---------12:21----------
come across that's what it feels like in


---------12:24----------
my mind like I don't know I feel like I


---------12:25----------
want it did someone my intent is to


---------12:28----------
sorry go ahead


---------12:29----------
no go ahead it's like the ideas that I


---------12:38----------
like or ones that everybody likes and so


---------12:40----------
like I'm coming and I'm trying to say


---------12:42----------
like hey I think I know how to help like


---------12:44----------
we could do this thing and then it's


---------12:45----------
gonna be good for you and you and you


---------12:46----------
and you and you and actually everyone


---------12:48----------
wins and it's better cuz these people


---------12:50----------
are hurting and they'll hurt less and


---------12:51----------
like you all are stressed out you'll be


---------12:52----------
less stressed out like let's just do


---------12:54----------
this and it's like there's this idea


---------12:56----------
that feels super pure that's just gonna


---------12:58----------
get it's almost like a dog it's gonna


---------12:59----------
get kicked it's like this innocent kind


---------13:02----------
of thing that for whatever reason I


---------13:04----------
can't so the I when the idea gets kicked


---------13:10----------
you mean that something pure is going to


---------13:12----------
get rejected yes yes okay why do you


---------13:19----------
think that's happening my fault because


---------13:22----------
the reason it gets rejected is because


---------13:24----------
it gets ended and it ends up getting


---------13:25----------
associated with you well to be honest so


---------13:31----------
it's like I already know the end of the


---------13:33----------
movie you brought that up with somebody


---------13:35----------
else before where I'm not this is not


---------13:37----------
now that we're talking about is very


---------13:39----------
clear to me that this is not logical but


---------13:41----------
I've predetermined that that's how it's


---------13:42----------
gonna end okay like there's a there's


---------13:46----------
something that I have that I want to


---------13:48----------
share with the world and it's a good


---------13:50----------
pure thing and at the end of the day


---------13:52----------
it's gonna get rejected and it's gonna


---------13:54----------
be my fault


---------13:54----------
who did that to you when you were young


---------14:00----------
what did you share with people that was


---------14:04----------
rejected


---------14:08----------
you


---------14:10----------
you


---------14:14----------
damn dude isn't it like everything my


---------14:16----------
thoughts my tension is it everything I


---------14:21----------
offers to help okay like my mean


---------14:28----------
residents yeah is that how you felt did


---------14:31----------
you feel like your presence was offense


---------14:33----------
like does something come to mind yeah


---------14:36----------
yeah for sure


---------14:39----------
residents being effect offensive I think


---------14:41----------
like grade school I fell talking about


---------14:43----------
that


---------14:45----------
[Music]


---------14:51----------
yeah I have a couple I have a number of


---------14:54----------
memories that are that are around


---------14:55----------
friends that I had when I was young that


---------14:57----------
I had falling outs with for various


---------15:00----------
reasons and kind of a sense that it was


---------15:03----------
my fault or something I don't know where


---------15:05----------
to start is I think it's kind of tangled


---------15:07----------
in some stress so why don't you just


---------15:09----------
start with just start anywhere all right


---------15:13----------
so that could just give me a memory so I


---------15:17----------
remember being really good friends with


---------15:19----------
this kid who lived across the street


---------15:20----------
beautiful was this summer home he was


---------15:23----------
older than me so maybe I was five or six


---------15:25----------
maybe he was eight or nine and I thought


---------15:27----------
that he was the coolest person in the


---------15:28----------
history of the world and you know we


---------15:33----------
hung out like we did stuff so on and so


---------15:35----------
forth he would come to my house I would


---------15:36----------
go to his house and then one day he


---------15:40----------
asked me he was like hey let me see your


---------15:42----------
laser pen my mom had just bought me a


---------15:44----------
laser pen that's like 90 bucks or


---------15:45----------
something like that which is a lot of


---------15:46----------
money when you're that young I don't


---------15:47----------
know why my parents would buy at night


---------15:48----------
anyway and so I went to grab it and I


---------15:51----------
like open the drawer where was and it


---------15:53----------
wasn't there so long story short you


---------15:55----------
know it was like pretty clear that he


---------15:58----------
stole it and like he was just doing that


---------15:59----------
he's a stupid kid like stupid kids draw


---------16:01----------
attention to things that that they did


---------16:03----------
and I definitely remember ooh


---------16:09----------
so I remember that my parents kind of


---------16:11----------
got involved and they talked to his


---------16:13----------
parents and it was kind of like he


---------16:15----------
wouldn't admit it and like was not upset


---------16:17----------
about it and you know they they were


---------16:18----------
like okay this is you know you can't be


---------16:20----------
friends with him and I distinctly


---------16:22----------
remember a feeling like I didn't really


---------16:27----------
care that he stole the laser pen I'd


---------16:28----------
rather be I'd rather have a friend and


---------16:32----------
so I almost felt like it was my fault


---------16:34----------
that they found out that they stole it


---------16:36----------
that he stole the thing cuz if they


---------16:38----------
didn't find that out then I still would


---------16:40----------
have my friend so you felt responsible


---------16:43----------
for y'all's friendship ending yeah


---------16:50----------
I remember feeling responsible yeah I


---------16:52----------
remember just feeling like I had this


---------16:54----------
thing that was you know kind of


---------16:56----------
beautiful to me or precious to me like a


---------16:58----------
really like a like a really cool friend


---------16:59----------
and it was gone and I didn't do


---------17:02----------
everything that I could have to stop


---------17:04----------
that from happening mm-hmm and so it's


---------17:08----------
almost as if you had filtered yourself


---------17:10----------
and not shared that with your parents


---------17:12----------
yeah then y'all would still be friends


---------17:17----------
yeah maybe we would yeah I mean I also


---------17:21----------
remember later which I think is like


---------17:23----------
built on top of this one wound or what


---------17:25----------
sure that you know he told me these


---------17:27----------
stories about this game clock tower we


---------17:29----------
was like oh yeah you could do anything


---------17:30----------
and like I found this woman and like


---------17:32----------
killed her and stuffed her in a basement


---------17:34----------
or some [ __ ] and I remembered tell I


---------17:36----------
know it's a kind of messed up and I


---------17:37----------
didn't understand how messed up it was


---------17:39----------
at the time and I remember that I shared


---------17:41----------
that in second grade when a teacher said


---------17:44----------
some [ __ ] about like our video games


---------17:46----------
violent or good or whatever I love video


---------17:48----------
games but for whatever reason I


---------17:50----------
volunteered this information but then I


---------17:52----------
found out that was a lie


---------17:53----------
so it kind of recontextualized the


---------17:56----------
relationship I had with him in the first


---------17:58----------
place we're like not only did he steal


---------17:59----------
this thing and not care but also lied to


---------18:01----------
me about some things that I thought were


---------18:02----------
super cool so now I've got this judgment


---------18:05----------
from my younger self or even thinking


---------18:06----------
that he was so cool so you blame


---------18:09----------
yourself for thinking he's that you


---------18:11----------
blame yourself for him thinking that he


---------18:14----------
was nice to you when he was mean to you


---------18:16----------
yes so that I think there's a lot of


---------18:19----------
that yeah okay it's probably separate


---------18:21----------
but I have a lot of that like I noticed


---------18:23----------
that when I look back at myself I really


---------18:25----------
feel not good about who that person was


---------18:28----------
in what way what do you not feel good


---------18:32----------
about I just feel like what do I feel


---------18:38----------
not good about I feel like such an idiot


---------18:42----------
when I think that I'm okay and something


---------18:45----------
gets recontextualized as I'm not okay


---------18:47----------
does that make sense


---------18:48----------
makes perfect sense so let me put it


---------18:50----------
like we're not when I have the slight


---------18:52----------
hope that I am acceptable because like


---------18:54----------
this whole some scars about unacceptable


---------18:56----------
when I have this slight hope that I am


---------18:58----------
and then I learned something later


---------18:59----------
that's like oh you were actually wrong


---------19:01----------
there too it's like wow I was such an


---------19:03----------
idiot for even like hoping yeah so that


---------19:06----------
actually does sound very related


---------19:08----------
and just as you tie those two things


---------19:10----------
together right because what I'm hearing


---------19:11----------
from you is that you have learned that


---------19:15----------
your confidence and your perception of


---------19:18----------
acceptability turns out to be false yeah


---------19:21----------
but that too so I want you to notice


---------19:23----------
this that is very selective would--they


---------19:25----------
that's selective reasoning same or good


---------19:30----------
in the place where I'm at I don't even


---------19:33----------
see it exactly right so like that's so


---------19:37----------
so if we just think about you know a can


---------19:39----------
a five year old appropriately judge the


---------19:44----------
intentions and quality of friendship


---------19:47----------
that an eight-year-old offers absolutely


---------19:52----------
not it's [ __ ] absurd five-year-olds


---------19:55----------
will get owned day after day after day


---------19:58----------
by eight-year-olds going on yeah


---------20:01----------
literally like you just you do not even


---------20:03----------
have your you're playing it's like


---------20:05----------
you're playing a game without a


---------20:06----------
controller it's like Shrek


---------20:09----------
it's like Shrek how little kids can


---------20:10----------
watch Shrek and all these jokes just go


---------20:13----------
way over like absolutely awareness and


---------20:17----------
so Shrek is running circles around


---------20:18----------
little kids yeah and and yet so even


---------20:22----------
when we stop and think about that but


---------20:24----------
like that's not how you see yourself


---------20:26----------
right you you have a standard that you


---------20:28----------
should have known better you shouldn't


---------20:30----------
have let him take advantage of you


---------20:31----------
yeah in a sense what you're doing is not


---------20:34----------
you're being unacceptable towards


---------20:37----------
yourself like you are not accepting who


---------20:40----------
you are


---------20:42----------
Yeah right and and I think that that's


---------20:45----------
the Crocs so we're talking about other


---------20:47----------
people not accepting you and and where


---------20:49----------
the feeling of unacceptance comes from I


---------20:51----------
think wherever it comes from


---------20:53----------
and certainly reinforced by yourself or


---------20:56----------
propagated actually by yourself


---------20:58----------
I think the linchpin here is that you


---------21:00----------
don't accept who you are it's not about


---------21:02----------
actually showing people so it's actually


---------21:05----------
funny because you kind of think other


---------21:07----------
people can't see the real me but what it


---------21:09----------
really is that is that you don't think


---------21:10----------
that the real you is worth showing


---------21:15----------
because you or you aren't okay that's


---------21:18----------
why you have to filter because you're


---------21:22----------
tainted I agree I agree with everything


---------21:26----------
on a visceral level except the phrase


---------21:28----------
that I don't think the real me is worth


---------21:30----------
showing it's like I I think maybe what


---------21:32----------
feels more correct is that I've already


---------21:35----------
looked and I know it's not good enough


---------21:37----------
kind of thing so it's not that it's


---------21:38----------
worth showing it's just that I know what


---------21:40----------
I'm gonna show and it's not what it


---------21:43----------
needs to be actually the the thing that


---------21:46----------
clicked for me yesterday I was talking


---------21:48----------
to a good friend and a guru and he was


---------21:52----------
kind of asking about when I chose to


---------21:58----------
look at myself that way when I chose to


---------22:00----------
not be acceptable to myself and that


---------22:05----------
does seem like the original that seems


---------22:09----------
like that thing that persists like yeah


---------22:11----------
my own yeah god I I completely agree I


---------22:13----------
mean I think this is propagated by you


---------22:15----------
right so now we have to understand so


---------22:17----------
even though Bobby this is this causes


---------22:19----------
you suffering this is how this whole


---------22:22----------
complex is based to protect you yeah


---------22:25----------
because if you believe that you are


---------22:27----------
unacceptable then you can't then other


---------22:30----------
if other people then you have to filter


---------22:32----------
because if they see what's unacceptable


---------22:34----------
it's gonna be a no brainer they're going


---------22:36----------
to reject you but this really comes down


---------22:39----------
to where so two things right so one is


---------22:42----------
where that belief comes from and when


---------22:45----------
you started to build your life around


---------22:47----------
that belief


---------22:50----------
early so now I'm gonna ask you when you


---------22:53----------
feel this way at work like when you feel


---------22:55----------
like the rejection is inevitable it's


---------22:59----------
gonna be kind of a weird abstract


---------23:00----------
question that may not sense how old are


---------23:02----------
you actually my sense of internal


---------23:07----------
structure collapses so absolutely I


---------23:10----------
think I must be so young cuz I don't


---------23:12----------
even have a sense of like my physical


---------23:15----------
body absolute yeah it makes perfect


---------23:17----------
sense so I think what you are that's a


---------23:19----------
good practice I mean I just want to


---------23:21----------
share that because I think it would be


---------23:22----------
helpful for others like if you notice


---------23:24----------
that sometimes you feel like you have


---------23:25----------
structure and sometimes if you track


---------23:29----------
that sometimes you feel like you have


---------23:30----------
literally no structure like that's I


---------23:32----------
think really meaningful cuz that's the


---------23:33----------
thing that really clicked for me is it I


---------23:35----------
have a sense of my structure right now


---------23:38----------
talking to you yeah but when I think


---------23:39----------
about being at work I actually don't


---------23:41----------
even yeah so I don't have a body so when


---------23:45----------
a some scar activates it returns your


---------23:48----------
mind to the age at which it was formed


---------23:50----------
mm-hmm so uh and so I think what's


---------23:55----------
happening is like a four or five year


---------23:57----------
old doesn't really have a sense of


---------23:58----------
internal structure right they don't so I


---------24:01----------
think what's happening is like you're


---------24:02----------
revoking these thoughts or feelings that


---------24:04----------
come from there they don't actually come


---------24:07----------
from the here and now they come from the


---------24:08----------
past yeah and so I'll just give you


---------24:14----------
another example so I was I was working


---------24:16----------
with someone and they had a lot of


---------24:18----------
social anxiety and we were talking


---------24:22----------
through like what that meant for that


---------24:24----------
like what that felt like for them and


---------24:26----------
and then you know like I kept on asking


---------24:28----------
questions and like he was just unable to


---------24:30----------
give me any kind of sophisticated


---------24:31----------
answers like I was asking like what's


---------24:34----------
the feeling and he's like I don't really


---------24:35----------
know like what's the you know so then we


---------24:37----------
were talking about so he wanted to get


---------24:39----------
it he wanted to get a job but he felt


---------24:41----------
embarrassed to go into like a place and


---------24:45----------
ask for an application for a job and as


---------24:48----------
we talked to like how irrational that is


---------24:50----------
like it didn't really make a dent and so


---------24:52----------
then like eventually like we got to like


---------24:55----------
I pushed him and I pushed him and I


---------24:56----------
pushed him in his responses I just don't


---------24:58----------
wanna


---------25:00----------
yeah and that's it right it's not


---------25:04----------
complicated it's not like Freudian there


---------25:08----------
isn't this deep subconscious conflict


---------25:10----------
it's just somewhere along the way when


---------25:13----------
he interacts with people when his mind


---------25:15----------
formed this idea I just don't want him


---------25:17----------
it's like not even a fully formed like


---------25:20----------
grammatically correct sentence the core


---------25:23----------
of it is I just don't wanna and that's


---------25:25----------
actually enough that can be the end of


---------25:27----------
the road yeah and the interesting thing


---------25:30----------
is he's doing way better now because


---------25:32----------
like now he realizes that like in him


---------25:34----------
there's a part of his mind that is just


---------25:36----------
not gonna want to do something and you


---------25:37----------
can't make sense of it it's not some


---------25:40----------
deep subconscious conflict there's no


---------25:42----------
oedipal want to sleep with your mom and


---------25:45----------
knock out your dad or like any of these


---------25:47----------
deep complicated stories it's just


---------25:48----------
within him there's a seven-year-old who


---------25:52----------
just didn't want to go to school because


---------25:53----------
he was bullied and he didn't want to put


---------25:55----------
himself in front of people and he just


---------25:57----------
doesn't wanna that's it it's the end of


---------25:59----------
it yeah there's nothing to unpack


---------26:01----------
there's nothing to explore that's it and


---------26:05----------
he carries that seed of I just don't


---------26:07----------
wanna with him all the time and there


---------26:10----------
are times where that seed emerges like


---------26:13----------
most of the time like he's able to do


---------26:15----------
things with his friends and stuff like


---------26:16----------
that I mean he actually does want to do


---------26:18----------
things he does want to get a job he


---------26:20----------
wants to get a job at particular places


---------26:21----------
he thinks the people who weren't there


---------26:22----------
cool he'd like to work there he thinks


---------26:24----------
it would be fun to work there and when


---------26:26----------
he thinks about walking up to them and


---------26:27----------
asking them for a job application via I


---------26:30----------
just don't when he gets a case of the I


---------26:32----------
just don't want us and that's the some


---------26:35----------
scar that activates and the real


---------26:38----------
challenge here is that people think so


---------26:40----------
like Bobby you think this is you right


---------26:43----------
you operate under the assumption that


---------26:45----------
this is who you are like your conclusion


---------26:49----------
so you don't treat this as like an


---------26:50----------
external thing you treat this as you


---------26:52----------
yeah so so he just feels like he's a


---------26:56----------
lazy [ __ ] because he's got a part of


---------26:59----------
him that just doesn't wanna and he


---------27:01----------
identifies with that he doesn't


---------27:03----------
understand that that is just a some scar


---------27:05----------
that activates from time to time and if


---------27:07----------
you actually look at your life that you


---------27:11----------
are valued by many people


---------27:14----------
that he's appreciated and loved and


---------27:15----------
people think he's cool and funny and


---------27:17----------
also physically and sexually attractive


---------27:19----------
and and like all kinds of stuff that he


---------27:22----------
just like to do that I just don't want


---------27:23----------
is is not able to hold that and so in


---------27:26----------
your case I mean you say that you have


---------27:28----------
all this kind of conflict and that


---------27:29----------
you're unacceptable and that you've


---------27:30----------
gotten really really good at filtering


---------27:32----------
yourself which is probably how you


---------27:34----------
rationalize your success but it sounds


---------27:38----------
like you have a kid and you're married


---------27:40----------
and you have friends and you have


---------27:41----------
meaningful relationships and also you've


---------27:43----------
you've held a job for years and so


---------27:46----------
you're not so abrasive or toxic that


---------27:49----------
they fired you which they do and so like


---------27:52----------
let's just think about that for a second


---------27:54----------
are you so good at filtering that you


---------27:58----------
have fooled all of these people so the


---------28:06----------
way that I rationalize it is actually


---------28:10----------
with a sense of duty and responsibility


---------28:12----------
to the other people who feel the way


---------28:15----------
that I feel I think somewhere along the


---------28:17----------
line I got the sense that I wasn't alone


---------28:19----------
in feeling I was unacceptable I think


---------28:21----------
that this is important because I think


---------28:22----------
that I actually grew like this separate


---------28:24----------
part with that belief in other words I


---------28:28----------
don't necessarily rational at in other


---------28:30----------
words if you ask me why I think I'm


---------28:31----------
successful I would say that like I get


---------28:33----------
it I get the struggle I build products


---------28:35----------
for the people who had the struggle that


---------28:37----------
I have hmm not everybody has the


---------28:39----------
struggle that I have and I I don't think


---------28:42----------
that I'm better than them at all I just


---------28:43----------
think that if you haven't gone to this


---------28:45----------
deep dark place awful all that stuff and


---------28:48----------
you haven't really looked around you


---------28:50----------
don't get how sensitive it is as a


---------28:51----------
four-year-old as a five-year-old as a


---------28:53----------
seven-year-old and so when I'm building


---------28:55----------
products I'm holding the four or five


---------28:57----------
six seven year olds and all of us like


---------28:59----------
in that design a beautiful feel that


---------29:01----------
like do you know that was that's I with


---------29:04----------
you so that's your daughter mine that's


---------29:05----------
your karma so this is how karma and


---------29:08----------
karma relate there's AI so related yeah


---------29:10----------
it's crazy so explain that to us


---------29:25----------
so I've had experiences in my life that


---------29:29----------
have been painful they haven't killed me


---------29:33----------
and for a long time I thought I was


---------29:38----------
alone in that and that really hurt and


---------29:41----------
so I know how much hurt there is in that


---------29:43----------
feeling and because I know how much hurt


---------29:46----------
there is I know how important it is to


---------29:48----------
tend to that and how hungry people are


---------29:52----------
for that kind of tending and that kind


---------29:54----------
of attention oh I know that you know


---------29:57----------
through that negative experience I have


---------29:59----------
something that you know later on I don't


---------30:03----------
know how it happened inside me but I


---------30:04----------
decided that we're not alone and I can


---------30:07----------
do something about it


---------30:08----------
and if I never had the experiences if I


---------30:11----------
never had if I didn't have the Karma if


---------30:13----------
I wasn't led to the place where I where


---------30:15----------
I was where I made that decision that


---------30:16----------
that's the thing that I'm gonna fix then


---------30:19----------
you know I could never have the the duty


---------30:21----------
and responsibility to do it so perfect


---------30:24----------
right so your karma even your hurt and


---------30:27----------
your suffering yeah set you up to do


---------30:31----------
your duty or responsibility you made you


---------30:34----------
the person that you are and without


---------30:35----------
those experiences you would not be able


---------30:37----------
to have hurt and suffering at the


---------30:40----------
forefront of creating products for like


---------30:42----------
creating stuff at which yeah exactly


---------30:44----------
right which is kind of bizarre because


---------30:46----------
when you think about product developers


---------30:48----------
at twitch I don't think that that's the


---------30:51----------
kind of thing that they would be


---------30:52----------
thinking about but I think if you know


---------30:54----------
you've been at twitch for six years into


---------30:55----------
which is done very well over the last


---------30:57----------
six years I think part of the reason is


---------30:59----------
because you're keeping something really


---------31:01----------
like like deeply spiritual for lack of a


---------31:04----------
better term I mean I just call it


---------31:05----------
spiritual but maybe psychological


---------31:07----------
whatever at the forefront of the work


---------31:10----------
that you do and it doesn't surprise me


---------31:11----------
that you're successful there so at the


---------31:15----------
same time I feel right is it part of the


---------31:18----------
exact same narrative where it's like hey


---------31:19----------
this is the thing that I'm doing and it


---------31:21----------
works and you will never you write to


---------31:23----------
others the people who will find me


---------31:25----------
unacceptable you'll never believe me and


---------31:27----------
never let me do the work that I feel I


---------31:28----------
have to do that's where the conflict


---------31:30----------
comes in and where I yeah so you start


---------31:32----------
to control and have that shakes of hurts


---------31:35----------
were


---------31:36----------
good so let's talk about that so the


---------31:38----------
first thing is that I think that these


---------31:40----------
things are not actually like related I


---------31:42----------
think the Dharma and karma is sort of a


---------31:45----------
genuine sense of who you are and I think


---------31:48----------
the unacceptability like the Dharma is


---------31:51----------
what lets you tolerate and get away with


---------31:53----------
your feelings of unacceptability but I


---------31:56----------
don't believe for a second that having


---------31:58----------
the Dharma that you have makes people


---------32:01----------
like you and then if you've been


---------32:03----------
successful at twitch for six years and


---------32:05----------
you've managed to get married and you


---------32:06----------
have friends and stuff like that that


---------32:07----------
human beings are pretty good at like


---------32:10----------
judging other human beings and that


---------32:13----------
there's something that they see in you


---------32:15----------
that they actually do wholeheartedly


---------32:17----------
accept otherwise because here's the


---------32:20----------
thing you're abrasive right yeah it


---------32:26----------
depends it depends on if I feels it up


---------32:28----------
so let's let's just say yes let's just


---------32:30----------
say yes and so just think about this for


---------32:32----------
a second if for someone who's as


---------32:33----------
abrasive as you are they sure as hell


---------32:38----------
have to accept something deep within you


---------32:41----------
to have to like work with you on a


---------32:42----------
day-to-day basis yeah


---------32:51----------
right yeah I am very different yeah in


---------32:55----------
context but uh-huh but I think


---------32:57----------
ultimately like I have to agree I mean I


---------32:59----------
think you're what what is my sense I


---------33:02----------
have this sense that the you know I'm


---------33:04----------
not acceptable the people who accept me


---------33:05----------
anyway those are the safe people the


---------33:07----------
people who don't those are the unsafe


---------33:08----------
people that's kind of how I've


---------33:09----------
rationalized it there's some people who


---------33:12----------
can eat who can accept someone even like


---------33:14----------
me yeah so I think that that makes sense


---------33:19----------
I don't think that that's really a


---------33:21----------
rationalization I think that's actually


---------33:22----------
just an accurate observation that for


---------33:24----------
with some people they you know you you


---------33:27----------
have the perception that you show them


---------33:29----------
the real Bobby and they accept you and


---------33:31----------
therefore they're safe and that there's


---------33:33----------
a larger camp of people who can't you


---------33:35----------
can't let them see the real Bobby


---------33:36----------
because they won't accept you in and


---------33:38----------
then you're like abrasive and combative


---------33:40----------
and you don't understand why they don't


---------33:41----------
understand what you're trying to tell


---------33:43----------
them and stuff like that and it sounds


---------33:44----------
like actually in some ways you're hard


---------33:46----------
to work with yeah that's probably true


---------33:48----------
yeah and the bizarre thing is that sure


---------33:51----------
that that's true I'm sure yeah that's


---------33:52----------
true and the bizarre thing is is that


---------33:54----------
only what to do about it


---------33:55----------
yeah we'll get to that yeah so but the


---------33:57----------
bizarre thing is that if we really look


---------33:59----------
at your situation if you have an


---------34:01----------
abrasive person who people continue to


---------34:03----------
work with rather than them being


---------34:05----------
unacceptable their acceptability has to


---------34:08----------
be way higher because your abrasiveness


---------34:09----------
is making it like harder to deal with


---------34:11----------
you sure yeah so in a really weird way I


---------34:15----------
think like the safe people are way


---------34:17----------
larger that that group is way larger


---------34:19----------
than you realize yeah so I think you're


---------34:25----------
right about that yeah yeah so now the


---------34:30----------
question is like where do we go from


---------34:31----------
here okay so the first is I want you to


---------34:34----------
recognize that you know as we start to


---------34:37----------
think those kinds of thoughts that runs


---------34:39----------
contrary to the perception and


---------34:42----------
construction that you've made


---------34:44----------
right we just say your perception is


---------34:47----------
that you're unacceptable on the inside


---------34:49----------
and through a lot of lot of surface


---------34:51----------
level filtering you can create an


---------34:54----------
appearance of acceptability but what I'm


---------34:56----------
actually hearing is quite the opposite


---------34:58----------
is that on the outside you can sometimes


---------35:00----------
be difficult and abrasive so you're not


---------35:03----------
creating anything like the filter you're


---------35:04----------
actually creating like a negative filter


---------35:06----------
not a positive filter and despite


---------35:08----------
despite the negative filter that you're


---------35:10----------
putting out in terms of your


---------35:11----------
abrasiveness and your you know internal


---------35:13----------
sense of your unacceptability people are


---------35:16----------
able to see through that [ __ ] and


---------35:18----------
still value working with you in some


---------35:19----------
capacity yeah my real sense actually so


---------35:22----------
I have the sense that I'm acceptable


---------35:24----------
deep deep down but no one will ever ever


---------35:26----------
know it like whatever however I talk


---------35:28----------
however I interface with the rest of the


---------35:30----------
world I in other words like there's some


---------35:32----------
gold deep down but there's so much [ __ ]


---------35:34----------
between the gold which is me or whatever


---------35:38----------
that no one will ever see the good


---------35:41----------
alright that's the struggle that I live


---------35:43----------
with every day okay no deep down there's


---------35:45----------
value and then I want to help and then


---------35:48----------
if I if only I didn't if only I wasn't


---------35:50----------
such a problem that stuff could get out


---------35:54----------
into the world so makes perfect sense


---------35:58----------
okay so what I'm hearing is so I'm gonna


---------36:00----------
ask you a question when so tell me about


---------36:03----------
if you remember anything about when


---------36:07----------
someone didn't dig through the [ __ ] and


---------36:09----------
find the gold when they looked inside


---------36:11----------
you you opened the doors and they just


---------36:13----------
saw a sea of [ __ ] and they like ran away


---------36:18----------
I remember feeling misunderstood as a


---------36:25----------
kid where so okay I have a really strong


---------36:27----------
memory I don't know if I brought it up


---------36:28----------
where it was a Sunday and I was playing


---------36:30----------
with my cousin's did I bring that memory


---------36:31----------
up mmm-hmm


---------36:32----------
I was having so much fun it was the kind


---------36:35----------
of childish joyas fun where you know the


---------36:37----------
whole rest of the world is gone and


---------36:38----------
you're just where you are and then on


---------36:40----------
Monday it turned out that I had homework


---------36:43----------
that I was supposed to do and I just you


---------36:45----------
know I had you know my pant I was called


---------36:46----------
my pants down and this is maybe the


---------36:49----------
third time that I forgot to do homework


---------36:50----------
or something like that and I remember


---------36:52----------
really getting the riot act or whatever


---------36:54----------
that really being like hey you you've


---------36:56----------
got a problem here and this cannot


---------36:58----------
happen anymore


---------36:58----------
and so it's kind of recontextualizing


---------37:00----------
that joy is fun with right like whoo


---------37:04----------
baby the riot couldn't my parents and I


---------37:08----------
think the teacher was like not not


---------37:09----------
particularly happy okay I remember one


---------37:12----------
time very clearly I was in fourth grade


---------37:14----------
I remember it so well that something


---------37:17----------
happened the teacher said something and


---------37:18----------
like I was actually listening to them


---------37:20----------
but I think I was doing it in an


---------37:21----------
abrasive way where it was kind of a


---------37:23----------
know-it-all way and I actually got


---------37:25----------
punished just for clarifying like what


---------37:28----------
the teacher had said because I knew that


---------37:29----------
somebody else didn't understand what


---------37:31----------
they said and I just felt like what the


---------37:34----------
f you know I'm actually trying to help


---------37:36----------
you do your job and I'm getting punished


---------37:38----------
like that makes him no sense hmm so it's


---------37:42----------
almost thought I was supposed to do and


---------37:44----------
I'm getting punished for what I'm


---------37:45----------
supposed to do yeah so what I'm hearing


---------37:47----------
is that you offered your gold and they


---------37:49----------
perceived it as [ __ ] yeah yeah I feel


---------37:53----------
like when I would think back to my


---------37:55----------
childhood there was a lot of mixed


---------37:56----------
messages like there's a lot of times


---------37:58----------
when I would be in trouble for no reason


---------37:59----------
like maybe my dad would be having a bad


---------38:01----------
day and he was just stressed and I did I


---------38:03----------
couldn't understand that he was just


---------38:05----------
venting can you tell me about your dad


---------38:08----------
yeah my dad I think that if people knew


---------38:11----------
my dad it would make so much sense out


---------38:14----------
of me he he's so okay he's like


---------38:22----------
basically always the coolest guy in the


---------38:23----------
room


---------38:25----------
he's a shorter Italian guy that he's


---------38:27----------
five seven or something like that you


---------38:29----------
know it's like a he doesn't look like


---------38:31----------
Joe Pesci at all you know he's skinnier


---------38:33----------
and stuff he's more about tough for sure


---------38:35----------
but you know I'm he tells a story where


---------38:38----------
he went to a party one time and a woman


---------38:41----------
said to him like who are you like I


---------38:44----------
you're somebody right and he was like I


---------38:46----------
could have been somebody kind of thing


---------38:48----------
and he definitely like yeah he runs the


---------38:53----------
show it was very clear for like the


---------38:55----------
whole extended family he's like the


---------38:56----------
patron by their own and he is very


---------39:01----------
vocally critical about kind of like


---------39:04----------
anybody being lazy or not pulling their


---------39:06----------
weight or whatever


---------39:07----------
and so he kind of uses humor but he's


---------39:09----------
using humor to kind of keep everybody in


---------39:11----------
check and that makes sense


---------39:13----------
he's like policing and what do you think


---------39:17----------
that what you say you said earlier that


---------39:19----------
if people like knew my dad they they'd


---------39:21----------
understand you better how does that help


---------39:23----------
us understand you I've said it I said


---------39:28----------
I've said it for a long time but I don't


---------39:30----------
necessarily know that I thought about


---------39:31----------
why I think it sure why do I think it


---------39:35----------
yeah what does that tell you about what


---------39:39----------
does that tell us about you well I've


---------39:42----------
got his blood in me and also I grew up


---------39:45----------
as you know under his kind of power and


---------39:48----------
authority and if you see the way that he


---------39:51----------
acts you'll you'll sense a tremendous


---------39:54----------
amount of stress and anxiety as well as


---------39:56----------
like a loud kind of personality


---------39:58----------
what what what does in what way does he


---------40:01----------
act that makes you feel stress and


---------40:03----------
anxiety I he feels a lot of stress and


---------40:06----------
anxiety like I think that all of his


---------40:08----------
external stuff is just dealing with his


---------40:11----------
internal state you know the the fact


---------40:13----------
that like his body system is telling him


---------40:15----------
like like flooding him all the time with


---------40:18----------
like threat signals or whatever okay I


---------40:20----------
feel definitely consistently overwhelmed


---------40:23----------
by like my body telling me that like


---------40:24----------
there's something really wrong


---------40:27----------
hmmm I think he does too what is your


---------40:33----------
body telling you is wrong now sure the


---------40:43----------
world's the world's in a bad spot we got


---------40:45----------
to do something okay


---------40:47----------
there's people suffering I think it's


---------40:49----------
60% of people are lonely in America so


---------40:52----------
it's like two out of three or something


---------40:53----------
like that I don't know some crazy number


---------40:55----------
and you feel that in your body I can


---------40:59----------
yeah what does that feel like a


---------41:03----------
tightness in my chest like a kind of


---------41:09----------
burning focus it's a sense of like fire


---------41:14----------
and it's like the laser beam right it's


---------41:18----------
a strong focused energy in a direction


---------41:22----------
and it comes with kind of like an


---------41:24----------
impatience mm-hm and a an anger around


---------41:29----------
why isn't anybody looking at this I kind


---------41:31----------
of feel that a lot yeah my dad told me


---------41:34----------
his dad was actually a union organizer


---------41:35----------
so not a union leader or whatever but he


---------41:38----------
was the guy who's in the factory saying


---------41:39----------
like what are we doing


---------41:40----------
yeah these guys are making all the money


---------41:42----------
and we're getting screwed like what are


---------41:44----------
we doing and he was so nuts about it


---------41:46----------
that he actually [ __ ] writes founded


---------41:49----------
a union yeah it's like that kind of feel


---------41:54----------
I feel like I've got that in me you know


---------41:56----------
absolutely you do that's bit that I


---------41:59----------
learned that very late in life


---------42:00----------
by the way what is it that's bit tough


---------42:03----------
yeah yeah I feel like I've got all five


---------42:06----------
tried no [ __ ] that's how I feel but yeah


---------42:09----------
well you're primarily about that pizza


---------42:10----------
so I'm sure I mean everyone has some


---------42:13----------
degree of dough shows but if you have a


---------42:15----------
fair amount of color in your face for


---------42:17----------
example and then you know we also see


---------42:19----------
that you know you're you're irritable


---------42:20----------
abrasive driven focused all bit negative


---------42:23----------
attributes and yeah so Bobby I think um


---------42:29----------
yeah you're right you know when you talk


---------42:34----------
about your dad I certainly think that


---------42:37----------
that's significant but I'm still a


---------42:38----------
little bit curious about


---------42:40----------
how he contributed to you becoming the


---------42:44----------
person that you are


---------42:45----------
he thought I was he was stressed all the


---------42:49----------
time that I was not gonna make it I


---------42:51----------
remember him walking around just being


---------42:53----------
like this kids not gonna make he's just


---------42:57----------
not gonna make it I'm not gonna this


---------42:59----------
kids not gonna make it I remember he


---------43:00----------
would say it is not a one-time thing he


---------43:02----------
would say that a lot just like throwing


---------43:03----------
his hands up ahead this kids not gonna


---------43:06----------
make it I can't protect it what is what


---------43:08----------
does that do to you what is it was that


---------43:10----------
do to a kid something yeah especially


---------43:23----------
when I felt deep deep deep down that


---------43:27----------
that was not correct right it's this


---------43:29----------
feeling of there's something down here


---------43:31----------
that he can't see and nothing I [ __ ]


---------43:34----------
do will ever change that


---------43:37----------
right yeah how could it be that there


---------43:42----------
actually is something good here and he


---------43:44----------
can't see it like he's my you know I


---------43:45----------
mean how could it be like there must be


---------43:48----------
something so wrong in the rest of me


---------43:51----------
that that's what it feels like right


---------43:53----------
yeah so what have we been talking about


---------43:56----------
for the past 30 or 40 minutes we've been


---------44:00----------
talking about this absolutely yeah


---------44:03----------
the time about the sense that like


---------44:04----------
there's something so so a lot of things


---------44:07----------
are clicking right so you said that


---------44:09----------
there are a couple things one is that he


---------44:11----------
can't see it and all he sees is you


---------44:14----------
[ __ ] up and forgetting your homework


---------44:16----------
and he also lets you know whatever it is


---------44:19----------
like random stuff yeah so so in that


---------44:22----------
that's actually a significant detail


---------44:23----------
because it's not so if it's just one


---------44:26----------
thing then you end up with some scar


---------44:28----------
that you're bad at homework you're like


---------44:29----------
oh man I suck at school or I'm not good


---------44:30----------
at setting no but in the clouds right


---------44:33----------
that kind of thing like but it's so it's


---------44:39----------
it's it's multi-dimensional for him


---------44:41----------
which also means that you're not


---------44:43----------
unacceptable in one way you're


---------44:45----------
unacceptable in every way


---------44:47----------
yes generalized yet yes and then there's


---------44:50----------
also something subtle which you kind of


---------44:52----------
mention some time ago which we haven't


---------44:54----------
explored but there's something that


---------44:56----------
bothers you about people who clearly


---------45:00----------
you're not acceptable but they have to


---------45:02----------
love you anyway mm-hmm and that sounds


---------45:06----------
like I mean it sound you know take that


---------45:10----------
statement out of context from half an


---------45:11----------
hour ago and plug it in here it fits


---------45:13----------
perfectly because we're talking about of


---------45:15----------
all people your dad mm-hmm yeah and it's


---------45:20----------
kind of like I guess I had the sense


---------45:21----------
that other people we're kind of faking


---------45:24----------
it mm-hmm yeah of course so that I think


---------45:29----------
is also completely rational for a young


---------45:31----------
kid because you trust your parents and


---------45:34----------
you you sort of set your compass like


---------45:36----------
you set the gold standard based on how


---------45:39----------
your parents treat you and if the rest


---------45:41----------
of the world is congruent with that


---------45:43----------
that's fantastic and if it's not you


---------45:46----------
don't accept the rest of the world and I


---------45:48----------
see this a lot actually in cases of


---------45:50----------
abuse where like when a child is taught


---------45:52----------
that they're a piece of [ __ ] and then


---------45:53----------
like like when they're adults and like


---------45:55----------
people treat them with love and care and


---------45:57----------
respect how do you think they respond no


---------46:01----------
well why not really you kind of can't


---------46:05----------
believe it right yeah absolutely come up


---------46:07----------
with a story that makes it not the


---------46:09----------
simple truth absent just be that's


---------46:12----------
perfect


---------46:12----------
it's [ __ ] confusing and bewildering


---------46:15----------
to them they do not understand it that's


---------46:17----------
all it's so confusing yeah and so then


---------46:22----------
what they do is is they they start doing


---------46:24----------
all kinds of weird acting out behaviors


---------46:26----------
to align the relationship with what they


---------46:30----------
believe about themselves Yeah right so


---------46:34----------
they start doing things that drive their


---------46:36----------
partners like I'm just thinking about


---------46:38----------
romantic situations where like someone


---------46:40----------
is genuinely like loved and cared for by


---------46:42----------
another person and that's so confusing


---------46:43----------
for them so they start doing things that


---------46:45----------
shift the relationship towards something


---------46:48----------
that they like or familiar with which


---------46:51----------
actually is to try to incite their


---------46:53----------
partner to like get angry with them or


---------46:55----------
sometimes even like try to get them to


---------46:58----------
be physically abusive I've worked with


---------47:01----------
someone who literally would like just


---------47:03----------
attack their partner because they wanted


---------47:05----------
their partner to like beat the [ __ ] out


---------47:06----------
of them


---------47:07----------
and the partner just wouldn't do it and


---------47:10----------
it was just really really confusing and


---------47:12----------
it took some time to untangle but it's


---------47:14----------
wild like what people will do like they


---------47:16----------
want to play the game that they know how


---------47:18----------
to play yeah


---------47:20----------
and so the funny thing is that if we


---------47:23----------
want to get really sort of you know


---------47:24----------
loose associations what do you do at


---------47:28----------
work yeah


---------47:33----------
[Music]


---------47:38----------
you


---------47:41----------
okay how do I have an original idea


---------47:43----------
about this right now because as you


---------47:45----------
asked that question I know I've said


---------47:47----------
things along these lines about my


---------47:49----------
behavior and reflection in the past in


---------47:51----------
other words I'm kind of don't mean you


---------47:55----------
don't give me the answer that I don't


---------47:57----------
give me the answer that I want don't


---------47:59----------
give me the right answer answer give me


---------48:00----------
your answer the one that pops into my


---------48:04----------
head when I look at my own behavior is


---------48:05----------
like I'm trying so hard to get the gold


---------48:07----------
out and I kind of go up to bed and but I


---------48:09----------
do it in this way that's self-defeating


---------48:11----------
you know absolutely do it in a way where


---------48:14----------
and I'm not but the thing is that I feel


---------48:16----------
very blind to what is happening in the


---------48:18----------
middle you know as do they but if you're


---------48:23----------
[ __ ] abrasive at work you're driving


---------48:26----------
them towards unaccepting yeah


---------48:32----------
yeah you're trying to make them feel


---------48:34----------
about you the way that you feel about


---------48:35----------
yourself because then the world makes


---------48:37----------
sense and then on the flip side you're


---------48:39----------
trying to do the exact opposite because


---------48:40----------
you're paranoid and you're fighting and


---------48:42----------
you're conflicted and that's why I like


---------48:43----------
it sounds like you're in a state of


---------48:44----------
semi-conscious constant torture yeah


---------48:49----------
yeah sounds awful with yeah that's not


---------48:54----------
yeah it's not fun it's definitely not


---------48:56----------
fun so I mean I you know I don't know I


---------49:00----------
mean I think personally it's a little


---------49:01----------
bit of a stretch to think that you're


---------49:03----------
really sort of subconsciously kind of


---------49:05----------
driving people towards being unaccepting


---------49:08----------
that's the kind of you know


---------49:09----------
psychoanalysis level [ __ ] that I


---------49:12----------
normally call [ __ ] on so I think


---------49:16----------
what I do right is like I'll go into an


---------49:18----------
interaction I don't think I start as


---------49:20----------
abrasive necessarily but maybe I do


---------49:22----------
honestly when I feel more like it's a


---------49:26----------
powerful person or a person with power I


---------49:28----------
am worse that's for sure so let me ask


---------49:33----------
you something if someone starts to


---------49:34----------
accept your ideas is generally accepting


---------49:37----------
your ideas how do you feel


---------49:43----------
I think a little bit desperate see this


---------49:47----------
is weird right so this makes perfect


---------49:50----------
sense this is consistent with our


---------49:51----------
hypothesis because what's actually


---------49:53----------
happening is you are getting accepted


---------49:55----------
they're actually accepting your ideas


---------49:58----------
and then you get confused and then you


---------50:03----------
get desperate why don't they get


---------50:05----------
desperate it's like it's like it's


---------50:06----------
there's a thing here that I've that I'm


---------50:08----------
want so badly and like I can't let it


---------50:11----------
get away kind of thing and so what do


---------50:14----------
you do in your interactions with them


---------50:19----------
like dump absolutely dump what does that


---------50:23----------
mean


---------50:25----------
so there's basically it's like a damn


---------50:29----------
there's like a damn of all these things


---------50:31----------
that I've wanted to share with people


---------50:33----------
for years and years and years and so you


---------50:35----------
know it's like I feel like no one is


---------50:38----------
ever gonna listen sort of thing because


---------50:39----------
of because I suck and so if I sense that


---------50:42----------
someone is listening it's like that dam


---------50:44----------
just blows open and all of there's so


---------50:48----------
much that I want to say and it's very


---------50:50----------
very overwhelming and disorganized and


---------50:52----------
then how do they respond like they're


---------50:56----------
overwhelmed and have no idea and then


---------50:59----------
what does that do to the size of your


---------51:01----------
dam well I think once the good comes out


---------51:08----------
and it runs them over like if they


---------51:12----------
haven't received it properly then the


---------51:14----------
angry starts to come out actually sure


---------51:16----------
and then I think the next day what you


---------51:18----------
do is you build your dam higher yeah for


---------51:22----------
the next person yeah first absolutely


---------51:24----------
right so now we're seeing like like this


---------51:27----------
is all kind of tied together because


---------51:29----------
like what happens is when you get a


---------51:30----------
little bit of acceptance yeah you flood


---------51:33----------
them with it and so then what happens is


---------51:35----------
like you get back to this kind of idea


---------51:37----------
that like you're reinforcing this idea


---------51:39----------
that you're like they're not gonna


---------51:40----------
accept what you have then you have to


---------51:41----------
build the walls higher yeah and actually


---------51:44----------
to be honest it's like it's it starts


---------51:47----------
from the prenup in other words even when


---------51:48----------
I interact with people it's like I start


---------51:50----------
from the premise that they're not gonna


---------51:52----------
accept me and maybe if they accept


---------51:54----------
things it'll be because of my resume and


---------51:56----------
because of the quality because so I


---------51:57----------
focused the whole conversation on these


---------51:59----------
things that I'm not even sure they when


---------52:01----------
I'm talking with you I'm not sure if


---------52:03----------
anybody cares about okay so it's kind of


---------52:07----------
like I'm preparing a case for why they


---------52:10----------
should say I'm preparing a case yeah I


---------52:13----------
understand I killed somebody you know it


---------52:15----------
so you'd but then on the other hand look


---------52:16----------
at all these good things and me I'm on


---------52:18----------
the balance you can get over you know


---------52:20----------
this dam because of all this stuff over


---------52:23----------
here so Bobby might


---------52:28----------
I'm gonna try to offer so first of all


---------52:31----------
let's just take a step back because I'd


---------52:32----------
like to offer you something kind of


---------52:34----------
concrete which I hope will let you move


---------52:37----------
forward in a like a at least one serious


---------52:40----------
step because I'm getting the sense that


---------52:43----------
we're sort of teasing a lot of stuff


---------52:44----------
apart but I'm going I'm getting a


---------52:47----------
growing sense within me of like what do


---------52:49----------
we do about all of us yeah so first of


---------52:54----------
all help me understand what we've


---------52:57----------
covered today and and what you think


---------52:59----------
like where are we


---------53:02----------
like like recap for me what you


---------53:05----------
understood from our discussion today


---------53:10----------
give me one sec so I had not said


---------53:22----------
explicitly the part about my dad kind of


---------53:30----------
my experiences of my dad giving me the


---------53:32----------
sense that there may be something good


---------53:34----------
here but it's like no one will ever see


---------53:36----------
it and it's like there's so much in the


---------53:37----------
way that's bad I had never explicitly


---------53:39----------
said that and I think it that's super


---------53:41----------
core


---------53:43----------
aside from that I think that I'm aware


---------53:46----------
of most of what we discussed and I think


---------53:50----------
what we're talking about is kind of a


---------53:51----------
double bind where how do I put this and


---------54:03----------
I feel like that's where the sense of


---------54:04----------
what do we do about it comes from even


---------54:06----------
in Me's I've worked very very very


---------54:07----------
desperately on you know this this


---------54:10----------
problem in that I at the same time


---------54:18----------
believe that I'm good and that I'm


---------54:20----------
complete I believe that I'm like good


---------54:22----------
and complete at the same time yep and


---------54:24----------
that that causes me to act in super


---------54:27----------
confusing ways yep to myself and to


---------54:30----------
other people


---------54:31----------
absolutely is that maybe the simplest


---------54:33----------
way to put it


---------54:34----------
beautiful way to put it right so your


---------54:36----------
confusion this is a problem of confusion


---------54:40----------
this is a problem of someone who is


---------54:41----------
taught that love involves physical abuse


---------54:43----------
and then just gets [ __ ] and confused


---------54:45----------
because there's a part of them that also


---------54:47----------
realizes that they deserve


---------54:48----------
honest and authentic love that involves


---------54:51----------
no abuse and there's a part of them that


---------54:53----------
also has learned go when I look for


---------54:59----------
acceptance from my dad I think that what


---------55:03----------
the case that I want to provide is I'm


---------55:05----------
almost saying hey Dad I heard everything


---------55:07----------
that you told me and I've started from


---------55:09----------
the premise that I'm not gonna make it


---------55:11----------
and so I thought about this which is bad


---------55:13----------
and here's the answer I've right I've


---------55:15----------
mitigated this problem with myself I've


---------55:17----------
mitigated this one with myself and I


---------55:19----------
mitigated this one and that's why you


---------55:21----------
should trust me


---------55:22----------
in other words I know that I'm bad and


---------55:24----------
I've done all this work to like be


---------55:26----------
acceptable for this one moment


---------55:33----------
what do you what do you think about that


---------55:37----------
so that sounds like that's a very common


---------55:39----------
pattern in your life right have you done


---------55:44----------
that was like when you bring up the


---------55:45----------
abuse which is not my experience but


---------55:47----------
it's like I want someone to hit me so


---------55:50----------
that then right we can kind of get


---------55:53----------
closer I know that the hits gonna happen


---------55:56----------
let's just get it over with and then we


---------55:58----------
can find our way to a place where like


---------55:59----------
we can be okay with the fact that I got


---------56:02----------
hit yeah yeah so what I'm hearing is


---------56:04----------
let's just let's just here's what I'm


---------56:07----------
hearing from you in terms of like your


---------56:09----------
the premise that you're unacceptable and


---------56:11----------
damage control you're saying okay why


---------56:13----------
don't you guys just tell me I'm


---------56:14----------
incompetent to begin with so that I can


---------56:17----------
get to all of the reasons why you guys


---------56:20----------
should still value what I'm doing 100


---------56:22----------
let's just get the fact that I'm in


---------56:24----------
competence completely out of the way


---------56:25----------
let's start scale even if I'm


---------56:28----------
incompetent


---------56:28----------
I still think you guys should buy this


---------56:30----------
blender for $19.99 plus shipping and


---------56:33----------
handling if you buy one right now you're


---------56:35----------
gonna get a second one for free


---------56:36----------
that's exactly right right that's


---------56:39----------
exactly right yeah I'm the shittiest


---------56:42----------
user of a blender I cut all my fingers


---------56:44----------
off you I could blender like you should


---------56:47----------
trust me because I'm an idiot


---------56:48----------
yeah no one understands incompetent


---------56:51----------
blender customers more than me yeah so


---------56:55----------
how do we how do we get get out of this


---------57:00----------
okay so a couple of thoughts okay so the


---------57:04----------
first is you have to let go of the


---------57:06----------
premise that you're unacceptable and I


---------57:08----------
realize that's easy to say and hard to


---------57:10----------
do but the the tricky thing here is that


---------57:15----------
when you're letting go so why is it hard


---------57:18----------
to let go the premise you're


---------57:19----------
unacceptable because


---------57:22----------
it opens you up to uncertainty and


---------57:25----------
potential failure so in a weird way


---------57:27----------
you've got a game plan that involves


---------57:30----------
Bobby being unacceptable


---------57:32----------
yeah and so the problem I think which


---------57:35----------
what's really difficult is that you sort


---------57:37----------
of built a party around you know let's


---------57:42----------
say like you're playing like an RPG and


---------57:45----------
you like build a party that's like all


---------57:46----------
mages and then like you built this party


---------57:49----------
and then you've come up with the


---------57:50----------
strategy to like still win with all


---------57:52----------
mages even though all mages is like


---------57:54----------
generally speaking a terrible party but


---------57:55----------
also my favorite kind of party to play


---------57:57----------
and so I come up with these like super


---------57:59----------
convoluted strategies of like you know


---------58:01----------
spamming consumables and buying scrolls


---------58:04----------
and stuff early on in the game until my


---------58:06----------
mages actually come online and then I


---------58:08----------
[ __ ] start tearing things apart


---------58:10----------
because you can just see see and like


---------58:12----------
AoE the [ __ ] out of anything that comes


---------58:15----------
your way and this is why you're


---------58:17----------
successful because you came up with this


---------58:20----------
sort of like premise that's messed up


---------58:21----------
but then you also have a lot of faith


---------58:24----------
and when your strategy comes online yeah


---------58:27----------
and that's the bullet points right


---------58:29----------
because you're like let's call me


---------58:30----------
acceptable and let's move to the bullet


---------58:32----------
points because the bullet points like


---------58:33----------
that's when my page may just come online


---------58:35----------
and like it doesn't matter


---------58:37----------
that it doesn't matter that we can't use


---------58:39----------
swords or armor or we have no healers


---------58:42----------
you guys think that this is busted


---------58:44----------
because you think that you need a tank


---------58:46----------
and you think you need a healer but I


---------58:47----------
can show you without all this stuff with


---------58:49----------
my all mage strategy you can still do it


---------58:51----------
yeah so the really tricky thing here is


---------58:54----------
that if you abandon your premise you


---------58:56----------
also abandon your solution and you


---------58:58----------
abandon your possibility for success


---------59:00----------
you're re-entering and zone of


---------59:03----------
uncertainty that could lead to failure


---------59:05----------
once again so I think that's part of the


---------59:07----------
reason you you attach yourself to this


---------59:09----------
premise because at the end of the day


---------59:10----------
this strategy Bobby has worked for you


---------59:13----------
yeah so once I want to ask does it make


---------59:17----------
a difference where like you said I can


---------59:19----------
show you that this works and it's true I


---------59:20----------
can show you but not if you don't look


---------59:22----------
and I've got this other thing about like


---------59:24----------
you'll never let me show you kind of


---------59:25----------
thing sure I think that change your


---------59:27----------
analysis at all in terms of how I should


---------59:29----------
think about it not really because I


---------59:31----------
think it's just it's just that's just


---------59:32----------
part of the


---------59:34----------
you know it's part of the complex it's


---------59:36----------
part of the mechanism so you have a some


---------59:39----------
scar but then you also have these other


---------59:41----------
like coping mechanisms that you've


---------59:43----------
created in your mind to account for that


---------59:45----------
and and and I think that like to unravel


---------59:48----------
the really tricky thing so you know when


---------59:52----------
I I'm just trying to think about this so


---------59:57----------
one of my supervisors once told me that


---------59:59----------
growing up is the process of abandoning


---------60:02----------
what works yeah and that kind of struck


---------60:06----------
me and I was kind of confused about that


---------60:07----------
and then you know is the more that I


---------60:08----------
thought about it sort of like well I


---------60:10----------
mean when you when you when you're two


---------60:12----------
and you throw a temper tantrum like you


---------60:14----------
can kind of get away with that but as


---------60:15----------
you get older there are things that you


---------60:18----------
used to do that you have to give up and


---------60:20----------
like later in life so for example when I


---------60:23----------
talk about medical students so medical


---------60:25----------
students are very very grades oriented


---------60:27----------
and that's worked very well for them


---------60:29----------
because they were the top of their class


---------60:30----------
in high school


---------60:31----------
top of their class in college honors


---------60:32----------
students did excellent like you don't


---------60:35----------
have 3.9 GPA s and did really well on


---------60:38----------
standardized tests and they come to med


---------60:40----------
school and they hit the hospital and


---------60:42----------
then suddenly it's not about tests


---------60:45----------
anymore and so they've always tried to


---------60:48----------
be the best and so they ask you over and


---------60:50----------
over again how am i doing and we say


---------60:51----------
you're doing fine you're doing great


---------60:53----------
good job good job kid good job and then


---------60:56----------
when when grades come around what grade


---------60:58----------
do you think they get I mean I've had


---------61:02----------
this experience mmm not a good one so


---------61:05----------
they get an average grade which is in


---------61:07----------
their mind not a good one and then they


---------61:08----------
get really [ __ ] confused because


---------61:09----------
they're like you said I did a great job


---------61:11----------
every day and you I just got an average


---------61:14----------
grade and then we say well yeah that's


---------61:15----------
because your average because we're


---------61:17----------
comparing you with other med students


---------61:18----------
who are also showing up every day and


---------61:19----------
working really hard and you're now


---------61:21----------
average and it kind of just blows their


---------61:23----------
mind so some kids get honors okay and so


---------61:29----------
then the the the the I mean the trihard


---------61:32----------
bet they're all try hards they get


---------61:34----------
really confused and they're like you


---------61:36----------
said I did a great job yeah I asked you


---------61:38----------
what I need to do they don't say it like


---------61:40----------
this because they're too terrified of


---------61:41----------
you like I've spent my whole life with


---------61:46----------
the professor telling me you need to


---------61:47----------
study the


---------61:48----------
this this and this and you will get an a


---------61:50----------
on a test and I came here and I asked


---------61:52----------
you what do you want me to do you laid


---------61:54----------
out my responsibilities I fulfilled


---------61:55----------
every one of those responsibilities why


---------61:57----------
don't I get an A and so what we have to


---------62:01----------
do is teach them to abandon what works


---------62:06----------
and so what I try to explain to the med


---------62:09----------
students is that like it doesn't matter


---------62:11----------
like whether like I'm not the standard


---------62:14----------
that you should be judging yourself by


---------62:16----------
right you're nodding so it looks like


---------62:19----------
you understood something what are you


---------62:20----------
but what are you thinking so I think I'm


---------62:23----------
the person who asked that question


---------62:24----------
directly and if I don't get the answer


---------62:26----------
that you're giving me I get very angry


---------62:28----------
yep in other words I feel it's


---------62:30----------
acceptable to give this person an


---------62:32----------
average grade when you've you know but


---------62:34----------
then the next thing you need to say is


---------62:36----------
okay the way to get a better grade than


---------62:38----------
average is to abandon what's worked by


---------62:40----------
getting difficult and that's little


---------62:41----------
growth you know that's real leadership


---------62:43----------
and I've respect that that's a good


---------62:45----------
answer so if I get some dumbass answer


---------62:47----------
like well blah blah blah I get very


---------62:49----------
upset yeah so a lot of times the med


---------62:51----------
students get upset thankfully I've had


---------62:53----------
some years to practice this and so what


---------62:56----------
I what I tell them is like you should be


---------62:57----------
not thinking about what I want is your


---------63:00----------
supervising physician you should be


---------63:02----------
thinking about your patients needs


---------63:04----------
yeah for sure and the the the kids who


---------63:07----------
get honors are the ones that actually


---------63:08----------
don't and it's not that they don't care


---------63:10----------
about what I want they do everything but


---------63:12----------
their focus is not on the grade their


---------63:13----------
focus is on the patient yeah that's my


---------63:17----------
strength is that my focus is generally


---------63:19----------
on the people who need and that I serve


---------63:20----------
them yep but then when it comes to my


---------63:22----------
relationship with the professor like


---------63:24----------
it's contentious its contentious so


---------63:27----------
until they make it easy for the


---------63:29----------
professor I'd okay that I need to sit


---------63:31----------
and think about that so so the the point


---------63:33----------
here is that like Bobby I think you've


---------63:35----------
got a winning strategy and just like all


---------63:37----------
of the med students who have a winning


---------63:38----------
strategy that gets them to that point


---------63:40----------
what I try to impress upon the med


---------63:42----------
students is you're no longer studying


---------63:43----------
for a grade like I don't think you guys


---------63:45----------
get this one day you're gonna be it's i


---------63:49----------
funny I told this this story yesterday


---------63:50----------
one day you're gonna be on an airplane


---------63:52----------
and someone is gonna ring a button like


---------63:56----------
a call bell and they're not sorry you're


---------63:57----------
gonna hear an announcement where the air


---------64:00----------
hosts or the air hostess is going to say


---------64:01----------
is there a doctor on the plane


---------64:04----------
and then you're gonna be terrified it's


---------64:07----------
happened to me it's the most terrifying


---------64:08----------
experience in the world scariest thing


---------64:11----------
that's ever happened to me and then you


---------64:13----------
wait and you cross your fingers because


---------64:15----------
you hope that there's someone else hmm


---------64:18----------
right you hope that someone else does it


---------64:20----------
no one does and they say it again and


---------64:22----------
then you're like well [ __ ] I gotta do


---------64:23----------
this because this is what I trained for


---------64:24----------
me yeah and you hit the call bell and


---------64:27----------
then they go over and you know they call


---------64:29----------
you over and then you go and then like


---------64:31----------
like there's a pregnant lady who's like


---------64:33----------
has bad stomach cramps and then the


---------64:37----------
pilot asks you this question which is


---------64:40----------
should we land the plane immediately


---------64:43----------
that's what you need to be studying for


---------64:45----------
and that's what you should think about


---------64:47----------
every day when you come to the hospital


---------64:48----------
understand it's not about pleasing me


---------64:50----------
it's not about knowing the names of your


---------64:52----------
medications it's that like one day


---------64:54----------
someone is gonna need your help and are


---------64:56----------
you prepared for that moment because


---------64:58----------
it's [ __ ] terrifying yeah is she


---------65:00----------
having indigestion or is she having a


---------65:03----------
placental rupture where not only is she


---------65:05----------
losing the baby but she's gonna die


---------65:07----------
within 60 minutes from internal bleeding


---------65:10----------
or did she eat too much dairy and in


---------65:14----------
that moment you can't say I mean what my


---------65:18----------
personal fear is I can't say I'm a


---------65:20----------
[ __ ] psychiatrist I don't know real


---------65:21----------
medicine Yeah right that's what I'm


---------65:25----------
scared of and so that somewhere along


---------65:28----------
the way the med students get that it's


---------65:29----------
no longer about the grade and you're


---------65:31----------
actually becoming a doctor and that


---------65:33----------
people's lives are gonna depend on you


---------65:35----------
even if you're a psychiatrist who spends


---------65:37----------
his time talking to people on twitch if


---------65:39----------
I'm on the subway or if I'm on an


---------65:41----------
airplane like I can't say I'm sorry I


---------65:43----------
spend most of my time on Twitch I can't


---------65:44----------
help you unacceptable so they have to


---------65:48----------
abandon what works and what you have to


---------65:49----------
do is abandon what works and it's gonna


---------65:51----------
be terrifying you have to let go my keys


---------65:55----------
so you have to let go of your lists you


---------65:58----------
have to let go of your lists and you


---------66:00----------
have to let go of your unacceptability


---------66:01----------
yeah so I said ability then the list


---------66:06----------
goes to beautiful


---------66:08----------
right but but there's a lot of comfort


---------66:11----------
in that whole package for you because


---------66:13----------
that's what's worked so you have to let


---------66:15----------
yourself potentially fail and what I


---------66:19----------
mean by potentially fails you have to


---------66:21----------
give other people their agency back


---------66:24----------
which you take away from them yep right


---------66:28----------
you have to let them yeah right so you


---------66:33----------
have to let them be okay with your idea


---------66:37----------
not being okay that I don't think you


---------66:40----------
can do so that's something you need to


---------66:42----------
work on right so in in the so this is


---------66:45----------
I'm gonna go back to kind of the abusive


---------66:46----------
person so the most terrifying thing for


---------66:49----------
that person is actually like accepting


---------66:52----------
the possibility that this person


---------66:53----------
genuinely loves them is if this person


---------66:55----------
treats them abusively and then five


---------66:57----------
years ago from now they leave the person


---------67:01----------
in the abusive relationship is actually


---------67:02----------
okay with that because they always knew


---------67:04----------
it was gonna happen this is a game I


---------67:05----------
played before I can deal with


---------67:07----------
abandonment I know how to do it and as


---------67:10----------
long as you hold onto the possibility as


---------67:12----------
long as you hold onto that idea that I'm


---------67:14----------
not worth loving it's easy to deal with


---------67:16----------
abandonment what's terrifying is


---------67:20----------
actually like accepting someone's love


---------67:22----------
and believing that you're not worth


---------67:24----------
abandoning not like carrying those you


---------67:28----------
know putting those walls up and then the


---------67:30----------
possibility of abandonment people do not


---------67:32----------
want to do that they say I can't take it


---------67:34----------
if I presume that I'm gonna fail at the


---------67:37----------
beginning I can take a failure but if I


---------67:39----------
let myself hope and believe that I can


---------67:41----------
be loved and that I can be successful


---------67:42----------
and then I fail I can't do it it's gonna


---------67:45----------
destroy me I'm not that strong so


---------67:49----------
something very protective about all of


---------67:51----------
this stuff for you yeah right it's the


---------67:54----------
same reason why half of our audience


---------67:56----------
doesn't give it their all when they


---------67:58----------
study for a test yeah because if you


---------68:01----------
study for a test and you studied as hard


---------68:03----------
as you could and you get a B you're


---------68:05----------
[ __ ] dumb but if you're lazy you get


---------68:09----------
to hold on to being smart because I


---------68:10----------
didn't give it my all yeah giving it


---------68:13----------
your all is the most terrifying thing in


---------68:15----------
the world because then if you fall up


---------68:17----------
short you're short and there's no excuse


---------68:20----------
yeah so I think you've got to give it


---------68:24----------
your all and I think you've got to let


---------68:25----------
let go of control a couple of other


---------68:29----------
things to remember one is that I want


---------68:31----------
you to recognize that this some scar


---------68:33----------
exists within you right so it's not


---------68:36----------
correct it's not wrong it's just a piece


---------68:39----------
yeah


---------68:41----------
it's like if you're developing a


---------68:42----------
strategy for smash like you know you can


---------68:45----------
there are different characters that have


---------68:47----------
different strategies it's not like one


---------68:49----------
is the dominant truth it's just they're


---------68:51----------
different ways to play the game so in


---------68:54----------
your case you have a four or


---------68:55----------
five-year-old that sometimes thinks this


---------68:57----------
all this unacceptability stuff like that


---------68:59----------
and it's gonna dictate it's gonna want


---------69:01----------
to dictate your actions yeah as best as


---------69:04----------
you can as you see that just notice that


---------69:06----------
it wants to dictate your actions but


---------69:09----------
that it doesn't you don't have to let


---------69:11----------
that dictate your actions just see it


---------69:12----------
within you it doesn't mean it's wrong


---------69:15----------
right so like you're in a double bind


---------69:18----------
because you've got one horse that's


---------69:19----------
pulling you this way in one horse that's


---------69:21----------
pulling you this way put the horses


---------69:23----------
together there's still individual horses


---------69:24----------
they're not different but you can move


---------69:26----------
in one direction even though one of them


---------69:28----------
is like like you know you can have that


---------69:31----------
four-year-old within you and acknowledge


---------69:34----------
that that person is there and still move


---------69:36----------
forward and still speak and still


---------69:38----------
recognize that I don't have to convince


---------69:40----------
people I'm gonna actually just I'm gonna


---------69:42----------
choose to let go of the unacceptability


---------69:46----------
and also the absolute cheat code god


---------69:51----------
mode of my logic I'm gonna let go of


---------69:55----------
them both I'm gonna share my ideas and


---------69:57----------
then I'm gonna let people like cuz I


---------69:59----------
know that like there's a part of me that


---------70:00----------
doesn't want to just share my idea you


---------70:02----------
guys you guys have to listen to all of


---------70:04----------
it don't just listen to part of it don't


---------70:06----------
judge me halfway or you like I like


---------70:08----------
actually and I love watching your stream


---------70:10----------
cuz you approach this so differently you


---------70:12----------
start with your idea and you if I were


---------70:15----------
you my stream would have been two months


---------70:17----------
of me saying like okay I've thought


---------70:19----------
about this I could have been wrong in


---------70:20----------
this it's like could in other words I


---------70:22----------
never would have shared my ideas cuz I


---------70:23----------
would have just shared this extensive


---------70:25----------
case about like why you should listen to


---------70:27----------
me even though you probably do you know


---------70:29----------
what I mean no like when you'd wait if


---------70:31----------
imagine if you started your stream you


---------70:33----------
were like hey I


---------70:34----------
no you guys don't spirituality let me


---------70:36----------
like you know and you kind of defended


---------70:38----------
this angle you didn't you're just


---------70:39----------
totally obsessed with why people


---------70:41----------
shouldn't believe you and you're just


---------70:43----------
attacking these beliefs that you believe


---------70:45----------
could be out there and then after all


---------70:47----------
that then you share your ideas yeah so I


---------70:50----------
mean I like such a [ __ ] way to talk


---------70:52----------
absolutely


---------70:53----------
so like the reason that I people don't I


---------70:55----------
don't because it doesn't work right so


---------70:57----------
like like this doesn't work I just tell


---------70:58----------
you so Bobbi like let me tell you right


---------71:00----------
what I think I do you with you right


---------71:02----------
yeah yeah so I I think which is so like


---------71:05----------
I don't I don't I don't know that I'm


---------71:07----------
gonna help you I don't know that what


---------71:08----------
you're gonna say is going to be


---------71:09----------
acceptable to you I just I have no idea


---------71:13----------
right so what I have is a sense of faith


---------71:16----------
in Who I am but I don't have the the


---------71:20----------
winning strategy and not to draw too


---------71:24----------
much of a comparison between the two of


---------71:25----------
us but I think that's the only thing


---------71:26----------
that work because I've tried it your way


---------71:28----------
and doesn't [ __ ] work it doesn't is


---------71:31----------
that you be the person that you are and


---------71:32----------
you let your compass of trying to help


---------71:35----------
these gamers on Twitch and 60 percent of


---------71:36----------
people are lonely and you go to those


---------71:38----------
people you go to your colleagues at


---------71:39----------
twitch and you say hey I have this idea


---------71:41----------
I'd love to share it with you guys and


---------71:42----------
you don't try to convince them you let


---------71:44----------
them you you know it's it's the cake


---------71:48----------
that's in the display case you're not


---------71:51----------
the person who's giving out samples


---------71:52----------
you're just gonna make your cake you're


---------71:55----------
gonna stick it in the display case and


---------71:56----------
you're gonna let them choose and if they


---------71:59----------
want it they're gonna have it you're not


---------72:00----------
the person who's like hey would you like


---------72:01----------
to try a hey hey try this oh put a


---------72:03----------
little schmear this on this


---------72:05----------
why don't you dip it in here like you


---------72:06----------
know like just take a step back in and


---------72:08----------
give what you have to give and let the


---------72:10----------
world receive it and recognize that


---------72:12----------
there's the four year old the five year


---------72:14----------
old who's gonna be terrified about that


---------72:16----------
there's all the whole gold nugget and


---------72:18----------
[ __ ] like what you need to do is give


---------72:20----------
them a [ __ ] cake with a gold nugget on


---------72:24----------
top just give them it give it all to


---------72:26----------
them don't try to just give them the


---------72:28----------
gold and don't try to hold back the [ __ ]


---------72:30----------
just give it all to them because they


---------72:32----------
see it all anyway I know it's terrifying


---------72:37----------
I think that there's like you're just


---------72:38----------
not you're not that manipulative to


---------72:41----------
where you can really hide that much


---------72:42----------
Bobby you're not very manipulative so


---------72:44----------
you're like no uncertainty you're low on


---------72:46----------
the sociopathy scale like you're a kind


---------72:48----------
of strategy of filtering information and


---------72:50----------
stuff like that works you just have to


---------72:51----------
be way more sociopathic for that to be a


---------72:53----------
successful strategy for you the last


---------72:56----------
thing that I'll leave you with is we got


---------72:58----------
to talk about your mom okay so another


---------73:01----------
thing and I don't know that we have to


---------73:03----------
do this today but one of my supervisors


---------73:06----------
once told me it's the parent that they


---------73:07----------
don't so one parents the smoking gun and


---------73:10----------
there's another parent that they don't


---------73:12----------
talk about and the money is that the


---------73:13----------
parent that they don't talk about


---------73:15----------
there's plenty with yeah there's plenty


---------73:17----------
there okay flip though I will tell you


---------73:20----------
in Flint if I was a teen I would only


---------73:21----------
talk about my mom sure not talk about my


---------73:23----------
dad right so that there's a lot about


---------73:26----------
acceptability and and who you became to


---------73:28----------
be and I'm sorry that you know it sounds


---------73:30----------
like there were many experiences where


---------73:31----------
you really did just try to be yourself


---------73:33----------
and the world punished you for it yeah


---------73:36----------
and and I think you just need to


---------73:38----------
recognize that like that happened to you


---------73:41----------
and just because the world has punished


---------73:42----------
you in the past I mean there are


---------73:44----------
overwhelming numbers of people who have


---------73:46----------
accepted you for who you are


---------73:48----------
and yet this some scar has not been


---------73:51----------
processed because like it's not some


---------73:53----------
scars can't fight against each other


---------73:54----------
like that like you you were beloved in


---------73:57----------
the smash community you know it's clear


---------73:59----------
that you know my twitch at likes you I


---------74:01----------
like you you're married yeah your wife


---------74:04----------
likes you presumably you have a


---------74:05----------
three-year-old he's kind of a fan a lot


---------74:08----------
yeah and things I'm cool yeah do you


---------74:11----------
feel unacceptable with him dude


---------74:14----------
sometimes yeah so notice that right and


---------74:19----------
understand that's that is past week


---------74:21----------
we're sure I've noticed it more because


---------74:22----------
that was the practice you gave me yeah I


---------74:24----------
do notice it more so but that's not


---------74:26----------
coming from him it's coming from you a


---------74:28----------
hundred percent


---------74:29----------
right so that you think that I the thing


---------74:32----------
that was said to me yesterday that I


---------74:33----------
think really helped was that it's like I


---------74:37----------
at a certain point when I was very young


---------74:39----------
I chose to have me be than me that my


---------74:42----------
dad saw or that somebody else saw and


---------74:45----------
like I had to remember who that me was


---------74:48----------
that made that decision


---------74:49----------
cuz that me is the


---------74:51----------
that's you know does that kind of make


---------74:53----------
sense it makes it so I'll put it to you


---------74:55----------
another way so I think what so some


---------74:57----------
scars and the things that you cope


---------74:58----------
around them are learned behaviors yeah


---------75:01----------
so like I think about anxiety I mean not


---------75:04----------
all like sometimes it's you know true


---------75:06----------
biological anxiety that wasn't learned


---------75:08----------
but for a lot of people especially the


---------75:10----------
kind of anxiety that I see a lot now


---------75:12----------
it's like a learned anxiety it's just


---------75:15----------
your brain literally trying to cope or


---------75:17----------
adapt to a certain set of circumstances


---------75:18----------
and I don't know I mean I think you made


---------75:21----------
a choice I don't know if I would call it


---------75:23----------
a choice but I definitely think that you


---------75:25----------
I mean yeah you can call it a choice I


---------75:28----------
think it was sort of a subconscious


---------75:29----------
choice maybe it's a good way to put it


---------75:31----------
but I think you learned to accept your


---------75:34----------
dad's premise about who you are in the


---------75:37----------
same way that the abuse of the person


---------75:39----------
who gets into an abusive relationship


---------75:40----------
who has abusive parents learn to accept


---------75:43----------
their opinions like their parents


---------75:46----------
opinions of who they are mm-hmm and so I


---------75:49----------
completely read and that's why we got to


---------75:51----------
go back to like where this started right


---------75:52----------
and I think sure maybe it was the


---------75:54----------
four-year-old I think these some scar


---------75:55----------
has been kind of added on to those are


---------75:57----------
all pieces that are strengthening it


---------75:58----------
yeah but there's just this general idea


---------76:01----------
that like you know you're not acceptable


---------76:03----------
number one and secondly that there's


---------76:06----------
something about people that are that you


---------76:08----------
love and respect being forced to


---------76:11----------
associate with you despite your smell


---------76:15----------
yeah good way to put it and and just


---------76:21----------
notice those things and I'd say like you


---------76:23----------
know Bobby I think I think you've got


---------76:24----------
unfortunately a long road ahead of you


---------76:26----------
but I think you know I have faith that


---------76:28----------
you're gonna do do well not because you


---------76:31----------
have a winning strategy but because I


---------76:32----------
think you're gonna continue to try I'm


---------76:35----------
definitely gonna continue to try yeah


---------76:37----------
thoughts or questions do you have any uh


---------76:44----------
I would like to meditate again and have


---------76:48----------
a practice I did some chanting but I


---------76:50----------
only kind of do it at home like when can


---------76:52----------
me I think that feels really good


---------76:54----------
like letting it out as opposed to


---------76:56----------
forcing it is a big difference yep


---------76:58----------
[Music]


---------77:02----------
yeah give me a second I also feel like


---------77:04----------
yeah go ahead god no just gonna say I


---------77:07----------
also you know when I've kind of done


---------77:08----------
sort of parts of myself like kind of


---------77:10----------
thought about what's going on in my


---------77:12----------
experience I think I actually have like


---------77:14----------
a pretty strong third eye experience


---------77:16----------
when I am understanding something but at


---------77:18----------
the practice of pointing my finger I


---------77:20----------
never connected the dots between those


---------77:22----------
two places I guess and I wonder if


---------77:24----------
there's something there that I could let


---------77:29----------
me just think for a second


---------77:37----------
um okay let me just think for a second


---------77:42----------
I'm gonna just take a quick ad break


---------77:44----------
because I've been told to do that one


---------77:45----------
and then I just need to think


---------77:47----------
and then we'll teach meditation when I


---------77:49----------
get and I need to blow my nose and stuff


---------77:51----------
so I'm gonna just run to the restroom


---------77:52----------
let's talk about meditation when I get


---------77:54----------
back


---------78:16----------
you


---------78:40----------
ad is still there okay let me think no


---------78:48----------
ads chat should we do something new or


---------79:00----------
something old should we do the same one


---------79:04----------
again


---------79:18----------
you


---------79:22----------
you


---------79:33----------
so how do we teach you a meditation


---------79:36----------
about acceptability let me think


---------80:02----------
do you want something that's a little


---------80:04----------
bit more focused or more contemplative


---------80:13----------
so that's a slice contemplative is my


---------80:16----------
strict go-to strategy so maybe that's


---------80:17----------
not like I'm good at it but on the other


---------80:21----------
hand I use it to deal with my as a


---------80:24----------
coping strategy not as a yeah so I mean


---------80:28----------
I'm not I think sometimes when it comes


---------80:30----------
to meditation the goal is for you to


---------80:32----------
have a practice that's easy


---------80:33----------
kind of easy for you to do so we can try


---------80:35----------
to do something contemplative I'm trying


---------80:38----------
to figure to be honest I think that so I


---------80:40----------
think that if I could so there's a place


---------80:44----------
when I was learning how to how to wave -


---------80:46----------
it's like an advanced tech and Super


---------80:48----------
Smash Brothers mmm where if you're


---------80:50----------
trying to learn something in a video


---------80:51----------
game you kind of just go into it being


---------80:53----------
like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna beat this


---------80:54----------
level I'm gonna I'm gonna learn how to


---------80:55----------
do this and it doesn't matter if it


---------80:58----------
takes a week or a month or a year you're


---------80:59----------
just kind of gonna kind of do it and you


---------81:01----------
kind of explore something that you're


---------81:05----------
just gonna keep trying and it's it's


---------81:07----------
okay to mess up and I really love that


---------81:09----------
part of video games and I'm wondering


---------81:11----------
like


---------81:13----------
there's a way to kind of like just


---------81:17----------
recommit to being me and not worry about


---------81:21----------
the consequences of being me that was


---------81:22----------
the thing that you said last time that


---------81:23----------
really stuck with me I think I live in


---------81:25----------
the consequences of being me and so I'm


---------81:29----------
trying to refocus like where my mind is


---------81:31----------
- not five seconds after whatever I'm


---------81:33----------
thinking about saying but just where I


---------81:36----------
does that make sense yeah okay that's


---------81:38----------
helpful


---------81:38----------
so I think that we're gonna do something


---------81:40----------
that maybe is a little bit different but


---------81:52----------
let me just think about how to structure


---------81:54----------
us how can I


---------82:17----------
how do you feel about breath oriented


---------82:19----------
meditations my breathing sucks so I feel


---------82:23----------
really good about it what is that I


---------82:26----------
breathe very shallowly I find it very


---------82:28----------
difficult to breathe deeply


---------82:30----------
I find that uh I kind of feel like I


---------82:35----------
like I don't know if it's gas or


---------82:38----------
whatever but something will build up


---------82:39----------
when I'm trying to breathe deeply that


---------82:41----------
does they kind of prevent gets in the


---------82:42----------
way then I kind of feel like I have to


---------82:44----------
burp or something hmm which doesn't also


---------82:46----------
doesn't work I don't know if that's


---------82:50----------
super weird but okay first thing that I


---------82:56----------
want you to sit up straight and close


---------82:58----------
your eyes we get a pillow sure hips hips


---------83:09----------
above knees yep very good okay


---------83:19----------
so I'm gonna teach you a technique


---------83:27----------
around the double bond okay mm-hmm so I


---------83:31----------
want you to notice you but do you have a


---------83:36----------
tennis ball by chance or something


---------83:39----------
that's tennis ball shape can you go grab


---------83:41----------
it so if you guys have a tennis ball go


---------84:03----------
grab one if you don't have a tennis ball


---------84:07----------
we're gonna try to use your fist okay so


---------84:09----------
Bobby I want you to close your eyes and


---------84:11----------
breathe in and out through your nose and


---------84:15----------
tell me first if you can discern whether


---------84:18----------
one ball one nostril is more open than


---------84:21----------
the other


---------84:22----------
I think my right okay so go ahead and


---------84:28----------
block your lap nostril and breathe in


---------84:29----------
through your right it does it to any


---------84:33----------
finger it doesn't matter yes so just


---------84:34----------
block one off so it'll be then and then


---------84:37----------
after one breath switch and then check


---------84:39----------
the other nostril full breath


---------84:43----------
yeah just confirm whether your left gang


---------84:51----------
or right gang maybe left I don't know


---------84:58----------
kind of in the middle I think that's


---------85:00----------
more clear okay so then what I want you


---------85:03----------
to do is to take the tennis ball and


---------85:06----------
stick it under your left armpit kind of


---------85:09----------
up into the armpit like push it up yeah


---------85:16----------
you kind of feel it pressing into your


---------85:19----------
like up in there okay kind of make it


---------85:25----------
almost a little bit uncomfortable like


---------85:26----------
pressure yeah it's a little one guy feel


---------85:28----------
a little bit of like in the back okay so


---------85:31----------
like almost like imagine if you were


---------85:32----------
like leaning with your armpit over a


---------85:35----------
railing okay good so close your eyes now


---------85:39----------
observe your breath and with each breath


---------85:43----------
notice which nostril is more open and


---------85:49----------
then try to catch the transition so you


---------85:51----------
can put your fist into your armpit if


---------85:56----------
you want


---------86:01----------
the other thing that you can do is lay


---------86:04----------
down on the if you guys are watching at


---------86:06----------
home if that's it's which do you catch


---------86:08----------
it I think it did so if it's switched to


---------86:17----------
then move the tennis ball other arm pet


---------86:22----------
can't confirm it yeah switch the tennis


---------86:29----------
ball now catch it this time


---------86:41----------
so the other thing that you all can do


---------86:43----------
cuz the fists can be a little bit


---------86:44----------
awkward is that you can lay down on the


---------86:48----------
side of your open nostril so if your


---------86:51----------
left nostril is open lay down on your


---------86:54----------
left and if your right nostril is open


---------86:56----------
lay down on your right it switched again


---------87:00----------
are you catching it I think I think it


---------87:03----------
was between two breaths like it was the


---------87:07----------
exhale so I want you to focus it the it


---------87:14----------
kind of that the back or top of your


---------87:16----------
nose because that's where you may feel


---------87:19----------
the switch and you're gonna get one


---------87:21----------
breath in there with both nostrils open


---------87:24----------
maybe a couple


---------87:29----------
you


---------87:30----------
you


---------87:32----------
I figured switching really fast


---------87:36----------
you


---------87:37----------
it's it's a it starts on this yeah it's


---------87:40----------
switching super [ __ ] fast okay so now


---------87:43----------
we have your problem right so I think


---------87:44----------
this is so you got it so you can stop


---------87:46----------
for a second Bobby so what I'm gonna do


---------87:48----------
let's try to do it slightly differently


---------87:50----------
which one's open now left okay so I want


---------87:54----------
you to your couch in the back I want you


---------87:56----------
to lay down on your left side okay and


---------88:00----------
just kind of just just lay down on your


---------88:04----------
left nope just lay down on your left


---------88:07----------
side yeah it's it's very strange that


---------88:12----------
his is switching correctly so I think


---------88:13----------
this is the right technique for him I


---------88:15----------
won't be able to hear you


---------88:16----------
okay so lay down on your on whichever


---------88:19----------
side is open and then watch it switch


---------88:22----------
and then come back when it after it


---------88:24----------
switches alright and try to catch


---------88:27----------
yourself in the middle of the switch


---------88:32----------
you


---------88:35----------
you


---------88:36----------
you


---------88:39----------
yeah it's very strange it normally does


---------88:42----------
not switch that fast yeah


---------88:50----------
can relax [ __ ] how do I tell him to put


---------88:53----------
a pillow under his head because he looks


---------88:55----------
[ __ ] awkward Jesus that looks


---------88:57----------
uncomfortable like so stiff


---------89:07----------
poor Bobby he tries so hard


---------89:12----------
you


---------89:13----------
you


---------89:18----------
okay I think I caught a dude okay so it


---------89:25----------
was quick okay good so first of all you


---------89:29----------
know you can lay down in a more relaxed


---------89:31----------
fashion you don't have to like keep your


---------89:32----------
header like you could have like gotten


---------89:34----------
on a pillow just comfortably


---------89:35----------
okay okay so first of all it's very


---------89:37----------
unusual that you're you're you're not


---------89:40----------
ease are switching so rapidly like


---------89:41----------
usually it takes like at least like six


---------89:44----------
30 60 seconds so but this also is cool


---------89:48----------
because I think this is the right


---------89:49----------
technique for you so Bobby you we've


---------89:52----------
been talking about the double bind what


---------89:54----------
you need to learn how to do is to live


---------89:56----------
in between two things to live in the


---------89:59----------
tension as opposed to being pulled onto


---------90:03----------
two sides so there's a tension within


---------90:04----------
you and I think it's clear to me that


---------90:06----------
like you need to live in the space of


---------90:08----------
that transition so there's going to be


---------90:11----------
one breath in there where either


---------90:12----------
inhalation or exhalation things are


---------90:15----------
gonna be even in balance before you


---------90:17----------
switch over so just spend time in the


---------90:20----------
middle of those two things and what you


---------90:24----------
can you can also do is like you don't I


---------90:26----------
mean this is weird I've never had


---------90:27----------
someone who switches so quickly so I


---------90:30----------
don't know that you need to worry about


---------90:34----------
this by the way go ahead I think that I


---------90:37----------
learned very young not to trust myself


---------90:38----------
so my left and right hemispheric brains


---------90:41----------
don't trust each other so there's just a


---------90:43----------
bunch of like ah I don't know if that


---------90:45----------
makes any sense but I just like as I


---------90:47----------
think through things I noticed that I


---------90:49----------
switched from like what is the meaning


---------90:50----------
and how does this make sense


---------90:51----------
holistically to well none of the facts


---------90:53----------
support this and it's like they're kind


---------90:55----------
of disagreeing and they're fighting all


---------90:57----------
the time right so you need to find your


---------90:59----------
corpus callosum which is the thing that


---------91:01----------
connects your two hemispheres right so


---------91:03----------
you need to find you need to live in the


---------91:05----------
in-between spaces that's so so it's so


---------91:09----------
cheering there it shouldn't be a


---------91:11----------
battleground right so I what I want you


---------91:13----------
to understand so like imagine that I


---------91:14----------
have to you know if I take like two


---------91:17----------
boards and I lean them against each


---------91:20----------
other those two boards are opposing each


---------91:24----------
other and you could argue that that's a


---------91:27----------
battleground right because one of them


---------91:28----------
wants to fall this way the other one


---------91:30----------
wants to fall this way but


---------91:31----------
I set them up there's actually like


---------91:33----------
there's no conflict that is just the


---------91:36----------
tendency of one board and the tendency


---------91:39----------
of the other board are creating conflict


---------91:40----------
and opposition but in between them


---------91:42----------
there's actually peace and balance and


---------91:45----------
you need to start learning how to live


---------91:47----------
in that space and I think this is a


---------91:49----------
technique that's gonna help you with


---------91:50----------
that just like you said your if your two


---------91:52----------
hemispheres don't trust each other


---------91:55----------
fantastic so start to learn la live in


---------91:58----------
the in-between spaces do you have any


---------92:02----------
idea what that feels like could you kind


---------92:03----------
of maybe say a word or two about what it


---------92:06----------
might feel like to live in the tension


---------92:13----------
yes I can but I'm not going to okay


---------92:18----------
so part of this is tricky because I'm


---------92:19----------
trying to teach you sort of a middle


---------92:21----------
technique without the beginning and


---------92:23----------
without the end so this is sort of the


---------92:25----------
preparatory technique the main thing


---------92:26----------
though is that the other thing you can


---------92:27----------
do is you don't necessarily have to use


---------92:29----------
the tennis ball if you're switching very


---------92:30----------
rapidly you can just observe your breath


---------92:33----------
and catch the the switch naturally okay


---------92:36----------
so I don't think that you should have it


---------92:38----------
ping ping pong hang back and forth so


---------92:40----------
rapidly so if you want to you know have


---------92:42----------
it breathe for a couple minutes and then


---------92:43----------
you want to force switch you can breathe


---------92:46----------
for a couple minutes and then you want


---------92:47----------
to force a switch but see if you can


---------92:48----------
catch the natural transition and and


---------92:52----------
when that transition happens just fully


---------92:55----------
implant yourself in that space with one


---------92:58----------
breath that is both right nostril and


---------93:01----------
left nostril and then you tell me how it


---------93:07----------
feels to live in the in-between okay


---------93:11----------
thoughts questions feels good thanks so


---------93:17----------
much for everything that you're doing


---------93:18----------
man


---------93:18----------
yeah man it's been a pleasure thanks for


---------93:20----------
coming on a couple times and also you


---------93:21----------
know rescheduling so rapidly for sure


---------93:25----------
any thoughts on who we should raid I'm I


---------93:30----------
was thinking I would stream so I mean if


---------93:31----------
you want to yeah we can just raid you


---------93:33----------
that's right Bobby are you streaming or


---------93:36----------
Mike I'm about to you I wasn't cuz the


---------93:39----------
camera won't let me it wouldn't let me


---------93:41----------
you know you couldn't see me go to Bobby


---------93:45----------
was dreaming okay which underscore scarf


---------93:48----------
alright thanks a lot Bobby will raid you


---------93:50----------
take care yeah you too oh wow


---------93:57----------
thank you mass stars for the how many is


---------94:00----------
that


---------94:00----------
holy 100 gift bomb thank you very much


---------94:05----------
for the you know gigantic pile of subs


---------94:10----------
okay so for a couple of things to make


---------94:13----------
things so you know sometimes I struggle


---------94:20----------
on stream because I'm not sure like what


---------94:22----------
to teach because some stuff is very


---------94:24----------
applicable to the person and I think


---------94:25----------
less applicable to twitch at dodged what


---------94:31----------
I'm confused why does people say dodged


---------94:39----------
oh they dodge the subs thanks for the


---------94:42----------
hundred gifted subs really mash stars we


---------94:45----------
really appreciate it so that'll go to


---------94:46----------
you no it'll go to fun something or


---------94:48----------
other so I'm sorry if that you know that


---------94:53----------
meditation practice was like odd for you


---------94:55----------
guys cuz it's very strange that Bobby's


---------94:57----------
like switching so rapidly but if you


---------95:00----------
guys are if you're struggling in some


---------95:04----------
way and you feel like you're in a double


---------95:06----------
bind that practice could be good for you


---------95:08----------
too so this practice is part of


---------95:10----------
something called sawara sadhana so era


---------95:12----------
means breath or sound and yoga is sort


---------95:15----------
of a particular set of practices that


---------95:18----------
are sort of a designed to get you to


---------95:22----------
enlightenment purely through the breath


---------95:25----------
and it's different from be passionate


---------95:27----------
because sort of sadhana isn't really


---------95:29----------
about doing things with your breath


---------95:31----------
which is more Brown I am


---------95:32----------
it's about observing nuances of the


---------95:35----------
breath so I'll give you guys kind of a


---------95:38----------
another practice so if you close your


---------95:41----------
eyes and you pay attention to your


---------95:43----------
breath you'll feel the flow of air


---------95:49----------
through your nostrils right and now I


---------95:55----------
want you to figure out which of your


---------95:57----------
nostrils is dominant so one of your


---------95:59----------
nostrils is gonna be more open than the


---------96:01----------
other


---------96:09----------
left Ganga right gang okay so now what I


---------96:20----------
want you guys to do if y'all ready for


---------96:22----------
the next level this is gonna be hard


---------96:24----------
left gang right gang so if you guys have


---------96:26----------
some practice with this now I want you


---------96:28----------
to notice the direction of the breath


---------96:30----------
okay within your nose so what I mean by


---------96:36----------
that is okay so if you think about your


---------96:47----------
nose like this right so here's your


---------96:53----------
right nostril here's your left nostril


---------96:55----------
dr. K okay so you can feel let's use


---------96:59----------
like a brush or something yeah so you


---------97:03----------
can feel the breath around here or you


---------97:08----------
can feel it here or you can feel it here


---------97:11----------
there's going to be a dominant place


---------97:13----------
where your breath is coming out of your


---------97:15----------
nostril it's going to be equal both


---------97:22----------
sides very rarely does this make sense


---------97:26----------
to anyone there's going to be one area


---------97:30----------
like it could be here or here what are


---------97:33----------
you're gonna feel the breath more there


---------97:36----------
are five distinct zones


---------97:43----------
so what you guys want to do is as you


---------97:46----------
breathe just notice which zone you're in


---------98:00----------
right so this is tricky because like so


---------98:04----------
sorta silent is hard it's like a more


---------98:06----------
subtle practice and it's like really not


---------98:08----------
for everyone which is fine doesn't mean


---------98:09----------
you're bad at meditation the whole point


---------98:12----------
of teaching different meditation


---------98:13----------
techniques is cuz like some people know


---------98:15----------
what charging the laser beam feels like


---------98:16----------
and other people are like I have no idea


---------98:18----------
what that is


---------98:19----------
and other people you do left gang right


---------98:21----------
gang and they're like yeah that makes


---------98:22----------
perfect sense how do you guys not


---------98:23----------
understand this so what you guys want to


---------98:26----------
do is just pay attention to the


---------98:28----------
different zones of your nose and just


---------98:30----------
focus on that and try to feel what they


---------98:32----------
are so what I'll ask you guys is that


---------98:35----------
I'll tell you that there are a certain


---------98:37----------
number of zones in each nostril so you


---------98:40----------
guys tell me what are the zones of each


---------98:43----------
nostril so I'll say let's let's say five


---------98:44----------
okay so five directions that your breath


---------98:47----------
can go within each nostril and and try


---------98:54----------
to just see try to find all five in each


---------98:57----------
nostril and that's your meditation


---------99:00----------
practice right so it's not so important


---------99:08----------
what it is right now but as you so what


---------99:11----------
I want you guys to do is is understand


---------99:17----------
so try to catch all five of them the


---------99:24----------
zones are what you you need to figure


---------99:26----------
that out I'm not gonna tell you what


---------99:27----------
they are and if you guys don't know what


---------99:30----------
what I'm talking about that's actually


---------99:32----------
completely fine


---------99:36----------
right so for those of you who think your


---------99:38----------
five had like digital donger that's just


---------99:41----------
for directions buddy where's the fifth


---------99:44----------
and do this practice do it throughout


---------99:46----------
the day because you're not gonna like


---------99:47----------
doesn't make sense like if one zone is


---------99:49----------
active that's the zone that's gonna be


---------99:50----------
active right now you can continue


---------99:51----------
watching the breath but it's gonna be


---------99:53----------
the same part that's gonna be active and


---------99:58----------
so practice it for a while so listen


---------100:03----------
guys I just want to thank you guys again


---------100:05----------
for all of the support and for all the


---------100:08----------
subs and things like that you know our
