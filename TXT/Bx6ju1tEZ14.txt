---------00:00----------
so we're trying something a little bit


---------00:01----------
new this week at healthy gamer um so a


---------00:04----------
lot of people like thousands of people


---------00:06----------
have expressed interest or curiosity


---------00:08----------
about becoming coaches um i also know


---------00:10----------
that a ton of people in our community


---------00:12----------
are really interested in like


---------00:13----------
understanding motivation


---------00:15----------
so part of what we're going to be doing


---------00:17----------
today is teaching our coaches like how


---------00:19----------
to think about goal setting and


---------00:20----------
motivation we're going to be explaining


---------00:22----------
some principles of psychology and


---------00:24----------
neuroscience and things like that and i


---------00:26----------
think actually it can be useful for


---------00:27----------
people in our community to kind of like


---------00:29----------
learn this stuff on their own


---------00:31----------
um


---------00:32----------
a one or two interesting kind of points


---------00:34----------
to remember the first is that this is


---------00:36----------
not really geared towards a diy


---------00:39----------
perspective right so this is a training


---------00:40----------
that we do for our coaches so they can


---------00:43----------
help other people do it so um that


---------00:45----------
perspective may be a little bit


---------00:46----------
different so a lot of people had


---------00:48----------
questions yesterday about like can i do


---------00:49----------
this myself how do i do this by myself


---------00:52----------
um there are certainly ways of doing


---------00:53----------
that but that's not quite the focus so


---------00:55----------
we're still going to share all the


---------00:56----------
principles because we think those are


---------00:57----------
useful but especially today for example


---------01:00----------
we're going to share some of the


---------01:01----------
mechanisms through which behavioral


---------01:04----------
change happens in a neuroscience from a


---------01:05----------
neuroscience perspective and so some of


---------01:08----------
those mechanisms are specifically


---------01:10----------
they specifically inform how we've


---------01:13----------
designed our coaching program so our


---------01:15----------
coaching program is sort of designed to


---------01:17----------
take advantage of some of these things


---------01:19----------
which it may be harder for you to


---------01:20----------
implement kind of on your own but you


---------01:22----------
can absolutely sort of still benefit


---------01:24----------
from them now we get to the four types


---------01:26----------
of intent


---------01:28----------
or the four dimensions of intent


---------01:30----------
so when when someone says i have a goal


---------01:33----------
i


---------01:35----------
what are the four things that could be


---------01:37----------
driving this person like why do people


---------01:40----------
pick goals


---------01:46----------
like outside pressure like like family


---------01:49----------
or a society or something


---------01:50----------
okay so pressure excellent


---------01:53----------
society


---------01:55----------
family what else


---------01:58----------
values


---------01:59----------
uh what do you mean by that


---------02:01----------
um it's like something they care about


---------02:05----------
okay


---------02:07----------
so when someone feels pressured


---------02:09----------
and they say


---------02:10----------
they they're saying that i have to


---------02:12----------
accomplish this goal what is the verb


---------02:14----------
that they


---------02:16----------
use


---------02:18----------
i know it's kind of a weird


---------02:20----------
okay good excellent what else do they


---------02:21----------
say


---------02:23----------
should


---------02:24----------
absolutely


---------02:27----------
okay


---------02:28----------
so what else goes into


---------02:30----------
you know why someone does something


---------02:34----------
it's their duty


---------02:35----------
okay


---------02:36----------
so duty so what do they what's the word


---------02:39----------
that they use there so care about is a


---------02:41----------
good example of a value


---------02:47----------
what's the


---------02:48----------
worst responsibility absolutely


---------02:52----------
right


---------02:56----------
or obligation


---------02:59----------
so do you guys see how like these are


---------03:00----------
different things what i n what i should


---------03:03----------
do is different from and we'll get to


---------03:05----------
should and an obligation in a second


---------03:07----------
because you could say that your duty is


---------03:09----------
what you should do


---------03:10----------
um and i'd say the key well let's just


---------03:12----------
talk about it now so i think the big


---------03:13----------
difference is like the duty is like owed


---------03:16----------
to someone else


---------03:20----------
and there are all kinds of things that


---------03:21----------
you should do that you don't owe to


---------03:23----------
someone else does that make sense


---------03:26----------
like i should eat healthier but that's


---------03:27----------
not like a duty it's just


---------03:30----------
i should eat healthier because society


---------03:32----------
you know judges me because of my body


---------03:34----------
type and if i don't want to be poorly


---------03:36----------
judged by society or my family makes fun


---------03:39----------
of me for being like overweight or


---------03:40----------
underweight or whatever


---------03:42----------
like that's that's a should but it's not


---------03:44----------
something that i owe someone so you can


---------03:45----------
use the word should for duty but this is


---------03:47----------
exactly the point of like having this


---------03:49----------
discussion because these are actually


---------03:51----------
different internal drives that share the


---------03:54----------
same language and so when people use


---------03:56----------
unsophisticated language they don't


---------03:58----------
diagnose the problem correctly like i'm


---------04:00----------
sick


---------04:01----------
so as a doctor it's like sick with what


---------04:03----------
right like there isn't medicine for


---------04:05----------
sickness


---------04:06----------
there are treatments for diseases and we


---------04:08----------
need specificity of our language to


---------04:10----------
figure out where the problem is so that


---------04:12----------
we can fix it


---------04:13----------
there's one big bucket that we're


---------04:15----------
missing


---------04:17----------
what desire or what yeah perfect desires


---------04:20----------
right


---------04:21----------
this has nothing to do with duty or


---------04:23----------
obligation it's like sometimes you know


---------04:26----------
dr k just needs a hot dog like that has


---------04:28----------
nothing to do with you know what i


---------04:29----------
should be eating or or values or


---------04:31----------
anything like that it's just like i


---------04:33----------
smell you know there's some korean


---------04:35----------
corn dog place that opened up sort of


---------04:38----------
near where i live there's always a line


---------04:40----------
out the door i don't actually like


---------04:41----------
really want to eat it but sometimes when


---------04:43----------
i walk by i get curious and i smell it


---------04:46----------
and and so that's you know there are


---------04:47----------
desires right i want to play league


---------04:49----------
because i want to school some noobs


---------04:52----------
so if we kind of look at these


---------04:55----------
one of the things that i i kind of


---------04:56----------
notice is that some of these result in a


---------04:59----------
loss for me like i have to give


---------05:01----------
something up and some of these result in


---------05:04----------
a gain


---------05:05----------
and then the other kind of dimension is


---------05:06----------
that some of these lead to like


---------05:08----------
external


---------05:10----------
um what's the term i want to use here


---------05:16----------
once i figured out a good term


---------05:24----------
yeah so external reward


---------05:27----------
and internal reward


---------05:32----------
okay


---------05:34----------
so where do you all think desires go


---------05:40----------
which quadrant would you put them in


---------05:44----------
when i satisfy my desires do i gain


---------05:46----------
something or do i lose something


---------05:50----------
gain absolutely and do i gain an


---------05:54----------
internal reward or an external reward


---------05:56----------
external


---------05:58----------
yeah so this is where desires go so this


---------06:00----------
is going to be kind of weird but like i


---------06:02----------
define external reward as something that


---------06:05----------
includes a bodily satisfaction right


---------06:07----------
it's like some kind of pleasure so let's


---------06:09----------
think a little bit about the things that


---------06:11----------
i should do


---------06:15----------
like my family wants to become a doctor


---------06:18----------
where does that go is that a gain or a


---------06:20----------
loss


---------06:20----------
for me


---------06:22----------
it's a loss


---------06:23----------
yeah it's kind of weird so you gotta you


---------06:25----------
gotta run with my system here okay


---------06:27----------
it's not this isn't signed there's no


---------06:29----------
ohm's law for this dr k's impression


---------06:32----------
like i have to give something up that's


---------06:33----------
the way i kind of think about a loss


---------06:35----------
right so i have to give up potentially


---------06:37----------
like my own happiness


---------06:38----------
and what about internal reward or


---------06:40----------
external reward what's the advantage of


---------06:42----------
doing things that i should do


---------06:44----------
it's an external reward absolutely right


---------06:47----------
so i want to be a professional video


---------06:49----------
gamer but that's not a respectable


---------06:51----------
profession and i can't really hold my


---------06:53----------
head up high while i'm grinding like a


---------06:55----------
professional video game but if i'm a


---------06:57----------
doctor and i put that on my tinder


---------06:59----------
profile that comes with a lot of


---------07:00----------
prestige even though i hate myself on


---------07:03----------
the inside because you know i did


---------07:05----------
something that i don't really want to do


---------07:06----------
for the wrong reasons


---------07:07----------
so shoulds


---------07:09----------
go here


---------07:11----------
where do values go


---------07:15----------
bottom right


---------07:17----------
absolutely so walk me through that


---------07:21----------
um you're gaining


---------07:24----------
something because you're doing it


---------07:26----------
because you value it and it's also


---------07:28----------
internal to yourself


---------07:30----------
as opposed to a hot dog


---------07:33----------
yeah right so like when i when i do


---------07:34----------
things that i care about i usually get


---------07:38----------
something out of it


---------07:39----------
right so like if like let's say that i


---------07:42----------
you know i care about my children so i'm


---------07:44----------
gonna take care of them when they're


---------07:45----------
sick


---------07:46----------
actually that may be a


---------07:47----------
obligation we'll get get to that in a


---------07:49----------
second but generally speaking things


---------07:51----------
that you care about in my experience


---------07:53----------
tend to come to


---------07:55----------
um tend to come with some kind of gain


---------07:57----------
like you get some sort of like personal


---------07:59----------
satisfaction out of it and like the


---------08:01----------
reward that you gain is not something


---------08:02----------
that is shown to the the external world


---------08:04----------
there's no prestige with it there may


---------08:07----------
not necessarily be like bodily enjoyment


---------08:09----------
with it so like a good example of this


---------08:11----------
is let's say that i enjoy hiking and i


---------08:13----------
climb to the top of a mountain


---------08:15----------
i i'm not it's like generally speaking


---------08:17----------
like does it cost me something sure like


---------08:19----------
it requires effort right so doing things


---------08:21----------
that you care about sometimes require


---------08:22----------
effort but it like feels good on the


---------08:24----------
inside and you get to the top and


---------08:25----------
there's like a view and like you feel


---------08:27----------
kind of like amazing so that's something


---------08:29----------
like doing things that you care about


---------08:31----------
and so then our last bucket is duty kind


---------08:33----------
of goes up here


---------08:35----------
and so if we think about duty duty


---------08:36----------
usually involves sacrifice right so it's


---------08:38----------
like a loss it's not something that


---------08:40----------
necessarily like i want to do for my


---------08:42----------
sake it's an obligation or something


---------08:44----------
that i owe so it like costs me something


---------08:46----------
but it's very satisfying to do so for


---------08:48----------
example taking care of my kids when


---------08:50----------
they're sick like overnight


---------08:52----------
um is something that feels like


---------08:54----------
internally satisfying as a parent


---------08:56----------
because like i know i'm being a good


---------08:58----------
parent


---------08:59----------
it's not something that i'm posting on


---------09:00----------
social media or anything that i'm gonna


---------09:02----------
like get prestige or enjoyment out of


---------09:04----------
and it actually costs me something right


---------09:06----------
because i have to stay up all night and


---------09:07----------
like try to take care of them and all


---------09:09----------
that kind of good stuff


---------09:10----------
so duty kind of goes up here does that


---------09:12----------
make sense


---------09:15----------
so let me ask y'all when people kind of


---------09:17----------
come to you and they they come up with


---------09:19----------
goals and they say like oh i have these


---------09:21----------
goals what


---------09:23----------
quadrant what quadrant or quadrants do


---------09:26----------
you think the average client that you


---------09:28----------
all deal with is operating from


---------09:35----------
shows her desires


---------09:37----------
what do y'all think about


---------09:39----------
that


---------09:40----------
agree with is that alan yeah i would say


---------09:42----------
should's


---------09:45----------
right so


---------09:48----------
so we've got two votes for shoulds


---------09:51----------
one vote for desire what about the


---------09:52----------
rustial


---------09:53----------
yeah


---------09:54----------
okay i think should because if someone


---------09:57----------
had a desire they would be able to do it


---------09:59----------
without a coach


---------10:00----------
okay so when you think about their lives


---------10:03----------
and the behaviors that they engage in


---------10:06----------
what what do you think actually drives


---------10:09----------
them and like what shapes their behavior


---------10:14----------
eli


---------10:17----------
so not just the things you asked me the


---------10:19----------
question again yeah so you said that


---------10:20----------
they come to coaching and they i've


---------10:22----------
already satisfied their desires what


---------10:24----------
they need help with is the shoulds well


---------10:26----------
very well said so i'm going to ask you


---------10:28----------
to dig a little bit deeper and for the


---------10:30----------
things that like most of what they


---------10:32----------
actually do the behaviors that your


---------10:34----------
clients engage in what do you think is


---------10:36----------
the driving force for what they're able


---------10:38----------
to what they're doing without you


---------10:41----------
gotcha um i'd say a lot of times desires


---------10:43----------
like if you take your corndog example


---------10:46----------
most people don't need a coach to go buy


---------10:48----------
a corn dog they have enough motive


---------10:50----------
motivation if you will by themselves to


---------10:52----------
go do that okay and so like i know this


---------10:55----------
so this is going to be kind of actually


---------10:57----------
forget the leading question so well said


---------10:58----------
so i completely agree so in my


---------11:00----------
experience


---------11:01----------
most people operate from the left side


---------11:03----------
of the quadrant and operating from the


---------11:05----------
left side of the quadrant can sometimes


---------11:08----------
make people happy but generally speaking


---------11:11----------
like what we're talking about is living


---------11:13----------
a life of external reward and then the


---------11:15----------
other thing that tends to happen is like


---------11:17----------
when you're living a life of external


---------11:19----------
reward


---------11:20----------
and it's kind of like loss oriented like


---------11:23----------
the loss of the should if if you're


---------11:25----------
living a life of external reward you


---------11:27----------
can't


---------11:28----------
like


---------11:30----------
afford that loss i don't know how else


---------11:32----------
to put it right so what i'd say is that


---------11:34----------
when people actually move from this


---------11:37----------
quadrant to this quadrant or this


---------11:39----------
quadrant to this quadrant or this


---------11:40----------
quadrant to this quadrant this is when


---------11:42----------
their motivation starts to move in a


---------11:44----------
positive direction they feel good about


---------11:47----------
themselves and they take control of


---------11:48----------
their lives what do y'all think about


---------11:50----------
that


---------11:52----------
that's a that's a hypothesis or


---------11:54----------
assertion that i'm putting forward which


---------11:56----------
all can agree or disagree with


---------11:59----------
definitely agree


---------12:02----------
right so this is something that we also


---------12:03----------
see in addiction psychiatry so in


---------12:05----------
addiction psychiatry people have a


---------12:07----------
powerful biological driver


---------12:10----------
that is forcing them to use a substance


---------12:13----------
right so biology doesn't even enter this


---------12:15----------
like this equation when you have biology


---------12:17----------
entering it what we kind of go more


---------12:20----------
towards is like i'd say that biology is


---------12:22----------
sort of maybe undesires right because


---------12:23----------
that's like reward circuitry and


---------12:25----------
dopamine and stuff like that


---------12:26----------
so this also maybe is like where youtube


---------12:29----------
and gaming and stuff live


---------12:32----------
and so when it when it comes to helping


---------12:33----------
someone overcome an addiction like


---------12:35----------
literally the process that we try to do


---------12:37----------
there's a whole system of therapy called


---------12:39----------
acceptance and commitment therapy which


---------12:41----------
is sort of based on it's another one of


---------12:42----------
these like novel therapies that takes a


---------12:44----------
sprinkling of eastern wisdom and then


---------12:46----------
packages up in a western way and calls


---------12:48----------
itself something new some interesting


---------12:50----------
cultural appropriation going on there so


---------12:52----------
act as an evidence-based treatment for


---------12:56----------
um


---------12:58----------
is an evidence-based treatment for


---------13:00----------
addictions


---------13:02----------
and what the goal of act is is it sort


---------13:04----------
of says that the more that you move


---------13:05----------
people into this quadrant the easier it


---------13:08----------
is to overcome addictions


---------13:10----------
and that's been my experience as well


---------13:12----------
like like people have to have a clear


---------13:14----------
reason


---------13:15----------
to make the sacrifice right like they


---------13:18----------
have to make the sacrifice or give up


---------13:20----------
the external reward and there has to be


---------13:22----------
something i want you all to understand


---------13:23----------
it's like any time we're talking about


---------13:24----------
motivation right there's a pro and a con


---------13:27----------
in someone's brain there's a calculation


---------13:29----------
that's going on constantly should i do


---------13:31----------
this thing or should i not do this thing


---------13:32----------
should i eat the hot dog or should i not


---------13:34----------
eat the hot dog and what keeps people


---------13:36----------
stuck is essentially like a conflict


---------13:38----------
between two of these quadrants


---------13:40----------
so i should do this


---------13:43----------
but i want to do this and then we feel


---------13:46----------
paralyzed


---------13:47----------
it's my duty to do this


---------13:50----------
but i want to do this


---------13:53----------
right


---------13:54----------
i want to do this but this is what i


---------13:56----------
care about


---------13:57----------
i actually do genuinely care about like


---------13:59----------
being healthy and i hate the way that i


---------14:02----------
feel when i like drink too much


---------14:04----------
at the same time i want to get


---------14:06----------
absolutely hammered and go party and


---------14:07----------
have fun with my friends


---------14:09----------
and so what keeps people stuck is


---------14:11----------
actually like conflicts between these


---------14:13----------
two


---------14:14----------
these different quadrants does that make


---------14:16----------
sense


---------14:18----------
so as a coach what our goal is is to


---------14:20----------
help people essentially move from this


---------14:23----------
side


---------14:24----------
over here


---------14:25----------
and how do y'all think we do that


---------14:28----------
what's our methodology


---------14:37----------
create awareness and understanding of


---------14:39----------
what's going on


---------14:41----------
absolutely


---------14:42----------
absolutely that's that's the key thing


---------14:44----------
awareness and understanding


---------14:46----------
okay


---------14:47----------
and that may sound kind of weird because


---------14:49----------
like wha how does awareness and


---------14:51----------
understanding like actually create how


---------14:54----------
does that drive behavior like once you


---------14:56----------
clarify this stuff for people like how


---------14:57----------
does that help them


---------15:02----------
because when you can see


---------15:04----------
like the


---------15:05----------
driving forces behind these things it's


---------15:07----------
much easier to understand them and then


---------15:09----------
shift around your own personal values


---------15:12----------
for your choices absolutely right so i


---------15:14----------
know it sounds kind of weird but like


---------15:17----------
you know like when when our clients come


---------15:20----------
in and they say like i have this goal


---------15:21----------
and i should do it so like let's use the


---------15:23----------
example of like the student who doesn't


---------15:24----------
feel like studying


---------15:26----------
right so like what is the student who


---------15:27----------
doesn't feel like studying like what do


---------15:29----------
they say to you


---------15:34----------
like what language you should study


---------15:36----------
absolutely


---------15:37----------
right and then you ask them what makes


---------15:39----------
it harder like why don't you study and


---------15:41----------
what do they say


---------15:46----------
i don't want to there you go there it is


---------15:49----------
right it's that simple so they're stuck


---------15:52----------
right here


---------15:54----------
and so like the way that you help that


---------15:55----------
client like is by sort of clarifying


---------15:58----------
like their values right like so this is


---------16:00----------
where you know when i work with clients


---------16:01----------
who are like that it's sort of thinking


---------16:03----------
about okay like what do you actually


---------16:04----------
care about why are you actually in


---------16:06----------
college


---------16:07----------
you know why did you go here is it to


---------16:09----------
fulfill a societal obligation is that


---------16:11----------
why you went to college or is there


---------16:13----------
something genuinely that you can come to


---------16:15----------
appreciate about college is there


---------16:17----------
anything that we can figure out here


---------16:19----------
that aligns with what you actually care


---------16:21----------
about because if you can help that


---------16:23----------
person uncover


---------16:25----------
what


---------16:26----------
what about college aligns with them and


---------16:29----------
that could even be duty you could even


---------16:30----------
like come to the revelation i've had


---------16:32----------
students do this who sort of say that


---------16:33----------
like okay my parents have supported me


---------16:35----------
they're paying for my college i owe them


---------16:38----------
like some degree of like work right


---------16:40----------
because they're paying for me so i


---------16:41----------
should do this


---------16:43----------
and then what and then it's it's not


---------16:44----------
like a vague should it actually even


---------16:46----------
though they use the word should it


---------16:47----------
crosses over into duty and then we see a


---------16:49----------
positive behavioral change once you


---------16:51----------
align studying with their values we see


---------16:53----------
a positive behavioral change because


---------16:55----------
then even if you're if you're giving


---------16:57----------
something up even if there's a loss


---------16:59----------
involved if it kind of like if you're


---------17:01----------
giving something up but you can make


---------17:03----------
that class your own like if you kind of


---------17:05----------
say okay well i'm in college i'm


---------17:07----------
studying finance but i really care about


---------17:08----------
philosophy and what i'm going to do is


---------17:10----------
like minor in philosophy and you sort of


---------17:12----------
help them sort of uncover


---------17:14----------
you know some plan to help them act in a


---------17:17----------
way that's aligned with their values and


---------17:18----------
you'll see positive behavioral change


---------17:20----------
okay does that make sense


---------17:26----------
okay yes so the second thing so the key


---------17:29----------
takeaway here is that you know as a


---------17:31----------
coach what you want to do is clarify


---------17:33----------
like what is driving this person clarify


---------17:36----------
their intent and as you clarify that


---------17:38----------
their intent you can start to ask them


---------17:40----------
questions that sort of


---------17:42----------
help them understand like what is on


---------17:44----------
this side of the equation and how do we


---------17:46----------
get from like this side of the equation


---------17:48----------
to this side of the equation how do we


---------17:50----------
get and what's the conflict that they


---------17:52----------
face and the cool thing about human


---------17:54----------
beings is once you bring a subconscious


---------17:56----------
conflict to the surface in a conscious


---------17:58----------
manner it tends to move towards the


---------18:00----------
right direction okay


---------18:03----------
so that those are the four types of


---------18:04----------
intent any questions before we move on


---------18:09----------
okay


---------18:11----------
so the next thing that we're going to do


---------18:13----------
is talk about raising the uh the


---------18:15----------
awareness of negative


---------18:19----------
so this is a big problem that a lot of


---------18:21----------
people who set goals and like have


---------18:22----------
intent you know these kind of intent


---------18:24----------
problems have which is that they don't


---------18:27----------
really appreciate the negative so when


---------18:28----------
someone talks about a goal


---------18:30----------
like and they say like okay my goal is


---------18:32----------
to study every day like what kind of


---------18:36----------
you know is that like a positive thing


---------18:37----------
in their mind or a negative thing in


---------18:38----------
their mind


---------18:40----------
when people think about like meeting


---------18:42----------
their goals so what is like the


---------18:43----------
emotional energy behind that what's the


---------18:45----------
valence there


---------18:50----------
some part of it is like resemblance or


---------18:52----------
the situation they're in ah okay


---------18:55----------
great good


---------18:58----------
is that conscious or unconscious


---------19:05----------
what do you would say unconscious


---------19:07----------
yeah i mean they may be somewhat


---------19:08----------
conscious of it but for the most part


---------19:10----------
it's unconscious right so when i think


---------19:11----------
about losing weight


---------19:13----------
is that idea filled with resentment or


---------19:16----------
like


---------19:17----------
or what


---------19:18----------
right when i think about getting a 4.0


---------19:20----------
gpa like is the primary emotion that i


---------19:23----------
feel when i think about that resentment


---------19:30----------
what's the primary emotion that people


---------19:32----------
feel when they they kind of think about


---------19:33----------
fulfilling their goals


---------19:37----------
some kind of excitement yeah so it's


---------19:40----------
positive in nature right so it's like


---------19:41----------
exciting


---------19:43----------
achievement


---------19:45----------
pride


---------19:50----------
right so this is interesting so like


---------19:52----------
when someone's is kind of thinking about


---------19:54----------
their goals in a very positive manner


---------19:58----------
um you know you're i'm gonna post it on


---------19:59----------
social media like i'm gonna advertise


---------20:01----------
i'm gonna get into harvard and i'm gonna


---------20:03----------
like buy a harvard hoodie in a harvard


---------20:05----------
hat and then a harvard bumper sticker


---------20:07----------
and then everyone's gonna know i went to


---------20:09----------
harvard it's gonna be great


---------20:12----------
so what happens when they sort of have


---------20:14----------
all of these like positive like


---------20:16----------
expectations or ideas of achieving their


---------20:19----------
goals and they set out to actually like


---------20:21----------
achieve their goals


---------20:27----------
doesn't easily work sustainably


---------20:30----------
why not


---------20:32----------
because part of their brain is sort of


---------20:34----------
thought that they've already done it and


---------20:36----------
so there's less motivation to do it and


---------20:38----------
part of it is that whenever there's like


---------20:40----------
an implicit judgment about what you're


---------20:42----------
doing it's like putting white gas in


---------20:43----------
your car like it'll kind of get you


---------20:45----------
going for a little while like you can do


---------20:47----------
almost anything for a week or two and


---------20:49----------
then it's just not going to work all


---------20:50----------
that well


---------20:51----------
okay excellent someone's been watching


---------20:53----------
dr k's guide i think


---------20:56----------
their motivation is hinged oh sorry


---------20:59----------
allen go ahead oh it's just gonna say


---------21:01----------
yeah it's pretty good have you have you


---------21:02----------
seen it


---------21:04----------
steve


---------21:06----------
i was gonna say their motivation is


---------21:07----------
hinged on the outcome not absent their


---------21:10----------
action


---------21:11----------
right so when we so when we people think


---------21:14----------
about goals in a positive way which is


---------21:17----------
like sort of how we defaultly think


---------21:18----------
about them it's like it's a weird


---------21:19----------
sentence to say because like of course


---------21:21----------
we want to achieve our goals like why do


---------21:22----------
we want to achieve our goals because of


---------21:23----------
like some something positive duh that's


---------21:25----------
why they're my goals to begin with but


---------21:27----------
there's interesting it's interesting


---------21:29----------
because what actually happens is we


---------21:30----------
create an expectation


---------21:32----------
so let's say like i think about how


---------21:34----------
awesome it's going to be when i get into


---------21:36----------
shape it's going to be great i create


---------21:39----------
this expectation of how like i'm going


---------21:40----------
to be a chad and i'm going to go to the


---------21:42----------
beach and like it's gonna be like chad


---------21:44----------
city up in here


---------21:46----------
and then i go to the gym


---------21:48----------
and what's my experience in the gym


---------21:54----------
it's hard


---------21:55----------
yep right i'm huffing i'm puffing the


---------21:58----------
shame and afterwards people there who


---------22:00----------
are in shape and you're not oh there you


---------22:02----------
go right


---------22:04----------
and after one week


---------22:06----------
i look at my flabby ass in the mirror


---------22:08----------
and what do i see am i am i dr chad


---------22:10----------
thundercock now


---------22:14----------
his is the action that i've taken


---------22:17----------
what is the correlation between the


---------22:20----------
action that i've taken and the


---------22:21----------
expectation that i have


---------22:25----------
it's fallen way short absolutely and


---------22:28----------
then what does that do to my motivation


---------22:31----------
decrease


---------22:33----------
absolutely right


---------22:35----------
so this is the big thing like when


---------22:36----------
people come in and they're like i'm


---------22:37----------
fired up like i'm achieve this goal i'm


---------22:40----------
gonna make my life


---------22:41----------
what i want it to be


---------22:43----------
you know i'm gonna crush it


---------22:46----------
i'm gonna make a million dollars i'm


---------22:47----------
gonna get into shape i'm gonna like it's


---------22:49----------
gonna be awesome like i'm gonna do so


---------22:50----------
good


---------22:51----------
i'm gonna become a pro league of legends


---------22:53----------
player it's going to be awesome


---------22:56----------
and so like it's kind of weird but like


---------22:58----------
one of the key things we can do as a


---------23:00----------
coach is raise awareness of the negative


---------23:03----------
so a couple of important things there


---------23:04----------
the first thing that we do when we raise


---------23:06----------
awareness of the negative is we fix this


---------23:07----------
expectation issue because we set


---------23:10----------
appropriate expectations and the problem


---------23:12----------
is that when they set inappropriate


---------23:13----------
expectations and they go out and they do


---------23:16----------
something


---------23:17----------
and what happens doesn't align with


---------23:19----------
their expectations it tanks their


---------23:20----------
motivation and then they quit


---------23:24----------
right and then they feel ashamed of


---------23:26----------
themselves


---------23:27----------
and then they feel they get the identity


---------23:29----------
of a quitter


---------23:31----------
gg get wrecked noobs


---------23:33----------
game over


---------23:35----------
right so this cycle happens so fast and


---------23:37----------
it starts with here


---------23:39----------
okay or it doesn't identify the quitter


---------23:41----------
sounds harsh so they're like all these


---------23:42----------
like milder versions of this right


---------23:44----------
they're like oh i'm not good at that


---------23:47----------
like i'm good at being a programmer but


---------23:49----------
i'm like not good at actually making


---------23:50----------
video games


---------23:52----------
like you know there are things that


---------23:53----------
we've spent a decade training in and so


---------23:56----------
we'll see this a lot in our community as


---------23:57----------
well where they're like they're people


---------23:59----------
who are doing pretty well in life but


---------24:00----------
like when it comes to doing things that


---------24:02----------
they find


---------24:03----------
that they value so there are a lot of


---------24:04----------
people that can actually do the should


---------24:06----------
column really well we'll get these


---------24:08----------
people too and when you talk to them


---------24:10----------
that they feel unhappy and you talk to


---------24:11----------
them about oh you know what about things


---------24:13----------
that you value there'll be some kind of


---------24:14----------
identity thing there


---------24:16----------
right they'll feel like okay i'm not


---------24:18----------
quite as talented as like other


---------24:19----------
musicians


---------24:20----------
or they'll say things like i've already


---------24:22----------
invested so much into this career that


---------24:25----------
like


---------24:26----------
i would feel behind if i switched now or


---------24:29----------
it's too late right and if they start


---------24:31----------
saying things like that what is that


---------24:33----------
where what part of the mind is that


---------24:34----------
coming from


---------24:39----------
if they say i'm behind other musicians


---------24:42----------
because i've spent 10 years as a


---------24:43----------
programmer that's that's the ego


---------24:46----------
ego absolutely right so it doesn't have


---------24:49----------
to look like you know a quit


---------24:52----------
shamed


---------24:54----------
like neat kind of person right like th


---------24:56----------
this stuff this cycle manifests in


---------24:58----------
people who are like very healthy and


---------24:59----------
very successful it's just the way that


---------25:01----------
the mind works


---------25:02----------
so first thing that we're going to do by


---------25:04----------
raising awareness of the negative is


---------25:05----------
that we're going to like deal with the


---------25:06----------
idea of expectation and as your clients


---------25:09----------
learn how to expect


---------25:12----------
appropriate things from their actions


---------25:14----------
it'll actually like


---------25:16----------
disable this cycle and they'll be able


---------25:18----------
to retain motivation


---------25:20----------
the second thing that raising awareness


---------25:22----------
of the negative does


---------25:24----------
is


---------25:25----------
let me think about what number two is


---------25:28----------
has to do with ambivalence


---------25:32----------
okay


---------25:33----------
so can somebody define ambivalence for


---------25:36----------
me again


---------25:38----------
it's like you're sitting on the fence


---------25:40----------
absolutely right so like


---------25:43----------
on the fence


---------25:44----------
so if we kind of go back oh


---------25:47----------
if we go back to this like these


---------25:48----------
conflicts or ambivalence you'll see that


---------25:51----------
this is this is ambivalence right here


---------25:53----------
so anytime that humans have a desire to


---------25:56----------
do something or i mean i'm using the


---------25:58----------
word desire loosely here


---------26:01----------
anytime that a human wants to do


---------26:03----------
something


---------26:04----------
if they don't do it there's something


---------26:06----------
that's getting in the way and so the


---------26:08----------
other thing that happens with our


---------26:09----------
clients is like they think about


---------26:11----------
you know


---------26:12----------
what they want to accomplish but they


---------26:14----------
don't really appreciate what keeps them


---------26:16----------
from accomplishing it so this is kind of


---------26:18----------
weird but like a lot of people in in the


---------26:20----------
digital generation they say that they


---------26:22----------
lack motivation they don't lack


---------26:24----------
motivation they actually have a ton of


---------26:26----------
motivation and i want you guys to think


---------26:27----------
about this is going to sound kind of


---------26:28----------
weird


---------26:29----------
if i play a video if i wake up and i


---------26:32----------
let's say like i'm a video game addict


---------26:33----------
right and i watch video i play video


---------26:35----------
games all day long and my life is


---------26:37----------
falling apart


---------26:39----------
and i describe myself as unmotivated


---------26:41----------
what do y'all think about that


---------26:43----------
am i unmotivated


---------26:48----------
no


---------26:49----------
why do you say no david you just really


---------26:52----------
motivated to play video games absolutely


---------26:54----------
right so i want you guys to really


---------26:55----------
appreciate this


---------26:57----------
if playing video games is destroying


---------26:59----------
every dimension of my life


---------27:02----------
it's screwing up my relationships it's


---------27:03----------
screwing up my health it's screwing up


---------27:05----------
my professional prospects it's screwing


---------27:07----------
up my grades


---------27:09----------
for that high of a cost i want you all


---------27:11----------
to recognize that there must be a pro on


---------27:15----------
the other side of that equation


---------27:17----------
in order to continue that behavior and


---------27:20----------
this is the thing that no one thinks


---------27:22----------
about being a video game addict is a


---------27:24----------
huge pro in their mind but it absolutely


---------27:27----------
is because that's just like literally


---------27:28----------
how the brain works


---------27:31----------
human beings do not engage in like


---------27:33----------
generally speaking negative things we


---------27:35----------
default to things that on balance


---------27:38----------
benefit us that's how we've evolved so


---------27:41----------
how do i know like how you know how far


---------27:43----------
to hunt or what kind of territory to


---------27:45----------
have it's because on balance the pros


---------27:47----------
outweigh the cons that's just how


---------27:48----------
evolution works


---------27:50----------
so by raising awareness of the negative


---------27:52----------
we're sort of highlighting costs


---------27:57----------
oh sorry i said highly


---------28:00----------
so we highlight costs and then we kind


---------28:03----------
of like help people understand like what


---------28:06----------
is on the other side of the equation


---------28:07----------
because the other problem with people


---------28:08----------
who are unmotivated is they they just


---------28:10----------
don't understand it right they're like i


---------28:12----------
don't know every part of my life is


---------28:14----------
falling apart because i'm addicted to


---------28:16----------
video games i just don't know why i


---------28:18----------
can't do something about it there's a


---------28:20----------
huge blind spot in their mind and the


---------28:23----------
high the blind spot is actually


---------28:24----------
highlighting the costs or in a weird way


---------28:27----------
for a negative behavior it's


---------28:28----------
highlighting the benefit


---------28:32----------
so in either case it's about both sides


---------28:35----------
of the fence


---------28:36----------
okay


---------28:37----------
so the advantage of sort of highlighting


---------28:39----------
the negative or in some sense the pro


---------28:42----------
like the reason i'm talking about the


---------28:43----------
negative is when i think about okay i


---------28:44----------
want to become a doctor and that's the


---------28:46----------
goal that i have there's like a negative


---------28:48----------
to that there's a huge cost to that


---------28:49----------
which is why i'm not doing it that's why


---------28:50----------
i'm not engaging in the behavior


---------28:52----------
does that make sense so it can be


---------28:54----------
positive or negative but we're basically


---------28:56----------
talking about the flip side of the coin


---------28:57----------
and the cool thing about that is once


---------28:58----------
again we have evidence-based


---------29:00----------
motivational interviewing and once you


---------29:02----------
highlight the negative and you raise


---------29:04----------
that ambivalence and you start working


---------29:06----------
with them using the stages of change


---------29:07----------
model


---------29:08----------
that's when you start to see positive


---------29:10----------
change but that has to start with


---------29:12----------
awareness of the negative and working on


---------29:15----------
that ambivalence until you can't move


---------29:18----------
someone past ambivalence you can't move


---------29:20----------
someone past an internal conflict if


---------29:23----------
they don't know what the internal


---------29:24----------
conflict is and eventually what you want


---------29:26----------
to get to is to the point where your


---------29:28----------
client is making a choice


---------29:33----------
and once they understand that they're


---------29:35----------
making a choice every single day i have


---------29:37----------
a choice today to play league of legends


---------29:40----------
or take one insignificant step towards


---------29:42----------
the life that i want to which one am i


---------29:44----------
going to pick and once they understand


---------29:46----------
that it's going to be an insignificant


---------29:48----------
step it's going to feel insignificant


---------29:50----------
they're going to study today but it's


---------29:51----------
not going to give them a 4.0 that


---------29:53----------
they'll never get a 4.0 but who do i


---------29:55----------
want to be do i want to live a life that


---------29:57----------
is in service to my values filled with


---------30:00----------
external rewards or do i want to live a


---------30:02----------
life that is in service to what i care


---------30:04----------
about and is going to lead to internal


---------30:06----------
reward once that choice becomes clear in


---------30:08----------
their mind which you're going to help


---------30:09----------
them do and we'll explain a little bit


---------30:11----------
about the neuroscience of how that works


---------30:13----------
then they start making choices in the


---------30:15----------
right direction right and also from


---------30:17----------
motivational interviewing we know from


---------30:19----------
numerous scientific studies that this


---------30:20----------
methodology is actually effective at


---------30:23----------
creating a behavioral change in the


---------30:24----------
right direction


---------30:26----------
okay


---------30:27----------
so working on ambivalence


---------30:30----------
um


---------30:31----------
okay and then we get to the third


---------30:33----------
advantage of raising the awareness of


---------30:35----------
the negative which is that this is kind


---------30:37----------
of weird but paradoxically


---------30:42----------
so this is going to sound kind of weird


---------30:43----------
i may have kind of


---------30:45----------
spoiled you all already but once the


---------30:47----------
cost of a behavior increases in my mind


---------30:51----------
what does that actually do to my ability


---------30:53----------
or with my likelihood to engage in the


---------30:55----------
behavior


---------31:02----------
it lowers it so that's what one would


---------31:05----------
think


---------31:06----------
but paradoxically increasing cost


---------31:10----------
can sometimes


---------31:13----------
drive behavior


---------31:15----------
okay


---------31:16----------
and that may sound really weird because


---------31:19----------
it is so this is where like we're not


---------31:20----------
really sure how this works we just know


---------31:23----------
multiple instances of like human


---------31:25----------
behavior where this is the case


---------31:27----------
so the first example is actually comes


---------31:29----------
from wine tasting okay so people have


---------31:32----------
done studies on wine tasting


---------31:35----------
and like


---------31:36----------
what do you all think so if i if i blind


---------31:38----------
a group of people like let's say expert


---------31:40----------
sommeliers which are like professional


---------31:42----------
wine tasters and i blind them to a wine


---------31:44----------
like to like let's say i give them five


---------31:46----------
bottles of wine that have various costs


---------31:50----------
what do you think happens do you think


---------31:51----------
the sommeliers can tell which wine is


---------31:53----------
like


---------31:55----------
do you think they can tell that the more


---------31:56----------
expensive wine actually tastes better


---------32:00----------
no


---------32:02----------
so it's interesting because you're


---------32:03----------
correct so like people like the


---------32:05----------
interesting thing about sommeliers is


---------32:07----------
they'll agree there'll be consensus


---------32:09----------
about which wines are better than others


---------32:11----------
so they can rank the wines from one two


---------32:13----------
three four five but there will be like


---------32:16----------
no correlation with dollar signs


---------32:19----------
now they do a second experiment


---------32:23----------
where they tell them


---------32:25----------
they're not blinded to price


---------32:27----------
what do you think happens when


---------32:29----------
wine tasters are not blinded to price in


---------32:32----------
terms of how they rate wines


---------32:35----------
the more expensive ones taste better


---------32:38----------
absolutely so the price drives the


---------32:41----------
perception of quality


---------32:43----------
okay so this is like there have been


---------32:45----------
scientific studies on this


---------32:47----------
and so like like corporations use this


---------32:49----------
all the time in terms of like you know


---------32:51----------
they'll use it for sales for example so


---------32:53----------
when i say that oh this this car costs a


---------32:55----------
hundred thousand dollars but you can get


---------32:58----------
it on sale for like forty thousand


---------32:59----------
dollars there's this perception of value


---------33:03----------
that like is created by the cost that


---------33:05----------
you pay


---------33:06----------
it's kind of bizarre the other good


---------33:07----------
example of this is there have been a lot


---------33:09----------
of studies on hazing


---------33:11----------
and what effect does hazing have on


---------33:14----------
someone's like value of the group


---------33:16----------
they're being hazed to join


---------33:20----------
like if i get hey if i have to get hayes


---------33:23----------
to join a frat what happens to my


---------33:25----------
perception of the value of the frat


---------33:28----------
it goes up


---------33:29----------
absolutely


---------33:30----------
increases value and if we think about it


---------33:32----------
like if i tell you


---------33:34----------
like i'm going to tell you hey if you


---------33:36----------
want to join this frat it's going to


---------33:37----------
[ __ ] suck we're going to tie you up


---------33:39----------
naked seriously happened at


---------33:41----------
you you know the university i went to


---------33:43----------
when i was a freshman


---------33:44----------
like there was one fraternity that would


---------33:46----------
tie up their pledges naked on a tree


---------33:50----------
they'd like


---------33:51----------
tie them up onto trees and then the


---------33:54----------
people in the frat would piss on them


---------33:58----------
make you naked i'm going to piss on you


---------34:00----------
and it's going to be awful what do y'all


---------34:02----------
think like how many people do you think


---------34:04----------
dropped out of hazing like after the the


---------34:06----------
pledge process after being demeaned and


---------34:09----------
paying this huge humiliating cost


---------34:13----------
not my friend by the way but


---------34:16----------
i'll say like none


---------34:17----------
absolutely


---------34:19----------
so i know it's


---------34:20----------
weird okay like i don't understand


---------34:23----------
exactly why this happens


---------34:25----------
but as coaches like we sort of don't


---------34:27----------
care right so what we're gonna do as


---------34:30----------
coaches is we're gonna use psychology


---------34:32----------
and neuroscience to help our clients get


---------34:34----------
to where they need to go


---------34:37----------
and like we're not saying we're going to


---------34:38----------
haze them or anything like that right we


---------34:39----------
don't want to do that that's not we're


---------34:40----------
not going to be we're going to be like


---------34:42----------
authentic and compassionate but what we


---------34:44----------
can learn is that paradoxically high


---------34:46----------
front loaded costs can actually


---------34:48----------
incentivize behavior and what we see


---------34:50----------
this time and time and time again right


---------34:52----------
if you tell your client hey like what do


---------34:54----------
you think going to the gym is like


---------34:55----------
they're going to be like oh i think it's


---------34:56----------
going to be tough and you guys raise


---------34:57----------
awareness of the negative you're going


---------34:58----------
to be like it may be really hard you may


---------35:00----------
feel ashamed okay what's gonna happen


---------35:02----------
like let's think about it how are we


---------35:03----------
gonna deal with that shame where does


---------35:05----------
that shame come from like how are you


---------35:06----------
gonna feel


---------35:07----------
and then what do they say when you


---------35:09----------
actually like get them to go if you've


---------35:12----------
prepped them about the negative costs


---------35:14----------
what do they say when they come back


---------35:21----------
it wasn't that bad


---------35:23----------
absolutely so here's the key thing


---------35:25----------
all right


---------35:29----------
what does this


---------35:31----------
statement do to their motivation


---------35:38----------
how does this statement affect whether


---------35:40----------
they go tomorrow or


---------35:42----------
not it increases absolutely


---------35:50----------
right


---------35:51----------
so this is why we want to raise


---------35:52----------
awareness of the negative there are


---------35:54----------
actually multiple mechanisms that are


---------35:56----------
really important about raising awareness


---------35:58----------
of the negative the first is that we


---------36:00----------
deal with their expectations we set


---------36:01----------
appropriate expectations the second is


---------36:04----------
that by elevating the cost


---------36:06----------
so i don't know if you all have this or


---------36:08----------
if you all have ever seen this but like


---------36:09----------
we see examples of this all the time so


---------36:11----------
another good example is like you know


---------36:13----------
parents who are like living vicariously


---------36:15----------
through their children


---------36:17----------
so they've given up


---------36:18----------
so much for their child and so the value


---------36:21----------
of that sacrifice like increases in


---------36:24----------
their mind and like drives all kinds of


---------36:26----------
sometimes negative behaviors you can see


---------36:28----------
this in like narcissistic parents too


---------36:30----------
where they've like paid a big cost so it


---------36:32----------
must mean


---------36:34----------
that like there's big value to what i've


---------36:36----------
done if i quit my job and i gave up my


---------36:39----------
career to raise you


---------36:41----------
that means that i must have done a very


---------36:43----------
good job does that make sense like they


---------36:46----------
can't tolerate the idea there's a bunch


---------36:48----------
of cognitive dissonance which is


---------36:49----------
probably the mechanism here by the way


---------36:51----------
is like cognitive dissonance


---------36:53----------
is that we're sort of leveraging


---------36:54----------
cognitive dissonance in a positive way


---------36:56----------
to like get people aligned to move in


---------36:58----------
the direction that they want to go and


---------37:00----------
in the case of like narcissistic parents


---------37:01----------
it's kind of the other way around where


---------37:03----------
like to prevent that cognitive


---------37:04----------
dissonance like it feels dumb to like


---------37:07----------
pay a cost and not get value out of it


---------37:10----------
so as you sort of raise awareness of the


---------37:12----------
cost you can actually drive positive


---------37:13----------
behavior okay and then the third thing


---------37:16----------
is ambivalence and sort of working


---------37:18----------
through that ambivalence which sort of


---------37:19----------
drives people in the right direction


---------37:21----------
questions about you know how to clarify


---------37:23----------
intent or the value of raising awareness


---------37:25----------
of the negative


---------37:30----------
yeah i don't fully understand how the


---------37:33----------
last part the paradoxical thing might


---------37:35----------
work in a session so i i guess my


---------37:37----------
understanding is okay so we're going to


---------37:38----------
raise a lot of awareness of the


---------37:41----------
negatives which increases the cost and


---------37:44----------
therefore when they actually try it then


---------37:46----------
it drives the behavior more is that


---------37:49----------
what it is


---------37:50----------
so so


---------37:51----------
in session i think the main thing like


---------37:53----------
so the questions that you want to ask is


---------37:54----------
like for a given goal like what's it


---------37:56----------
going to cost you


---------38:00----------
right like that's the question you want


---------38:02----------
to ask


---------38:03----------
like what do you have to give up by


---------38:04----------
doing this


---------38:05----------
so if i start if i if the goal is to get


---------38:07----------
me to stop playing like a game all day


---------38:10----------
what do i give up what do i lose


---------38:13----------
by


---------38:15----------
not playing the game


---------38:17----------
because that's not something most people


---------38:18----------
think about what what most people just


---------38:20----------
think about is like what do i gain by


---------38:21----------
quitting gaming


---------38:24----------
and so then what happens is like they're


---------38:26----------
not aware that there's like


---------38:28----------
like and then it's kind of silly because


---------38:30----------
like when they try to give up gaming so


---------38:31----------
let's say that the advantages of gaming


---------38:33----------
is that like let's just take this


---------38:34----------
example okay so for gaming


---------38:36----------
what are the advantages if i play video


---------38:38----------
games all day like what do i get from


---------38:39----------
that


---------38:41----------
emotional suppression


---------38:43----------
absolutely


---------38:45----------
fun


---------38:47----------
distracted socialization


---------38:49----------
yep socialization


---------38:53----------
dopamine get some of that sweet sweet


---------38:55----------
dopamine or fun right


---------38:58----------
so and everyone what what people tend to


---------39:01----------
look at is like the advantages of


---------39:02----------
achieving a goal so they think like oh


---------39:04----------
my god like i'm gonna get money and i'm


---------39:07----------
gonna you know get healthy and i'm gonna


---------39:08----------
become independent


---------39:10----------
and i'm gonna be confident


---------39:12----------
right this is what they're focusing on


---------39:15----------
and then when they try to do it like


---------39:18----------
they're not prepared for like this


---------39:21----------
so like the cause they're not prepared


---------39:23----------
for the shame


---------39:24----------
they're not prepared for the loneliness


---------39:27----------
and they're not prepared for the boredom


---------39:30----------
and so if they're not like ready for


---------39:32----------
this like what's gonna happen when they


---------39:33----------
stop playing games for a day


---------39:35----------
like this is gonna hit and then like


---------39:37----------
their brain is like this feels bad


---------39:39----------
why the hell are we doing this


---------39:41----------
let's go back to the gaming like which


---------39:42----------
one do you think your brain is gonna


---------39:44----------
pick


---------39:45----------
i give you a choice red pill blue pill


---------39:47----------
one involves having fun and having


---------39:49----------
friends and one involves shame


---------39:51----------
loneliness and boredom which one are you


---------39:52----------
gonna pick


---------39:54----------
so you have to help people understand


---------39:56----------
that there's a cost


---------39:58----------
and oddly enough like


---------40:00----------
the more that you emphasize cost


---------40:02----------
so let me ask y'all like when you


---------40:04----------
emphasize cost like which way are you


---------40:06----------
moving


---------40:07----------
in this quadrant


---------40:15----------
away from desires


---------40:19----------
away from desire is sure so i'd say that


---------40:20----------
like if we think about cost right cost


---------40:22----------
is up here so like this is how you move


---------40:25----------
people in this direction


---------40:27----------
and then what you do is you help people


---------40:29----------
like okay what do you care about as you


---------40:30----------
clarify that


---------40:32----------
you know so this is how you get away


---------40:33----------
from desires absolutely and then you're


---------40:35----------
in the shoulds and then like you know


---------40:36----------
there are other techniques that you can


---------40:37----------
use to move people to the right


---------40:40----------
does that make sense


---------40:44----------
does that answer your question tom


---------40:48----------
i think so so we're trying to highlight


---------40:51----------
the


---------40:52----------
the cost that it's going to cost a lot


---------40:55----------
in terms of shame loneliness boredom and


---------40:57----------
then for some reason paradoxically that


---------40:59----------
actually drives behavior yeah so so like


---------41:03----------
you know we don't want to over emphasize


---------41:04----------
it because chances are they're blind to


---------41:06----------
it so we want to raise some awareness of


---------41:08----------
it and then what happens is like once


---------41:09----------
they know what to expect right then


---------41:12----------
we're engaging this circuit whatever the


---------41:14----------
hell this is


---------41:15----------
because then when they try and you say


---------41:17----------
hey like i think this next week so if


---------41:18----------
you want to quit gaming i'm behind you


---------41:20----------
100


---------41:21----------
i think it's going to be tough


---------41:23----------
i know you can do it bro but it ain't


---------41:25----------
going to be easy


---------41:27----------
right does that like does that make


---------41:28----------
sense in terms of a coach like as a


---------41:30----------
coach like how that will help someone


---------41:32----------
move in the right direction


---------41:34----------
yeah that that definitely helps to


---------41:35----------
clarify right so like it's like hey bro


---------41:38----------
this ain't gonna be easy


---------41:40----------
or but like this is what it could look


---------41:42----------
like so i want you to be prepared and


---------41:44----------
then you can also engage a lot of other


---------41:46----------
like super practical stuff since it's


---------41:48----------
gonna be so hard you know i know you


---------41:50----------
want to stop gaming for a week but like


---------41:52----------
you may just last one or two days at a


---------41:53----------
time how are you going to feel if you


---------41:55----------
fail after one or two days


---------41:57----------
and let's remember that this can take


---------41:59----------
practice right so then you're going to


---------42:00----------
prep them from failure you're going to


---------42:02----------
do all that kind of good stuff and then


---------42:03----------
when they come in they say okay i was


---------42:05----------
only able to make it three days and you


---------42:06----------
could say hold on a second on your first


---------42:08----------
attempt


---------42:09----------
you didn't meet your goal of one week


---------42:10----------
but you actually went 72 hours without


---------42:12----------
playing a single video game


---------42:14----------
that's amazing


---------42:17----------
and you view that as a failure


---------42:19----------
and you went 72 hours


---------42:22----------
like i can see that you didn't meet your


---------42:24----------
goal but on the flip side like if you


---------42:26----------
did it for one day if you did it for two


---------42:28----------
days and you did it for three days like


---------42:30----------
you could probably do it for three days


---------42:31----------
again


---------42:32----------
let's figure out how you can do it for


---------42:34----------
three days again you adjust their goal


---------42:36----------
we'll kind of get to that in a second


---------42:37----------
but that's the iterative aspect right


---------42:40----------
so it all kind of ties together in a


---------42:42----------
practical sense we've got you know a


---------42:43----------
list of questions and exercises by the


---------42:45----------
way and like even dialogue sample


---------42:47----------
dialogue for y'all that we'll give y'all


---------42:48----------
in the manual


---------42:50----------
okay


---------42:50----------
that'll clarify a lot of these things


---------42:52----------
okay so now we get to the fun part


---------42:55----------
presuming this hasn't been fun already


---------42:57----------
okay so now what we're gonna do


---------42:59----------
is talk about


---------43:02----------
how


---------43:03----------
awareness changes people


---------43:05----------
so here we are


---------43:09----------
saying oh just like have conversations


---------43:10----------
about their shoulds and their values and


---------43:12----------
their desires and have conversations


---------43:13----------
about this and make them aware of the


---------43:15----------
costs so the question becomes like how


---------43:18----------
does that from a neuroscience


---------43:19----------
perspective


---------43:20----------
actually result


---------43:22----------
in like changes in their behavior and


---------43:25----------
this gets really fascinating so have you


---------43:27----------
all seen the video versus nyan um video


---------43:30----------
in dr k's guide


---------43:34----------
and can anyone kind of explain like a


---------43:36----------
tldr of like what what the takeaway from


---------43:38----------
that guy does i think if i remember


---------43:41----------
correctly vidya is knowledge and yana's


---------43:44----------
understanding so it's like objective


---------43:46----------
knowledge and subjective understanding


---------43:48----------
and the differences between the two


---------43:50----------
yep so it's information


---------43:53----------
it's objective


---------43:56----------
and then neon is


---------44:01----------
understanding


---------44:04----------
and it's subjective so which one do you


---------44:06----------
think is more responsible for behavioral


---------44:08----------
change


---------44:11----------
yeah


---------44:12----------
absolutely


---------44:13----------
right so this is once again the problem


---------44:15----------
of the internet which is that we have


---------44:17----------
tons of information out there


---------44:19----------
about how to fix your life


---------44:21----------
right


---------44:22----------
available to you for the low price of


---------44:24----------
300


---------44:25----------
if you sign up now


---------44:27----------
but everyone watches these things and


---------44:29----------
like it doesn't actually change their


---------44:31----------
behavior and there's new there's tons of


---------44:32----------
information from like medical science


---------44:35----------
that


---------44:37----------
information does not change behavior


---------44:38----------
right so if i have someone who's like


---------44:40----------
smoking and i say hey if you smoke


---------44:42----------
you're gonna get lung cancer


---------44:43----------
do you want lung cancer they say no do


---------44:46----------
they quit smoking


---------44:50----------
no okay right so then the question


---------44:53----------
becomes how does awareness


---------44:56----------
go from here to here like so this is


---------44:58----------
essentially what we're gonna do we're


---------44:59----------
gonna what we focus on in coaching is


---------45:01----------
not giving them information we focus on


---------45:02----------
giving them understanding so how does


---------45:04----------
that process work so it starts by


---------45:06----------
understanding two things one is that


---------45:08----------
there's explicit memory


---------45:10----------
and there's implicit memory


---------45:13----------
okay


---------45:14----------
and then there's working


---------45:17----------
we're memory


---------45:17----------
to kind of gloss over working memory for


---------45:19----------
a second so explicit memory is


---------45:21----------
information


---------45:24----------
facts


---------45:26----------
and uh


---------45:27----------
memories


---------45:30----------
does this make sense so like if i ask


---------45:31----------
you


---------45:32----------
you know what your name is


---------45:34----------
or where was the what was the address


---------45:37----------
like what city did you grow up in


---------45:39----------
that's like explicit memory it's stored


---------45:41----------
in a particular part of the brain like


---------45:43----------
the hippocampus


---------45:45----------
okay


---------45:47----------
and then implicit memory is like is


---------45:50----------
understanding so let me give you all an


---------45:52----------
example and it's stored in other parts


---------45:54----------
of the brain so let's say i want to


---------45:55----------
learn how to play basketball


---------45:58----------
so if i want to learn how to play


---------45:59----------
basketball i go and i watch youtube


---------46:01----------
videos on basketball i go and i read


---------46:03----------
books about michael i watch the michael


---------46:05----------
jordan documentary


---------46:07----------
i learn all these facts about basketball


---------46:10----------
i study like the physics of the body and


---------46:12----------
i figure out i learn all these tips


---------46:13----------
right so people say that when you're


---------46:15----------
shooting


---------46:16----------
you should you know when you're shooting


---------46:18----------
hoops you should follow through have you


---------46:19----------
all heard that before in terms of


---------46:20----------
basketball


---------46:22----------
so i like i know all the tips


---------46:25----------
what happens when i go and play


---------46:26----------
basketball i have all the information


---------46:31----------
i'm really inexperienced and not good at


---------46:34----------
making the basket


---------46:36----------
absolutely right so it doesn't actually


---------46:38----------
translate into like


---------46:40----------
workable


---------46:41----------
information right so what happens in the


---------46:43----------
brain is we have these like infra look


---------46:46----------
we have these tips and the cool thing is


---------46:48----------
that we can turn this tip of


---------46:50----------
follow-through into understanding but


---------46:53----------
then where that lives is actually the


---------46:54----------
cerebellum for basketball


---------46:56----------
so what happens is like memories


---------46:58----------
explicit memories are stored in the


---------46:59----------
hippocampus but then what happens is


---------47:02----------
that as we catalyze understanding


---------47:05----------
that information moves from the


---------47:07----------
hippocampus to other parts of our brain


---------47:09----------
and specifically for us it moves to the


---------47:11----------
frontal lobe or the neocortex


---------47:16----------
okay


---------47:17----------
so like we can i can read i can read


---------47:20----------
about motivation there are people here


---------47:21----------
who are listening to this on stream


---------47:23----------
right now and they can understand the


---------47:24----------
concepts theoretically and they can even


---------47:26----------
i can even quiz them right like the next


---------47:28----------
day i can ask chat chat what did y'all


---------47:30----------
remember about what i said but that's


---------47:32----------
all explicit memory and it lives in the


---------47:34----------
hippocampus and they can recall it but


---------47:36----------
it's not actually going to change their


---------47:38----------
lives in order to change their lives


---------47:40----------
there's actually a very in a sense


---------47:42----------
well-known process where explicit


---------47:44----------
memories from the hippocampus


---------47:46----------
essentially get encoded in other parts


---------47:48----------
of our brain


---------47:50----------
in the cerebellum in the frontal lobes


---------47:51----------
and in parts of our cortices and once


---------47:53----------
they get encoded there then they


---------47:56----------
actually affect our behavior okay so


---------47:58----------
i'll give you all an example like once


---------47:59----------
it clicks for me that i need to follow


---------48:01----------
through when i'm shooting hoops then my


---------48:04----------
body like kind of responds but the way


---------48:06----------
that it clicks is how like how do i get


---------48:08----------
information to click with shooting hoops


---------48:10----------
how do i learn how to like


---------48:12----------
shoot effectively in


---------48:19----------
your basketball


---------48:20----------
absolutely practice i gotta be saying a


---------48:23----------
whole bunch of times


---------48:25----------
play it uh play on the court right so i


---------48:28----------
gotta get on the court


---------48:30----------
okay


---------48:31----------
so now


---------48:32----------
and this sort of makes sense right like


---------48:34----------
once i play on the court like once i


---------48:35----------
practice once i get out there once i


---------48:37----------
start fluidly applying the concepts


---------48:40----------
swimming around in the concepts i don't


---------48:41----------
quite understand it right so like a lot


---------48:44----------
of being on the court is about being at


---------48:45----------
the barrier of your understanding so let


---------48:47----------
me ask y'all


---------48:49----------
what is the mental equivalent of get


---------48:52----------
playing on the court


---------48:55----------
how do we do that


---------49:02----------
how do we get in there and actually


---------49:04----------
start shooting hoops when it comes to


---------49:05----------
mental concepts


---------49:06----------
like desires studying for just 30


---------49:09----------
minutes or whatever the applicable goal


---------49:11----------
would be nope incorrect


---------49:14----------
studying is explicit information


---------49:18----------
oh sorry i meant studying in the sense


---------49:20----------
of like if your goal is


---------49:22----------
like to get a 4.0 but the small


---------49:24----------
insignificant step is studying


---------49:27----------
then you take that small insignificant


---------49:29----------
step okay so but i can't take that small


---------49:32----------
insignificant step except right steve


---------49:34----------
like that's my whole problems i can't


---------49:36----------
study


---------49:39----------
so what's the equivalent i know it's


---------49:40----------
sort of like a read my mind question but


---------49:42----------
i'm gonna stick to this one what's the


---------49:44----------
equivalent of playing on the court when


---------49:46----------
it comes to like these mental internal


---------49:48----------
processes


---------49:50----------
picking up the ball and shooting hoops


---------49:55----------
see if chat can get it


---------50:01----------
it's not doing it


---------50:04----------
okay so i know this is this is i love


---------50:06----------
these answers


---------50:12----------
this is it this is literally what we do


---------50:17----------
right so like here's the thing


---------50:19----------
there's all this theoretical crap


---------50:22----------
floating around in their head


---------50:25----------
getting them to play with it getting


---------50:27----------
them to understand i know you guys know


---------50:28----------
this right this is literally what you do


---------50:31----------
you get on the court of the mind


---------50:34----------
and you help people like understand


---------50:35----------
these concepts they play around with


---------50:37----------
them you test it this way you test it


---------50:39----------
that way you talk about it you have


---------50:40----------
revelations you have emotional catharsis


---------50:43----------
they're starting to play with these


---------50:44----------
concepts and you're bringing it out with


---------50:46----------
them that's literally what coaching is


---------50:48----------
so that's why we do coaching in the way


---------50:50----------
that we do it so like as someone you can


---------50:52----------
explain this stuff to people but as you


---------50:54----------
all work with them as you talk about


---------50:56----------
these concepts


---------50:58----------
these concepts move from information to


---------51:00----------
understanding they start to move into


---------51:02----------
your frontal lobes and like your


---------51:04----------
neocortex and like other parts of your


---------51:06----------
brain


---------51:07----------
and then they start to actually affect


---------51:08----------
your behavior


---------51:10----------
so this is also why you know as we look


---------51:12----------
at some of the the format of coaching


---------51:15----------
why do we coach people one hour a week


---------51:18----------
over eight weeks as opposed to eight


---------51:20----------
hours in one day


---------51:23----------
what do y'all think that is


---------51:27----------
we want them to do the work


---------51:31----------
uh sure


---------51:33----------
you need practice over time


---------51:34----------
absolutely so this mechanism


---------51:38----------
when does this happen do you all know


---------51:40----------
this process right here it happens at a


---------51:42----------
very specific time


---------51:45----------
when does explicit memory get encoded as


---------51:48----------
implicit memory


---------51:50----------
when does sleeping


---------51:51----------
absolutely during sleep


---------51:55----------
okay so theoretically and we've tried


---------51:56----------
this okay so we've had coaches who will


---------51:58----------
work with clients twice a week


---------52:01----------
this is also why um


---------52:03----------
we actually like generally speaking keep


---------52:05----------
sessions to an hour because remember you


---------52:07----------
have this working memory and so your


---------52:09----------
working memory gets overwritten


---------52:15----------
after 45 minutes


---------52:19----------
so like a lot of times clients will want


---------52:21----------
like 90 minute sessions or two hour


---------52:23----------
sessions because it feels good


---------52:26----------
but what we really want is we don't want


---------52:27----------
them to lose the first 45 minutes in the


---------52:29----------
next 45 minutes so a lot of the way that


---------52:32----------
we've structured our intervention is


---------52:34----------
bait


---------52:35----------
has some of these concepts baked in that


---------52:37----------
change happens over time like sure we


---------52:38----------
sort of generically know that but


---------52:40----------
hippocampus consolidation into long-term


---------52:42----------
memory and application into your


---------52:44----------
cerebellum happens during sleep so if


---------52:46----------
you want to study effectively for


---------52:47----------
example like when i was studying in


---------52:49----------
medical school part of the reason i was


---------52:50----------
effective is because i tried to take a


---------52:51----------
nap every day because studying for four


---------52:53----------
hours at a stretch is not as effective


---------52:55----------
is start studying for two hours taking a


---------52:57----------
nap and studying for two hours you give


---------52:59----------
your brain time to consolidate that


---------53:00----------
memory and turn it into understanding


---------53:04----------
questions about this


---------53:12----------
okay right on time finish on time


---------53:16----------
all right


---------53:16----------
so let's go ahead and um


---------53:20----------
but just summarize this quickly so like


---------53:22----------
if we think about basketball right it's


---------53:24----------
essentially practice


---------53:27----------
and so what is practice for the mind


---------53:28----------
like that's what we try to do in


---------53:29----------
coaching so this is where like as you


---------53:32----------
understand these concepts as you play


---------53:34----------
with these concepts as you work with


---------53:35----------
clients over time and you kind of


---------53:36----------
reinforce them what will happen is like


---------53:38----------
these concepts will start to be


---------53:40----------
internalized by your clients and then


---------53:43----------
they'll start to affect their behavior


---------53:44----------
because then then at that point it's


---------53:46----------
working from the frontal lobe like i


---------53:48----------
don't know if this sort of makes sense


---------53:49----------
but if you look at motivation and you


---------53:52----------
think about a should


---------53:54----------
so


---------53:54----------
like when i ignore the shoulds those


---------53:58----------
shoulds are coming from explicit memory


---------54:00----------
it's like i'm sitting down i'm about to


---------54:02----------
play league of legends


---------54:04----------
first thing in the morning which is like


---------54:05----------
11 a.m for me


---------54:07----------
and then this this thought pops up this


---------54:09----------
fact pops up in my head i have a thought


---------54:12----------
that gets generated from explicit memory


---------54:14----------
that says hey you should not do this but


---------54:17----------
it does not actually drive me my


---------54:18----------
behavior when you look at people who


---------54:20----------
make behavioral changes


---------54:22----------
the thought comes from a different place


---------54:24----------
it doesn't just pop up as a fact or a


---------54:26----------
bit of information that then quickly


---------54:28----------
gets ignored it comes from a completely


---------54:30----------
different place of their brain and when


---------54:32----------
it comes from the frontal lobe then it


---------54:34----------
actually results in things like impulse


---------54:35----------
control


---------54:37----------
not a fact that is coming from their


---------54:40----------
hippocampus it's an actual understanding


---------54:42----------
that results in impulse control from the


---------54:44----------
frontal lobe does that make sense to you


---------54:45----------
all or is that like a bit too abstract


---------54:47----------
do you all know what i mean


---------54:48----------
like if you examine your own thought


---------54:49----------
process


---------54:50----------
you'll recognize like you know you have


---------54:52----------
some good behaviors and if you pay


---------54:54----------
attention to where those good behaviors


---------54:56----------
come from or where change comes from in


---------54:58----------
your mind it's not actually a fact it's


---------55:01----------
something that's coming from a different


---------55:02----------
part of your brain it's something that


---------55:04----------
reigns in an impulse and drives your


---------55:06----------
behavior and that's what the frontal


---------55:07----------
lobe does as long as it's coming from


---------55:09----------
the hippocampus as long as it's a piece


---------55:11----------
of information as long as it's vidya as


---------55:13----------
long as it is it's me telling you or


---------55:15----------
your parents telling you this is bad for


---------55:17----------
you you should stop doing it it will not


---------55:19----------
change behavior it'll just be explicit


---------55:21----------
memory


---------55:23----------
this is also why parents can tell you a


---------55:24----------
thousand times to do something


---------55:26----------
but as long as it's floating around you


---------55:28----------
can remember that they told you to do


---------55:30----------
that but as long as it's coming from


---------55:31----------
your hippocampus and explicit memory


---------55:32----------
it's not going to drive behavioral


---------55:34----------
change and so the mechanism from moving


---------55:36----------
from explicit memory to implicit memory


---------55:37----------
is literally how we have designed this


---------55:39----------
coaching intervention this is the goal


---------55:42----------
and that's why we kind of say awareness


---------55:44----------
first raise awareness raise awareness


---------55:46----------
raise awareness because raising


---------55:48----------
awareness is the process that gets you


---------55:50----------
from here to here


---------55:52----------
they have to like get it right they have


---------55:54----------
to understand it they have to be aware


---------55:56----------
of it and by the way awareness is also


---------55:58----------
what strengthens the frontal lobe so


---------56:00----------
awareness comes from the frontal lobe as


---------56:02----------
well


---------56:04----------
so from a neuroscience perspective it's


---------56:05----------
like boosting the frontal lobe
