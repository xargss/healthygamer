---------00:00----------
okay guys so it's close to the new year


---------00:03----------
a lot of people want to lose weight and


---------00:05----------
we here at healthy gamer are


---------00:07----------
here to help you do that so i'm dr k um


---------00:10----------
one of the co-founders of healthy gamer


---------00:11----------
and today i want to talk to you guys


---------00:13----------
about some of the scams of the weight


---------00:15----------
loss industry


---------00:16----------
and frankly why it's hard to lose weight


---------00:19----------
and at healthy gamer you know our main


---------00:21----------
goal is to teach people how stuff works


---------00:23----------
right


---------00:24----------
so my hope is that by explaining a


---------00:26----------
little bit about how weight loss works


---------00:28----------
some of the science behind it and also a


---------00:30----------
little bit about how the weight loss


---------00:31----------
industry works we can empower you guys


---------00:33----------
to actually achieve some of your goals


---------00:35----------
and live sort of a healthier happier


---------00:38----------
life okay


---------00:39----------
so we're gonna jump in with talking a


---------00:42----------
little bit about the diet industry


---------00:44----------
so i want you guys to just think about


---------00:46----------
this for a second so the diet industry


---------00:47----------
has been growing the wellness industry


---------00:49----------
is growing


---------00:50----------
they're now multi-billion dollar


---------00:51----------
industries we have


---------00:53----------
a lot of advances in medical science you


---------00:55----------
know a lot of people are studying


---------00:57----------
um weight loss and obesity and all these


---------00:59----------
kinds of things


---------01:00----------
we have all these qualified


---------01:02----------
professionals like nutritionists


---------01:04----------
endocrinologists medical doctors


---------01:06----------
personal trainers


---------01:07----------
there's so many people out there that


---------01:09----------
are their job is to


---------01:12----------
help you lose weight and we have a whole


---------01:14----------
industry that's spending billions of


---------01:15----------
dollars on helping you lose weight


---------01:17----------
and what's happening across the world


---------01:19----------
people are getting fatter


---------01:20----------
right so obesity is actually on the rise


---------01:23----------
and it blows my mind that this is


---------01:24----------
actually happening right now


---------01:26----------
that despite all of the advances in


---------01:28----------
medical science despite


---------01:29----------
this gigantic industry people overall


---------01:32----------
are still getting more and more obese


---------01:34----------
and more and more unhealthy


---------01:35----------
and so the question is like why is that


---------01:38----------
right so


---------01:38----------
what's going on here and can we


---------01:40----------
understand a little bit about the


---------01:41----------
science of weight loss


---------01:43----------
which may explain why actually going on


---------01:45----------
crash diets


---------01:47----------
doesn't actually help you lose weight it


---------01:49----------
actually potentially makes it harder for


---------01:51----------
you to lose weight and we'll dig into


---------01:52----------
the science behind that


---------01:54----------
so let's start by talking a little bit


---------01:56----------
about crash diets right so you guys may


---------01:57----------
have heard of


---------01:58----------
things like you know 20 30 years ago it


---------02:00----------
was the south beach diet


---------02:01----------
then people were doing this thing when i


---------02:03----------
was in college called the master cleanse


---------02:06----------
which is when you drink like a bunch of


---------02:07----------
like lemonade with cayenne pepper in it


---------02:09----------
for like five days


---------02:10----------
and nowadays everyone's like low carb


---------02:12----------
paleo like


---------02:13----------
everyone's got these kind of new diets


---------02:15----------
atkins diet whatever


---------02:17----------
and the the goal of these diets is to


---------02:19----------
kind of help you lose weight in sort of


---------02:21----------
a drastic


---------02:22----------
manner and we see this a lot where


---------02:23----------
people like oh i need to get in shape


---------02:25----------
for the summer i need to get in shape


---------02:26----------
for a wedding so like i want to lose 10


---------02:28----------
pounds


---------02:29----------
in 15 days and i heard about this person


---------02:32----------
that did it they posted it all over


---------02:33----------
their social media and instagram


---------02:35----------
so that's what i'm gonna do too and so


---------02:37----------
the diet industry loves to sell you


---------02:39----------
these kinds of


---------02:40----------
of weight loss programs right they say


---------02:42----------
stick with this diet and you'll lose


---------02:43----------
this amount of weight in this amount of


---------02:45----------
time


---------02:45----------
but the reason that all of the the diet


---------02:47----------
industry exists is because


---------02:49----------
none of those really work and what do i


---------02:50----------
mean by that i mean if we just think


---------02:52----------
about that for a second


---------02:53----------
if these solutions actually worked then


---------02:55----------
the industry wouldn't be there right


---------02:57----------
everyone would be in shape


---------02:58----------
and so if the industry is actually


---------03:00----------
growing and growing and growing


---------03:01----------
it doesn't mean that their their methods


---------03:03----------
are effective it actually means the


---------03:05----------
exact opposite


---------03:06----------
that their methods i know this sounds


---------03:08----------
really bizarre but the more that people


---------03:09----------
invest in the diet industry the more


---------03:11----------
obese we're getting


---------03:12----------
so is there actually a scientific reason


---------03:14----------
behind that and i know it sounds


---------03:16----------
absolutely crazy


---------03:17----------
but there actually is and there's


---------03:18----------
actually really strong data


---------03:20----------
that going on crash diets actually


---------03:22----------
causes you to get


---------03:23----------
fatter and the main scientific theory


---------03:26----------
that's behind this is something called


---------03:28----------
set


---------03:28----------
point theory and what setpoint theory


---------03:30----------
basically says is that your body has an


---------03:33----------
ideal weight that it homeostatically


---------03:35----------
tries to maintain


---------03:37----------
so your your body actually has an ideal


---------03:39----------
weight that it is going to try to


---------03:40----------
maintain and if you try to lose weight


---------03:42----------
it'll actually fight against you and if


---------03:44----------
you go over your


---------03:46----------
set weight it'll actually start to lose


---------03:48----------
weight and i know it sounds really weird


---------03:50----------
but let's just think about this for a


---------03:51----------
second so let's say you and your friend


---------03:53----------
may not be the same weight


---------03:55----------
even though you guys eat roughly the


---------03:57----------
same stuff right most human beings eat


---------03:59----------
around 2000 calories a day


---------04:01----------
and it's not like people who weigh 300


---------04:03----------
pounds


---------04:04----------
eat twice as many calories as people who


---------04:06----------
weigh 150 pounds


---------04:08----------
and so if we look at a population that's


---------04:09----------
roughly eating the same amount of


---------04:11----------
calories


---------04:11----------
how do we explain some people being way


---------04:14----------
heavier in some people being way lighter


---------04:17----------
well it turns out that set point theory


---------04:18----------
perfectly explains that


---------04:20----------
each of these people all of us have this


---------04:22----------
internal calculator


---------04:24----------
that tells us how much we should weigh


---------04:27----------
and so that's the idea behind set point


---------04:29----------
theory so the first study that i want to


---------04:30----------
talk to you guys a little bit about is


---------04:32----------
from the journal of nutrition


---------04:33----------
and it basically explains the concept of


---------04:36----------
of


---------04:36----------
set points which is sort of this


---------04:38----------
intrinsic biological capacity to stay at


---------04:41----------
a particular


---------04:42----------
weight so let's try to look at what


---------04:43----------
happens when people actually go on a


---------04:46----------
crash diet


---------04:46----------
so when we lose a lot of weight our


---------04:49----------
internal body is like oh my god we're


---------04:51----------
losing a bunch of weight we better


---------04:52----------
compensate for all this weight loss


---------04:54----------
because otherwise we're going to end up


---------04:55----------
in starvation


---------04:57----------
and so one of the things that it does is


---------04:58----------
it changes something called your basic


---------05:00----------
metabolic rate


---------05:01----------
it changes the way that you expend


---------05:03----------
energy and it tries to conserve that


---------05:05----------
energy


---------05:06----------
so basically in a gaming analogy what


---------05:08----------
this means is that like we're losing a


---------05:09----------
bunch of weight and then our body is


---------05:11----------
saying oh my god weight loss is op


---------05:13----------
so let's nerf weight loss and let's


---------05:15----------
change the way that our body


---------05:17----------
holds on to energy and i know this


---------05:20----------
sounds absolutely crazy but that's


---------05:21----------
exactly what happens


---------05:22----------
so there's a great study from the new


---------05:24----------
england journal of medicine which is one


---------05:26----------
of the most prestigious and


---------05:27----------
well-respected journals in the world


---------05:29----------
that basically talks a little bit about


---------05:31----------
how when you lose weight


---------05:33----------
your body compensates by slowing down


---------05:35----------
its metabolism


---------05:37----------
and so basically what it says is that


---------05:38----------
this weight loss is too drastic


---------05:40----------
let's conserve our calories let's hold


---------05:43----------
on to weight as much as possible


---------05:46----------
and the other thing that's really really


---------05:47----------
scary about this is that


---------05:49----------
there's another study in the american


---------05:50----------
journal of nutrition that suggests that


---------05:52----------
this compensatory mechanism that causes


---------05:55----------
your


---------05:55----------
body to hold on to calories when you go


---------05:58----------
through a drastic period of weight loss


---------06:00----------
actually lasts even if you gain the


---------06:03----------
weight back


---------06:03----------
so what that means is that if you go


---------06:05----------
through a drastic period of weight loss


---------06:07----------
your body thinks you're starving and it


---------06:09----------
starts to actually make changes to your


---------06:11----------
metabolism


---------06:12----------
to cause you to hold on to calories in a


---------06:15----------
more desperate way


---------06:16----------
it tries to compensate and even if you


---------06:18----------
start to gain weight again


---------06:20----------
those changes to your body those periods


---------06:22----------
of starvation will actually remain


---------06:25----------
and you'll actually start to be


---------06:27----------
potentially even go above your set point


---------06:30----------
and set a new set point that is actually


---------06:32----------
higher than your old weight and so what


---------06:34----------
this really means


---------06:35----------
it sounds absolutely crazy is that


---------06:38----------
if you do drastic weight loss your body


---------06:40----------
will try to


---------06:42----------
keep you conserving more calories and


---------06:44----------
you could actually wind up


---------06:46----------
at a higher weight than you used to and


---------06:48----------
that's actually what setpoint theory


---------06:49----------
tells us


---------06:51----------
so let's think about that for just a


---------06:52----------
second so why does our body do that and


---------06:54----------
it turns out that it's actually


---------06:55----------
evolutionary


---------06:56----------
so if we go through a period of


---------06:58----------
starvation you know


---------07:00----------
the organisms that were able to be more


---------07:02----------
calorie efficient


---------07:04----------
after those periods of starvation were


---------07:05----------
the ones that were more likely


---------07:07----------
to survive future periods of starvation


---------07:10----------
so our body basically learns from this


---------07:12----------
period of


---------07:12----------
of enforced starvation and says we


---------07:15----------
better hold on to weight as quickly as


---------07:16----------
possible or as


---------07:17----------
severely as possible and so the problem


---------07:21----------
with this is that if we kind of switch


---------07:22----------
back to the diet industry for a second


---------07:24----------
you know the diet industry is really


---------07:25----------
interesting because what it does is


---------07:27----------
it helps us lose weight for a brief


---------07:29----------
period of time


---------07:30----------
and then what inevitably happens is we


---------07:32----------
gain all the weight back


---------07:33----------
right and then something very very


---------07:35----------
important happens is that we don't blame


---------07:37----------
our physiology or the diet industry for


---------07:39----------
that what we do is we say oh my god i


---------07:40----------
lack discipline i'm lazy


---------07:42----------
i lost the weight and i just needed to


---------07:44----------
stick with the diet if only i had stuck


---------07:46----------
with the diet then i would have kept the


---------07:47----------
weight off


---------07:48----------
whereas in reality what's going on is


---------07:50----------
sure you may have deviated from the diet


---------07:52----------
because they're not really sustainable


---------07:54----------
but then we we kind of walk out of that


---------07:56----------
scenario thinking that the diet


---------07:58----------
worked but we didn't and that's not


---------08:00----------
really what's going on actually what's


---------08:01----------
going on is that the crash diet that you


---------08:03----------
went on


---------08:04----------
is actually changing your metabolism to


---------08:06----------
gain weight afterwards so it's kind of


---------08:08----------
like it's a huge scam


---------08:10----------
and a huge point of misunderstanding um


---------08:13----------
and so another thing just about a set


---------08:15----------
point theory like so a lot of people


---------08:16----------
when they diet


---------08:17----------
they diet with the idea that okay so i'm


---------08:20----------
eating 2 000 calories a day right now


---------08:21----------
i'm not gaining weight i'm not losing


---------08:23----------
weight


---------08:23----------
so if i go on a crash diet and i lose 15


---------08:26----------
pounds


---------08:27----------
and i go back to a like my regular diet


---------08:30----------
i'll stay at that new lower weight i


---------08:32----------
won't gain weight i won't lose weight


---------08:33----------
but that doesn't really work because


---------08:35----------
exactly what happens is setpoint theory


---------08:37----------
sort of kicks in and says oh my god


---------08:38----------
we've lost too much weight so


---------08:40----------
even if you eat the same amount that


---------08:41----------
you're eating right now you'll actually


---------08:43----------
gain weight and may even end up at a


---------08:45----------
higher weight than you started at which


---------08:47----------
is what's really scary


---------08:48----------
so you can go on a crash diet nowadays


---------08:51----------
they're kind of like you these no carb


---------08:53----------
diets um you can even kind of like do


---------08:56----------
all this kind of stuff and you can sort


---------08:58----------
of end up with the idea that


---------09:00----------
discipline is the problem oh you should


---------09:02----------
have stuck with it but the real truth is


---------09:04----------
that if you go on these crash diets and


---------09:05----------
if you do this this really drastic stuff


---------09:08----------
then kind of no matter what happens


---------09:10----------
you're going to sort of gain your weight


---------09:12----------
back


---------09:12----------
so what ends up happening is that you


---------09:14----------
start to view yourself as a failure


---------09:15----------
rather than the diet as a failure


---------09:17----------
and when you gain it back it becomes


---------09:19----------
this abusive cycle of like losing weight


---------09:21----------
and gaining


---------09:22----------
weight and each time you know you think


---------09:24----------
oh the diet worked but i didn't work so


---------09:26----------
then you go back to the diet


---------09:27----------
industry you buy more books you go on


---------09:29----------
another crash diet


---------09:31----------
as you go on your second crash diet your


---------09:33----------
set point actually increases further


---------09:35----------
and as you start to introduce even a


---------09:37----------
healthy normal diet


---------09:39----------
you notice that the weight actually goes


---------09:41----------
back to where you used to be


---------09:42----------
which is what most people's experience


---------09:44----------
with the diet industry is


---------09:46----------
so then we kind of get to the quite the


---------09:47----------
main question which is okay what do we


---------09:48----------
do about it right so how do we lose


---------09:50----------
weight


---------09:50----------
if crash diets don't work if the diet


---------09:52----------
industry doesn't work


---------09:54----------
how is it possible to actually lose


---------09:55----------
weight and it turns out there are a


---------09:57----------
bunch of solutions and this is


---------09:58----------
kind of what we're going to get into


---------10:00----------
there are a lot of things that you can


---------10:01----------
do once you understand what your


---------10:02----------
physiology is to actually


---------10:04----------
lead to sustained weight loss right so


---------10:06----------
we don't want to institute something


---------10:08----------
where


---------10:08----------
our body says oh my god this weight loss


---------10:10----------
is too op


---------10:12----------
nerf this this is op like let's correct


---------10:14----------
it


---------10:15----------
what we want to do is sustained weight


---------10:16----------
loss solutions


---------10:18----------
through sustained action and


---------10:21----------
they're actually really good ways to do


---------10:22----------
that really good ways to understand your


---------10:24----------
physiology that lead to


---------10:26----------
constant and relatively easily


---------10:28----------
sustainable changes to your weight


---------10:30----------
so don't crash diet because it's


---------10:32----------
actually going to make it harder to lose


---------10:34----------
weight and there's a great


---------10:35----------
there's a great paper from american


---------10:37----------
psychologists that sort of


---------10:38----------
digs into why like losing weight will


---------10:40----------
actually cause you to binge more


---------10:42----------
so here are just a couple of things that


---------10:44----------
you can do so the first thing to


---------10:45----------
understand is that sustained weight loss


---------10:47----------
is gained through sustained action


---------10:49----------
you need to change your diet on a daily


---------10:51----------
basis it can't be a temporary thing


---------10:53----------
the good news is that you may not even


---------10:54----------
need to change it much there are small


---------10:56----------
sustainable things that you can do


---------10:57----------
that will actually change your weight in


---------11:00----------
a relatively


---------11:01----------
efficient way there are all kinds of


---------11:03----------
interesting solutions that we can do


---------11:05----------
based on our understanding of science


---------11:07----------
and a good example of this


---------11:08----------
is flax seeds so flax seeds actually


---------11:12----------
increase our leptin sensitivity and so


---------11:15----------
people may ask okay what is leptin


---------11:17----------
so in our body we have two hormones


---------11:19----------
leptin and ghrelin


---------11:20----------
leptin is the hormone that tells us hey


---------11:22----------
we're feeling full


---------11:24----------
and ghrelin is the hormone that says hey


---------11:26----------
we're hungry we need to eat more


---------11:28----------
so what we find in people who are


---------11:30----------
overweight is that they are actually


---------11:32----------
resistant to leptin and so what that


---------11:35----------
means is that there's a hormone


---------11:37----------
that is telling you hey we've had enough


---------11:39----------
food


---------11:40----------
but you are resistant to that signal so


---------11:42----------
you're not really receiving that message


---------11:44----------
and flax seeds have actually been shown


---------11:46----------
to increase leptin sensitivity


---------11:49----------
so what that means is that if you're


---------11:50----------
eating a particular meal and you add


---------11:52----------
let's say like a teaspoon of flax seeds


---------11:54----------
on top literally that


---------11:56----------
meal's capacity to make you feel full


---------12:00----------
goes up with that teaspoon of flax seeds


---------12:02----------
so a lot of simple things that you can


---------12:04----------
do


---------12:04----------
that will sort of play with that


---------12:06----------
hormonal balance and allow you to


---------12:08----------
actually


---------12:09----------
feel more full and your body will start


---------12:11----------
to tell you hey we actually don't need


---------12:13----------
to eat as much because


---------12:15----------
you know your leptin is actually


---------12:16----------
functioning as normal


---------12:18----------
other things that we can do are actually


---------12:20----------
increased sun exposure


---------12:22----------
there's actually a great uh paper that


---------12:23----------
sort of explores this is a


---------12:25----------
from the medical journal medical


---------12:27----------
hypotheses


---------12:28----------
um that explores how obesity and vitamin


---------12:32----------
d


---------12:32----------
deficiency are actually linked and


---------12:34----------
there's some good evidence behind this


---------12:36----------
but some of it is also theoretical


---------12:38----------
but literally this can be as simple as


---------12:40----------
exposing yourself to sunlight


---------12:42----------
and so sun exposure may actually help


---------12:44----------
lead to weight loss through correcting


---------12:45----------
vitamin d mechanisms


---------12:47----------
and if that sounds really biz bizarre


---------12:49----------
just think for a second about you know


---------12:50----------
how your body functions


---------12:52----------
and there's a really simple um sort of


---------12:54----------
causation


---------12:56----------
between sunlight exposure and weight


---------12:58----------
gain and it's simply that people in


---------12:59----------
northern climates


---------13:01----------
are less exposed to sunlight people in


---------13:03----------
northern climates tend to have heavier


---------13:05----------
winters


---------13:06----------
and in the winter time you have less


---------13:07----------
access to food so evolutionarily what


---------13:10----------
our body does is says


---------13:11----------
oh if there's not a whole lot of


---------13:13----------
sunlight we need to store calories


---------13:15----------
so you can do something as simple as


---------13:17----------
just getting some sunlight


---------13:19----------
which actually produces vitamin d and is


---------13:22----------
more likely to make you lose weight


---------13:24----------
so these are just a couple of the


---------13:26----------
solutions that we're introducing you


---------13:27----------
guys


---------13:28----------
with today um and there are actually a


---------13:30----------
lot of other solutions that will empower


---------13:32----------
you to get control of your weight


---------13:34----------
and sort of lead to a sustained weight


---------13:36----------
loss and so we don't want


---------13:38----------
