---------00:00----------
and what am i calling you by the way


---------00:02----------
what do you go by uh you can call me


---------00:04----------
pull yeah Paul okay yeah okay so let's


---------00:10----------
get started in just a second okay


---------00:12----------
and Paul where where are you joining us


---------00:14----------
from I'm currently in London UK okay


---------00:18----------
cool


---------00:18----------
yeah feeling nervous yeah so I might as


---------00:27----------
was lined up as maybe the backup last


---------00:29----------
week so I understood that I might be


---------00:31----------
getting on the show last week but since


---------00:33----------
I didn't I had the whole week to sort of


---------00:34----------
like ponder it and be anxious about it


---------00:39----------
yeah because obviously like airing your


---------00:43----------
dirty laundry in front of a live


---------00:45----------
audience as well as a nobody is is


---------00:48----------
actually quite a daunting thing but um


---------00:51----------
I'm super excited to be on I'm a fan of


---------00:53----------
the show yes kind of weird to be on this


---------00:55----------
side of the screen you know are we a


---------00:59----------
show is that what we are I kind of feel


---------01:02----------
like maybe that's just how I rationalize


---------01:04----------
it to make it seem less the one thing I


---------01:06----------
don't know okay no I mean I think it's a


---------01:08----------
good characterization it's just I didn't


---------01:09----------
realize it so Paul you're joining us


---------01:11----------
from the UK right I think we're we're


---------01:13----------
alive yay okay so our hypetrain did


---------01:16----------
something can you explain to me what a


---------01:17----------
hype train is me yeah like do you know


---------01:21----------
what that is I got a line from from I


---------01:26----------
mean the meme is it's a scam train so


---------01:28----------
all I know is this twitches latest scam


---------01:31----------
to draw more money other people who are


---------01:32----------
foolish enough to surrender it I guess


---------01:35----------
but okay I are constantly I've ever


---------01:37----------
gotten on one myself okay so Paul so


---------01:41----------
help us understand a little bit so for


---------01:44----------
those of you who saw an ad I apologize


---------01:47----------
but Paul was just filling us in a little


---------01:49----------
bit about how daunting it is to share


---------01:51----------
your dirty laundry over the Internet in


---------01:53----------
front of thousands of people and I


---------01:55----------
completely agree with you man it sounds


---------01:57----------
daunting so tell us help help me


---------02:01----------
understand a little bit about what we're


---------02:02----------
talking about today and how we can be


---------02:04----------
right so I mean when I submitted the


---------02:08----------
application I just put down in cell is a


---------02:09----------
bit of an attention-grabber I don't know


---------02:11----------
like I don't really identify with that


---------02:13----------
term


---------02:13----------
the raw definition of it applies right


---------02:16----------
so it stands for involuntary celibate


---------02:19----------
which isn't just another way of saying


---------02:21----------
basically you can't get a girlfriend


---------02:22----------
right and that's as far as that goes


---------02:24----------
it's okay it's a it's a loaded term if


---------02:27----------
you look it up it's all kinds of


---------02:29----------
nonsense or so you like to be an insult


---------02:31----------
you also have to be a misogynist you


---------02:33----------
also have to be part of a conspiracy so


---------02:35----------
I I leave all that I'm not a so she do


---------02:38----------
okay and and so you say that you kind of


---------02:42----------
don't you do identify with being in and


---------02:45----------
celery you don't identify with being no


---------02:46----------
I actually don't okay it seems I don't


---------02:50----------
even really know like the full


---------02:51----------
definition but like sorry the raw


---------02:53----------
definition applies but if you you I


---------02:55----------
guess to be officially a member of


---------02:58----------
whatever that's all about you have to be


---------03:00----------
a whole bunch of other things which I


---------03:01----------
hope don't apply because they sound


---------03:02----------
terrible like what like a misogynist


---------03:05----------
what I mean so I guess it's thought that


---------03:09----------
in cells were a product of their own


---------03:14----------
flaws which is that you know well they


---------03:17----------
of course they can't be attracted to


---------03:19----------
something they hate right so they hate


---------03:21----------
women but also I guess they also want to


---------03:24----------
be with them I don't know okay um I


---------03:27----------
don't think that's the case I'm I hope


---------03:29----------
it's not my case I'm sure you're sure if


---------03:30----------
you go down a line a questioning little


---------03:32----------
reveal it one way or another but I don't


---------03:34----------
think that applies to me because okay


---------03:36----------
some there's some you know ladies I like


---------03:38----------
and some I don't and isn't it it's not


---------03:40----------
because they're female or or not it's


---------03:42----------
just based on something else


---------03:45----------
I'm confused what's based on something


---------03:47----------
else


---------03:48----------
I mean whether or not I like someone


---------03:51----------
isn't based on their gender is what I'm


---------03:53----------
trying to say got it okay so what do you


---------03:56----------
identify with so what what are we


---------03:58----------
talking about if we're not talking about


---------03:59----------
the whole complex of what it means to be


---------04:01----------
an insult fine


---------04:02----------
what are we talking about I guess we I


---------04:04----------
guess we're just talking about like how


---------04:07----------
is it that I have failed I'm like I'm 35


---------04:11----------
in a couple of weeks and I've never had


---------04:13----------
a girlfriend like how is it that I'm in


---------04:15----------
this situation and how is it that I


---------04:16----------
can't seem to get out of it


---------04:18----------
sure so I think that sounds applicable


---------04:20----------
to twitch like yes so so I feel a little


---------04:25----------
bit it's weird that I'm I was the one


---------04:27----------
who's picked I feel like this probably a


---------04:28----------
lot of people in chat who envy the


---------04:30----------
position I'm in they would like to be


---------04:32----------
here instead but I'm hoping the AoE


---------04:33----------
healing thing is actually gonna be


---------04:35----------
relevant to more than just me right


---------04:37----------
I hope so too because it looks like


---------04:39----------
we're not gonna be healing in cells


---------04:40----------
today because you're not in itself so


---------04:42----------
we're gonna be young people okay yeah so


---------04:46----------
I I just got to say we got it we got it


---------04:49----------
I think this is gonna be really


---------04:50----------
hopefully helpful for you and if you are


---------04:54----------
just if you if you identify as a


---------04:56----------
full-blown insel with all of the


---------04:59----------
toxicity and hatred that I know that is


---------05:03----------
perceived as I love to talk to you if


---------05:05----------
you're watching on stream is this


---------05:08----------
something you can help with oh cuz it's


---------05:09----------
nothing to do with being a healthy gamer


---------05:11----------
right I don't even know if this is like


---------05:12----------
is this something you specialize in or


---------05:14----------
like do you really is what something


---------05:16----------
that I specialize in not having a friend


---------05:18----------
or or feeling itself you don't have to


---------05:22----------
be these things just as I specialize I


---------05:25----------
mean you know how to


---------05:27----------
approach this topic which one is being a


---------05:31----------
good because it's an insular or having


---------05:33----------
trouble finding a girlfriend the


---------05:36----------
laughter the one that applies in my case


---------05:39----------
yeah so am I an expert in that no okay


---------05:44----------
so so this may surprise people I'm not


---------05:48----------
an expert in pretty much any anything


---------05:51----------
that I'm not an expert in any person


---------05:54----------
that comes on stream right so my expert


---------05:58----------
in the person but obviously you you deal


---------06:00----------
with eggs X in your day job on a regular


---------06:03----------
basis you must be pretty good at dealing


---------06:04----------
with the kinds of issues they have and


---------06:06----------
obviously you purport to be about being


---------06:08----------
healthy gamer so you must be pretty


---------06:09----------
decent at dealing with with gamers but


---------06:12----------
so this this seems like the sideline to


---------06:14----------
that yeah so um so apologies if this


---------06:19----------
gets kind of academic but I think it's


---------06:21----------
kind of a good discussion AB so you said


---------06:23----------
I work with execs so I must be good at


---------06:25----------
the issues that they have that I


---------06:27----------
actually disagree with so I think the


---------06:29----------
biggest thing that makes me effective is


---------06:31----------
that I do not assume that a class of


---------06:34----------
people has a class of issues right so


---------06:39----------
like that's what's different like that's


---------06:41----------
a big part of who I am and I think part


---------06:44----------
of the reason that I help gamers is


---------06:46----------
because I don't think that their game or


---------06:48----------
issues like the whole problem around


---------06:50----------
game or mental health is that the rest


---------06:52----------
of the world treats them like they're a


---------06:54----------
different person and so we say like oh


---------06:57----------
you're suffering because you're a gamer


---------06:58----------
it's a gamer issue and they kind of like


---------07:00----------
marginalize and get keep a community my


---------07:03----------
whole belief is that like there aren't


---------07:05----------
executive issues there aren't gamer


---------07:08----------
issues there are just people issues and


---------07:10----------
each person is individual and each


---------07:12----------
person is unique and I'm not like an


---------07:15----------
expert in ADHD do I think I can help


---------07:18----------
people with ADHD absolutely do I think I


---------07:20----------
can help people who have trouble finding


---------07:22----------
a girlfriend absolutely have I struggled


---------07:24----------
and had a lot of shame and and just been


---------07:27----------
terrible around women absolutely okay


---------07:30----------
right so like all those things are true


---------07:32----------
but I I think my whole point is that


---------07:34----------
like you shouldn't think about yourself


---------07:36----------
as a class of person because you're


---------07:40----------
right so like if you think about it you


---------07:41----------
have your own unique challenges and just


---------07:45----------
because there's an AoE effect doesn't


---------07:47----------
mean that someone who's watching you is


---------07:49----------
going to learn from you like the AoE


---------07:52----------
healing understand this very carefully


---------07:53----------
okay


---------07:54----------
the AoE healing happens because you see


---------07:56----------
something happening you see something


---------07:58----------
that you think applies to you and then


---------08:01----------
you look within yourself and you go


---------08:05----------
through it in here it's not that you


---------08:07----------
learn it from out there you actually go


---------08:08----------
through it in here and then you change


---------08:10----------
does that make sense it makes sense


---------08:15----------
logically I don't know if I can relate


---------08:18----------
to it


---------08:18----------
I can certainly honor but I think if the


---------08:21----------
short answer that you're at like short


---------08:23----------
question that you're asking is do I


---------08:24----------
think I can help you absolutely sorry


---------08:29----------
sometimes you guys have to remember that


---------08:31----------
I'm an academic and if you ask me a


---------08:32----------
simple question I'm gonna give you a


---------08:34----------
really long answer that you didn't ask


---------08:36----------
for it so I apologize but that academic


---------08:38----------
distinct I mean I think it's important


---------08:39----------
understand reasons my anxiety a little


---------08:41----------
because I know we don't have a lot of


---------08:42----------
time sure why don't we have a lot of


---------08:44----------
time well I mean there's you've got a


---------08:47----------
like maximum a couple hours and then you


---------08:49----------
have to do something else right yeah


---------08:51----------
yeah I mean a couple hours no time well


---------08:55----------
to do what I mean it's me sure I mean


---------09:00----------
like part of me like because because


---------09:01----------
well you know I watch a show very


---------09:03----------
regularly and a lot of a lot of time


---------09:05----------
like these pearls of wisdom


---------09:06----------
sometimes even like profound pearls of


---------09:08----------
wisdom they almost seem counterintuitive


---------09:09----------
out of context come out of your mouth


---------09:12----------
and they're they're amazing that's


---------09:13----------
exciting to watch and it's interesting


---------09:15----------
to learn from and I want something like


---------09:17----------
that for me that I can pin up on my wall


---------09:18----------
and if as long as I remember it every


---------09:20----------
day I'll never be an N so again you know


---------09:22----------
that's a lot to put on you it's probably


---------09:24----------
impossible but that battery you ready


---------09:25----------
for the first you ready for the first


---------09:27----------
pearl is ready the how is it that you


---------09:30----------
already got one I think well I mean


---------09:32----------
because you gave it to me buddy so just


---------09:34----------
thinking think about the way that you're


---------09:36----------
approaching your problem right you're


---------09:39----------
you're thinking that some like I'm gonna


---------09:41----------
say something magical like so here's the


---------09:42----------
thing you go by Paul right in your mind


---------09:46----------
there's the Paul before and there is the


---------09:48----------
Paul after no no before before and after


---------09:52----------
was after me


---------09:53----------
for and after the wisdom right now that


---------09:56----------
you're gonna learn something here today


---------09:58----------
that you can stick on your wall and then


---------10:00----------
your life is gonna be different that's


---------10:02----------
what I'm hearing from you I mean that


---------10:04----------
would be nice but I don't know if that


---------10:06----------
means I'm two different people I think


---------10:07----------
to absorb whatever wisdom there is is


---------10:10----------
something that is not instantaneous but


---------10:11----------
I completely agree good so let's just


---------10:14----------
let's just look at that right because I


---------10:15----------
wonder if I'm with you and I think


---------10:18----------
you're us you're clearly a very smart


---------10:20----------
guy I think you're clearly a very


---------10:22----------
logical guy and when I repeat back to


---------10:24----------
you what I hear you start to poke holes


---------10:27----------
in it which is very good but also you're


---------10:30----------
the one who gave me the image of getting


---------10:32----------
a pearl of wisdom putting it up on your


---------10:34----------
wall and then like that's like clearly a


---------10:36----------
before/after moment right does that make


---------10:39----------
sense like that image is like before


---------10:42----------
it's on the wall Paul's life is a


---------10:44----------
particular way and if I give you the


---------10:45----------
pearl of wisdom if it happens and you


---------10:48----------
are transformed I mean I would be super


---------10:51----------
wouldn't it I don't actually believe it


---------10:53----------
that's a very feasible thing but I


---------10:55----------
completely agree and just because you


---------10:59----------
don't believe it's feasible doesn't mean


---------11:00----------
that you don't want it or you don't


---------11:02----------
fantasize about it


---------11:03----------
it doesn't mean that targets high you


---------11:05----------
know set lofty goals okay sure yeah okay


---------11:11----------
so let's just put a pin in that for a


---------11:13----------
second so help me understand a little


---------11:14----------
bit about so your corner quote problem


---------11:18----------
is that it would you call it a problem


---------11:21----------
is that you haven't been able to find a


---------11:23----------
girlfriend sure that seems like a


---------11:25----------
problem


---------11:31----------
you don't seem to be identifying with it


---------11:34----------
uh what makes you say that


---------11:38----------
Oh or just your response mistake on my


---------11:42----------
part


---------11:42----------
so would you say that that that's your


---------11:44----------
problem yeah I think so okay so help me


---------11:49----------
understand of hard to nail down but yeah


---------11:50----------
it if you could go over the details and


---------11:53----------
a high level that is the problem yes


---------11:55----------
okay so tell me about the details


---------12:02----------
come on you said if you gloss over the


---------12:05----------
details then yes so that implies that


---------12:08----------
there's something a little bit more


---------12:09----------
complicated to your situation that


---------12:11----------
involves the details so let's talk about


---------12:13----------
the details yeah I don't already know


---------12:18----------
where to start with that though okay


---------12:19----------
so tell me to pause for a second okay


---------12:35----------
okay can you just tell me a little bit


---------12:37----------
about where you grew up


---------12:40----------
sure like from from like what we're


---------12:43----------
starting when not like where did you


---------12:46----------
grow up well I grew up in a few places


---------12:48----------
after I moved around a lot yeah I moved


---------12:52----------
around a lot because of my dad's job and


---------12:54----------
he's the provider so we moved wherever


---------12:55----------
it if his job is moving we're moving


---------12:57----------
okay


---------12:59----------
it's a little bit of a fragmented kind


---------13:02----------
of so that mostly happened and like in


---------13:04----------
the primary school years which is I


---------13:07----------
don't know what you call that America


---------13:09----------
but like the first school you go to yeah


---------13:11----------
sure


---------13:12----------
so from like the first time we moved as


---------13:14----------
when I was five and then the next two


---------13:15----------
years seven and then again it went


---------13:17----------
online so you sort of like you develop a


---------13:19----------
few friendships but then you have to let


---------13:22----------
them go and start again on us and I've


---------13:24----------
quite you know every two years it's


---------13:25----------
pretty regular basis about eight Wow


---------13:27----------
what kind of work was he doing um he was


---------13:31----------
a nuclear safety officer or something


---------13:33----------
interesting yeah I don't know the


---------13:38----------
details but so worked in a nuclear power


---------13:39----------
plant it sounds like it was hard to kind


---------13:42----------
of like reset in terms of friends and


---------13:44----------
stuff like that I think you grow some


---------13:47----------
kind of detachment right you sort of


---------13:49----------
like get this idea that well friends a


---------13:50----------
temporary I'm kind of worried that that


---------13:53----------
is actually like something that I


---------13:55----------
subconsciously learned from from that


---------13:57----------
but also I was never really that good


---------13:59----------
with people anyway it just made the


---------14:02----------
problem worse like whenever like yeah


---------14:05----------
please I just had this memory like from


---------14:07----------
when I was in year 3 or whatever when


---------14:09----------
you're 8 years old it's pretty early on


---------14:10----------
and I had like a group project and I


---------14:13----------
didn't I think I think my mother even


---------14:15----------
got called in like the some time later


---------14:17----------
the teacher was had a concern about my


---------14:20----------
development


---------14:22----------
like I I I preferred I didn't want to do


---------14:24----------
the group project with other people I


---------14:25----------
just I had my own ideas and I guess I


---------14:27----------
didn't want to like convince them to do


---------14:30----------
what I wanted to do it would be much


---------14:31----------
easier if I just took all the materials


---------14:33----------
and built a thing myself


---------14:34----------
whatever we were doing no I'd rather do


---------14:37----------
it might do it by myself


---------14:39----------
which caused some some concern I guess


---------14:42----------
I'm not even sure if I'm remembering


---------14:44----------
this accurately at all because it's so


---------14:46----------
long ago but I I guess I have that


---------14:49----------
memory so I must journal true so it


---------14:51----------
sounds like you you know it was


---------14:53----------
troublesome to deal with other people


---------14:55----------
and it was actually easier to just live


---------14:59----------
on your own and that's that's what I do


---------15:01----------
like in my idle life last since that


---------15:05----------
since I left home I I live very much


---------15:08----------
alone yeah so what do you think about


---------15:15----------
that I think it suits me I completely


---------15:21----------
agree then so then the question is sort


---------15:27----------
of like well is it strange that I said


---------15:30----------
that no because you this is it's almost


---------15:34----------
it's almost like a meme your personal


---------15:36----------
mean you you always you always say that


---------15:38----------
so would you like to understand why I


---------15:40----------
agree please yeah so like for you just


---------15:45----------
said right so like you said that in the


---------15:46----------
when you were 8 years old when your


---------15:49----------
personality was beginning to develop and


---------15:51----------
you were starting to become the person


---------15:52----------
that you are it just suited you to work


---------15:55----------
on your own like you just rather prefer


---------15:58----------
like you were more comfortable yeah like


---------16:00----------
it's not a stretch to then for like you


---------16:02----------
to 30 seconds later say it just suits me


---------16:05----------
to be on my own oh it's like yeah and


---------16:07----------
like you just told us well of course of


---------16:08----------
course I mean that that much is obvious


---------16:09----------
but we just jumped from me being like


---------16:11----------
eight to me being 35 and they missed out


---------16:13----------
everything in the middle and I don't


---------16:14----------
know they does it be even matter maybe


---------16:15----------
not I guess well as that doesn't pearl


---------16:19----------
of wisdom number two so just think about


---------16:22----------
that for a second fall does everything


---------16:25----------
in the middle matter


---------16:32----------
well if it doesn't they you know dig


---------16:34----------
into it right well just go just get


---------16:35----------
straight to the conclusion well yeah I


---------16:37----------
mean so I think this is an important


---------16:39----------
point to make right so we're gonna dig


---------16:41----------
into it absolutely to see if there's a


---------16:42----------
pattern that emerges but I think my


---------16:45----------
point is that like the people that we


---------16:47----------
are are formed in the past right like


---------16:50----------
that's kind of a no-brainer


---------16:51----------
right yeah this is a recurring theme for


---------16:54----------
sure from the other people you've seen


---------16:55----------
very good so what's the theme well the


---------17:01----------
theme is that how you're nurtured early


---------17:06----------
on someone's like the butterfly effect


---------17:09----------
it sort of echoes stronger and stronger


---------17:13----------
throughout the rest of your life


---------17:16----------
beautifully sad Pro acquisitive number


---------17:19----------
three so this is this is gonna be great


---------17:21----------
so like you know I was a little bit


---------17:23----------
concerned that I have to give you pearls


---------17:24----------
of wisdom but it seems like we've


---------17:26----------
swapped you I actually surprised myself


---------17:28----------
a little bit with that one but yeah yeah


---------17:31----------
what was surprising about that I thought


---------17:35----------
I'd be too nervous to come out with


---------17:36----------
anything profound in this session to be


---------17:38----------
honest that usually huh so I think


---------17:40----------
that's the first letter on the thing


---------17:43----------
that you put on your wall right so


---------17:44----------
that's you actually understanding you're


---------17:46----------
doing it already my friend but but would


---------17:49----------
you hold on so these pros are just just


---------17:51----------
like minor revelations of almost things


---------17:54----------
of the like kind of obviously I kind of


---------17:56----------
already know and putting them on my wall


---------17:57----------
isn't gonna even be like one step


---------17:59----------
towards fixing my problem these these


---------18:01----------
are not really okay Lisa don't I mean


---------18:05----------
you're kind of like smirking like gosh


---------18:06----------
you know they are so I'm not convinced


---------18:10----------
of that okay so I want to ask twitch


---------18:12----------
chat' question twitch chat and I can


---------18:15----------
mute you if you want to because I'm


---------18:16----------
going to ask him about you do you want


---------18:18----------
to hear it or do you want to I'm just


---------18:19----------
curious if they're able to receive so


---------18:22----------
twitch chat is he's squirrelly


---------18:24----------
what is this Corley is he like dodgy


---------18:28----------
like resisting dodging you guys see that


---------18:32----------
is that clear to you


---------18:33----------
well what am i dodging he's slippery


---------18:38----------
you're slippery Oh does that make sense


---------18:43----------
in what way so so what I mean by that is


---------18:46----------
like so here's the thing you come so


---------18:48----------
just notice your behavior okay you're


---------18:51----------
doing good by the way do you feel


---------18:51----------
nervous yeah probably yeah sorry that's


---------18:54----------
why I wanted was thinking about meeting


---------18:55----------
you but I just I was a little bit


---------18:57----------
curious about whether other people were


---------18:59----------
able to see what I was picking up from


---------19:01----------
you so I get the sense that you're


---------19:03----------
concerned that you can't be helped well


---------19:07----------
that was that was an initial concern but


---------19:09----------
you already you already told me that you


---------19:10----------
think I can absolutely right so does


---------19:13----------
that go away once I tell you I think you


---------19:15----------
can yeah I think it does oh I have a lot


---------19:20----------
of know what I mean you know doctor take


---------19:23----------
the wheel I actually quite happy to let


---------19:24----------
the rings go and you just you can drive


---------19:26----------
this thing I don't okay so yeah that's


---------19:28----------
what we're gonna do so I think the first


---------19:30----------
thing is that that probably over time


---------19:32----------
you've started to think and I'm


---------19:34----------
detecting from you that there's a part


---------19:36----------
of you that feels like it's it's gonna


---------19:37----------
be hard to help you or maybe that can't


---------19:40----------
be helped well I mean that's based on so


---------19:44----------
I I briefly saw a guy a CBT guy uh-huh


---------19:48----------
charged me it was charging what I


---------19:50----------
consider quite a lot of money for his


---------19:52----------
services and and this was like six years


---------19:56----------
ago or so and he sort of laughed at me


---------19:58----------
at one point when he yeah yeah that's my


---------20:02----------
reaction to when he got the idea that


---------20:06----------
maybe I would only date a virgin and I'm


---------20:08----------
oh I don't know where he got that idea


---------20:10----------
from maybe it was even true back then I


---------20:11----------
saw another case now but because I was a


---------20:14----------
virgin like oh I want someone who's like


---------20:16----------
on the same level kind of thing and he


---------20:18----------
sort of laughed like from like like


---------20:20----------
you're gonna find someone like that in


---------20:21----------
London you know I think yeah I don't


---------20:23----------
think so buddy kind of thing


---------20:25----------
and so after the session for whatever


---------20:27----------
reason you I didn't pay up front I don't


---------20:29----------
remember what the arrangement was I


---------20:30----------
think maybe you like pay at the start


---------20:32----------
the next session for both or I don't


---------20:34----------
know what the arranged mode but for some


---------20:35----------
reason I hadn't actually paid for the


---------20:36----------
session yet and he sent me packing with


---------20:37----------
some homework and this is the other


---------20:40----------
things like it's kind of like he'd


---------20:41----------
already prepared the homework so before


---------20:43----------
he'd even met me so it's like it seems


---------20:44----------
like a very standardized course and I


---------20:46----------
said to him look I got a concern like


---------20:47----------
before I come and see you again I'm just


---------20:49----------
like I'm not concerned I have a concern


---------20:51----------
that maybe you you can't like do you


---------20:53----------
believe you can help me because I mean I


---------20:55----------
got kind of got some like Hinn's like


---------20:57----------
FFT when he's like laughing I mean kind


---------20:59----------
of thing like I have a doubt so I said


---------21:01----------
to him can you can you if I'm gonna come


---------21:03----------
back for more sessions can you at least


---------21:06----------
tell me that from your point of view


---------21:07----------
this is it like you really believe


---------21:10----------
earnest in earnest that you can help me


---------21:12----------
and his response was well actually


---------21:14----------
actually actually may don't don't bother


---------21:17----------
pay me I don't know I'm not gonna see


---------21:18----------
you again


---------21:19----------
um you can keep the money so yeah I have


---------21:22----------
a doubt that I can be helped because


---------21:23----------
I've I've already failed to get help a


---------21:28----------
few times fail to get help


---------21:31----------
no no no no my friend that's not what


---------21:33----------
you failed to do it sounds like an


---------21:35----------
expert thought that you were hopeless


---------21:37----------
that's not failing to get help that's


---------21:39----------
help telling you that you can't be


---------21:42----------
helped does that make sense that's an


---------21:46----------
expert telling you that I'm giving up on


---------21:47----------
you yeah I don't know if I mean I don't


---------21:50----------
if he's a charlatan or what but I mean


---------21:51----------
he's is that how did you feel when he


---------21:54----------
said that


---------21:56----------
I don't remember his like five or six


---------21:57----------
years ago I kind of and I was very


---------22:00----------
depressed at that time I was depressed


---------22:02----------
clinically depressed and I was taking I


---------22:04----------
think so I'd tell a pram or something


---------22:05----------
okay if you know if not exactly then it


---------22:09----------
then shortly before after I don't


---------22:10----------
remember the timeframe exactly so how I


---------22:12----------
felt it probably actually made almost no


---------22:14----------
difference to my mood because my moods


---------22:16----------
already like rock bottom anyway okay at


---------22:19----------
that time so good now Paul I'm really


---------22:22----------
sorry that that happened to you that


---------22:23----------
actually sounds incredibly shitty again


---------22:27----------
it's water off a duck's back at the time


---------22:29----------
- honestly what does that mean like I


---------22:33----------
was like I would you told you didn't


---------22:34----------
really have an effect of that I recall


---------22:36----------
at the time yeah but just because it


---------22:39----------
didn't have an effect then and also it


---------22:41----------
was like the fourth so like before that


---------22:44----------
okay so definitely I was depressed I


---------22:46----------
remember that at the time I lived a


---------22:47----------
better now so before that had already


---------22:48----------
seen like three or four therapists but


---------22:50----------
bad ones because I since I was


---------22:53----------
clinically diagnosed you're entitled in


---------22:55----------
the UK to free therapy so what happens


---------22:59----------
then is you go to a center and they'll


---------23:00----------
give you the trainees you know you know


---------23:03----------
the ones that are will actually do it


---------23:04----------
for free and they're terrible they don't


---------23:07----------
they don't listen they don't take notes


---------23:08----------
they don't like one of them I most I'm


---------23:11----------
only saw for one session and I was like


---------23:13----------
nah this isn't going to work out one of


---------23:14----------
the mice office the full six though


---------23:16----------
which is what you're entitled to at the


---------23:18----------
end of the fifth session I said to her


---------23:19----------
but there's one burning thing I keep on


---------23:21----------
it I've wanted to say it's in session


---------23:22----------
one which never got around to it but can


---------23:24----------
you please remind me for session six and


---------23:26----------
I kind of I was kind of saying it


---------23:27----------
because I kind of had the feeling


---------23:28----------
because there was no like continuity


---------23:31----------
between any of the sessions so I was


---------23:33----------
kind of saying it kind of is a bit of a


---------23:35----------
[ __ ] test so for the sixth session I


---------23:37----------
turn up and it's the session concludes


---------23:39----------
and she hasn't even mentioned that the


---------23:41----------
burning thing I wanted her to remind me


---------23:43----------
to bring up and I mean all I can say


---------23:46----------
about that really it's always just under


---------23:48----------
underlines like how bad this this


---------23:49----------
therapy was it was a complete waste of


---------23:52----------
time but I guess I hope I'm such a


---------23:54----------
cheapskate I would have bought some I


---------23:55----------
guess I can't afford 500 an hour but you


---------23:59----------
know I could have spent something and


---------24:01----------
maybe got better I wasn't like my heart


---------24:04----------
was like fully in it though I didn't I


---------24:05----------
didn't fully believe that it was would


---------24:07----------
do me any good either so that's another


---------24:09----------
problem I'm a look I'm hearing you say a


---------24:11----------
lot of different things Paul on the one


---------24:14----------
hand I'm hearing you say that they did a


---------24:16----------
shitty job and on the other hand ear I


---------24:20----------
guess it was mutual we both wielded a


---------24:21----------
[ __ ] off yeah so then you're also saying


---------24:25----------
that right I'm also hearing that so this


---------24:29----------
this thread so Paul this is gonna be a


---------24:32----------
little bit tricky I'm trained in this


---------24:34----------
most human beings are not to remember


---------24:36----------
the sequence of a conversation so I'm


---------24:39----------
gonna try to point out some things to


---------24:41----------
you so this started when I asked you are


---------24:45----------
you afraid that you can't be helped


---------24:48----------
which in turn started because we had


---------24:49----------
this weird conversation about are you an


---------24:51----------
expert in this so like let's just stop


---------24:54----------
and think about that right so you start


---------24:56----------
the session by asking me are you an


---------24:59----------
expert in this


---------25:00----------
that's that starts that's not a neutral


---------25:03----------
beginning that's a like a skeptical not


---------25:06----------
skeptical is not the right word that's


---------25:07----------
actually a beginning that comes from


---------25:09----------
fear because there's a part of you that


---------25:12----------
believes that I can't help you


---------25:14----------
I believe in the possibility that you


---------25:17----------
might not be able to so yeah so so Paul


---------25:21----------
I think this is the other actually


---------25:23----------
really cool thing is that sometimes when


---------25:25----------
I reflect things back at you you


---------25:27----------
actually look at them objectively but I


---------25:29----------
think some of the statements that you


---------25:30----------
make are not coming from objective


---------25:32----------
places so you're actually like you would


---------25:34----------
be very good at CBT because like I said


---------25:38----------
as a patient or as a patient I would


---------25:41----------
love to have you as a CPT measure


---------25:43----------
because you actually CBT is about a


---------25:47----------
therapist being a mirror for you in some


---------25:51----------
people when I repeat things back they


---------25:53----------
can't like they don't CBT is like


---------25:56----------
helping you understand your thoughts and


---------25:57----------
that and you actually your thoughts do


---------25:59----------
change so the tricky thing about CBT is


---------26:02----------
like your thoughts are malleable so when


---------26:03----------
when I say you know I detect and I'm


---------26:06----------
curious of twitchchat detects this to


---------26:07----------
essentially despair despair about your


---------26:10----------
situation and despair that whether you


---------26:12----------
can be helped or not right and and then


---------26:16----------
the interesting thing though is that


---------26:17----------
when someone is in that despair like


---------26:19----------
leaks out and it starts with do you


---------26:21----------
think you can actually help


---------26:23----------
that's the first opening that's the


---------26:25----------
opening salvo to our session and and so


---------26:29----------
then but then I say yes I I can and this


---------26:32----------
is the magical thing is you say okay


---------26:33----------
that means something to me


---------26:35----------
for a lot of people if I tell them yes I


---------26:37----------
can their despair is so rigid that they


---------26:40----------
can't even like see past that but it


---------26:43----------
sounds like you can so that's fantastic


---------26:44----------
well I mean I yeah it's just I have a


---------26:47----------
lot of love for you in the work that you


---------26:48----------
do and I genuinely believe that if


---------26:50----------
you're like one of the smartest guys


---------26:51----------
I've ever known and if you say that you


---------26:54----------
can help me that's good enough for me


---------26:56----------
honestly okay good so I can't help you I


---------26:59----------
believe that I've been wrong in the past


---------27:02----------
but you know so maybe I'm the red buff I


---------27:05----------
don't know yeah I think we're gonna have


---------27:08----------
we don't have to vote on who's the raid


---------27:10----------
boss right so it's like you can't help


---------27:12----------
me if you can't help me I am


---------27:14----------
that's we'll figure that out I guess


---------27:16----------
okay so see there it is again


---------27:18----------
like you see that like there's there's


---------27:20----------
this there's a certain calcification


---------27:22----------
durst and that was a joke but like in


---------27:24----------
your mind like I think there's a part of


---------27:27----------
you that wonders whether you're the rain


---------27:28----------
boss like I'm the you're the one guy


---------27:30----------
that dr. K can't help do that does that


---------27:32----------
make sense that's exactly that's nothing


---------27:35----------
so that comes from a sense that you


---------27:37----------
cannot be helped


---------27:38----------
does that make sense it possible yeah


---------27:42----------
and that can everyone be helped with


---------27:43----------
everything I don't know okay so don't


---------27:45----------
get don't get philosophical on me so so


---------27:51----------
we're talking about you like I don't


---------27:52----------
[ __ ] know if everyone can be helped


---------27:55----------
with everything I know nothing about


---------27:57----------
that that's not what I do I don't help


---------27:59----------
everyone with everything I try to do one


---------28:02----------
person with one thing but you have a


---------28:07----------
question no okay sir so then I asked you


---------28:13----------
about you know do you feel like you can


---------28:14----------
be helped and then you tell me these


---------28:16----------
stories and what is the point of those


---------28:19----------
stories like what are you have it enjoy


---------28:21----------
the stories maybe not so much to therapy


---------28:24----------
because I feel like if you just go in


---------28:26----------
with with trainees who don't like really


---------28:28----------
know what they're doing any kind of


---------28:30----------
recipe for disaster but


---------28:31----------
I guess I didn't know that before I


---------28:33----------
tried it but anyway a specially the CBT


---------28:35----------
guy and he's chart he I was like eighty


---------28:38----------
critter time for him which seemed like a


---------28:40----------
quite a lot of money to me at the time I


---------28:42----------
kind of expected more out of that than I


---------28:46----------
got how did you feel when he said don't


---------28:49----------
worry about it mate I'm not gonna see


---------28:51----------
you again how did you feel


---------28:53----------
I told you that I was ready I don't


---------28:56----------
either I don't remember or it was just


---------28:58----------
neutral okay good to know and I also


---------29:01----------
have a terrible emotional memory anyway


---------29:03----------
I like remembering emotions isn't really


---------29:06----------
something I'm good I believe that you


---------29:09----------
did not notice or maybe even didn't have


---------29:12----------
I I accept what you're saying that you


---------29:16----------
did not notice or even a notice implies


---------29:19----------
that it could have been happening eat I


---------29:20----------
don't think you changed much or you


---------29:21----------
didn't notice much of a change based on


---------29:23----------
what he said but now expected it to even


---------29:26----------
be asking me in the first place


---------29:28----------
asking what if I'm asking him do it does


---------29:31----------
he really believe he can help me I'm


---------29:32----------
half expecting that he can't right so if


---------29:34----------
you're yeses say that you can't is just


---------29:36----------
firming what I have suspected anyway


---------29:38----------
yes very good I'm not because I'm going


---------29:40----------
to be devastated by that revelation yep


---------29:42----------
and that's still going on here you see


---------29:45----------
that like that dynamic is here so you


---------29:47----------
have more faith in me which is fantastic


---------29:49----------
but just because you have faith in me


---------29:51----------
does not mean that your attitude has


---------29:53----------
changed like so the faith in me is used


---------29:57----------
to overcome your attitude and the reason


---------30:00----------
you can overcome your attitude is


---------30:02----------
because you have a lot of faith in me


---------30:03----------
but that attitude that you cannot be


---------30:06----------
helped runs pretty deep and is pretty


---------30:08----------
strong yeah well I mean I've been on


---------30:13----------
this earth for quite a few years and


---------30:16----------
probably one of the oldest in cells


---------30:17----------
around and I've tried a lot of things


---------30:20----------
and none of them have worked so if we


---------30:23----------
put away all the stuff that's related to


---------30:25----------
maybe your area like therapy and all


---------30:27----------
that stuff I mean there's plenty of


---------30:28----------
other stuff that's more normal that I've


---------30:30----------
tried like just hanging around in bars


---------30:33----------
and clubs there's not a place I like to


---------30:34----------
be but I tried it for a while at one


---------30:36----------
point I I guess when I was depressed


---------30:38----------
especially I was like well gee you're


---------30:40----------
depressed and what are you depressed


---------30:41----------
about what you're depressed because you


---------30:42----------
can't go well why aren't you even doing


---------30:43----------
the things that you know traditionally


---------30:45----------
no


---------30:45----------
people do like go to the ghost of social


---------30:48----------
places and just hang out there I see


---------30:50----------
what happens you haven't even tried it


---------30:52----------
and you're like you're depressed but it


---------30:54----------
doesn't make sense try it well if you


---------30:55----------
got to lose at that point [ __ ]


---------30:56----------
nothing because you're depressed so I


---------30:58----------
did I didn't work out I can't tell you


---------31:01----------
the long story short didn't work out


---------31:02----------
tell me about what what happened I


---------31:06----------
thought so I heard a little while I used


---------31:09----------
to I just went to a bar and I'm teetotal


---------31:12----------
but I drank anyway because it's what


---------31:14----------
everyone else does and I didn't meet any


---------31:16----------
girls but I met some guys eventually and


---------31:22----------
they befriend I would say they


---------31:24----------
befriended me around the other way


---------31:25----------
around I'm not really like confident


---------31:27----------
enough to like opens but they just


---------31:29----------
decided to chat to me and we actually


---------31:30----------
became friends kind of


---------31:32----------
the they didn't seem to have a lot in


---------31:34----------
common with me but we did anyway and I


---------31:35----------
just hang out hung out with them and did


---------31:37----------
the things they like to do which


---------31:38----------
included like more of that but also


---------31:40----------
going clubbing which is like much harder


---------31:43----------
than just hanging out in a bar like I I


---------31:45----------
hate everything about clubs just like


---------31:47----------
everything about them


---------31:50----------
but yeah but as we did all that for a


---------31:53----------
little bit until I got until I got tight


---------31:55----------
well actually eventually they moved so


---------31:57----------
eventually they one of them went off to


---------31:58----------
Australia and the other one somewhere


---------32:00----------
else at around the same time and we when


---------32:02----------
we split then but for a little while I


---------32:04----------
tried I tried that and didn't it didn't


---------32:06----------
appeal to me and it didn't work out for


---------32:07----------
me but I was just I thought I'd give it


---------32:09----------
a go yeah very good right so once again


---------32:12----------
you're a smart guy you logically looked


---------32:14----------
at your situation and you decided that


---------32:16----------
you were going to try something and so


---------32:19----------
it sounds like you that have you tried


---------32:21----------
that a couple of different times or that


---------32:23----------
was sort of the main time uh yeah so I


---------32:26----------
just went I just went on that little


---------32:27----------
binge it was like a few months of just


---------32:31----------
going clubbing with them and drinking


---------32:33----------
with them


---------32:34----------
okay um did you meet any did you meet


---------32:40----------
any girls during that time no so no I


---------32:44----------
didn't although one of the guys was


---------32:46----------
pretty good-looking and he got off with


---------32:50----------
a few but for whatever reason his other


---------32:52----------
friend didn't and he was almost at least


---------32:54----------
to me so you know my sis is attractive


---------32:56----------
and the him and me didn't okay how do


---------33:02----------
you understand that


---------33:02----------
like if his body was also it sounds like


---------33:05----------
he's outgoing and enjoys clubbing and is


---------33:07----------
attractive like why didn't he meet any


---------33:09----------
girls over those few months let's talk


---------33:11----------
about him for a second so what the other


---------33:14----------
guy who didn't do any better than I did


---------33:16----------
yeah why didn't he yeah I guess I never


---------33:21----------
figure that out I mean why didn't you do


---------33:24----------
well let's start there well I mean I'm


---------33:27----------
overweight okay


---------33:31----------
I'm balding I don't know if you'd know


---------33:33----------
that I don't know how clearly it comes


---------33:34----------
through on the web


---------33:34----------
yeah but sure I think you've got just


---------33:36----------
standard male pattern baldness that's


---------33:38----------
right yeah yeah so like you have do you


---------33:41----------
have reasons for your failure right I


---------33:44----------
imagine that he must have too but it


---------33:47----------
wasn't really apparent to me maybe it's


---------33:49----------
just that he was overshadowed by his


---------33:51----------
friend and there wasn't enough to go


---------33:52----------
around okay


---------33:53----------
so there's another option right which is


---------33:56----------
that the duration of your experiment was


---------34:00----------
not long enough to yield a result like


---------34:04----------
if I go fishing and there's a very


---------34:07----------
veteran Fisher know I should know I know


---------34:09----------
what no no no so there was so so so to


---------34:12----------
look at them there wasn't much to choose


---------34:14----------
between them but actually the other guy


---------34:15----------
definitely was a much much looser


---------34:19----------
even if they drank an equal volumes and


---------34:22----------
even if they were equally like how to


---------34:25----------
call in that system he most definitely


---------34:27----------
more outgoing yeah


---------34:28----------
you step outside of your thought process


---------34:31----------
and I want you to pay attention to an


---------34:32----------
exchange that just happened you gave me


---------34:35----------
a scenario right you gave me the


---------34:38----------
scenario you gave me data and then I


---------34:41----------
drew a conclusion from that data and


---------34:44----------
then what did you do with the conclusion


---------34:46----------
that I drew what exactly I saw you're


---------34:51----------
kind of could so you said you said that


---------34:53----------
you know I was it was kind of weird


---------34:55----------
because he was about as good-looking and


---------34:57----------
then we talked about okay why couldn't


---------34:59----------
he find a girlfriend and you said I


---------35:01----------
don't know and then I said okay why


---------35:03----------
couldn't you find a girlfriend and you


---------35:05----------
said because I'm overweight and then I


---------35:07----------
suggested to you that perhaps there was


---------35:11----------
like something about the duration of how


---------35:13----------
long you looked which if he couldn't


---------35:15----------
find a girlfriend maybe maybe there's


---------35:17----------
like maybe it just takes longer than a


---------35:19----------
couple of months of clubbing to find a


---------35:20----------
girlfriend and then you came back and


---------35:23----------
said what well I said but I know what I


---------35:29----------
said but it's just because I read


---------35:30----------
spontaneously remembered something that


---------35:32----------
I forgot I thought I'm not disputing


---------35:33----------
that you spontaneously remember that's


---------35:35----------
not I'm not disputing that what did you


---------35:37----------
say


---------35:39----------
well I said that so that the guy who was


---------35:42----------
doing well actually did have a


---------35:43----------
differentiating factor which was that he


---------35:45----------
was more outgoing absolutely so now so


---------35:48----------
now we're gonna jump into something so


---------35:50----------
this is a cognitive bias okay so like


---------35:53----------
like this is how a cognitive bias


---------35:55----------
operates you are doing something that's


---------35:58----------
very subtle so most of the time what we


---------36:00----------
want our mind to do is we have a


---------36:03----------
particular opinion and the world gives


---------36:06----------
us data and that data should change our


---------36:09----------
opinion that's the reason that we


---------36:11----------
collect information from the world right


---------36:12----------
like if I walk outside like does that


---------36:15----------
make sense like you want your


---------36:17----------
experiences like the process of learning


---------36:19----------
is you like have a particular belief and


---------36:22----------
then the world tells you something and


---------36:24----------
your your opinion about the world should


---------36:27----------
change based on the experiments that you


---------36:29----------
perform in the world right sure yeah


---------36:32----------
yeah something very common happens with


---------36:34----------
people we're instead of using the data


---------36:37----------
to change their interpretation they use


---------36:40----------
their interpretation to change the data


---------36:43----------
well you you thing and they're really


---------36:47----------
roundabout way that I'm just making it


---------36:48----------
up it's not that you're making it up


---------36:50----------
it's true but it's that your mind is


---------36:53----------
doing this little slippery thing where


---------36:56----------
when I present something to you that


---------36:57----------
does not fit with your conclusion your


---------37:00----------
mind scans your memory further and comes


---------37:03----------
up with greater evidence to support your


---------37:05----------
existing belief I mean I just remembered


---------37:12----------
the other thing I don't know absolutely


---------37:14----------
I'm not saying you didn't remember it


---------37:15----------
you're the funny thing is you're right


---------37:17----------
so now I'm gonna give you an example


---------37:18----------
have you seen any of the videos about a


---------37:20----------
hum car and woody do you know what those


---------37:21----------
mean


---------37:23----------
so those particular terms are not once a


---------37:25----------
group okay group so so I'm gonna I'm


---------37:28----------
gonna give you an example real quick


---------37:29----------
okay because I know it seems freakin


---------37:32----------
absurd but it's not irrational what


---------37:34----------
you're doing is not irrational it's not


---------37:36----------
stupid it's literally how our mind works


---------37:38----------
okay so some so I'm gonna give you a


---------37:45----------
scenario so let's say that this is a


---------37:47----------
standard one I use so hopefully people


---------37:49----------
will remember this one so let's say that


---------37:50----------
I go into work one day and my boss yells


---------37:52----------
at me for being late let's say I work in


---------37:54----------
real estate okay I go in for work one


---------37:57----------
day my boss who's the manager so I'm one


---------38:00----------
of the people who goes around and like


---------38:01----------
sells real estate my colleagues go


---------38:03----------
around in sell real estate manager


---------38:05----------
manages the office so he says hey I'll


---------38:08----------
look you're late again you're always


---------38:10----------
late like you got a you know you got to


---------38:12----------
be like on time and stuff like that and


---------38:14----------
so like how do you think I feel when he


---------38:16----------
says that like he says in front of the


---------38:17----------
whole office well if he's gonna do it


---------38:22----------
that way you must feel a little bit


---------38:25----------
mortified absolutely right something


---------38:29----------
something happens where like when I feel


---------38:31----------
mortified and humiliated sometimes my


---------38:33----------
ego can activate and I can start


---------38:35----------
thinking things like who is he to tell


---------38:37----------
me right does that make sense like like


---------38:42----------
I sell real estate like what difference


---------38:44----------
does it make if I show up half an hour


---------38:46----------
later at work or whatever like the


---------38:50----------
important thing is that I meet my


---------38:51----------
clients on time and I sell houses like


---------38:54----------
I'm selling houses so like what does it


---------38:56----------
matter like what time I show up he's


---------38:57----------
just some office manager he's not


---------38:59----------
actually out there selling he's just


---------39:02----------
he's like making my life hard but like


---------39:04----------
it doesn't matter like whether I show up


---------39:06----------
at 9:35 an appointment at 11 o'clock


---------39:09----------
like who cares what time I get to the


---------39:11----------
office I get my work done I show up half


---------39:13----------
an hour later and I leave half an hour


---------39:15----------
later does that thought process make


---------39:18----------
sense to you that someone could think


---------39:19----------
that oh yeah some people for sure with


---------39:22----------
absolutely right that's my that I've met


---------39:24----------
and these ones yeah and and so so our


---------39:28----------
mind does something we're like like is


---------39:29----------
that thought process illogical


---------39:36----------
No


---------39:37----------
yes good insubordinate sure absolutely


---------39:41----------
so then but but our mind works in a very


---------39:44----------
very funny way it also is like super


---------39:48----------
selective about how it retrieves


---------39:49----------
memories so in that moment when I'm


---------39:51----------
feeling that way and I'm thinking these


---------39:52----------
thoughts about my boss I'm gonna gloss


---------39:54----------
over all kinds of things like for


---------39:57----------
example that the reason that the boss is


---------39:59----------
the manager is because he's the best


---------40:01----------
salesperson in the office that's how he


---------40:03----------
got promoted but in that moment like my


---------40:06----------
mind is gonna gloss away from that does


---------40:08----------
that make sense


---------40:08----------
sure right and and so you hear all kinds


---------40:12----------
of this is what we call a justification


---------40:13----------
right so I was in a marriage and I had


---------40:16----------
an affair because my partner worked too


---------40:18----------
much so like our mind does all kinds of


---------40:22----------
weird gymnastics to justify what we


---------40:25----------
believe about ourselves right so like


---------40:28----------
that's that's the way that our mind


---------40:29----------
absolves our self and responsibility


---------40:31----------
because we don't want to think that


---------40:32----------
we're a bad person so it does more


---------40:34----------
gymnastics and if you go to that person


---------40:35----------
who says that they had an affair because


---------40:37----------
their partner traveled too much for work


---------40:39----------
and you try to talk to them and you try


---------40:43----------
to like show them a different way their


---------40:45----------
mind does the same thing your mind does


---------40:46----------
which is that it comes up with more and


---------40:49----------
more data to support their existing


---------40:51----------
belief does that sound like can you


---------40:55----------
imagine that happening does that sound


---------40:56----------
reasonable to you like if I talk to an


---------40:59----------
alcoholic and I say you're an alcoholic


---------41:01----------
okay and they say you're trying to sure


---------41:04----------
okay but are you trying to convince me


---------41:05----------
that I'm wrong of something different


---------41:07----------
because if not then why are you pointing


---------41:09----------
it out I'm pointing it out to you


---------41:11----------
because I want you to understand what


---------41:13----------
your thought process is doing that your


---------41:16----------
thought process has and will point it


---------41:19----------
out to you later - okay that you have


---------41:21----------
this this option where like you know


---------41:23----------
we'll talk about something and then


---------41:25----------
you'll give me a set of data and I will


---------41:28----------
interpret that data and we'll send it


---------41:30----------
back to you based on the data that you


---------41:32----------
provide and then you will invalidate my


---------41:35----------
conclusion with additional data that's


---------41:38----------
gonna be the process by which your mind


---------41:40----------
works and we're gonna see it half a


---------41:42----------
dozen times over the next hour so just


---------41:44----------
look for it


---------41:45----------
Hey okay that's all I want to point out


---------41:48----------
okay yeah you might be right I mean I


---------41:51----------
have a lot of like stupid mind loops I


---------41:53----------
remember that from reckful show I really


---------41:55----------
identify with that thought yeah mostly


---------41:58----------
most of them come from the depression


---------41:59----------
days we sure that they stick with me


---------42:01----------
sure so I think this is a little bit


---------42:04----------
different I I'm I'm sensing that what


---------42:06----------
you're talking about is a content of


---------42:09----------
your mind is like this like that the


---------42:11----------
what I'm talking about is the process of


---------42:13----------
your mind not the content of your mind


---------42:14----------
okay sure okay so let's just keep an eye


---------42:16----------
on that because I think that there have


---------42:18----------
been many times where you've made


---------42:19----------
statements to me and I generally do this


---------42:21----------
where I repeat back to people what they


---------42:22----------
said in slightly different language and


---------42:24----------
then you kind of block so earlier if


---------42:27----------
that's what I mean by slippery but


---------42:28----------
that's okay it's not it's not your fault


---------42:30----------
I just want you to notice what your mind


---------42:31----------
is doing because why I need to notice


---------42:33----------
them huh why do I need to notice is it


---------42:36----------
like a fold or um it's not that it's a


---------42:40----------
fault


---------42:40----------
it's simply that you play video games


---------42:44----------
I've been done - okay so what do you


---------42:47----------
play these days not so much okay what


---------42:53----------
was the last thing oh lately lately


---------42:54----------
rimworld actually okay I mean I needed


---------42:56----------
it to take my mind off things RIT this


---------42:58----------
week sure cool just came yeah so so like


---------43:01----------
like if you're thinking about rim world


---------43:02----------
like what's the point behind


---------43:04----------
understanding the mechanics of rim world


---------43:08----------
what's the point yeah why would you why


---------43:11----------
do you need to understand how the game


---------43:13----------
functions like what the rules of the


---------43:14----------
game are to not die trust you do well it


---------43:20----------
it you need to understand the mechanics


---------43:21----------
right yep so why do you need to


---------43:24----------
understand the mechanics of your mind


---------43:27----------
listen isn't a life and death situation


---------43:30----------
though no it's not but it's to do well


---------43:32----------
at life right that's what the whole


---------43:35----------
stream is about is that by understanding


---------43:37----------
how your mind works okay you'll get


---------43:40----------
better at the game of life okay but yeah


---------43:44----------
what do I need to do what do I need to


---------43:46----------
do differently about the thing you were


---------43:47----------
talking about though the first thing is


---------43:49----------
to notice it because you can't you can't


---------43:52----------
change anything about your mind unless


---------43:54----------
you're aware that it's acting right so


---------43:57----------
I'm


---------43:58----------
and you and I'm learning that it in the


---------44:04----------
face of a an opposite conclusion I just


---------44:08----------
throw more supporting evidence of my


---------44:09----------
belief yes thing you're right in saying


---------44:12----------
yes that's exactly what I'm saying so I


---------44:15----------
want you to look for it okay and it's


---------44:17----------
not the tricky thing here is it's not


---------44:18----------
that you're wrong


---------44:19----------
so that is it not like I mean obviously


---------44:21----------
you know why I do it though rice because


---------44:23----------
maybe if you had that a little bit more


---------44:25----------
he might be swayed you might reconsider


---------44:27----------
I don't know absolutely because you're


---------44:29----------
convinced you're right and you're gonna


---------44:31----------
keep on giving me evidence until you


---------44:34----------
show me that I'm wrong that's how your


---------44:36----------
mind is working but what I'm saying is


---------44:38----------
that like what you're doing is you're no


---------44:39----------
longer using data from the external


---------44:42----------
world to change your view that's a


---------44:44----------
problem right so this is where like case


---------44:48----------
in point I think the reason that you


---------44:50----------
didn't find a girlfriend over three


---------44:51----------
months okay it is because the same


---------44:55----------
reason that your friend didn't find a


---------44:56----------
girlfriend over three months which is


---------44:57----------
that it's generally speaking hard to


---------44:59----------
find it a girlfriend over a three-month


---------45:00----------
period that's the reason this no right


---------45:07----------
because a three-month period is not a


---------45:08----------
sufficient time span to find a


---------45:10----------
girlfriend okay


---------45:11----------
well what kind of is the rough reference


---------45:13----------
gestation period of thought the sequence


---------45:15----------
18 months Jesus Christ okay I'm going to


---------45:20----------
speed dating next simple as the point of


---------45:21----------
that so I think the other thing that


---------45:23----------
makes it hard for you to find a


---------45:24----------
girlfriend is that like generally


---------45:25----------
speaking like you're not gonna be happy


---------45:27----------
and actively looking if you're blatantly


---------45:30----------
uncomfortable and don't enjoy what


---------45:32----------
you're doing


---------45:35----------
right like if if I'm a garbage man and I


---------45:39----------
don't like my job my chances of like


---------45:42----------
having a successful interaction with a


---------45:44----------
woman while I'm taking out someone's


---------45:46----------
trash is gonna be really low so if


---------45:50----------
you're if you're in a bar in a club and


---------45:53----------
you hate being there and you feel


---------45:54----------
uncomfortable because you it's it's it


---------45:57----------
suits you to play the game single-player


---------45:59----------
and you don't like being in this large


---------46:01----------
crowded place with thousands of people


---------46:02----------
and it like makes you socially anxious


---------46:04----------
your chances of meeting a girl not only


---------46:07----------
they like Lowe from a three-months


---------46:09----------
standpoint you're not going to show them


---------46:13----------
the attractive version of you you know


---------46:16----------
if there even is one but yeah there we


---------46:20----------
go again can't be helped you see that


---------46:23----------
that's the core belief and now when I


---------46:27----------
say there it is again you can't be


---------46:29----------
helped give me the evidence do you feel


---------46:34----------
like telling me but I really can't be


---------46:36----------
helped


---------46:36----------
somehow you feel okay good good so let's


---------46:40----------
see it no because you keep you keep


---------46:42----------
texting me on this point you already


---------46:43----------
told me I can no I'm not trying to test


---------46:49----------
you on that point I believe you that you


---------46:51----------
you believe that you can what I'm


---------46:52----------
pointing out to you is the reflexive


---------46:55----------
nature of your mind I'm not trying to


---------46:58----------
catch you I'm trying to point out to you


---------46:59----------
that you had the loss of flexion


---------47:01----------
reaction to that ball huh I didn't have


---------47:04----------
a reflexive reaction to that though no


---------47:08----------
no but you just said you just said I


---------47:10----------
don't know if I if I can if I can be all


---------47:13----------
right yeah right yeah so so that that


---------47:18----------
were that phrase that came out of your


---------47:20----------
mouth runs contrary to the belief that


---------47:24----------
you can be helped agreed well yeah I


---------47:31----------
mean


---------47:31----------
we haven't yeah well at this point in


---------47:33----------
time yeah yeah so I just want you to


---------47:35----------
notice your mind that's all I'm telling


---------47:37----------
you to do okay we're gonna this is this


---------47:39----------
like super like heady so so like let me


---------47:42----------
try to make things a little bit more


---------47:44----------
concrete for you okay so thoughts


---------47:48----------
questions actually let's just pause for


---------47:49----------
a second I didn't have anything okay I'm


---------47:56----------
gonna take a drink of water okay I


---------48:02----------
suppose the only thought I have is like


---------48:04----------
when do when do we get to the when do we


---------48:06----------
get to the fixing me part because it


---------48:07----------
seems I don't know how is this is this


---------48:09----------
is this is this this is part of it like


---------48:12----------
I feel like we're correcting god I hope


---------48:17----------
so


---------48:17----------
I just feel like it's like how does this


---------48:20----------
feel to you feels like a lot of


---------48:23----------
digression into um random things yeah


---------48:26----------
what what about what we're talking about


---------48:28----------
is random what are we talking about


---------48:31----------
we're talking about Hawaii mines work


---------48:36----------
which is group which would be fine but


---------48:39----------
it doesn't seem like it's the way in


---------48:41----------
which my mind works as it pertains to my


---------48:44----------
interaction with other people or even


---------48:47----------
like the opposite sex like it doesn't


---------48:48----------
that's not coming into it it's slow like


---------48:50----------
just about just about anything like you


---------48:56----------
are spot-on let my backstory or whatever


---------48:58----------
so so can I tell you can I I'm gonna


---------49:00----------
repeat back to you now okay so let's see


---------49:03----------
what happens so I'm guessing I'm getting


---------49:06----------
from you that we're not necessarily here


---------49:09----------
to talk about your mind in isolation and


---------49:12----------
about something random what we're here


---------49:14----------
to talk about is how your mind


---------49:16----------
interfaces with meeting other people in


---------49:19----------
relationships and how the function of


---------49:22----------
your mind interferes with you like


---------49:25----------
getting a girlfriend


---------49:27----------
sure


---------49:29----------
we're not talking about like your mind


---------49:31----------
and isolation and random things that


---------49:33----------
we're talking about these patterns and


---------49:35----------
crap like that all the patterns we're


---------49:36----------
talking about have nothing to do with


---------49:38----------
girlfriends right is that what it feels


---------49:40----------
like a digression to you yeah I guess so


---------49:42----------
yeah okay


---------49:43----------
so another way so I'm now I'm gonna try


---------49:45----------
to extend things a little bit another


---------49:46----------
way to put it is right now like we're


---------49:48----------
talking about just you we're not talking


---------49:50----------
about anything in the outside world


---------49:53----------
right okay yeah sure and and your sense


---------49:58----------
is that the solution to finding a


---------50:00----------
girlfriend is to like talk about how you


---------50:01----------
interface with the outside world yeah it


---------50:07----------
seems like it would be yeah absolutely


---------50:10----------
does seem like it would be my belief is


---------50:12----------
that it actually isn't okay so I think


---------50:16----------
your biggest problem actually comes from


---------50:18----------
here because if you think about it


---------50:22----------
statistically you're like you like you


---------50:24----------
may be overweight but like lots of dudes


---------50:26----------
are overweight lots of dudes are


---------50:28----------
partially balding in their 30s you're


---------50:30----------
not a bad-looking guy right I mean you


---------50:33----------
may think so but you know I mean I'm


---------50:35----------
pretty sure I can generally like you're


---------50:37----------
not like you're just a normal-looking


---------50:39----------
guy and and I think that the biggest


---------50:43----------
thing that's holding you back is


---------50:44----------
actually the stuff in here because in my


---------50:46----------
experience with gamers entrepreneurs


---------50:49----------
executives housewives this is what I


---------50:53----------
think it's part of me part of me thought


---------50:55----------
so too which is why I wanted to come on


---------50:57----------
very good right yeah it's not like I


---------51:01----------
thought well I'm just coming on because


---------51:03----------
I'm I like the show it's because I yeah


---------51:06----------
yeah very good


---------51:08----------
yeah yeah right so so I think that it's


---------51:11----------
clear to me that you're a smart guy and


---------51:13----------
that you've tried lots of external


---------51:15----------
things I'm not an expert in dating I'm


---------51:18----------
not an expert in how to meet women


---------51:20----------
what I'm an expert in is how your mind


---------51:22----------
works and I'm definitely detecting


---------51:25----------
things that I think would interfere with


---------51:27----------
your ability to find a girlfriend okay


---------51:31----------
and at the top at the top of the list is


---------51:33----------
the idea that you're hopeless sure it's


---------51:40----------
evidence-based but yeah absolutely right


---------51:43----------
there it is again


---------51:44----------
absolutely evidence-based it's probably


---------51:45----------
one day's mile adaptations as you call


---------51:48----------
them around yeah yeah so I don't doubt


---------51:49----------
that it's evidence-based but you see


---------51:50----------
what you did there


---------51:51----------
you're giving me evidence you're gonna


---------51:53----------
give me evidence to make sure that I'm


---------51:55----------
convinced that you are hopeless you're


---------51:58----------
like but it's evidence-based I'm


---------51:59----------
hopeless it's evidence-based that's what


---------52:01----------
you meant right I'm just I'm just


---------52:06----------
letting you know where it comes from


---------52:07----------
it's not like I just made it up I


---------52:09----------
completely agree because I think it is


---------52:10----------
evidence-based I think the reason that


---------52:12----------
you believe you're hopeless is not


---------52:14----------
because you're weak but because you were


---------52:16----------
taught so and you were signaled that by


---------52:20----------
people like that CBT therapist for their


---------52:23----------
best to abruptly terminate with a


---------52:25----------
patient and tell you yeah I'm not gonna


---------52:27----------
see you anymore is very damaging again


---------52:31----------
not really the damage had already been


---------52:33----------
done that that became way too late to


---------52:36----------
really have a significant impact so in


---------52:39----------
in the then I completely agree with you


---------52:41----------
I don't think it affected you that but I


---------52:43----------
think it affects you today because I


---------52:45----------
think it is another point of evidence so


---------52:48----------
that really think about it I don't have


---------52:51----------
to think about it


---------52:52----------
you don't have to think about you know


---------52:54----------
I'm sure you rarely think about when you


---------52:55----------
were eight years old and you didn't want


---------52:57----------
to do a group project


---------52:58----------
that's the whole point behind the


---------53:00----------
subconscious is that the actions that


---------53:02----------
occur to us and the things that happen


---------53:04----------
to us affect our behaviors in our


---------53:09----------
beliefs about ourselves without any


---------53:12----------
conscious knowledge that's like how the


---------53:15----------
mind works


---------53:16----------
hmm yeah but I guess what I'm saying is


---------53:22----------
this logged away with a bunch of [ __ ]


---------53:24----------
about the things that we probably will


---------53:26----------
never have time to discuss and maybe


---------53:27----------
don't need to but that's like a lot of


---------53:30----------
evidence that stacks up against that


---------53:33----------
would make me come to that conclusion


---------53:34----------
yeah I think so dick okay so I don't


---------53:37----------
know what you're trying to do but I


---------53:39----------
think you're so that so you are giving


---------53:43----------
me more and more ammo for my hypothesis


---------53:46----------
which is that your problem with meeting


---------53:48----------
women doesn't come from anything that


---------53:50----------
you do externally but comes from the


---------53:51----------
idea that you're hopeless and when I


---------53:53----------
tell you that you say by the way dr. K


---------53:55----------
that's a very very logical conclusion


---------53:58----------
and I have piles and piles of evidence


---------53:59----------
to believe to make me believe I'm


---------54:01----------
hopeless and I say absolutely it's


---------54:04----------
because you have all of those piles of


---------54:06----------
evidence that the hopelessness is so


---------54:08----------
strong that inner interjects into every


---------54:12----------
interaction you have with female human


---------54:14----------
beings yeah I guess it kind of its kind


---------54:19----------
of like pretty much full oh my god I


---------54:20----------
don't think even any more evidence at


---------54:22----------
this point would even make any


---------54:23----------
difference but but that's not what way


---------54:25----------
that's not gonna be a solution is it


---------54:27----------
like how do we get rid of how to be like


---------54:29----------
reprogram that absolutely so the first


---------54:33----------
thing to understand how you feeling by


---------54:37----------
the way


---------54:40----------
nothing's changed I feel like pretty


---------54:42----------
much the same okay you feel that kind of


---------54:45----------
neutral


---------54:47----------
sure yes you could say I guess you could


---------54:49----------
say that yeah okay so the your question


---------54:56----------
about reprogramming right I guess I feel


---------54:58----------
a little bit hopeful though we're


---------54:59----------
finally starting to touch on maybe like


---------55:01----------
yeah


---------55:01----------
this could this could go somewhere good


---------55:04----------
yes so that's weird because I thought we


---------55:07----------
just concluded that you have


---------55:09----------
overwhelming evidence that you're


---------55:11----------
hopeless in that well you know what


---------55:14----------
we've identified that you've identified


---------55:15----------
that as the thing that needs to change


---------55:18----------
which is see the see I mean I look I


---------55:23----------
have friends and I have colleagues and I


---------55:24----------
have people tell me things like oh you


---------55:26----------
need to you need to dress smarter or you


---------55:28----------
need to you need to get like regular


---------55:30----------
hobbies that are relatable to other


---------55:32----------
people or not you know blah blah blah no


---------55:35----------
one's ever told me you need to


---------55:38----------
like what you just said right okay


---------55:40----------
that's something new to think about this


---------55:42----------
just infuriates me to no end Paul are


---------55:45----------
you a smart guy it's not a trick


---------55:52----------
question how would I know the answer is


---------55:56----------
[ __ ] yes the answer is yes right like


---------56:01----------
okay but why are you asking me about


---------56:03----------
right now well I'm getting I'm going


---------56:05----------
somewhere I'm going somewhere it goes


---------56:07----------
let's start let's just start with laying


---------56:08----------
out or some shits are you a smart guy


---------56:10----------
I'm not trying to trap you it's not a


---------56:11----------
trick question I know I look like I'm


---------56:13----------
about to trap you I'm not gonna trap you


---------56:15----------
okay so you're a smart guy


---------56:18----------
you're a capable guy I have faith in you


---------56:19----------
as a human being okay so if you is a


---------56:24----------
smart guy if you're given a thousand


---------56:25----------
solutions like dress differently and do


---------56:28----------
this and do this if you were given a


---------56:30----------
thousand solutions to a problem of not


---------56:32----------
meeting a girl and none of those


---------56:35----------
solutions work what do we know about the


---------56:37----------
like what does that tell us


---------56:39----------
well the credible thing is like some of


---------56:42----------
them I don't want to try because they're


---------56:43----------
like they require changing fundamentally


---------56:45----------
Who I am sometimes I get suggestions


---------56:46----------
like that so then I'm thinking do I


---------56:48----------
haven't even tried them so it's got that


---------56:49----------
I might have to do this I might be gonna


---------56:51----------
have to I don't think you you are don't


---------56:53----------
change who you are


---------56:54----------
no no exactly this will leaves it leaves


---------56:56----------
room for doubt well it's something


---------56:58----------
you've not tried then people are telling


---------56:59----------
you should do it yeah so like at the


---------57:02----------
point that I'm trying to make is like if


---------57:03----------
you try a thousand solutions and you


---------57:06----------
haven't tried a thousand sure there's


---------57:07----------
stuff you haven't try and fine but


---------57:09----------
you've tried a lot of stuff right like


---------57:10----------
you've been struggling to like find a


---------57:12----------
girlfriend for years and like over a


---------57:14----------
decade it sounds like yeah well on and


---------57:17----------
off a certain point I put it at some


---------57:19----------
point I put the whole thing to bed and I


---------57:21----------
just you concluded that maybe it's just


---------57:23----------
not for me


---------57:23----------
yep but I keep but I keep seeing there's


---------57:27----------
there what what is what is that it's not


---------57:30----------
for me that's the can't be helped you


---------57:32----------
see that you're hopeless like that yeah


---------57:34----------
well the it's a you can't keep chasing


---------57:36----------
something that there's other things to


---------57:39----------
do with your time right it's kind of


---------57:40----------
like that fury 18 to like go after


---------57:42----------
something that you're clearly not good


---------57:44----------
at at some point you just [ __ ] give


---------57:46----------
up yeah how does that


---------57:56----------
that's is that it conflicting because in


---------58:00----------
some ways it's therapeutic so you no


---------58:01----------
longer to think you know I could long


---------58:02----------
have to worry about it if it's not only


---------58:04----------
a goal to strive for something that


---------58:05----------
seems hopeless


---------58:07----------
then that's therapeutic because well it


---------58:09----------
release it's comfortable because you


---------58:10----------
just couldn't use put it to bed you


---------58:12----------
don't but you keep relapsing and coming


---------58:16----------
back to this idea like so like I lost


---------58:17----------
like ten kilos or fifteen kilos a couple


---------58:19----------
years ago and I saw and then I got like


---------58:21----------
some fresh new clothes I thought well


---------58:23----------
you [ __ ] put the two and put those


---------58:25----------
two things together maybe I should give


---------58:26----------
it another shot and it didn't work out


---------58:28----------
and then like okay well [ __ ] I guess I'm


---------58:30----------
just lose more weight I know I don't


---------58:31----------
know what I don't know what I need to


---------58:32----------
try and do but you keep relapsing and


---------58:35----------
like giving in them giving it another go


---------58:36----------
because you get all these kind of like


---------58:37----------
data points from other people like that


---------58:39----------
I really [ __ ] happy in their


---------58:40----------
relationships and like you never had one


---------58:42----------
so it's like at least one I have one one


---------58:44----------
time just to see what it's like for me I


---------58:46----------
mean they sing to you having a good time


---------58:47----------
with it but so now we get to the core


---------58:51----------
okay because you have so being hopeless


---------58:55----------
is protective do you get that giving up


---------58:58----------
gives you comfort you see that and then


---------59:02----------
every once in a while your loneliness


---------59:05----------
Rises and you say I want that I'm gonna


---------59:07----------
try again you let yourself hope and wait


---------59:10----------
you let yourself hope you get smacked in


---------59:12----------
the face yeah yeah and and then being


---------59:15----------
hopeless and giving up becomes even more


---------59:18----------
comforting because you have tried and


---------59:20----------
you have tried and you have tried and


---------59:21----------
life has smacked you across the face


---------59:23----------
over and over and over again so why the


---------59:26----------
[ __ ] why the [ __ ] even bother it's


---------59:29----------
impossible let me just accept that this


---------59:32----------
is never for me let me be hopeless let


---------59:34----------
me conclude that I can't be helped


---------59:37----------
because if I tell myself I cannot be


---------59:39----------
helped I don't have to be hurt anymore


---------59:41----------
if I accept it is a isn't is it's


---------59:45----------
impossible and it's if I can do that I


---------59:48----------
can live with that because I can live


---------59:49----------
with loneliness what I can't live with


---------59:52----------
is hope and like trying again


---------59:54----------
mmm no it's just that so like let's


---------59:58----------
let's suppose it


---------60:01----------
let's just entertain for a moment the


---------60:02----------
idea that maybe actually I'm not


---------60:03----------
suitable there is no one in the world


---------60:04----------
that was made for me just let's


---------60:06----------
entertain that thought for just a second


---------60:07----------
if that was the case if you could


---------60:09----------
possibly know that from the future then


---------60:11----------
you would go back and tell yourself well


---------60:12----------
don't even waste your time with it like


---------60:14----------
focus on the things you're actually good


---------60:15----------
at and develop those even further excel


---------60:17----------
at those right why the [ __ ] it's totally


---------60:21----------
futile to spend any of that effort you


---------60:22----------
put into it if you could of course we


---------60:26----------
did week on though like he maybe maybe I


---------60:28----------
came super [ __ ] close maybe I just


---------60:29----------
needed to go a bit further than I would


---------60:30----------
who knows but like at this point you


---------60:33----------
don't know but like when you when you


---------60:34----------
start to collect so much evidence that


---------60:35----------
there seems to suggest that you just


---------60:38----------
[ __ ] not bother than like yeah so I'm


---------60:44----------
just pack it in III think I think you're


---------60:47----------
I think you're right Paul I think that


---------60:49----------
your disease or your reason to pack it


---------60:52----------
in is a very good one


---------60:54----------
this comes back to you your problem is


---------60:57----------
not that you're dumb your problem is


---------60:59----------
that you're smart your problem is that


---------61:01----------
the logical conclusions you come to have


---------61:04----------
the force of intelligence behind them


---------61:05----------
not ignorance this is what makes


---------61:08----------
cognitive bias so lethal for you because


---------61:11----------
the smarter you are the stronger the


---------61:14----------
cognitive biases which you have to


---------61:16----------
understand about cognitive biases it's


---------61:18----------
like something hijacking your IQ so the


---------61:23----------
smarter you are the harder it is to


---------61:25----------
overcome your cognitive bias because


---------61:27----------
your capacity to make logical arguments


---------61:30----------
and find evidence is very very high


---------61:32----------
which in turn makes it harder for you to


---------61:35----------
convince yourself that hopelessness is


---------61:38----------
not the right path because you've


---------61:41----------
logically you do this philosophical


---------61:43----------
thought experiment well let's assume for


---------61:45----------
a moment that like some people are meant


---------61:47----------
to be alone which is like a reasonable


---------61:49----------
assertion like not every billion not


---------61:51----------
every one of the seven billion people on


---------61:53----------
the planet like some of them have to be


---------61:55----------
alone right just statistically well it


---------61:57----------
works it works out mathematically like


---------61:59----------
if on average there's 50% male and


---------62:01----------
female


---------62:02----------
I just [ __ ] know so it was good yeah


---------62:07----------
what are you doing right now what is it


---------62:09----------
doing right now pay attention giving you


---------62:11----------
the [ __ ] data is mind Lee


---------62:13----------
[ __ ] good one I like this story but


---------62:14----------
you don't need to hear it actually good


---------62:16----------
I'm glad that you recognize that you


---------62:18----------
like it this is why your mind keeps on


---------62:22----------
going there you love that mind loop so


---------62:25----------
much because it protects you from so


---------62:27----------
many things it that mind loop and this


---------62:32----------
is why you have such a strong cognitive


---------62:34----------
bias that you can't be helped because if


---------62:36----------
you can't be helped then you can just


---------62:39----------
let abandon it all you can you can let


---------62:42----------
yourself go from the roller coaster of


---------62:45----------
hope and rejection and hurt and failure


---------62:47----------
okay but you've you've proved you've


---------62:49----------
proved that several times but when can


---------62:52----------
we start on the like how do we reprogram


---------62:54----------
it though this is how we reprogram it


---------62:56----------
how by noticing so awareness precedes


---------63:00----------
control ever had dental work done I had


---------63:06----------
a feeling yeah did you get numb they


---------63:10----------
never you up yeah yeah can you control


---------63:13----------
your mouth when you're numb well you


---------63:16----------
certainly don't want to control it


---------63:17----------
during the operation but uh yeah you can


---------63:20----------
control that what you mean you can't


---------63:22----------
feel it yeah so what happens to the


---------63:24----------
control of your mouth when you can't


---------63:25----------
feel it oh you you have to be careful


---------63:28----------
you can end up biting yourself you know


---------63:29----------
you notice you can injure yourself yeah


---------63:31----------
so as your awareness return so why would


---------63:34----------
you bite yourself it's because your


---------63:35----------
control is imperfect


---------63:36----------
it's impaired yeah by the degree of


---------63:38----------
numbness right and so if you had one


---------63:40----------
feeling it sounds like they numbed up


---------63:41----------
just one part of your mouth yeah and so


---------63:44----------
you had control over you had good


---------63:45----------
control over the last bad control over


---------63:47----------
here and you can hurt yourself as you


---------63:49----------
gain control as you gain awareness of


---------63:51----------
this part of your mouth what happens to


---------63:53----------
your control over that part of your


---------63:55----------
mouth


---------64:00----------
I mean we regain control I mean


---------64:02----------
absolutely how do you gain control by


---------64:06----------
being able to feel your mouth how does


---------64:08----------
that work Paul I'm not unknown


---------64:13----------
neuroscientist but I guess because


---------64:14----------
you're receiving signals from the nerves


---------64:16----------
in your Union your mouth and yeah so you


---------64:18----------
have no you've no [ __ ] idea all you


---------64:20----------
know is that it's true right more or


---------64:23----------
less it's like like you have to be a


---------64:25----------
neuroscientist like it's not like people


---------64:27----------
who are neuroscientists are the only


---------64:28----------
ones that can control their mouth


---------64:29----------
everyone can control their mouth sure of


---------64:32----------
course in awareness precedes control if


---------64:36----------
you ever if you're in a relationship


---------64:37----------
with someone who's super manipulative


---------64:39----------
and you don't realize what they're doing


---------64:41----------
to you you're gonna get manipulated once


---------64:43----------
you start to become aware that


---------64:45----------
manipulation is happening from your boss


---------64:47----------
or a co-worker or a partner then you


---------64:50----------
gain control over it you're like oh yeah


---------64:52----------
yes that you have to you have to learn


---------64:54----------
that in London because people will take


---------64:56----------
people will uh people will [ __ ] him and


---------64:59----------
they let you scammy whatever in they're


---------65:01----------
not travelling as well yeah if you


---------65:03----------
traveled and so as you become aware of


---------65:06----------
what they're doing how do you gain


---------65:08----------
control over your life like how does


---------65:09----------
that work like is that is awareness


---------65:12----------
enough pretty much yeah


---------65:15----------
well there you go you just have to see a


---------65:18----------
cut you have to do you have to see it


---------65:19----------
coming uh experience this a little bit


---------65:21----------
as well you have to not to deal with it


---------65:22----------
too good yep so I'm gonna take the first


---------65:28----------
answer that you gave me which is pretty


---------65:30----------
much you have to know how to do with it


---------65:34----------
absolutely but awareness is where people


---------65:37----------
fall short and this goes back to my


---------65:39----------
earlier point the reason that I don't


---------65:41----------
think you've been able to find a


---------65:42----------
girlfriend is because you've been


---------65:43----------
solving the wrong problem


---------65:44----------
you've been solving a problem that's


---------65:46----------
external wear different clothes


---------65:48----------
lose weight do this do that go to the


---------65:51----------
club all of your solutions have been in


---------65:53----------
an external space I'm sure and I think


---------65:56----------
your problem the reason you can't find a


---------65:57----------
girlfriend has nothing to do with any of


---------65:59----------
that [ __ ] because you've tried all that


---------66:00----------
[ __ ] and if that was your problem then


---------66:02----------
logically you should have found a


---------66:03----------
girlfriend yeah ergo you're treating the


---------66:07----------
wrong disease yeah okay right so in


---------66:10----------
medicine we make a diagnosis and we


---------66:12----------
provide people with a treatment


---------66:14----------
if the treatment doesn't work sometimes


---------66:17----------
it's because our diagnosis is wrong and


---------66:20----------
you've been treating external factors


---------66:23----------
time and time and time again whereas I


---------66:27----------
think what's going on is you have this I


---------66:29----------
was about to say soul-crushing but I


---------66:32----------
think what it really is so here's


---------66:34----------
another pearl for you it's a very


---------66:36----------
protective hopelessness well it's not


---------66:42----------
it's not a pearl because it doesn't it


---------66:46----------
doesn't state it doesn't state what you


---------66:47----------
need to do it just it is states of how


---------66:49----------
things are yeah which is still useful


---------66:52----------
because I would never have phrased that


---------66:54----------
I guess it is a pearl in a way it's not


---------66:56----------
it's not a lot of resolution but now we


---------67:00----------
come back to the first [ __ ] thing


---------67:01----------
that I told you which is that you're


---------67:04----------
looking for the thing that you're gonna


---------67:06----------
put on your wall that's gonna transform


---------67:07----------
your life not how it works buddy I mean


---------67:09----------
I'm not gonna put on my wool that I have


---------67:11----------
a protective shroud of hopelessness but


---------67:13----------
there's nothing you can put on your wall


---------67:15----------
this process of growth is not binary


---------67:19----------
that's my point nothing is going to feel


---------67:22----------
transformative to you but is it huge


---------67:24----------
absolutely


---------67:30----------
it's little things little things about


---------67:33----------
the way that you view yourself little


---------67:35----------
things about understanding that when you


---------67:37----------
go meet someone we are empathic human


---------67:39----------
beings and that's someone that the girls


---------67:43----------
that you meet are gonna sense within you


---------67:45----------
some degree of hopelessness that even if


---------67:49----------
you try to engage with them you are not


---------67:51----------
gonna be carefree right are you saying


---------67:54----------
that are you saying that I worry about


---------67:56----------
that or that that's actually what's


---------67:57----------
happening that people can actually sense


---------68:00----------
of it I think people can sense it


---------68:01----------
because here's what I think people sense


---------68:03----------
I don't think people sense you being


---------68:05----------
carefree and when someone is looking for


---------68:07----------
a mate the number of people who are


---------68:09----------
attracted to people who are not carefree


---------68:11----------
like that's what's attractive like


---------68:12----------
that's when you're able to be your best


---------68:13----------
self when you were unburdened it makes a


---------68:18----------
lot of sense because like how can you


---------68:19----------
because I went through a spree of speed


---------68:21----------
dating as well like I'm like a dozen


---------68:23----------
events and you meet so many people they


---------68:25----------
must have met hundreds of people and


---------68:27----------
they like they will consistently reject


---------68:28----------
you it seems like well and you only meet


---------68:30----------
them like four minutes right so they


---------68:31----------
have to they have to pick up on


---------68:32----------
something pretty [ __ ] fast so I mean


---------68:35----------
that does that does fit yeah because I I


---------68:41----------
just don't know like I wear it on my


---------68:43----------
sleeve like how how is it that [ __ ]


---------68:44----------
obvious I don't know I I don't know I


---------68:46----------
don't know either I just know that as


---------68:48----------
human beings were empathic and that I


---------68:51----------
think that like you you know when


---------68:53----------
someone is carefree and when someone is


---------68:54----------
burdened right


---------68:56----------
I don't do you know it in the first four


---------69:02----------
minutes of meeting them I don't know I


---------69:04----------
don't know worth investigating


---------69:05----------
let's ask twitch at twitch at is this


---------69:08----------
guy burdened or is he carefree and did


---------69:10----------
you know in the first four minutes also


---------69:12----------
for you dr. K did I did I seem burned in


---------69:14----------
the first four minutes like absolutely


---------69:16----------
okay right it's taken me an hour to


---------69:23----------
convince you that you believe that you


---------69:25----------
cannot be helped but I've been trying


---------69:28----------
for an hour I've been trying to point


---------69:29----------
this whole thing out to you for one hour


---------69:32----------
we've been talking about the same


---------69:33----------
[ __ ] thing for the last hour twitch


---------69:37----------
at CPAC and why as though yes and no go


---------69:40----------
back and watch the vine I will yeah for


---------69:43----------
the benefit that I don't have twitch


---------69:44----------
chat on because it'd be too distracting


---------69:46----------
but I yeah I know what they're saying


---------69:47----------
don't ban anyone I want to know the real


---------69:49----------
I want to know what a Jewett fish that's


---------69:50----------
really saying yeah right so I think


---------69:53----------
twitch at can tell that you're burdened


---------69:55----------
okay and that's not your fault it's not


---------69:58----------
your dumb it's just what is right now


---------70:00----------
and I think this burden of hopelessness


---------70:02----------
has built up within you and then I think


---------70:04----------
like generally speaking if I'm going to


---------70:06----------
like try to gauge the success of any


---------70:09----------
endeavor a human beings belief in


---------70:12----------
whether they can succeed or whether


---------70:14----------
they're gonna fail tends to have a lot


---------70:17----------
to do with whether they succeed or fail


---------70:18----------
a lot of people who say they can succeed


---------70:23----------
still fail very few people who believe


---------70:27----------
they fail success that was the that was


---------70:31----------
the message of a poem my granddad gave


---------70:33----------
me


---------70:34----------
that's it that's something that I don't


---------70:37----------
know very well yeah I read it as funeral


---------70:39----------
Ashley let that exactly that message


---------70:42----------
yeah


---------70:42----------
you sooner or later those who succeed


---------70:45----------
are those who believe they can is the


---------70:47----------
sort of ending of that poem yep you


---------70:50----------
believe that and I believe it in my


---------70:52----------
working life I do I do pretty well like


---------70:54----------
professionally sure I should like have a


---------70:56----------
career in London is actually it's uh


---------70:59----------
it's not for everyone to say that yeah I


---------71:02----------
believe you're very capable but not


---------71:07----------
knowing everything I disagree I think


---------71:13----------
the big difference between your


---------71:15----------
professional careers that you believe


---------71:16----------
you can succeed and the big difference


---------71:17----------
in your dating life is that you believe


---------71:19----------
you can't yeah I wonder why that is


---------71:27----------
because it's it's not like it's not like


---------71:30----------
I didn't face a schilit of adversity in


---------71:33----------
my friend actually I had real trouble


---------71:35----------
holding down a job partly cuz I'm like


---------71:38----------
not very social as we


---------71:40----------
I it's less for problem now hmm just cuz


---------71:45----------
I've been through it so many [ __ ]


---------71:46----------
times like but it was really rough start


---------71:51----------
yep so what's the difference between a


---------71:56----------
rough start like so what's the


---------71:58----------
difference that's you're asking so


---------71:59----------
you're doing a very good job Paul so now


---------72:02----------
you're looking at your life you're


---------72:03----------
reflecting and I think you're actually


---------72:06----------
changing because you're asking yourself


---------72:08----------
why is it that in my professional life


---------72:10----------
despite adversity I was able to like


---------72:13----------
power through and succeed whereas in my


---------72:17----------
dating life I have been unable to and so


---------72:19----------
my question for you is when you were


---------72:22----------
facing adversity Paul what did you think


---------72:24----------
in your deepest darkest self what did


---------72:27----------
you think about your prospects of


---------72:28----------
success did you accept hopelessness


---------72:38----------
first yes but it's a really hard one to


---------72:41----------
answer because actually the first time I


---------72:43----------
lost my first job it wasn't just about


---------72:45----------
the job actually it was the two things


---------72:47----------
intertwined it was the climb at a girl


---------72:49----------
at work and she ultimately got me fired


---------72:52----------
and I and I despaired about that for a


---------72:56----------
cup for at least a year I didn't I just


---------72:59----------
I didn't work I was unemployed I was


---------73:02----------
collecting the Jobseeker's Allowance


---------73:04----------
which is what we have in the UK when


---------73:05----------
you're like eventually I obviously


---------73:12----------
through through necessity more than


---------73:15----------
anything I needed money I got back back


---------73:17----------
into the working world but I didn't get


---------73:20----------
into the okay remember you're making


---------73:23----------
this way too easy for everybody so I


---------73:25----------
think your absolute despair after after


---------73:28----------
that work experience I don't think you


---------73:31----------
can look at that as just a professional


---------73:33----------
experience because there was a woman


---------73:34----------
involved you know so I said that I said


---------73:36----------
it intertwined is that she's like both


---------73:38----------
of those exactly at the same time right


---------73:41----------
so that's a that reinforces our building


---------73:44----------
hypothesis that you've never really like


---------73:46----------
been hopeless about your work you may


---------73:49----------
have been hopeless about that situation


---------73:50----------
but I think that situation was


---------73:52----------
contaminated by a woman yeah yeah yeah I


---------74:03----------
guess part of it is like I don't know no


---------74:05----------
that's completely correct after you so


---------74:07----------
this was like 10 years ago see it's easy


---------74:08----------
to forget but actually the reason I


---------74:09----------
didn't want to go back into another job


---------74:11----------
straight away is because I was worried


---------74:12----------
that the same thing would happen again


---------74:13----------
with a woman like not so what you're


---------74:16----------
right look is the thing it's not


---------74:18----------
professional never was I've always been


---------74:24----------
[ __ ] so that now you ask yourself the


---------74:25----------
question why have I been able to face


---------74:28----------
adversity in my job and been successful


---------74:30----------
and faced adversity in my dating life


---------74:32----------
and been unsuccessful it's because the


---------74:34----------
[ __ ] adversity that you face in your


---------74:35----------
job didn't come from your job became


---------74:36----------
from women it's the same problem yes


---------74:41----------
well okay finds it whether it's not very


---------74:42----------
helpful revelation because it's just


---------74:44----------
okay so that we're still concluding that


---------74:47----------
my work has been fine and my dating has


---------74:50----------
not been fine which is we knew that the


---------74:51----------
whole time


---------74:52----------
no we did it right so this began when we


---------74:55----------
authentically reflected and scratched


---------74:57----------
our heads and said why why did I face


---------75:02----------
why did I get fired and I was


---------75:03----------
unemployment on unemployment for one


---------75:05----------
year why did I not give up hope then and


---------75:08----------
was I truly hopeless and is work


---------75:11----------
actually different from women because I


---------75:13----------
faced adversity in both now we have


---------75:15----------
confirmed our hypothesis it's not that


---------75:17----------
we didn't know like we had a suspicion


---------75:19----------
but we should still reflect and confirm


---------75:22----------
authentically so this still comes back


---------75:26----------
to then what this means is that like if


---------75:28----------
the big difference between your


---------75:30----------
professional life and your dating life


---------75:31----------
is your internal sense of confidence


---------75:34----------
about whether you can succeed that also


---------75:37----------
confirms that your road forward has


---------75:39----------
nothing to do with the shirt that you


---------75:40----------
wear or how much you weigh it has to do


---------75:43----------
with your belief about whether you can


---------75:45----------
actually be in a successful relationship


---------75:47----------
with a woman okay good okay it's more


---------75:52----------
reinforcement I guess what are we doing


---------75:55----------
about it though okay so so I've answered


---------76:01----------
that question a couple times but I'll


---------76:03----------
make things a little bit more calm I'm


---------76:04----------
gonna give you what you want which is


---------76:06----------
not what I think is gonna help you but


---------76:07----------
I'm gonna give you what you want so the


---------76:09----------
first thing is I've been saying to you


---------76:10----------
several times that understanding that


---------76:12----------
your hopelessness is what I think really


---------76:16----------
holds you back in terms of your


---------76:17----------
relationships with women


---------76:18----------
uh-huh and that so now what I want you


---------76:21----------
to do is train yourself to see the


---------76:23----------
hopelessness right so when you when you


---------76:26----------
you're going to a speed-dating thing


---------76:28----------
there's the sign good so when you think


---------76:31----------
about the speed-dating thing how do you


---------76:32----------
feel yeah I feel hopeless doctor okay


---------76:41----------
that's changing and the fact that you


---------76:43----------
can laugh at it so this is exactly what


---------76:46----------
I want you to do Paul when you go into


---------76:48----------
the speed-dating thing before you enter


---------76:50----------
the door to wherever this place is


---------76:52----------
notice that hopelessness catch it and


---------76:55----------
[ __ ] laugh in its face just like you


---------76:58----------
did and when you're sitting across from


---------77:00----------
a woman and you feel that hopelessness


---------77:02----------
catch it


---------77:04----------
look at it in laughing's [ __ ] face


---------77:07----------
and when you laugh like that it's such a


---------77:09----------
pure and beautiful laugh do you guys see


---------77:12----------
that dude chat and laugh in its face and


---------77:15----------
when you smile like that you know what


---------77:20----------
she's gonna do gonna pick it up and


---------77:25----------
leave no she's gonna smile there it is


---------77:48----------
beautiful you see that look at that


---------77:52----------
that's beautiful look at how much


---------77:57----------
confusing [ __ ] is there you don't even


---------77:59----------
know what's going on you're like what is


---------78:01----------
this but but I'm not in that moment I'm


---------78:28----------
not gonna laughter am i and this


---------78:31----------
assuming that I even as you say catch it


---------78:33----------
it's hard like what do you think it's


---------78:36----------
hard to grasp like there it is


---------78:38----------
pay attention but in that moment you see


---------78:41----------
well I don't know what just happened in


---------78:43----------
your mind but there was something


---------78:44----------
beautiful and positive and there was


---------78:46----------
something changed you're a different


---------78:47----------
slightly different person now and there


---------78:49----------
comes the thought again like a [ __ ]


---------78:51----------
boomerang but it's not gonna work dr. K


---------78:53----------
it's really not gonna work I can't


---------78:55----------
really do it can i I can't do this there


---------78:58----------
you see that what do you mean what do


---------79:02----------
you mean that like catch catch the no


---------79:04----------
stop for a second listen to what I just


---------79:07----------
said what did your mind just do Paul I'm


---------79:10----------
just I'm just asking you how do you do


---------79:12----------
it okay I'm okay like Han okay you're


---------79:15----------
asking me to do something I've never


---------79:16----------
done I think no I'm not asking you to do


---------79:18----------
something you've never done


---------79:19----------
catch the hopelessness you said arrived


---------79:21----------
I'm not asking you to do something


---------79:22----------
you've never done I'm asking you to do


---------79:24----------
something that you did for the first


---------79:25----------
time just now more or less never more or


---------79:30----------
less than ever and never very big


---------79:33----------
differences there's a huge difference


---------79:34----------
between you me telling you to do


---------79:37----------
something that you've never done before


---------79:38----------
and something that you've done once and


---------79:40----------
if you've done it once you can do it


---------79:42----------
again how did you do it I'm not quite


---------79:44----------
sure but you've done it once


---------79:50----------
a couple of times actually it wasn't


---------79:51----------
just once you did it a couple of times


---------79:54----------
in a row is like multiple orgasms I


---------79:56----------
collect it back there's nothing the only


---------80:00----------
women have it depends on whether you


---------80:03----------
learn tantric sex is a man no I'm gonna


---------80:07----------
pretend to know that means but then yeah


---------80:09----------
conversation I guess day gotta get you a


---------80:11----------
girlfriend first of all I guess I'm one


---------80:16----------
of the lucky few men who also know what


---------80:18----------
that feels like


---------80:22----------
how you feeling I just I want I wanted


---------80:49----------
to do what you say I want it to be that


---------80:52----------
when I go there something is different


---------80:54----------
and I just have a doubt that it will be


---------80:57----------
yep let me hear that yeah so so be it so


---------81:02----------
you're doing a good job so even now


---------81:04----------
you're doing a better job than you were


---------81:05----------
at the beginning of the hour because


---------81:07----------
instead of going and and so at the


---------81:10----------
beginning of the hour your doubt was


---------81:11----------
manifesting his resistance to what I was


---------81:14----------
saying but now already your doubt no


---------81:18----------
longer manifests as resistance instead


---------81:20----------
what you say is I have a doubt you've


---------81:22----------
actually made a huge difference there I


---------81:24----------
want everyone to see that you guys see


---------81:27----------
how he's different he used to just block


---------81:29----------
and be slippery and now he says but dr.


---------81:31----------
K I have doubt whereas that was the


---------81:34----------
doubt that was manifesting as evidence


---------81:36----------
and argument and resistance and now he


---------81:38----------
sees there as a doubt go back and watch


---------81:40----------
and you've never said like I mean you


---------81:42----------
did sort of but it's very different so


---------81:46----------
do you have work to do absolutely is


---------81:48----------
this easy absolutely not


---------81:50----------
can you change absolutely are you


---------81:52----------
hopeless absolutely not can you do it I


---------81:57----------
don't know is it possible I don't know


---------81:59----------
can you do it again yeah


---------82:02----------
if you can do it once you can do it


---------82:04----------
again so you tell me how what just


---------82:07----------
happened what just happened man what was


---------82:12----------
that like weird laughing crying like


---------82:14----------
what was that what were you feeling like


---------82:16----------
what the [ __ ] was that man I don't know


---------82:22----------
actually I don't know okay I I seems


---------82:29----------
like real true short-term memory


---------82:30----------
problems isn't the other no no no it's


---------82:32----------
it's it's not short-term memory problems


---------82:34----------
it's just you you have trained yourself


---------82:36----------
to be unfamiliar with emotions and


---------82:39----------
you've suppressed them so I've just like


---------82:43----------
yeah I'm bad with emotions I told you


---------82:46----------
already I have like I'm a bad memory for


---------82:48----------
them maybe it doesn't even have to be


---------82:49----------
long ago like yes sir have you seen any


---------82:51----------
of our videos about alexithymia no watch


---------82:56----------
those there on our YouTube channel


---------82:58----------
they'll give you a little bit but but


---------83:00----------
here's the thing so I don't know that


---------83:02----------
you've been so I their hope for you


---------83:04----------
absolutely man convinced now more than


---------83:06----------
ever if you can laugh like that if you


---------83:09----------
can look at your hopelessness in the


---------83:10----------
face and [ __ ] laugh at it that was


---------83:14----------
laughing I don't know what you were


---------83:16----------
laughing at but it was something


---------83:17----------
beautiful I don't know it was pure why


---------83:20----------
is it why is it what do you mean though


---------83:21----------
like why is it beautiful because it was


---------83:23----------
unburdening it why is it beautiful


---------83:25----------
actually don't know I don't know it just


---------83:28----------
was like why is this sunset beautiful I


---------83:30----------
don't know like I'm pretty sure twitch


---------83:33----------
at loved it too but partly yes of course


---------83:36----------
I mean the objective is always to make


---------83:38----------
the guests like [ __ ] break down isn't


---------83:40----------
that right makes a good show do you


---------83:42----------
think that's what the objective is well


---------83:48----------
right makes a good [ __ ] huh hard to deny


---------83:52----------
that no I don't think it's about


---------83:53----------
breaking them down I think it's about


---------83:54----------
lifting a mop dude this huge difference


---------83:57----------
yeah there was something kind of um


---------84:12----------
there was something kind of positive


---------84:15----------
about it in a weird way yeah so here's


---------84:20----------
the thing I I don't think I I think


---------84:22----------
let's just take a break I think this is


---------84:25----------
I'm gonna give you a chance to ask


---------84:26----------
questions but I think I know this is


---------84:28----------
gonna be a little bit unsatisfying but I


---------84:29----------
think this is good for today right so


---------84:32----------
you want me to fix everything I can't do


---------84:34----------
that this is not something I can do


---------84:35----------
overnight all right I'll get you to your


---------84:37----------
first breakthrough buddy but I think


---------84:39----------
what you need to do now is understand


---------84:42----------
what happened okay


---------84:45----------
so like I don't know exactly how that's


---------84:47----------
gonna work I'm gonna have to think about


---------84:48----------
it a little bit I think maybe what we


---------84:50----------
need to do is have you come back on


---------84:51----------
later right so I think that if you want


---------84:54----------
to work with a therapist again your work


---------84:56----------
may be different this time because now


---------84:58----------
you have something to kind of work on


---------85:01----------
practically what I want you to do and I


---------85:03----------
know you don't believe this


---------85:04----------
and it doesn't feel like it but I think


---------85:05----------
this is enough so as long as you


---------85:08----------
continue to see your hopelessness and as


---------85:11----------
long as you can kind of notice it and


---------85:13----------
laugh in its face as you walk and you


---------85:16----------
approach women the person that they are


---------85:19----------
going to see is someone that no women


---------85:21----------
has ever seen before well it should just


---------85:23----------
be clear I don't normally walk an


---------85:25----------
approach with it that's why the speed


---------85:26----------
dating works is because it forces you to


---------85:27----------
do that I define so I mean I don't need


---------85:30----------
you to walk in approached women because


---------85:31----------
you're a smart guy and you're gonna


---------85:32----------
figure out the external solutions


---------85:34----------
you're probably problem is not in


---------85:36----------
figuring out external solutions like you


---------85:38----------
said you've already figured it out


---------85:39----------
you're gonna do speed dating fine my


---------85:41----------
goal is in unburdening the pawl that


---------85:43----------
goes up goes its to speed dating and the


---------85:46----------
first step to that is to recognize that


---------85:48----------
that hopelessness is there and that you


---------85:51----------
have doubt that you'll ever be in a


---------85:52----------
relationship and to just notice notice


---------85:55----------
notice notice notice


---------86:00----------
just to notice it doesn't seem like it


---------86:04----------
doesn't see it doesn't seem I feel like


---------86:06----------
what you're trying to do by notice is


---------86:08----------
not what I


---------86:08----------
it's like it you do you have a different


---------86:10----------
definition because I must have noticed


---------86:12----------
it what do you mean no I don't think I


---------86:14----------
don't think you noticed it so what I


---------86:15----------
mean yeah you're right I have a


---------86:16----------
different definition so what I mean is


---------86:18----------
notice it with distance what distance


---------86:21----------
between you and the hopelessness instead


---------86:24----------
of saying I I'll give you an example


---------86:26----------
okay so what's the difference between I


---------86:28----------
will be alone for the rest of my life


---------86:30----------
and I sometimes think I will be alone


---------86:33----------
for the rest of my life one is an


---------86:41----------
absolute and one is just a thought


---------86:42----------
another absolutely so another way to put


---------86:44----------
it I'm going to be alone for the rest of


---------86:46----------
my life


---------86:47----------
my mind believes that I'm going to be


---------86:50----------
alone for the rest of my life what's the


---------86:55----------
difference between those two well you're


---------87:03----------
doing this thing like that you teach in


---------87:04----------
meditation where it's like well you you


---------87:06----------
and you and your mind or I don't know


---------87:09----------
your body in your mind or these are the


---------87:10----------
like disconnect what about listen to the


---------87:13----------
statements I will be alone for the rest


---------87:15----------
of my life my mind believes I will be


---------87:17----------
alone for the rest of my life you're


---------87:19----------
right but just look at the statement I


---------87:22----------
would say this I would say the same


---------87:23----------
thing again is like you're pretending or


---------87:25----------
very good that your mind is a different


---------87:28----------
thing like it's not somehow it's not you


---------87:31----------
yes so very good one is an absolute


---------87:34----------
truth and one is a thought so now let me


---------87:36----------
ask you something Paul when you believe


---------87:39----------
that you are gonna be alone from the


---------87:40----------
rest of your life where does that come


---------87:41----------
from well dude did I believe that that


---------87:44----------
was it just a thought I don't know if I


---------87:46----------
really believed it if I truly believed


---------87:48----------
it why would I even be going to doing


---------87:50----------
all these things so I I think the


---------87:53----------
hopelessness is a something if you heard


---------87:55----------
about some scars if you were like that


---------87:58----------
so you have a you have a some scar that


---------88:00----------
you are hopeless and that you will


---------88:02----------
always be alone so sometimes it


---------88:04----------
activates and sometimes it doesn't


---------88:06----------
but when it activates you believe fully


---------88:09----------
in those moments that you are gonna be


---------88:11----------
hopeless that you will be alone for the


---------88:12----------
rest of your life so the first thing to


---------88:15----------
understand is that the conclusion feels


---------88:17----------
true to you right like this whole hour


---------88:18----------
you've been giving me evidence evans


---------88:20----------
evidence no dr. kay it is true it is


---------88:25----------
true it is true absolute statements not


---------88:29----------
thoughts that's not how you treat them


---------88:31----------
but they are thoughts and thoughts come


---------88:35----------
from the mind and the mind is not the


---------88:37----------
knower of truth we treat it like it is


---------88:43----------
but just think about it for a second the


---------88:46----------
mind is not infallible on the contrary


---------88:48----------
it's fallible all the time but when you


---------88:52----------
- when you believe that to be true it's


---------88:56----------
your mind that's doing it so create


---------88:57----------
distance between reality and whatever


---------89:01----------
the mind wants to do because you've had


---------89:04----------
these experiences at the age of eight


---------89:06----------
first job that you got fired by a woman


---------89:09----------
I'm sure there are other experiences


---------89:11----------
being rejected by your therapist this


---------89:14----------
and that all of these things might not


---------89:16----------
fired by your women find because of


---------89:18----------
because we're so start by noticing and


---------89:23----------
what I mean by notice you're absolutely


---------89:25----------
right may have a different definition so


---------89:26----------
what that what that definition is is in


---------89:28----------
those moments when you know something to


---------89:30----------
be absolutely true take a step back and


---------89:33----------
recognize that this is my mind that is


---------89:36----------
telling me this doesn't mean it's true


---------89:38----------
that is how you notice to create


---------89:41----------
distance you can also meditate meditate


---------89:43----------
is the practice of stepping back from


---------89:45----------
your mind and as you step back from your


---------89:47----------
mind something like what happened today


---------89:50----------
will happen again and you will be able


---------89:51----------
to laugh and you will be able to laugh


---------89:53----------
beautifully and you will be able to


---------89:55----------
laugh freely and when you were able to


---------89:57----------
laugh beautifully in front and freely in


---------89:58----------
front of a woman she's gonna think


---------90:01----------
you're a little bit crazy and 99% of


---------90:04----------
women are gonna think you're a little


---------90:05----------
bit crazy


---------90:05----------
1% of them are gonna fall in love


---------90:11----------
because that's how it works love is


---------90:14----------
crazy you're gonna feel embarrassed but


---------90:20----------
one person is gonna like like have you


---------90:22----------
ever seen just like a woman just


---------90:24----------
laughing her heart out and it's there's


---------90:26----------
something even if you know she's nuts


---------90:28----------
there's something just beautiful about


---------90:29----------
that right like the laughter of a child


---------90:32----------
is just beautiful and pure and it's


---------90:34----------
attractive or even just a smile but yeah


---------90:39----------
yeah if it's an unburdened smile yeah


---------90:45----------
and it's been a long time since you've


---------90:48----------
had an unburdened smile my friend I feel


---------90:54----------
like you're just guessing that but


---------90:55----------
that's very true if it's a guess a


---------90:56----------
little but not what do you all I'm doing


---------91:02----------
is guessing buddy all I do I don't know


---------91:07----------
anything man well I know about you


---------91:10----------
nothing


---------91:10----------
it's just guessing right okay well it


---------91:13----------
was good guess


---------91:13----------
I don't yeah I don't smile that much


---------91:19----------
yeah


---------91:20----------
she smiled beautifully today Thanks


---------91:27----------
that's questions my only thought is like


---------91:37----------
how am I gonna catch my hopelessness


---------91:42----------
with practice so meditate


---------91:48----------
meditation right now because I think


---------91:49----------
you've been through a lot I don't think


---------91:50----------
you're in a good frame of mind to learn


---------91:52----------
is that okay I mean I'm fine now but but


---------91:55----------
if you know it's okay ya know what what


---------91:58----------
I want you to just sit with what you've


---------92:00----------
experienced today and try to process it


---------92:02----------
while it's fresh in your mind and I have


---------92:04----------
a I'm concerned that meditation may calm


---------92:07----------
down sure sure


---------92:10----------
yeah does that make sense so sometimes


---------92:12----------
when people have emotional stuff I sort


---------92:15----------
of recommend that they don't meditate


---------92:16----------
sure I'll take that under advisement


---------92:18----------
you're the expert on that yeah but I


---------92:20----------
think you know you could have you done


---------92:22----------
alternate nostril breathing before no


---------92:24----------
I've watched it I don't think I I guess


---------92:28----------
I approach with a bit of skepticism so I


---------92:29----------
don't always follow along with that part


---------92:31----------
okay so I want you to understand this


---------92:33----------
about meditation so you don't you don't


---------92:35----------
have to believe in it it's not about


---------92:36----------
skepticism so like if I'm skeptical that


---------92:39----------
exercising will cause me to lose weight


---------92:42----------
do I need to believe that huh so he's


---------92:45----------
just doing it as sufficient you don't


---------92:46----------
have to absolutely think just do it okay


---------92:48----------
yeah what makes it easier yeah you don't


---------92:50----------
have to believe in it it's just gonna do


---------92:52----------
what its gonna do okay nice right I like


---------92:56----------
that yeah it's like I'm skeptical that


---------92:59----------
this water will produce urine you just


---------93:01----------
drink the water your body will yeah okay


---------93:04----------
all right man strong work


---------93:05----------
Browdy thanks doc okay you have a little


---------93:10----------
bit of a long road ahead but I think you


---------93:12----------
can walk it okay just sit with this


---------93:16----------
we'll we'll do round two later okay


---------93:19----------
all right and I look forward to that


---------93:21----------
yeah yeah take care of man good luck


---------93:23----------
thanks Jase bye bye okay twitch at


---------93:35----------
okay so yeah so like things can feel


---------93:45----------
pretty circular but that's okay right so


---------93:47----------
we just got to keep at it so I want you


---------93:49----------
guys to understand you know for


---------93:52----------
yourselves as well like don't give up on


---------93:54----------
yourself right like just don't give up


---------93:56----------
on yourself and yeah just don't just


---------94:01----------
don't give up I don't know what else to


---------94:03----------
say like I don't have any other like


---------94:04----------
wise words for you guys and just


---------94:06----------
understand that that life is not about


---------94:08----------
like so we get so concerned about


---------94:10----------
outcomes right we get so concerned about


---------94:12----------
failure we get concerned like heat like


---------94:14----------
so he tries to ask out women it doesn't


---------94:16----------
work and then you start to like concern


---------94:17----------
yourself with failure and then you start


---------94:19----------
to believe things about the future life


---------94:22----------
is not about the future it's about the


---------94:24----------
present like action happens in the


---------94:25----------
present and you can't predict the future


---------94:27----------
so take the actions that you want to in


---------94:30----------
the moment and stay true to what your


---------94:32----------
goal is our goal there was not to make


---------94:34----------
him break down our goal there was to


---------94:36----------
help him as much as we can and if he has


---------94:40----------
a pearl of wisdom fine


---------94:41----------
if he doesn't have a pearl wisdom that's


---------94:43----------
okay we're just gonna try our best


---------94:44----------
you don't shoot for a particular target


---------94:47----------
and he says oh you know you want to


---------94:49----------
break people down because that's good


---------94:50----------
television sure it's good television but


---------94:52----------
that's not worry to here for we're not


---------94:53----------
there yeah it's not what were there for


---------94:57----------
certainly not to break up them down


---------94:59----------
sometimes does emotional expression do


---------95:02----------
people resonate with that yeah but I


---------95:04----------
don't think it's like it's not good


---------95:05----------
television when you see something


---------95:06----------
authentic and change in another person


---------95:09----------
that's like the reason we go for that is


---------95:12----------
because that's like the crit heal you


---------95:14----------
guys get that that's the [ __ ] heal for a


---------95:16----------
Oh a healing that's the crit you want a


---------95:18----------
fatty crit man need a crit heal so just


---------95:23----------
try to focus on what you need to be


---------95:26----------
doing and focus lay and just keep doing


---------95:28----------
so I'll leave this with you guys okay so


---------95:31----------
understand that gutter ball gutter ma


---------95:34----------
means action and gaddama has a fart


---------95:37----------
which means fruit so generally speaking


---------95:40----------
there's actions we take in the fruits of


---------95:42----------
our actions right there's like studying


---------95:45----------
for a test and


---------95:46----------
getting an A our society is overly


---------95:50----------
concerned with the fruit of our action


---------95:53----------
we're concerned with the outcome we're


---------95:55----------
concerned with quarterly reports we're


---------95:57----------
concerned with what the stock market is


---------95:59----------
doing we're concerned with the outcome


---------96:02----------
we don't care about the action we care


---------96:04----------
about the outcome if you give the people


---------96:07----------
the option to cheat they will if you


---------96:10----------
give them do you want to work your whole


---------96:11----------
life or you want to win the lottery


---------96:12----------
people say I want to win the lottery


---------96:14----------
like I'd fall into that camp - we all


---------96:16----------
care about the outcome we don't focus on


---------96:18----------
the action wrong way to live life focus


---------96:21----------
on the action it's not about getting an


---------96:24----------
a it's about studying as hard as you can


---------96:25----------
it's not about losing weight it's about


---------96:28----------
doing ten push-ups every day it's not


---------96:30----------
about finding a girlfriend it's about


---------96:34----------
working on yourself and letting go of


---------96:36----------
the hopelessness that you feel it's


---------96:39----------
about improving your own life right


---------96:41----------
don't focus on finding a girlfriend


---------96:43----------
focus on you and doing what you want to


---------96:48----------
that's the goal and the cool thing is


---------96:52----------
that if we were concerned if guys if I


---------96:54----------
was really concerned about getting a big


---------96:56----------
emotional response from Paul I would


---------96:58----------
have given up a long time ago because it


---------97:01----------
wasn't happening it's gonna happen like


---------97:05----------
I can't do that every time it wasn't


---------97:09----------
happening like it wasn't happening like


---------97:10----------
we're trying for an hour like nothing


---------97:11----------
fine but that's not our goal our goal is


---------97:14----------
not to get him to do that our goal is to


---------97:15----------
help him meet him wherever he is and try


---------97:17----------
to move him one step forward so focus on


---------97:20----------
the action focus on where he is focus on


---------97:22----------
where you are and focus on what you need


---------97:24----------
to do today and as long as you do the


---------97:27----------
right thing today today today today


---------97:28----------
today today irrespective of what happens


---------97:32----------
then your life will start to turn around


---------97:35----------
140 rejections from medical school


---------97:37----------

---------97:40----------

---------97:43----------
