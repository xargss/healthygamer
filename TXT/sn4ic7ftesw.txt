---------00:00----------
so just a couple of announcements before


---------00:02----------
we jump in today with moist critical


---------00:04----------
critical with a k on september 4th we're


---------00:08----------
going to be


---------00:09----------
uh releasing coaching we're going to


---------00:11----------
have a bunch of spots kind of opening up


---------00:12----------
for more coaches


---------00:14----------
um so for those of you who don't know


---------00:16----------
coaches are


---------00:18----------
basically people from our community who


---------00:20----------
um i've trained personally to sort of


---------00:22----------
help people in our community


---------00:24----------
and attempt to duplicate dr k and


---------00:27----------
you know they're not they're not me but


---------00:29----------
they are actually pretty effective at


---------00:30----------
helping people so


---------00:31----------
part of the cool thing about our


---------00:33----------
coaching program is i don't know if you


---------00:34----------
guys are aware of this but i am a


---------00:36----------
harvard andy


---------00:36----------
so i'm a big believer in evidence-based


---------00:38----------
medicine and scientific methodology


---------00:41----------
um and so what we do is collect outcomes


---------00:44----------
so we sort of


---------00:45----------
measure the the effectiveness of our


---------00:47----------
coaches and they seem to be like pretty


---------00:49----------
good


---------00:50----------
um so the coaches are actually like


---------00:53----------
people from our community who are


---------00:54----------
passionate committed intelligent


---------00:56----------
trained for a while um i work with all


---------00:59----------
the coaches on an ongoing basis in terms


---------01:01----------
of supervising and continuing education


---------01:04----------
um so if they run into an issue with a


---------01:05----------
client like if you guys are stuck


---------01:07----------
somewhere in a session i'll sort of give


---------01:09----------
them advice or help them


---------01:10----------
figure out how to help you move forward


---------01:12----------
so our coaches


---------01:13----------
are really helped are there to help


---------01:15----------
people overcome issues like what we talk


---------01:17----------
about


---------01:18----------
in streams so help you understand


---------01:19----------
relationships help you understand


---------01:21----------
yourself better help you understand


---------01:22----------
procrastination things like that


---------01:24----------
it's not a medical treatment so the


---------01:26----------
coaches are not there to diagnose or


---------01:28----------
treat your depression or your anxiety


---------01:30----------
they can certainly help you kind of


---------01:33----------
think about those things and understand


---------01:35----------
those things so it's not like


---------01:36----------
you can't talk about being anxious but


---------01:38----------
it's really not a


---------01:40----------
diagnosis or treatment so if you guys


---------01:42----------
want to you can


---------01:43----------
uh join the wait list


---------01:47----------
yeah coaches get paid absolutely


---------01:52----------
who knows my notebook hey


---------01:55----------

i swear to god so just so you remember


---------02:31----------
we were on that podcast together


---------02:34----------
and they introduced you as charlie right


---------02:36----------
so i was like okay there's a dude here


---------02:37----------
named charlie


---------02:38----------
and i was like damn that charlie dude


---------02:40----------
asks like really good questions


---------02:42----------
oh and is like like really like


---------02:43----------
thoughtful about his questions i was


---------02:45----------
like that's a cool guy


---------02:46----------
and then i didn't realize like and i was


---------02:48----------
like oh like it'd be cool if you know we


---------02:49----------
could hang out sometime


---------02:50----------
talk more because i really wanted i know


---------02:52----------
you'd ask questions but there are a lot


---------02:53----------
of people who are asking questions


---------02:55----------
about mental health um and i thought


---------02:57----------
that was like really cool


---------02:59----------
and then recently i saw a couple of your


---------03:00----------
videos about


---------03:02----------
um like leafy getting banned


---------03:05----------
and then something today about like uh


---------03:08----------
animal videos on youtube and i was like


---------03:09----------
hey it's that charlie guy


---------03:11----------
and then i saw that your name was


---------03:12----------
penguins


---------03:14----------
and and i was like okay so his i guess


---------03:16----------
his name is penguins


---------03:18----------
and then i i i [ __ ] you not man like let


---------03:20----------
me show you that anyway


---------03:22----------
i was just gonna dude you don't need to


---------03:25----------
prove it


---------03:26----------
i was taking a dump this morning and i


---------03:28----------
was watching your video about


---------03:29----------
um animal videos on youtube


---------03:32----------
um yeah that's a that's a scary rabbit


---------03:35----------
hole right there that'll ruin your


---------03:36----------
[ __ ] experience


---------03:37----------
so and i didn't realize you were you


---------03:40----------
were known as moist critical


---------03:41----------
so i apologize i have like i have this


---------03:44----------
terrible habit of just making


---------03:46----------
random [ __ ] names on every platform


---------03:48----------
it's it's awful but


---------03:50----------
it is what it is twitch is now asking me


---------03:52----------
to show the dump


---------03:55----------
can you prove that yeah did you watch it


---------03:57----------
yeah i it's too late for that


---------03:59----------
but it's it's funny i actually we talk a


---------04:01----------
lot about poop in my household


---------04:03----------
um because then in traditional indian


---------04:05----------
medicine a good sign of proper


---------04:08----------
digestion and diet is your poop and


---------04:11----------
so that sounds about right yeah that's


---------04:13----------
that's how they used to tell


---------04:15----------
whether uh you know whether your bowels


---------04:18----------
are functioning properly or and what not


---------04:20----------
but they used to use a a long time ago


---------04:23----------
the vikings used to use onion soup and


---------04:25----------
if they could smell it through your


---------04:26----------
wounds it meant you were gonna die


---------04:27----------
because the infection spread or


---------04:29----------
something right


---------04:30----------
fascinating i didn't know that but i


---------04:32----------
guess that makes sense


---------04:33----------
um interesting yeah


---------04:37----------
in ancient india speaking of you know


---------04:40----------
excretory material a good way that they


---------04:42----------
would test whether you had diabetes or


---------04:44----------
not is they would have you piss near an


---------04:46----------
ant mound


---------04:48----------
and if the ants came in and actually


---------04:50----------
like drank up the piss


---------04:52----------
it meant that you had sugar in your


---------04:53----------
urine and that got diabetes


---------04:57----------
that's huge yeah it was really great um


---------05:00----------
but theoretically people also maybe were


---------05:02----------
um just drinking urine which is


---------05:06----------
possible but i i like the ant test


---------05:09----------
better


---------05:10----------
yeah i think the ant test seems a little


---------05:11----------
more sound yeah


---------05:14----------
involves consuming less urine so we're


---------05:16----------
big fans of that


---------05:17----------
absolutely so uh and what do you want me


---------05:20----------
to call you do


---------05:21----------
like charlie or oh yeah yeah just


---------05:23----------
charlie you don't have to use any like


---------05:25----------
you know titles or anything man just


---------05:27----------
casual


---------05:29----------
um and and so tell me a little bit is


---------05:31----------
there something in particular i i


---------05:33----------
noticed that some uh my producers have


---------05:35----------
like put a list of questions but um


---------05:38----------
is there something that you want to talk


---------05:39----------
about today or something that can be


---------05:42----------
helpful


---------05:43----------
i'm game to just talk about whatever the


---------05:45----------
the way your producers talked about it


---------05:47----------
sounds like we just talked about what


---------05:48----------
was prevalent what's going on


---------05:50----------
okay kind of you know shoot the [ __ ]


---------05:52----------
there's no boys


---------05:54----------
okay that that sounds great to me so


---------05:56----------
just to clarify sometimes i have


---------05:58----------
personal conversations with people about


---------06:00----------
their life


---------06:01----------
and sometimes i talk with people about


---------06:03----------
stuff


---------06:04----------
do you have a preference of are we


---------06:06----------
shooting the [ __ ] about other things are


---------06:07----------
we talking about


---------06:08----------
you well your chat actually brought up


---------06:11----------
something interesting


---------06:12----------
we can talk about addiction that's kind


---------06:14----------
of become pretty prevalent in my


---------06:16----------
community recently because


---------06:17----------
okay i'm sure you would understand i've


---------06:20----------
been very big into buying yu-gi-oh boxes


---------06:23----------
and opening them on stream


---------06:25----------
okay some simpletons would refer to this


---------06:28----------
as a form of gambling


---------06:29----------
yeah it's because you know not too


---------06:31----------
different from like ea loot boxes you're


---------06:33----------
you're buying


---------06:34----------
a mystery i consider it mystery


---------06:36----------
investing in the yu-gi-oh cards


---------06:38----------
but there's a lot of people that think


---------06:40----------
that perhaps i have a susceptibility to


---------06:42----------
gambling


---------06:43----------
because of this what do you think


---------06:46----------
i think it's simply for the for the fun


---------06:50----------
of opening some yu-gi-oh cards the the


---------06:52----------
unexpected


---------06:53----------
thrill when we pull that starlight that


---------06:55----------
that rush of dopamine i think


---------06:58----------
all of that sounds like a gambling


---------07:00----------
addiction but i think what it actually


---------07:01----------
is gonna say


---------07:03----------
you get a pretty good case for an


---------07:05----------
addiction the thrill was that it's fun


---------07:08----------
yeah you know just that that fun with


---------07:10----------
the chat you know you get to shoot


---------07:12----------
you know shoot the [ __ ] in the chat make


---------07:13----------
some jokes get very disappointed when we


---------07:15----------
don't


---------07:16----------
pull a star light we get to feel the


---------07:17----------
highs and lows


---------07:19----------
and so maybe you know maybe i do have a


---------07:22----------
gambling addiction what do you think


---------07:24----------
i i wouldn't know i mean so far i know


---------07:26----------
all i know is that you're a guy who


---------07:28----------
opens yu-gi-oh cards


---------07:30----------
that's right so let me ask you do you uh


---------07:32----------
so my understanding is that yu-gi-oh is


---------07:34----------
a card game right


---------07:35----------
yeah yeah yeah um do you play the game


---------07:39----------
no no i just collect the cards okay


---------07:42----------
right so so so that's like a let's let's


---------07:46----------
think about a spectrum of addiction


---------07:48----------
so you've just shifted towards addiction


---------07:50----------
right if you don't


---------07:51----------
if you but at the same time people


---------07:54----------
collect all kinds of stuff so it doesn't


---------07:55----------
necessarily mean that you're addicted


---------07:56----------
like


---------07:57----------
people collect stamps right so that's


---------08:00----------
useless


---------08:02----------
and are yu-gi-oh cards useful if you


---------08:04----------
don't play a game with them


---------08:07----------
it's the implication i could battle if i


---------08:10----------
needed to i could make some monster


---------08:11----------
decks


---------08:12----------
and i think that's what makes me scary


---------08:14----------
to the community


---------08:15----------
that you could unleash your monster deck


---------08:19----------
of you go cards


---------08:20----------
on some unsuspecting new noob if you


---------08:23----------
if the if it if this reason arose


---------08:26----------
yeah you can't do that with stamps like


---------08:28----------
what are you going to do with stamps


---------08:29----------
just throw them at someone that's


---------08:30----------
worthless


---------08:31----------
you're going to send mail with them oh


---------08:33----------
yeah who cares right yeah like a ballot


---------08:35----------
or something like that a bill a letter


---------08:38----------
you know okay so i mean


---------08:42----------
so are you serious that your your


---------08:44----------
community kind of jokes about maybe


---------08:46----------
you having like an addiction to


---------08:50----------
yeah so i don't know if it's i know at


---------08:52----------
least a couple people earnestly think i


---------08:54----------
have an addiction


---------08:55----------
i i i don't but maybe like they grew up


---------08:59----------
in a household they're an environment


---------09:00----------
where they were around people that


---------09:02----------
maybe had like a real gambling addiction


---------09:03----------
you know maybe went to the casino more


---------09:05----------
times than they should


---------09:07----------
stuff like that and i i don't see the


---------09:09----------
same qualities here because i make it


---------09:11----------
pretty clear that it's just for like the


---------09:12----------
stream content and the fun


---------09:14----------
and highlight the videos for youtube


---------09:16----------
because i think a lot of the fun


---------09:18----------
comes from just like the unexpected


---------09:20----------
polls


---------09:21----------
and like the you know the jokes you can


---------09:23----------
make when a bad card comes up


---------09:25----------
just i think it's more about the journey


---------09:27----------
instead of the destination


---------09:28----------
i don't really think it's more like i'm


---------09:30----------
there to make money or i'm gonna be


---------09:32----------
really [ __ ] disappointed if i don't


---------09:34----------
get this one thing


---------09:35----------
and i don't think a lot of people can


---------09:37----------
recognize the difference between


---------09:38----------
just that kind of stuff for some content


---------09:41----------
versus a real


---------09:43----------
you know gambling problem or a real


---------09:44----------
addictive personality disorder


---------09:47----------
okay so is it okay if we talk about that


---------09:49----------
for a second


---------09:51----------
so maybe what we can do charlie and i'm


---------09:53----------
thrilled that we're having this


---------09:54----------
conversation because i would love to


---------09:55----------
have this conversation with you it's


---------09:56----------
like we can talk about what addiction is


---------09:58----------
right so what do you think makes an


---------10:00----------
addiction


---------10:01----------
how do we know whether someone is


---------10:03----------
addicted to something like


---------10:04----------
do i love do i just enjoy gambling or


---------10:08----------
am i addicted how do you what do you


---------10:10----------
think


---------10:11----------
so i guess uh in my voice correct in my


---------10:14----------
perspective


---------10:15----------
i think it becomes an addiction when it


---------10:17----------
becomes like the forefront of your


---------10:20----------
mind where you're thinking like i've


---------10:21----------
made this amount of money which means i


---------10:23----------
have this amount of gambling money to


---------10:25----------
set aside or


---------10:26----------
you know it becomes something that


---------10:27----------
you're constantly thinking about as a


---------10:29----------
means of


---------10:29----------
making money or as a way of staying


---------10:32----------
happy like i have to gamble


---------10:34----------
and this will make me happy but if i


---------10:36----------
don't get this i'm gonna be real sad


---------10:38----------
so i think it just more becomes to me an


---------10:41----------
addiction


---------10:41----------
when it's something you're constantly


---------10:43----------
harping on something that's always on


---------10:45----------
your


---------10:46----------
like on your mind you know what i mean


---------10:47----------
sure so there's a certain constancy of


---------10:49----------
mind i want to


---------10:50----------
tunnel down into actually i think a


---------10:52----------
couple of words which


---------10:53----------
i you didn't seem to emphasize but i


---------10:55----------
think are really important


---------10:57----------
you use the word have to right so you


---------10:59----------
said i


---------11:00----------
have to to make me happy to make money


---------11:03----------
whatever


---------11:03----------
so i think that there's a certain


---------11:05----------
compulsion which i think is actually


---------11:06----------
really important it's not so much about


---------11:08----------
what's on what's after the have to or


---------11:11----------
what's before the have to


---------11:13----------
it's the phrase have to there's a


---------11:16----------
certain amount of constancy


---------11:18----------
in your mind so like let's say that


---------11:23----------
and and so i'm just trying to think


---------11:26----------
about


---------11:27----------
situations where let's say i have to go


---------11:29----------
to work


---------11:31----------
and i'm constantly thinking about work


---------11:33----------
let's say i'm an investment banker


---------11:34----------
so this is common right so they they


---------11:37----------
spend a lot of time


---------11:38----------
going to work they feel like they have


---------11:40----------
to


---------11:41----------
um it occupies their mind they get to


---------11:44----------
sleep for like four hours a night


---------11:46----------
do we call that an addiction yeah


---------11:49----------
right i wouldn't call that an addiction


---------11:51----------
that would be more of a profession


---------11:53----------
that is that is actually what they do


---------11:55----------
for a living it is an entire career


---------11:57----------
built around it


---------11:58----------
i think i guess maybe for me the


---------12:00----------
distinction would be if it's not a


---------12:02----------
career


---------12:02----------
just this hobby that has become this


---------12:05----------
absolute


---------12:05----------
focal point of your life where it's


---------12:07----------
taking over other parts of it


---------12:09----------
okay taking over other parts i think


---------12:11----------
that's really important too


---------12:14----------
so we're we're getting to a really sort


---------12:17----------
of classical


---------12:18----------
medical definition of of addiction step


---------12:21----------
by step


---------12:21----------
taking over other parts of your life so


---------12:23----------
let's think about something


---------12:25----------
um else so let's say that i play league


---------12:28----------
of legends for 12 or 14


---------12:29----------
12 hours a day um i


---------12:32----------
am failing out of college


---------12:36----------
i'm master's league or master's level or


---------12:39----------
whatever


---------12:40----------
and i want to go pro what do we call


---------12:43----------
that


---------12:44----------
is that a career or an addiction what do


---------12:47----------
you think


---------12:48----------
that's tough to me that would be a


---------12:50----------
passion but i think it would be a little


---------12:52----------
misplaced


---------12:53----------
there has to be a balance i think


---------12:56----------
obsession in any of its forms such as


---------12:58----------
that like being obsessed with this drive


---------13:00----------
to make it to the next level in league


---------13:02----------
i don't think anything positive ever


---------13:03----------
comes from that


---------13:05----------
so for me i'd call that another


---------13:07----------
unhealthy addiction


---------13:08----------
to a certain degree but for that person


---------13:11----------
i guess


---------13:11----------
maybe passion would be more the right


---------13:13----------
term for them because they're clearly


---------13:14----------
very into the game they clearly see a


---------13:16----------
career and a future in it


---------13:18----------
but they're letting other parts of their


---------13:20----------
lives slip and fall down the [ __ ] for


---------13:22----------
it


---------13:22----------
which is what most programmers do right


---------13:24----------
before they make it pro they tend to


---------13:26----------
make these sacrifices


---------13:29----------
and they devote themselves fully to an


---------13:30----------
ideal so i'm hearing you kind of say


---------13:33----------
you'd put that ultimately in the passion


---------13:34----------
bucket


---------13:36----------
yeah more so than a like yeah


---------13:39----------
that'd definitely say passion okay um


---------13:42----------
so then let let me just kind of


---------13:44----------
highlight a couple of thoughts one is


---------13:45----------
you mentioned have to so i think


---------13:47----------
compulsion is a part of addiction right


---------13:50----------
sort of a sense of a lack of control


---------13:52----------
over your actions the second thing is a


---------13:55----------
certain constancy in your mind which you


---------13:57----------
sort of alluded to that it's at the


---------13:59----------
forefront of your mind is what you said


---------14:00----------
you're kind of thinking about it all the


---------14:02----------
time um i think that's also a feature of


---------14:04----------
addiction so a preoccupation with the


---------14:07----------
thing


---------14:08----------
so when if you think about if you talk


---------14:09----------
with alcoholics like a lot of them will


---------14:12----------
be thinking about


---------14:12----------
okay like if they're going on vacation


---------14:16----------
in their mind their mind will be sort of


---------14:18----------
figuring out okay when can i drink how


---------14:20----------
can i drink


---------14:21----------
um when am i going to get my next drink


---------14:23----------
and then i think a big part and this is


---------14:25----------
ultimately what sort of determines


---------14:27----------
addiction for me i think it's really


---------14:29----------
important is when you talked about


---------14:30----------
taking over


---------14:31----------
other parts of your life so i would call


---------14:33----------
that like sort of the medical term is


---------14:35----------
impairment of function


---------14:37----------
so if it interferes with your personal


---------14:40----------
professional academic


---------14:43----------
life or your physical or mental health


---------14:46----------
it's more likely to be an addiction


---------14:49----------
that sounds about right to me so i know


---------14:52----------
we don't diagnose or treat


---------14:54----------
things on stream you're aware of that


---------14:56----------
right


---------14:57----------
right so but now let's just think about


---------14:59----------
yu-gi-oh sort of as an academic example


---------15:02----------
would you say you hit those bullets so


---------15:04----------
do you feel like some degree of


---------15:06----------
compulsion to buy yu-gi-oh cards


---------15:08----------
that i will absolutely concede on that


---------15:11----------
it was like


---------15:12----------
even just four nights or two nights ago


---------15:14----------
whenever i opened the last


---------15:15----------
[ __ ] 34 boxes of rise of the duelist


---------15:18----------
that night i was like i need to get more


---------15:20----------
i need to find this card which doesn't


---------15:22----------
help my case


---------15:23----------
like i realize that makes me look like


---------15:25----------
an addict but sure in my


---------15:27----------
my defense like i've got to find that


---------15:29----------
[ __ ] card you know what i mean like


---------15:30----------
the stream's not complete without


---------15:32----------
finding it okay


---------15:34----------
so what i'm hearing is that you do sort


---------15:37----------
of have a sense of compulsion but it


---------15:39----------
also sounds like


---------15:40----------
in in your sense you're sort of making a


---------15:43----------
it sounds to me like it's almost like a


---------15:45----------
career kind of thing for you


---------15:46----------
where you've decided that the stream is


---------15:49----------
about


---------15:50----------
finding the card well yeah not the whole


---------15:52----------
stream i'm not like a yu-gi-oh streamer


---------15:54----------
these days or anything it's just a fun


---------15:56----------
little side quest we've been going on


---------15:58----------
here


---------15:59----------
i guess more so it's a compulsion with a


---------16:01----------
goal


---------16:02----------
it's like really aggressively chasing a


---------16:04----------
goal which is finding you know that


---------16:06----------
that white whale that starlight rare


---------16:07----------
we've been looking for


---------16:09----------
you know what i mean okay okay so


---------16:11----------
there's a particular goal do you find


---------16:12----------
that you're thinking about it relatively


---------16:14----------
constantly


---------16:15----------
no no no the only time i really think


---------16:17----------
about it is when the the boxes come at


---------16:19----------
the door and i'm like [ __ ] this is the


---------16:20----------
one and then when it's not i'm like [ __ ]


---------16:22----------
i'm thinking about it again


---------16:24----------
wait so i'm confused so you're thinking


---------16:26----------
about it when the box arrives at the


---------16:28----------
door and then when you


---------16:29----------
open the boxes and you're done then


---------16:31----------
you're thinking about it again


---------16:33----------
yeah those are really like the only two


---------16:35----------
times i'm ever really thinking about


---------16:36----------
getting more cards or thinking about


---------16:38----------
cards in general really


---------16:39----------
how many hours a day would you send you


---------16:41----------
you say you spend thinking about


---------16:42----------
yu-gi-oh


---------16:44----------
oh man it sounds it makes me sound like


---------16:46----------
a child


---------16:47----------
uh not much i'd say it's a the only


---------16:50----------
times i'm thinking about it


---------16:51----------
like i said is when i actually have the


---------16:53----------
boxes and i'm excited to open them on


---------16:55----------
stream


---------16:56----------
and when we just finished doing it and


---------16:57----------
we didn't and we didn't get what we were


---------16:59----------
going for


---------17:00----------
i'm sorry sorry for making it sound like


---------17:03----------
you were a child do you feel like a


---------17:04----------
child


---------17:07----------
oh you know what a little bit yeah you


---------17:09----------
know when i'm opening yugioh you know


---------17:11----------
makes me feel like a little boy again


---------17:12----------
you know it's


---------17:13----------
that's a feeling you can't emulate these


---------17:15----------
days it's one of those things you crack


---------17:16----------
open that nice pack you get that nice


---------17:18----------
beautiful aroma of some fresh cards you


---------17:21----------
know back like on christmas day 2006


---------17:23----------
it's lovely


---------17:24----------
it's a blast of nostalgia so yeah it


---------17:26----------
makes me feel like a kid a little bit


---------17:27----------
is that a bad thing not at all


---------17:31----------
okay so it sounds like you don't think


---------17:33----------
about it constantly


---------17:34----------
yeah and would you say that it impairs


---------17:36----------
your function or takes over other parts


---------17:38----------
of your life


---------17:40----------
no i i definitely wouldn't say so i


---------17:42----------
don't think i'm losing my life to


---------17:43----------
yu-gi-oh or anything i haven't been like


---------17:45----------
neglecting my


---------17:46----------
dogs or anything for yukio kart yeah i


---------17:48----------
mean so i think that's a pretty good


---------17:50----------
like you know i i i mean i've never


---------17:53----------
heard of a yu-gi-oh addiction before but


---------17:55----------
i think if you're


---------17:56----------
you know if people are are watching and


---------17:58----------
are kind of thinking a little bit about


---------18:00----------
is this an addiction i think those are


---------18:01----------
the important questions to ask


---------18:04----------
exactly and if the answer to all three


---------18:07----------
of those


---------18:07----------
or you know even two out of three is yes


---------18:09----------
like you may want to consider like


---------18:11----------
getting that checked out or getting


---------18:12----------
evaluated


---------18:13----------
or and i think really impairment to


---------18:15----------
function is the most important one


---------18:17----------
so if it's interfering with other parts


---------18:18----------
of your life then


---------18:20----------
i mean it sounds to me like you're


---------18:21----------
really interested in yugioh it sounds


---------18:23----------
like you have a nostalgic connection to


---------18:25----------
it


---------18:25----------
it sounds like it makes you feel like a


---------18:26----------
kid which is kind of fun


---------18:28----------
and alluring in a world where you know


---------18:30----------
everything is going to [ __ ]


---------18:32----------
um yeah and it's also like something


---------18:36----------
that you're doing with your audience


---------18:37----------
which sounds kind of like fun and


---------18:38----------
engaging


---------18:40----------
sort of like a bit of career a bit of


---------18:43----------
nostalgia


---------18:43----------
and at the end of the day is not causing


---------18:45----------
you to neglect your dogs


---------18:47----------
that's right i'm not hearing that you go


---------18:49----------
14 hours a day without eating or


---------18:52----------
drinking or using the bathroom because


---------18:53----------
you're opening yu-gi-oh cards


---------18:56----------
not yet but maybe i just haven't got


---------18:57----------
enough boxes who knows


---------18:59----------
yeah i guess one other thing to just


---------19:00----------
think a little bit about is whether from


---------19:02----------
a financial perspective you can afford


---------19:04----------
to


---------19:05----------
purchase and open all the yu-gi-oh packs


---------19:07----------
that you're buying


---------19:13----------
make sure to be very careful with that


---------19:15----------
kind of stuff i i very rarely spend


---------19:17----------
money so when i do i feel like real


---------19:18----------
guilty so i


---------19:19----------
make sure to look over it very


---------19:20----------
thoroughly why do you feel guilty when


---------19:23----------
you spend money


---------19:24----------
it's just how i grew up i never really


---------19:26----------
purchased anything


---------19:28----------
i just kind of always saved and hoarded


---------19:30----------
money


---------19:31----------
and either gave it away or you know


---------19:33----------
occasionally spent it on something every


---------19:34----------
now and then


---------19:35----------
so with the yu-gi-oh it's been very


---------19:37----------
different because the only thing i would


---------19:38----------
ever buy is movie tickets and food


---------19:40----------
and then i bought those yu-gi-oh boxes


---------19:42----------
for stream once and i was like damn this


---------19:45----------
was fun in the chat really enjoyed it


---------19:47----------
so then i spent more money on it and


---------19:48----------
like damn i'm kind of feeling a little


---------19:49----------
slimy about this


---------19:51----------
okay i don't know just to something uh


---------19:53----------
you know just something a little


---------19:54----------
different


---------19:55----------
charlie i noticed that you crossed your


---------19:57----------
arms are you feeling comfortable talking


---------19:59----------
about this stuff


---------20:00----------
yeah i just don't know what to do with


---------20:01----------
my hands because typically i have them


---------20:03----------
on the keyboard here


---------20:04----------
since i'm facing the camera i don't know


---------20:05----------
what to do with them no problem i i just


---------20:08----------
um do you mind if i ask a little bit


---------20:09----------
about you kind of feeling guilty about


---------20:11----------
spending money growing up and


---------20:13----------
boarding shows yeah it's an open book


---------20:16----------
help help me understand


---------20:17----------
um you know a little bit about how you


---------20:20----------
grew up


---------20:21----------
and and how you viewed spending money


---------20:24----------
uh so yeah my parents were they made


---------20:27----------
sure to instill in me the value of a


---------20:29----------
dollar


---------20:29----------
right uh i if i was begging for


---------20:31----------
something at toys r us


---------20:33----------
i wouldn't get it my dad and mom be like


---------20:35----------
nope


---------20:36----------
you can't have that you you know that's


---------20:39----------
that's that


---------20:40----------
we'll give you this toy but you can't


---------20:41----------
have two toys that kind of thing


---------20:43----------
so is the idea of not being spoiled and


---------20:45----------
i just kind of


---------20:46----------
made me feel as i grew up and started


---------20:49----------
having more money just more frugal with


---------20:50----------
it i didn't want to just


---------20:52----------
buy all of these materialistic things


---------20:54----------
because i just didn't need them you know


---------20:55----------
what i mean it was just one of those


---------20:57----------
things where i don't need it i'll save


---------20:58----------
this money


---------20:58----------
use it for something better as opposed


---------21:00----------
to something


---------21:02----------
you know just for me so


---------21:05----------
the way i view money is like making fun


---------21:07----------
content out of it spending money for


---------21:09----------
content is always when i'm happiest when


---------21:10----------
it comes to money


---------21:11----------
as opposed to buying something like a


---------21:14----------
yugioh box that i open in private while


---------21:16----------
i'm scratching at my neck having an


---------21:18----------
episode or something you know what i


---------21:19----------
mean


---------21:21----------
okay what do you mean by having an


---------21:22----------
episode was that a joke


---------21:24----------
oh yeah no i'm just kidding that


---------21:25----------
happened okay hold on a second


---------21:27----------
i thought it was a joke i was like i was


---------21:28----------
like i was envisioning like an episode


---------21:30----------
of like yu-gi-oh withdrawal where you're


---------21:32----------
like


---------21:33----------
feral in the closet like opening up


---------21:35----------
packs and kind of scratching yourself


---------21:37----------
sort of thing okay i said just i thought


---------21:40----------
that was


---------21:40----------
a funny image just kidding um


---------21:44----------
yeah so that's kind of interesting um


---------21:48----------
and and do you have a sense of why your


---------21:50----------
parents felt it was so important to


---------21:52----------
instill in you the value of a dollar


---------21:54----------
uh yeah i grew up in an area that had a


---------21:57----------
lot of spoiled kids like a lot of real


---------21:59----------
[ __ ] you know parents that would


---------22:01----------
just ignore them and give their kids


---------22:02----------
whatever they want it's not too


---------22:03----------
different from parents these days


---------22:04----------
just give their kids an ipad and tell


---------22:06----------
them to go do whatever so


---------22:07----------
my parents didn't like that and they


---------22:09----------
wanted to make sure i didn't turn out to


---------22:11----------
be one of those spoiled kids that just


---------22:12----------
had everything handed to them and just


---------22:14----------
you know


---------22:15----------
live life with this silver spoon where


---------22:17----------
everything they wanted they got


---------22:19----------
you know what i mean and i think that


---------22:20----------
was just a really valuable lesson


---------22:21----------
because i've


---------22:22----------
i've definitely i feel like it's a lot


---------22:25----------
better to spend


---------22:26----------
my money on things that other people can


---------22:28----------
enjoy like you know fun content or stuff


---------22:30----------
like that


---------22:31----------
or giving it to people that could use it


---------22:33----------
more use it


---------22:34----------
for something in their life you know


---------22:35----------
what i mean sure so so just for me


---------22:38----------
versus something better


---------22:40----------
yeah and do you remember how you felt as


---------22:43----------
a kid when your parents


---------22:45----------
you know sort of said like hey i mean


---------22:48----------
what was it like to grow up surrounded


---------22:49----------
by


---------22:50----------
kids who got two toys instead of one and


---------22:52----------
you only getting one toy


---------22:54----------
it never really bothered me i never


---------22:56----------
really had too much of a problem with it


---------22:58----------
i


---------22:58----------
from a young age i was like you know


---------23:00----------
what that's totally fine i can


---------23:02----------
understand why my parents are


---------23:04----------
wanting me to learn this my parents i


---------23:06----------
think have been just incredible role


---------23:08----------
models they


---------23:08----------
it always treated everyone with so much


---------23:10----------
respect and did everything they could


---------23:12----------
for


---------23:12----------
everyone around them and i always


---------23:14----------
recognized that as a really good thing


---------23:16----------
so the fact that they were telling me


---------23:17----------
look it's better if you just


---------23:18----------
learn that you can't always have


---------23:20----------
everything you want at a young age


---------23:22----------
and you'll benefit from it so it never


---------23:24----------
really bothered me that you know my


---------23:25----------
friends would have all this crazy [ __ ]


---------23:27----------
it wasn't really a big deal to me okay


---------23:29----------
because i realized i didn't need it you


---------23:31----------
know what i mean


---------23:32----------
okay um that's really impressive man so


---------23:36----------
it sounds like


---------23:36----------
not only did they sort of uh teach you


---------23:40----------
the value of a dollar but i'm also


---------23:42----------
hearing that they spent the time and


---------23:43----------
energy


---------23:44----------
to try to explain to you what they were


---------23:46----------
doing and why they were doing it


---------23:48----------
so they they would explain everything to


---------23:50----------
me man i don't know if you remember this


---------23:52----------
but there was a nascar


---------23:54----------
racer called dale earnhardt yeah and my


---------23:57----------
my


---------23:57----------
parents loved nascar one of their


---------24:00----------
biggest weaknesses i don't know why they


---------24:01----------
like nascar but they loved it and i was


---------24:03----------
watching nascar


---------24:04----------
and that accident happened where he


---------24:06----------
crashed into the wall and died


---------24:08----------
and my parents immediately like without


---------24:10----------
missing a beat it's like they had


---------24:11----------
[ __ ] scripted his death they're like


---------24:12----------
charlie this is death


---------24:14----------
and you need to understand what this


---------24:15----------
means like i was always be getting


---------24:17----------
lessons and


---------24:18----------
i think that that really just kind of


---------24:19----------
helped me understand things at a younger


---------24:21----------
age


---------24:22----------
as opposed to like you know having to


---------24:25----------
learn it the harder way


---------24:26----------
or you know later on what's the harder


---------24:29----------
way


---------24:31----------
yeah i said as far as death i don't know


---------24:34----------
but as for not getting everything you


---------24:35----------
want


---------24:36----------
you know realizing that you can't always


---------24:38----------
have everything


---------24:40----------
you know what i think is the harder way


---------24:43----------
by yourself because what i'm merely


---------24:46----------
hearing from you is that


---------24:48----------
you know what you you learned a lot of


---------24:50----------
things not alone


---------24:52----------
like you had parents who took the time


---------24:54----------
to really try to explain to you things


---------24:55----------
help you understand things


---------24:58----------
it's interesting i think it makes a lot


---------24:59----------
of sense because you seem to me to be


---------25:00----------
like i mentioned you at the beginning


---------25:02----------
when i was fanboying a little bit


---------25:04----------
um that you know i think you ask really


---------25:06----------
good questions and you're an insightful


---------25:07----------
dude


---------25:08----------
and it's kind of interesting to to see


---------25:10----------
that from a young age your parents


---------25:13----------
taught you how to think or encourage you


---------25:16----------
to think


---------25:16----------
or find reasons or try to understand


---------25:19----------
things


---------25:21----------
yeah well i appreciate that man yeah i


---------25:22----------
really can't thank my parents enough for


---------25:24----------
the upbringing i think the


---------25:26----------
a lot of the the reason that i am the


---------25:28----------
way i am today is because of everything


---------25:30----------
they taught me


---------25:31----------
sure i really appreciate that if you're


---------25:32----------
in the chat mom and dad keep up the


---------25:34----------
great work


---------25:35----------
love you um so


---------25:38----------
so charlie if i can just kind of point


---------25:41----------
something out to you that i think is a


---------25:42----------
little bit strange so


---------25:44----------
i think you know you kind of say i don't


---------25:46----------
need it


---------25:47----------
which sort of makes sense and but that


---------25:50----------
seems to me like a little bit


---------25:51----------
different or maybe related to feeling


---------25:54----------
guilty when you do


---------25:55----------
indulge what do you think about that


---------26:00----------
yeah i guess that might be a little part


---------26:01----------
of it because at the end of the day i


---------26:03----------
don't need


---------26:04----------
yu-gi-oh cards right like my stream's


---------26:05----------
not gonna you know go to the [ __ ] if


---------26:07----------
i'm not opening yu-gi-oh cards like some


---------26:09----------
kind of crazy feral animal


---------26:11----------
it's not something i need and when i buy


---------26:14----------
it it does make me feel a little guilty


---------26:16----------
because again


---------26:17----------
it is big purchases right like 34 boxes


---------26:19----------
of yu-gi-oh cards that was like


---------26:20----------
seventeen hundred dollars like that's


---------26:22----------
that's not like a small purchase it's


---------26:23----------
something i feel guilty about


---------26:25----------
spending that much on something like


---------26:27----------
that which is


---------26:28----------
again just this this thing just for some


---------26:30----------
fun on the stream


---------26:32----------
and no i think the fact yeah i just


---------26:34----------
think the fact that i don't need it and


---------26:36----------
you know it just makes me feel a little


---------26:38----------
slimy


---------26:39----------
yeah so so oddly enough i think the fact


---------26:41----------
that you do it for a stream


---------26:43----------
is what makes it okay for you so i think


---------26:46----------
stream is a good reason that protects


---------26:48----------
you from the guilt


---------26:50----------
because you strike me as someone who


---------26:52----------
wouldn't buy 34 boxes of yu-gi-oh cards


---------26:55----------
unless you had


---------26:56----------
a quote-unquote good reason right


---------27:00----------
and i i think now i'm gonna say


---------27:02----------
something a little bit provocative okay


---------27:04----------
so i think the interesting thing that


---------27:05----------
i'm hearing from you is a good reason as


---------27:07----------
anything except for yourself


---------27:12----------
that's fair i mean that's that's


---------27:14----------
probably fair yeah


---------27:16----------
what do you think about that ah


---------27:20----------
i think there's a lot of truth to it the


---------27:21----------
more i think about it the the more i


---------27:23----------
realize i don't buy anything really for


---------27:25----------
myself all my purchases are either food


---------27:27----------
for me and my girlfriend or movie


---------27:28----------
tickets for me and my girlfriend


---------27:30----------
i guess like the last thing i bought


---------27:32----------
simply for me to enjoy was a dance dance


---------27:34----------
revolution machine


---------27:36----------
and now that i'm talking about this out


---------27:37----------
loud it seems like everything i buy is


---------27:39----------
something that a nine-year-old would


---------27:40----------
think is cool


---------27:42----------
but uh yeah i don't really buy a whole


---------27:44----------
lot solely for me to enjoy


---------27:46----------
but that's because i like to share


---------27:47----------
everything with everybody like if i have


---------27:49----------
something i put it on stream or i make a


---------27:51----------
youtube video out of it


---------27:52----------
yeah so once again everything that you


---------27:54----------
have is for other people


---------27:59----------
yeah i guess so huh right


---------28:03----------
yeah and not to be a little bit um


---------28:07----------
further provocative but like let's just


---------28:09----------
think it's just


---------28:10----------
i'm thinking about some of my


---------28:12----------
supervisors who would just really love


---------28:14----------
to make some kind of bizarre conclusion


---------28:16----------
like


---------28:17----------
you know it sounds like your parents


---------28:19----------
taught you about very mature things at a


---------28:21----------
very young age


---------28:22----------
that you weren't able to indulge in


---------28:25----------
getting two toys and sort of live


---------28:27----------
life freely and openly which is why as


---------28:29----------
an adult you're chasing the feelings of


---------28:31----------
a child


---------28:33----------
i'm not chasing any children don't you


---------28:35----------
put those words feelings feelings


---------28:37----------
right so so you you kind of keep


---------28:40----------
commenting that


---------28:41----------
it makes me sound like i'm a kid and so


---------28:44----------
so some of my


---------28:45----------
like analytic supervisors would be like


---------28:47----------
oh he is trying to rediscover his


---------28:49----------
childhood in adulthood because he was


---------28:51----------
robbed of it


---------28:52----------
because his parents taught him about


---------28:54----------
death at a young age instead of letting


---------28:55----------
him indulge


---------28:56----------
and be a child can you believe that


---------28:58----------
unbelievable


---------29:00----------
unbelievable what do you think about


---------29:01----------
that i


---------29:03----------
i definitely wouldn't agree with that i


---------29:04----------
don't think i'm trying to chase the


---------29:05----------
feeling of anything i missed as a kid i


---------29:07----------
feel like i had a great childhood


---------29:08----------
yeah and it's not like i was you know in


---------29:10----------
the streets selling lemonade


---------29:13----------
you know it's a war-torn area for money


---------29:15----------
so i could buy something for myself


---------29:17----------
like my parents obviously got me things


---------29:18----------
but it was this idea of there's no need


---------29:20----------
to have


---------29:21----------
everything you always want at every


---------29:23----------
given moment


---------29:24----------
yeah of course definitely just the


---------29:26----------
balancing act of making sure i wasn't


---------29:28----------
spoiled


---------29:29----------
but also making sure that i wasn't you


---------29:30----------
know going hungry and


---------29:32----------
not having things to have fun with yeah


---------29:34----------
i mean because because like like you


---------29:36----------
said you know just to be clear


---------29:37----------
we're not talking about zero toys versus


---------29:40----------
two toys we're talking about one toy


---------29:42----------
so you go to toys r us and you get one


---------29:44----------
toy


---------29:45----------
you know and so sort of makes sense


---------29:48----------
um at the same time i am a little bit


---------29:52----------
you know i do wonder a little bit


---------29:54----------
charlie about sort of putting yourself


---------29:55----------
last or not being able to put yourself


---------29:58----------
first


---------29:58----------
and how you feel about that um


---------30:02----------
i never really look at it that way


---------30:04----------
because in general not my happiest when


---------30:06----------
i'm making


---------30:07----------
like cool content or i'm making bigger


---------30:09----------
projects like


---------30:10----------
the music video i did earlier this year


---------30:12----------
that was like the biggest undertaking


---------30:13----------
i've done it was a year-long


---------30:15----------
project a full animation and it was


---------30:17----------
expensive but i liked it doing it


---------30:19----------
because i like


---------30:20----------
putting that kind of stuff out there and


---------30:22----------
i would say like that's


---------30:23----------
for me as well as for sharing it with


---------30:25----------
other people i would say making


---------30:26----------
something like that was putting myself


---------30:28----------
first but it's also something that i got


---------30:30----------
to share with everybody


---------30:31----------
which is what i really enjoy yeah so i


---------30:34----------
don't i really don't view it as a like


---------30:35----------
me putting myself


---------30:36----------
last where you know i'm i you know not


---------30:39----------
spending anything on myself making sure


---------30:41----------
that i'm taken care of or anything like


---------30:43----------
that


---------30:44----------
it's just more so i enjoy doing things


---------30:46----------
that i can share with everybody else


---------30:49----------
what do you enjoy about that


---------30:55----------
all right i was wondering what that was


---------30:56----------
my doorbell doesn't work so it just it


---------30:58----------
just says install cover there's someone


---------31:00----------
at the door


---------31:01----------
um what was the question sorry i just


---------31:04----------
uh i forgot um


---------31:11----------
yeah i forgot give me a second all right


---------31:14----------
no worries


---------31:14----------
oh yeah what what do you enjoy about


---------31:16----------
sharing things with other people


---------31:19----------
um i don't know just always been a


---------31:21----------
really fulfilling thing i've just always


---------31:22----------
enjoyed


---------31:23----------
making things for the fun of making them


---------31:25----------
and then putting them out there for the


---------31:26----------
world to enjoy or [ __ ] on really


---------31:29----------
you don't have to love everything i do i


---------31:30----------
don't expect everyone to love everything


---------31:32----------
i do like i


---------31:33----------
i don't do it for that kind of that kind


---------31:35----------
of reason it's just i have a lot of fun


---------31:37----------
doing it


---------31:37----------
and since i had fun hopefully other


---------31:39----------
people have fun watching it or


---------31:41----------
interacting with it in some way and i


---------31:43----------
just really enjoy that


---------31:44----------
just being able to you know help


---------31:46----------
entertain somebody maybe


---------31:48----------
what is what is that feeling when you


---------31:49----------
keep on using the word enjoy what what


---------31:51----------
do you feel when


---------31:52----------
someone when you share something with


---------31:55----------
someone and they're able to appreciate


---------31:56----------
it


---------31:58----------
um


---------32:01----------
jubilation i'll use a hard word there i


---------32:04----------
i'd say like i


---------32:05----------
really feel great when someone's like


---------32:06----------
look charlie that video


---------32:08----------
was really [ __ ] cool skynet i'd never


---------32:10----------
even thought about robots being powered


---------32:11----------
by semen that was


---------32:13----------
wild that makes me feel like really good


---------32:17----------
oh yes the the music videos about robots


---------32:19----------
powered by semen


---------32:21----------
it's you have to read them yeah like


---------32:24----------
it's


---------32:25----------
s e a m e n or


---------32:30----------
i'll break down the storyline as a


---------32:32----------
little lore recap in skynet


---------32:34----------
it's basically terminator if the


---------32:36----------
machines were powered by


---------32:38----------
nut as opposed to technology electricity


---------32:43----------
yeah it's it's deep there's there's a


---------32:45----------
lot of moving parts to that i


---------32:46----------
don't even want to get into it the fan


---------32:48----------
isn't wild is something that


---------32:51----------
you made or is something okay


---------32:54----------
yeah so uh i have a band with a buddy of


---------32:57----------
mine named troy and we made this song


---------32:59----------
that's all about that


---------33:00----------
and then we hired an animation studio to


---------33:02----------
animate all of it


---------33:03----------
and that was by far the biggest project


---------33:06----------
i've done and putting that out there and


---------33:07----------
seeing people


---------33:08----------
really enjoy it or you know really


---------33:10----------
relate to it in some strange ways just


---------33:12----------
really cool


---------33:13----------
it just made me feel very happy charlie


---------33:16----------
it sounds like the world is lucky to


---------33:17----------
have you


---------33:20----------
that was sweet thanks man i'm


---------33:24----------
what are you right


---------33:28----------
you're just being sweet man i don't know


---------33:31----------
it was just very nice


---------33:33----------
i wasn't trying to be nice


---------33:37----------
can i explain myself a little bit i'm


---------33:39----------
curious how how it sounded when


---------33:41----------
how you felt when i said that all right


---------33:43----------
sure man


---------33:44----------
well let me just because like look so


---------33:46----------
you're you're like one of these content


---------33:47----------
creators right


---------33:48----------
and and it sounds like i imagine you


---------33:50----------
make a fair amount of money


---------33:52----------
and it sounds like what you really try


---------33:54----------
to do is you strike like a really good


---------33:55----------
balance of


---------33:56----------
being sort of authentic and not catering


---------33:59----------
to the masses or giving them the kind of


---------34:01----------
content that they want but really that


---------34:02----------
your goal is to


---------34:04----------
do something that you find like


---------34:05----------
interesting and fulfilling and


---------34:07----------
i think you use a really interesting


---------34:08----------
word which is subtle and has a lot of


---------34:11----------
connotation which is share


---------34:13----------
so you share something without


---------34:14----------
expectation


---------34:16----------
right you give it to people and you say


---------34:18----------
hey i hope you enjoy this i enjoyed it


---------34:20----------
you don't say i need you to enjoy it


---------34:22----------
which is what happens with a lot of


---------34:24----------
content creators


---------34:25----------
you know i want you to enjoy it how can


---------34:27----------
i make something so that you enjoy it


---------34:29----------
the most


---------34:31----------
that's not what i'm hearing from you


---------34:32----------
what i'm hearing is that


---------34:34----------
you know you have some resources and you


---------34:38----------
invest those resources to a certain


---------34:40----------
degree


---------34:41----------
in personal satisfaction but also that


---------34:43----------
like you really try to align personal


---------34:46----------
satisfaction with things that other


---------34:47----------
people can make


---------34:48----------
the world a slightly brighter place or


---------34:50----------
make someone stay better


---------34:53----------
man that was yeah that i think you hit


---------34:56----------
the nail on the head man i really


---------34:57----------
appreciate that


---------34:58----------
it means a lot to even like hear someone


---------35:00----------
explain it that way because that's


---------35:02----------
definitely how i feel like i don't make


---------35:04----------
these things trying to cater to some


---------35:06----------
kind of you know


---------35:07----------
popular take or popular opinion like you


---------35:09----------
know no one's talking about


---------35:11----------
nut-powered machines you know it's just


---------35:13----------
i enjoyed it


---------35:14----------
i like putting it out there and it


---------35:16----------
always means a lot when people like it


---------35:18----------
and if they don't that's fine too like


---------35:20----------
maybe they could make fun of it and they


---------35:21----------
could have fun that way really


---------35:23----------
it's just you know just the the cycle of


---------35:26----------
how i like to


---------35:26----------
to create things and just the way i kind


---------35:28----------
of live my life thinking of


---------35:30----------
well here's something i could do that


---------35:31----------
maybe other people would enjoy yeah


---------35:33----------
and so what what was it like to hear me


---------35:36----------
say that


---------35:38----------
ah man it felt like five different


---------35:40----------
angels all tickling my nut sack like it


---------35:42----------
was just soothing like you just


---------35:44----------
made me feel so at ease and like


---------35:46----------
fulfilled it was


---------35:47----------
wonderful okay


---------35:51----------
do do you feel i mean hey


---------35:54----------
i don't put this back is that an unusual


---------35:58----------
feeling


---------35:58----------
angel's tickling your nut sack well it's


---------36:01----------
you know it doesn't happen as often as


---------36:03----------
i'd like


---------36:04----------
you know what i mean but it's just a


---------36:07----------
nice feeling i don't know man


---------36:08----------
i've always watched it like i watch your


---------36:10----------
show obviously and i always appreciate


---------36:11----------
what you're able to do for the community


---------36:13----------
around here not just the people you


---------36:14----------
bring on stream but also the chat as


---------36:16----------
well i think you do a lot of good work


---------36:17----------
even making people in the chat


---------36:19----------
feel like they're learning something


---------36:20----------
about themselves and feeling good about


---------36:22----------
themselves so


---------36:23----------
i mean i'll make a bold claim here i


---------36:24----------
think you're tickling a lot of nut sacks


---------36:26----------
and making people feel


---------36:27----------
a lot better yeah that's that's


---------36:30----------
generally speaking what my fbi file is


---------36:32----------
filled with


---------36:34----------
yes


---------36:38----------
they call me aka nut sacticler


---------36:41----------
oh i believe it man you're notorious out


---------36:43----------
here


---------36:45----------
um yeah so


---------36:48----------
charlie i i think uh you know i wasn't


---------36:52----------
trying to tickle the nut sack but i


---------36:54----------
think you genuinely offered um


---------36:57----------
you know something that i heard which is


---------36:58----------
that i think you do kind of go


---------37:01----------
out of your way really i think that's


---------37:02----------
actually what's pretty cool about it is


---------37:04----------
that you don't go out of your way to


---------37:05----------
make people feel better what i really


---------37:07----------
hear you doing is


---------37:08----------
offering the most authentic parts of


---------37:10----------
yourself with the hope that other people


---------37:12----------
can benefit from them


---------37:13----------
and there's just something really like


---------37:15----------
pure about that and i just wanted to


---------37:17----------
acknowledge it


---------37:18----------
because i think it's cool man well thank


---------37:21----------
you man i'm glad you i'm glad you think


---------37:22----------
it's cool


---------37:23----------
it really does mean a lot to me and


---------37:28----------
yeah so i i i do i do think there's


---------37:30----------
something here charlie which i think


---------37:32----------
not necessarily that we need to explore


---------37:33----------
further but sometimes when people you


---------37:35----------
said something like


---------37:36----------
uh you know you do it you do some things


---------37:39----------
just for yourself


---------37:40----------
as opposed to like having a better


---------37:41----------
reason to do them


---------37:44----------
um and and i i i know we


---------37:47----------
i sort of mentioned that you kind of put


---------37:49----------
other people ahead of yourself which i


---------37:50----------
think is a really noble and awesome


---------37:52----------
thing i think it's part of what


---------37:54----------
results in what we just talked about


---------37:55----------
right that you really do authentically


---------37:57----------
try to create things kind of for


---------37:59----------
yourself but then do your best


---------38:01----------
to try to share them with other people


---------38:04----------
i do wonder a little bit um about


---------38:09----------
can i just think for a second and try to


---------38:10----------
figure out how to say this hey by all


---------38:12----------
means man


---------38:24----------
so sometimes people are taught


---------38:28----------
that other people are more important


---------38:31----------
than they are


---------38:33----------
and there's a very subtle so if you put


---------38:36----------
someone ahead of yourself


---------38:38----------
there can be a couple of reasons for


---------38:41----------
that


---------38:42----------
one is that you just value other people


---------38:45----------
right so like


---------38:46----------
the person besides you can have a lot of


---------38:48----------
value


---------38:49----------
the other reason that you can put people


---------38:51----------
ahead of yourself is that you can value


---------38:53----------
yourself


---------38:54----------
very low does that make sense it's kind


---------38:56----------
of like a comparison


---------38:58----------
no i totally i'm not saying that you


---------39:01----------
value yourself


---------39:02----------
lowly but i can envision a world in


---------39:05----------
which a kid is surrounded by


---------39:07----------
a bunch of rich kids um and


---------39:10----------
i'm not saying this is you by the way


---------39:12----------
i'm just sort of sketching this out okay


---------39:13----------
and it's


---------39:14----------
your your you have to tell me whether


---------39:16----------
this fits or doesn't fit or whether you


---------39:17----------
want to explore it further or not


---------39:19----------
i'm envisioning if you take a hundred


---------39:21----------
kids that are surrounded by


---------39:23----------
a hundred kids with lots of toys


---------39:27----------
and they're the one that doesn't get as


---------39:29----------
many toys


---------39:30----------
that out of those hundred kids some of


---------39:32----------
them will think


---------39:34----------
or feel like they are worth less than


---------39:36----------
their peers


---------39:37----------
does that make sense yeah i could


---------39:39----------
definitely envision that too but for me


---------39:41----------
personally i don't think it goes like


---------39:43----------
that deep when it comes to putting other


---------39:44----------
people ahead of myself


---------39:45----------
i wouldn't say i value those other


---------39:48----------
people more than i value myself


---------39:50----------
i'd still say at the end of the day i


---------39:51----------
care more about myself


---------39:53----------
than somebody that i have never met


---------39:56----------
before


---------39:56----------
and what's going on there i i just


---------39:58----------
really like to be able to


---------40:00----------
maybe produce something for them that


---------40:02----------
they can enjoy as well


---------40:03----------
it's not because i'm thinking like you


---------40:05----------
know what they deserve


---------40:06----------
something here and i don't deserve any


---------40:08----------
of this i don't think i've ever really


---------40:10----------
felt that way


---------40:11----------
as far as like uh you know that kind of


---------40:14----------
feeling maybe in high school i felt like


---------40:16----------
really low


---------40:16----------
on myself and maybe put others far


---------40:18----------
higher than me


---------40:19----------
but sure i've grown a lot since then in


---------40:22----------
high school i mean that's just rough for


---------40:23----------
everyone you know i'd like [ __ ]


---------40:24----------
pimply face i took accutane twice


---------40:27----------
i was beating my dick every night it was


---------40:28----------
miserable right like it's a high school


---------40:30----------
experience


---------40:31----------
but since then i don't think i've ever


---------40:32----------
really had like this really low


---------40:34----------
self-image or self-worth or anything


---------40:36----------
like that where


---------40:37----------
everyone around me is more important and


---------40:39----------
i'm trash


---------40:40----------
yeah yeah so i'm not getting that sense


---------40:42----------
from you i i'm getting a sense that


---------40:43----------
you're


---------40:44----------
confident you recognize your own worth


---------40:47----------
and at the same time


---------40:48----------
you sort of acknowledge in a simple sort


---------40:50----------
of like human way that


---------40:52----------
other people are super important to and


---------40:55----------
that the really cool thing is that it


---------40:56----------
seems like you can hit both of those


---------40:59----------
you know birds with one stone in terms


---------41:00----------
of you can do something for yourself


---------41:02----------
and do something for other people and


---------41:05----------
that the two aren't actually like


---------41:07----------
one doesn't have to come at the cost of


---------41:08----------
the other that's what i think is


---------41:09----------
actually really cool about a lot of what


---------41:11----------
you spend your time on


---------41:12----------
is that sure you can enjoy opening


---------41:14----------
yu-gi-oh cards but your stream enjoys it


---------41:15----------
too


---------41:16----------
right and it's it's fun for all of you


---------41:18----------
guys together


---------41:20----------
yeah there's some real enablers in there


---------41:22----------
though i'll tell you what they'll tell


---------41:23----------
me i don't have enough


---------41:24----------
cards and i feel like i have to [ __ ]


---------41:25----------
prove them wrong about to flip my desk


---------41:26----------
over and just order 34 more


---------41:30----------
how many how many packs are in a box


---------41:33----------
24 packs in a box wow


---------41:37----------
and why do you order 34 boxes


---------41:40----------
why 34. well you see it's simple


---------41:43----------
mathematics the more boxes the more


---------41:45----------
chances of pulling that one starlight


---------41:47----------
we've been hunting for


---------41:48----------
but why not 36 or 40 or 42 why


---------41:52----------
jesus you're sounding like my chat


---------41:54----------
you're going to make me order 100 boxes


---------41:55----------
by the end of this stream


---------41:58----------
[Music]


---------41:59----------
that's what the seller had i just


---------42:01----------
ordered out a full seller oh


---------42:03----------
got it okay yes you know this is gonna


---------42:06----------
take a a kind of a a dark turn but


---------42:08----------
sometimes when i deal with people who


---------42:11----------
have had a suicide attempt with taking


---------42:13----------
too many pills


---------42:15----------
they'll say like i took 27 pills and


---------42:17----------
then i'll be like


---------42:18----------
why 27 like why not 24 or 30.


---------42:22----------
and and often the the common answer is


---------42:25----------
because that's


---------42:25----------
everything that was in the bottle


---------42:28----------
um so it sounds like you know they were


---------42:30----------
emptying out their supply too


---------42:32----------
which is a little bit morbid but that's


---------42:35----------
i like to think that buying out the


---------42:37----------
yugioh boxes wouldn't be as


---------42:39----------
hardcore as swallowing a bottle of pills


---------42:41----------
but maybe i just haven't bought enough


---------42:43----------
boxes yet


---------42:44----------
you drown in the youtube cards or


---------42:46----------
something so


---------42:47----------
charlie i do wonder a little bit about


---------42:49----------
you know why you


---------42:51----------
feel guilty right where does that mean


---------42:54----------
the wrong word maybe it's just uh maybe


---------42:57----------
that you know kind of little


---------42:58----------
icky feeling you get sometimes where you


---------43:01----------
did something and it's like well


---------43:03----------
yeah but i could have done this this


---------43:05----------
would have probably


---------43:06----------
been a better use of this time or this


---------43:08----------
resource


---------43:09----------
maybe guilty's just a little too hard of


---------43:11----------
a word for what i feel because it's not


---------43:13----------
like i'm


---------43:14----------
waking up in a cold sweat like charlie


---------43:16----------
you have sinned and now we can't sleep


---------43:18----------
because of it


---------43:19----------
it's just when i make that decision it's


---------43:21----------
like ah that's you know


---------43:22----------
that's a little that's a little icky


---------43:24----------
right what's icky


---------43:27----------
[Music]


---------43:28----------
it's just like that that nagging


---------43:30----------
sensation where


---------43:32----------
i'm trying to think of a good way of


---------43:33----------
putting it because it's not like


---------43:35----------
terrible i don't feel


---------43:36----------
absolutely destroyed if i buy yu-gi-oh


---------43:39----------
boxes


---------43:40----------
i'm not inconsolable i'm not in the


---------43:42----------
corner crying about it it's just like


---------43:44----------
there's other people that want to buy


---------43:46----------
these things and i just bought this


---------43:47----------
entire seller's supply for the sake of


---------43:49----------
opening it on stream


---------43:50----------
did i need to buy all of them no


---------43:53----------
probably not this stream probably would


---------43:54----------
have been just as fun with


---------43:56----------
half of those boxes okay


---------44:01----------
so just a little bit like you know


---------44:04----------
didn't need to do that i went a little


---------44:05----------
hard there and now i feel a little gross


---------44:07----------
for doing that because now maybe


---------44:08----------
somebody


---------44:09----------
that wanted those or maybe someone's


---------44:11----------
parents were going to order from that


---------44:12----------
seller for their kid or something


---------44:13----------
now they can't because well now the


---------44:15----------
grease king's sitting on all 34 boxes


---------44:18----------
see so so it sounds like once again in


---------44:20----------
the in the ickiness what we're thinking


---------44:22----------
about is


---------44:23----------
in a weird way your mind is kind of


---------44:24----------
thinking about the possibility that


---------44:27----------
through your indulgence you've deprived


---------44:29----------
someone else of


---------44:30----------
an opportunity that's definitely fair


---------44:32----------
because there's there's only so many


---------44:33----------
boxes right and i just took a huge


---------44:36----------
chunk of them off the market so for the


---------44:38----------
fans of the game that actually play the


---------44:39----------
game and keep in mind i don't actually


---------44:41----------
go out and battle they can't get those


---------44:43----------
cards now now i have them


---------44:46----------
and i will not sell them by the way you


---------44:48----------
[ __ ] they're mine


---------44:50----------
yeah so i once again i'm noticing a


---------44:52----------
slight tension in terms of like the way


---------44:54----------
that your mind


---------44:57----------
measures you against others right that


---------45:00----------
that doing something


---------45:01----------
indulgence towards yourself and i'm not


---------45:03----------
saying it's big or bad or like this is a


---------45:05----------
smoking gun or anything but i think


---------45:06----------
the interesting thing is as we develop


---------45:08----------
as human beings


---------45:09----------
the problems with our mind become more


---------45:12----------
and more sudden


---------45:13----------
they become smaller and and there's


---------45:16----------
still sort of this tension where if i


---------45:18----------
get something someone else


---------45:19----------
doesn't it's a tiny tiny one tiny tiny


---------45:22----------
none


---------45:23----------
one and and you know small one


---------45:26----------
nano nano babu means nano means small


---------45:29----------
babu means baby and it's something that


---------45:31----------
my kids say from time to time


---------45:34----------
a tiny tiny baby so my younger kid talks


---------45:38----------
about


---------45:39----------
tiny tiny baby canora viruses which is


---------45:41----------
why we can't go to the playground


---------45:43----------
oh that's a good way of putting it yeah


---------45:46----------
um but you know i i'd encourage you


---------45:50----------
charlie to just keep


---------45:52----------
track of that and just notice you know


---------45:55----------
that


---------45:55----------
in your mind for some reason when you


---------45:58----------
buy something your mind


---------46:00----------
has a script that turns on which starts


---------46:02----------
thinking about


---------46:03----------
how someone else could be deprived by


---------46:05----------
what you've done


---------46:07----------
whereas i doubt i mean when you say


---------46:09----------
you've you know bought out a significant


---------46:11----------
share of the supply of yugioh boxes i


---------46:13----------
doubt that well at least on one website


---------46:17----------
i can tell you you could probably find


---------46:19----------
like a measurable


---------46:20----------
graph somewhere that shows before i


---------46:22----------
started streaming it and then after for


---------46:24----------
rise of the duelist


---------46:25----------
okay i think in total we've had like


---------46:27----------
[ __ ] 60 boxes worth of that that


---------46:29----------
we've opened on stream


---------46:30----------
i wouldn't be surprised if konami just


---------46:32----------
stops giving it to vendors and starts


---------46:34----------
sending it right to me or something


---------46:35----------
to make more money that way um


---------46:38----------
do you see what i'm saying though about


---------46:39----------
just sort of the automaticity of your


---------46:41----------
thought process in terms of like


---------46:44----------
doing something maybe indulging because


---------46:46----------
you're you're not


---------46:47----------
you know that's a sort of a situation


---------46:48----------
where there's one toy there's two toys


---------46:50----------
there's no toys and then you're like


---------46:52----------
going into toys r us and


---------46:54----------
you have the perception that you're kind


---------46:55----------
of buying out like an entire shelf of


---------46:57----------
something


---------46:58----------
and then your mind sort of thing starts


---------47:00----------
thinking about other people because you


---------47:02----------
do seem like you care about other people


---------47:04----------
and and there's just this little script


---------47:06----------
i'd encourage you to just keep an eye on


---------47:08----------
that


---------47:09----------
um there may be something more to that


---------47:11----------
can i tell you


---------47:12----------
i'll go into a little bit more detail


---------47:14----------
apologies if i'm kind of losing you am i


---------47:15----------
losing you


---------47:17----------
no absolutely not man absolutely so wild


---------47:19----------
so


---------47:20----------
the the other just thought that i have


---------47:22----------
is that i think


---------47:23----------
teaching indulgence to your kids is also


---------47:26----------
pretty important i don't know if you're


---------47:27----------
thinking about having kids you're


---------47:28----------
planning on having kids or want kids or


---------47:30----------
whatever


---------47:31----------
but you know i think teaching temperance


---------47:34----------
and restriction to your kids is


---------47:36----------
important but also


---------47:38----------
that sometimes they do get to come first


---------47:40----------
is like something that


---------47:42----------
i try to teach my kids is that sometimes


---------47:45----------
they get to come first and i'm wondering


---------47:50----------
you know i think part of what how can i


---------47:53----------
say this


---------47:54----------
i think you deserve more than you give


---------47:56----------
yourself charlie


---------48:00----------
hmm that's sweet i think


---------48:04----------
yeah i mean i from everything i said i


---------48:06----------
totally get where you'd come from here


---------48:08----------
but


---------48:08----------
i don't think that i deprive myself of


---------48:10----------
anything for the sake of


---------48:12----------
giving someone else anything i still


---------48:13----------
think you know if there is something


---------48:15----------
that i want and it is something just for


---------48:17----------
me i don't really like hesitate to get


---------48:19----------
it i don't think there's really been too


---------48:21----------
many cases of where like


---------48:22----------
you know i felt so guilty for giving


---------48:24----------
myself something that someone else might


---------48:26----------
not have it


---------48:27----------
i don't think i've really suffered too


---------48:28----------
much from that and even as a kid it's


---------48:30----------
not like i felt that way either


---------48:32----------
but from everything i've said i could


---------48:34----------
totally get why maybe you'd feel that


---------48:35----------
way i just don't


---------48:36----------
see it personally yeah maybe i'm a


---------48:38----------
little biased in it maybe my girlfriend


---------48:40----------
would feel differently where she's like


---------48:41----------
charlie you know you never really


---------48:43----------
do this for yourself but for me i just


---------48:45----------
don't get that feeling


---------48:46----------
yeah so charlie i'm not so let me be a


---------48:49----------
little bit even clearer so what i'm


---------48:50----------
talking about is that i think you give


---------48:52----------
yourself 99


---------48:53----------
of what you deserve what i'm talking


---------48:56----------
about is a one percent here


---------48:58----------
and the reason that i think that's


---------48:59----------
important has nothing to do with like


---------49:01----------
you depriving yourself


---------49:02----------
it actually has to do it i realize i'm


---------49:04----------
sort of stepping outside of my bounds


---------49:06----------
here but


---------49:06----------
i think it actually has to do with your


---------49:08----------
spiritual growth


---------49:10----------
so i i think that being able to


---------49:14----------
acknowledge and give yourself like


---------49:17----------
to be free from those thoughts those


---------49:19----------
automatic thoughts that you're depriving


---------49:20----------
someone


---------49:21----------
i think is actually like a step forward


---------49:23----------
for you


---------49:24----------
and that doesn't have to do with


---------49:26----------
actually buying more yu-gi-oh cards or


---------49:28----------
buying less yu-gi-oh cards


---------49:30----------
i'm not actually talking i'm not saying


---------49:32----------
that you should


---------49:33----------
give yourself more than you do what i'm


---------49:36----------
talking about is your sense of deserving


---------49:39----------
right that you should be comfortable and


---------49:42----------
acknowledge that


---------49:43----------
it's okay for you to indulge in that


---------49:45----------
other people aren't


---------49:47----------
that's what i'm talking about something


---------49:48----------
that's very very subtle i don't think


---------49:49----------
it's like an issue


---------49:50----------
i don't think it impairs your function i


---------49:52----------
don't think it's a problem


---------49:54----------
does that make sense it's just the


---------49:56----------
barrier of where you are


---------49:58----------
based on our conversation no i totally


---------50:01----------
get where you're coming from yeah that


---------50:02----------
makes sense


---------50:04----------
um yeah what do you how are we doing is


---------50:06----------
this conversation okay to you


---------50:09----------
yeah absolutely man i always enjoy these


---------50:10----------
things like i said i watch your show i


---------50:12----------
always like to hear these conversations


---------50:13----------
so to take part in one i mean i think


---------50:15----------
that's great


---------50:16----------
yeah uh i find myself being curious


---------50:18----------
about your girlfriend but also like


---------50:20----------
have a bunch of questions about um


---------50:24----------
i don't know how comfortable


---------50:30----------
but then they're also kind of questions


---------50:32----------
about like community and


---------50:34----------
and thinking about like different kinds


---------50:36----------
of community


---------50:37----------
um thinking about like hate and toxicity


---------50:40----------
um what do you think would be a better


---------50:42----------
use of our time


---------50:45----------
really i'm um this is your ship you're


---------50:46----------
one i'm willing to go wherever you want


---------50:48----------
to steer us i'm fine to talk about


---------50:50----------
any of that if you want to talk about


---------50:51----------
the toxic communities or something i


---------50:53----------
mean that's been pretty prevalent these


---------50:54----------
days so


---------50:55----------
i'm fine with whatever okay i mean


---------50:59----------
uh i need some kind of direction


---------51:02----------
all right then uh i think it'd be


---------51:04----------
beneficial if we talked about toxic


---------51:05----------
communities then i think that's a


---------51:07----------
something that's big right now something


---------51:09----------
that's been big for a little while that


---------51:10----------
why not talk about it absolutely so uh


---------51:13----------
can you tell me a little bit about


---------51:15----------
toxic communities and when you say it's


---------51:17----------
been big for a while what do you mean by


---------51:18----------
that


---------51:19----------
okay so for uh we'll just use the the


---------51:22----------
one everyone targets and i'm no


---------51:24----------
exception i also talk about it live


---------51:26----------
stream fails i know a lot of people


---------51:28----------
like to target them for everything wrong


---------51:30----------
with their stream and everything wrong


---------51:32----------
with


---------51:32----------
anything that when it comes to twitch in


---------51:34----------
particular and i've definitely made that


---------51:36----------
mistake before too where it's like


---------51:38----------
livestream fails has done this this and


---------51:40----------
this to these people


---------51:41----------
and i just think that's probably the


---------51:43----------
wrong approach to take it's a


---------51:44----------
community full of a bunch of different


---------51:46----------
people and i don't really think it's as


---------51:48----------
toxic as a lot of people have made it


---------51:49----------
out to be


---------51:50----------
myself included it's just there's a very


---------51:52----------
vocal minority of people that hijack


---------51:54----------
something like that it's the same thing


---------51:55----------
with chats like i don't think xqc's chat


---------51:57----------
is the most


---------51:58----------
toxic annoying place in the world it's


---------52:00----------
just there are some people


---------52:02----------
that take over and make that become the


---------52:04----------
public perception


---------52:05----------
what would your thoughts be on that do


---------52:07----------
you really think that there is this


---------52:08----------
overwhelmingly


---------52:09----------
large number of people that say these


---------52:12----------
bad things or feel this terrible way


---------52:13----------
about people


---------52:14----------
or is it just a small group that make it


---------52:16----------
seem that way


---------52:20----------
i think both are true so let me start by


---------52:23----------
saying i didn't realize that live stream


---------52:25----------
fails had a


---------52:26----------
reputation for uh harboring toxicity i


---------52:29----------
mean so when i browse lsf i tend to find


---------52:31----------
it


---------52:32----------
somewhat enjoyable and i thought


---------52:33----------
everyone sort of knew that the point of


---------52:35----------
lsf is that you take things out of


---------52:37----------
context


---------52:39----------
yeah well especially with yeah


---------52:41----------
especially with your show that's become


---------52:42----------
like a real big meme there is to take


---------52:44----------
some clips out yeah


---------52:45----------
so so so i mean i i actually i mean i


---------52:47----------
think it's


---------52:48----------
kind of funny i don't i don't feel like


---------52:52----------
personally lsf or the people on lsf


---------52:55----------
breed negativity i try to steer clear of


---------52:58----------
my clips but i think it's just


---------53:00----------
it's it's just funny right it's like


---------53:02----------
it's clips


---------53:04----------
first of all so you're not getting


---------53:06----------
really a fair representation it's like


---------53:08----------
it's like a meme generator


---------53:10----------
and meme generators i don't think are


---------53:12----------
going to be able to capture the truth


---------53:14----------
um i do know that lsf has been i think a


---------53:17----------
lot more mindful recently that


---------53:19----------
despite you know when you generate memes


---------53:21----------
sometimes you can go a little bit too


---------53:22----------
far


---------53:23----------
and that and and so it seems to me like


---------53:24----------
the the community has been like the lsf


---------53:27----------
modding community


---------53:28----------
um you know i think has been making a


---------53:31----------
lot of active changes which sound


---------53:32----------
awesome to me in terms of


---------53:34----------
uh i don't know like all the details but


---------53:36----------
i i think they're becoming more mindful


---------53:38----------
of what they create and what kind of


---------53:41----------
effects that they have and they've been


---------53:42----------
thinking about it more which seems to be


---------53:44----------
like a step in the right direction


---------53:46----------
um so that's what i'd say about lsf but


---------53:51----------
i'm relatively new to twitch and also


---------53:53----------
relatively new to lsf so i don't know if


---------53:55----------
they've been worse in the past or


---------53:56----------
you know what's been going on yeah i


---------53:59----------
think the reputation


---------54:00----------
i'm not like a frequent browser i'm only


---------54:02----------
an occasional one i don't know what new


---------54:04----------
modding things are implemented but i


---------54:06----------
think the reason why lsf gets that


---------54:07----------
reputation is because for a long time i


---------54:09----------
don't know if this is still the case but


---------54:10----------
the most popular posts were like


---------54:12----------
here's salinity being [ __ ] terrible


---------54:14----------
and then here's a clip of valenti from a


---------54:16----------
year ago still being terrible and you'll


---------54:17----------
have all these like old clips piled on


---------54:19----------
top of


---------54:19----------
one another targeting one person in


---------54:21----------
particular showing their worst moments


---------54:23----------
and then everyone in the comments is dog


---------54:25----------
piling it


---------54:26----------
and then maybe like five months down the


---------54:28----------
line the perception changes and then


---------54:30----------
everyone acts like


---------54:31----------
well this is terrible you know no one


---------54:33----------
should have ever said these things we


---------54:34----------
never did this


---------54:35----------
and then i wish people would stop


---------54:36----------
generalizing lsf based on its top posts


---------54:38----------
and stuff like that so they get this


---------54:40----------
reputation for


---------54:41----------
being toxic and then pretending they


---------54:44----------
weren't


---------54:45----------
and then they use that same line where


---------54:47----------
it's like it's a 900 000 person


---------54:49----------
community


---------54:50----------
you can't target us based on a couple


---------54:52----------
people even though it's their top post


---------54:54----------
which means it's most representative of


---------54:55----------
what people wanted


---------54:56----------
what people were vibing with so i do


---------54:59----------
think that that


---------54:59----------
uh so going to like you know the vocal


---------55:02----------
minority i think that


---------55:03----------
it's very common that a community can be


---------55:07----------
influenced by a vocal minority like in


---------55:10----------
chat you'll get a couple of real trolls


---------55:12----------
who


---------55:12----------
you know speak more so i think that


---------55:14----------
generally speaking majorities tend to be


---------55:16----------
silent


---------55:18----------
um and that minorities can oftentimes be


---------55:21----------
vocal


---------55:22----------
and so that is true but i i do think


---------55:24----------
just like you said though charlie like i


---------55:26----------
think that


---------55:27----------
we can't hide behind that anymore


---------55:30----------
because of things like when you upvote


---------55:34----------
right like when when a when a post makes


---------55:36----------
it to the top of live stream fails


---------55:38----------
that's not a vocal minority that's the


---------55:41----------
silent majority that is the action of


---------55:43----------
the silent majority


---------55:45----------
and so when that gets upvoted that


---------55:46----------
actually is representative of your


---------55:48----------
community


---------55:50----------
um and i i think especially with some of


---------55:51----------
these other you know


---------55:53----------
toxic communities which i've recently


---------55:55----------
learned about right so they're like i


---------55:56----------
recently discovered that they're like


---------55:58----------
um just kind of a funny meme story about


---------56:01----------
this but like someone mentioned keemstar


---------56:04----------
and i didn't know that that was a person


---------56:06----------
when i first heard it


---------56:07----------
like i thought because you know it's


---------56:09----------
like a term right so like like if you


---------56:10----------
say sky nut for example like i'm


---------56:12----------
assuming that that's just something that


---------56:13----------
someone made up


---------56:15----------
right like it's not like a per because


---------56:17----------
like you just can't [ __ ] tell


---------56:19----------
like is moist critical a person or like


---------56:21----------
it's just confusing


---------56:22----------
anyway so i think that there are like


---------56:24----------
communities right where


---------56:26----------
where people create content that is


---------56:28----------
geared towards attacking other people


---------56:30----------
and to be fair those communities are


---------56:33----------
gigantic


---------56:34----------
and they get tons of viewership which


---------56:37----------
says to me that this is not an


---------56:38----------
issue of a vocal minority that there is


---------56:41----------
actually a silent majority of people


---------56:43----------
there


---------56:44----------
and oddly enough you know i know this is


---------56:46----------
going to sound weird i think we have to


---------56:47----------
be careful about judging them because i


---------56:49----------
still don't know


---------56:51----------
why these people upvote what they do


---------56:54----------
so so there's just sort of this sense


---------56:55----------
that we call all of these people toxic


---------56:58----------
and i'm sure that that's fair but you


---------57:01----------
know i tend to


---------57:02----------
do my best to not


---------57:06----------
judge an entire person based on a


---------57:09----------
particular action


---------57:10----------
so i'm sure there are toxic people out


---------57:12----------
there but if you have


---------57:13----------
you know like a like an attack video


---------57:16----------
youtube or whatever that has like five


---------57:19----------
million subscribers like that's not


---------57:21----------
a vocal minority right that that


---------57:25----------
person's channel is successful because


---------57:29----------
there's actually a lot of people out


---------57:30----------
there who are experiencing


---------57:32----------
a lot of something and i personally am


---------57:34----------
curious like


---------57:35----------
what they're experiencing like i don't


---------57:37----------
know why these people


---------57:39----------
upvote this stuff


---------57:43----------
yeah i guess to bring it back into terms


---------57:45----------
with livestream fails i


---------57:47----------
i guess it would more be the sense of


---------57:49----------
community right that would be my take


---------57:51----------
where everyone's mad at this person so


---------57:52----------
maybe somebody feels like well if


---------57:53----------
they're mad


---------57:54----------
there's a reason for it i should be mad


---------57:56----------
even if maybe they don't feel that


---------57:57----------
strongly they'll still chime and be like


---------57:59----------
yo


---------58:00----------
i don't like this yuck what the [ __ ] is


---------58:01----------
that oh jesus upvote you know


---------58:04----------
i don't really think it's a whole bunch


---------58:05----------
of people that genuinely hate the person


---------58:07----------
or anything


---------58:08----------
like that they probably don't even know


---------58:09----------
who it is they just see that this is


---------58:11----------
popular


---------58:12----------
i'm in this community pretty often which


---------58:13----------
means i should feel the same way so i'm


---------58:16----------
going to


---------58:17----------
you know take on the same mindset you


---------58:18----------
know what i mean i don't think it's


---------58:20----------
necessarily always malicious where this


---------58:22----------
person is trying to you know


---------58:24----------
ruin the person that's being targeted


---------58:26----------
they just feel like they're missing out


---------58:27----------
by not


---------58:28----------
being in the same line as everyone else


---------58:30----------
in the community that they frequent


---------58:33----------
i've i'm quite skeptical of that so let


---------58:35----------
me ask you this charlie when you upvote


---------58:37----------
something on reddit


---------58:38----------
what's in your mind when you upvote it


---------58:41----------
well this is you're not going to believe


---------58:44----------
this but i've never


---------58:45----------
upvoted anything on reddit in my life


---------58:47----------
okay so


---------58:48----------
that actually makes a lot of sense to me


---------58:52----------
because i i think that your hypothesis


---------58:54----------
about what is in someone's mind


---------58:57----------
i wouldn't agree with that they're doing


---------58:59----------
it just because other people are doing


---------59:01----------
it


---------59:01----------
yeah that's totally fair maybe i'm just


---------59:03----------
out right wrong because i don't know


---------59:05----------
like maybe they are really feeling this


---------59:07----------
yeah so so as someone who upvotes a lot


---------59:09----------
on reddit and comments


---------59:11----------
rarely i upvote things that resonate


---------59:13----------
with me in some way


---------59:14----------
that i agree with and i downvote things


---------59:18----------
that i don't agree with


---------59:21----------
and don't resonate with the exception


---------59:24----------
being


---------59:25----------
i can resonate with something that i


---------59:27----------
disagree with if the guise


---------59:29----------
of the


---------59:32----------
given the premise of the post so for


---------59:34----------
example sometimes there are posts that


---------59:36----------
are


---------59:36----------
criticizing me that'll actually upvote


---------59:38----------
because i think they bring up good


---------59:39----------
criticisms


---------59:40----------
so i can disagree with what they're


---------59:41----------
saying but i i resonate with the post in


---------59:44----------
some way and i think generally speaking


---------59:46----------
when you think about upvote and downvote


---------59:47----------
i never think about oh my god a bunch of


---------59:49----------
people are upvoting this


---------59:51----------
i better upvote it too i've never


---------59:53----------
experienced that now that could be


---------59:54----------
happening subconsciously


---------59:56----------
but usually i tend to upvote things that


---------59:58----------
i find


---------59:59----------
like resonate with me in some way if i


---------60:01----------
find it funny i'm gonna upvote it i


---------60:02----------
don't care that other people find it


---------60:04----------
funny


---------60:06----------
i think it it it connects with you and


---------60:08----------
that's what happens with social media


---------60:10----------
and like likes and dislikes is


---------60:12----------
sure i'm sure there's a peer pressure


---------60:13----------
element to it but i think the


---------60:15----------
interesting thing about social media is


---------60:16----------
that


---------60:17----------
they've given us a chance like what


---------60:19----------
rises to the top


---------60:21----------
certainly has issues of popularity but i


---------60:23----------
think that there's like some content


---------60:24----------
that people


---------60:25----------
resonate with right like let's think


---------60:26----------
about yugioh like some there's something


---------60:29----------
that when people watch you open yu-gi-oh


---------60:31----------
facts something about them like when


---------60:34----------
they see your nostalgia


---------60:36----------
when they see your excitement your hope


---------60:38----------
it resonates with them


---------60:40----------
and it's like man i remember opening


---------60:42----------
yu-gi-oh packs hell yeah i'll put this


---------60:44----------
[ __ ]


---------60:45----------
you know like let's see if he does it


---------60:46----------
cause i i know what


---------60:48----------
starlight rare starlight something


---------60:50----------
what's that yeah


---------60:51----------
what's it called starlight starlight


---------60:53----------
rare starlight rare


---------60:55----------
so like a starlight like they remember


---------60:57----------
hunting for the starlight rare


---------60:59----------
and so it connects with them and i i


---------61:02----------
think the internet is


---------61:03----------
is about actually i know this sounds


---------61:05----------
bizarre but i think it's actually about


---------61:06----------
connection i think what social media


---------61:08----------
twitch


---------61:08----------
i mean twitch is about connection it's


---------61:11----------
about connecting with the person that


---------61:12----------
you're watching the person that you're


---------61:13----------
watching resonating with you


---------61:15----------
if we think about our stream that's also


---------61:17----------
about connection


---------61:18----------
so we've grown because the people who


---------61:20----------
come on here say and do things that


---------61:22----------
people


---------61:23----------
feel connected to


---------61:26----------
yeah i can totally agree with that so i


---------61:28----------
guess mainly the reason why i was


---------61:30----------
feeling that way when it comes to


---------61:31----------
something like lsf and things rising to


---------61:33----------
the top and maybe not being


---------61:35----------
you know maliciously upvoting something


---------61:37----------
bad is because you can see it a lot in a


---------61:39----------
chat right where if somebody posts


---------61:40----------
some kind of copy pasta or you know some


---------61:44----------
assy art picture of titties or the hydra


---------61:46----------
dick


---------61:46----------
you'll immediately see you haven't seen


---------61:49----------
the


---------61:49----------
well i don't even want to attempt it


---------61:51----------
because i hate that kind of [ __ ] i don't


---------61:52----------
like spam but


---------61:53----------
when somebody does like a copy pasta or


---------61:55----------
a hydro dick or three titty


---------61:57----------
spam thing you'll see 50 people


---------61:59----------
immediately


---------62:00----------
start posting the same thing so i would


---------62:04----------
i would imagine that that extends to


---------62:05----------
other platforms so when you see


---------62:07----------
something on reddit where it rises


---------62:08----------
pretty quickly


---------62:10----------
you'll typically would at least in my


---------62:12----------
perspective you'd see other people just


---------62:14----------
hop on it like well they're doing it i'm


---------62:17----------
going to do it i'll upload this as well


---------62:19----------
and i don't necessarily care too much


---------62:20----------
about what this person did


---------62:22----------
but everyone else is doing it so i'm


---------62:24----------
probably just gonna upload it too


---------62:26----------
yeah so i think there's certainly a mob


---------62:28----------
mentality


---------62:29----------
yeah but but i don't think the mob


---------62:31----------
mentality is the same as peer pressure i


---------62:33----------
think it's like more


---------62:34----------
instinctual right so like reddit becomes


---------62:36----------
like a school of fish


---------62:38----------
that certainly like one fish freaks out


---------62:40----------
and goes this way and then they're like


---------62:42----------
one bird


---------62:43----------
you know if you see a bunch of birds


---------62:44----------
roosting and then one bird jumps out and


---------62:46----------
starts flying all the other birds jump


---------62:48----------
out and start flying


---------62:49----------
so certainly is i think a group think


---------62:50----------
aspect to it but i i think by the way is


---------62:53----------
it a


---------62:53----------
hydro dick or hydra dick hydra


---------62:56----------
and i want to apologize to your mods i


---------62:58----------
just made their job so much [ __ ]


---------63:00----------
harder by even mentioning that sorry


---------63:02----------
hydra dick yeah like oh like the greek


---------63:05----------
monster yeah it's like just a bunch of


---------63:08----------
bunch of dicks


---------63:09----------
yeah okay i mean


---------63:13----------
they're dicks in all shapes and sizes on


---------63:15----------
the internet


---------63:16----------
you'd be surprised um anyway


---------63:20----------
yeah so so i i do think though that


---------63:23----------
that i'm not so sure that it's a vocal


---------63:25----------
minority


---------63:26----------
charlie because i think that you know


---------63:28----------
you do have entire communities that are


---------63:29----------
very successful


---------63:31----------
that are built on attacking other people


---------63:35----------
what do you think about that you i mean


---------63:38----------
that definitely exists i mean


---------63:39----------
yeah if you can see that especially


---------63:41----------
there's entire channels based around it


---------63:42----------
on youtube i mean


---------63:44----------
for better for worse sometimes it's


---------63:46----------
legitimate criticism or sometimes it's


---------63:48----------
pointing out something someone did to


---------63:50----------
make jokes about it and just have fun


---------63:51----------
about it i think there's definitely


---------63:52----------
different


---------63:53----------
levels of it different tiers where


---------63:55----------
there's someone that's hateful


---------63:57----------
about it like they hate this person and


---------63:59----------
they're just gonna keep


---------64:00----------
insulting them maybe there's nothing


---------64:02----------
constructive and maybe there's nothing


---------64:03----------
entertaining about it


---------64:04----------
and i think that's the worst level where


---------64:06----------
it's there for hate to fuel this hate


---------64:08----------
machine where


---------64:09----------
i think in today's landscape of social


---------64:11----------
media people like to be angry more than


---------64:13----------
they like to be happy


---------64:14----------
i think in general scheme of things


---------64:16----------
people like to feel like there's a


---------64:18----------
common enemy that they can all unite


---------64:19----------
against and hate against


---------64:21----------
and channels that simply aim to fuel


---------64:23----------
that to give them someone to hate


---------64:24----------
without anything constructive or


---------64:26----------
entertaining


---------64:26----------
i think that's probably the worst level


---------64:28----------
of it i don't necessarily feel that


---------64:30----------
about live stream fails in particular i


---------64:32----------
feel that's more


---------64:33----------
here's just some drama we can all rally


---------64:35----------
behind and maybe just mindlessly upvote


---------64:38----------
but i definitely think on other


---------64:39----------
platforms and on youtube there's


---------64:40----------
definitely channels that do that but


---------64:42----------
on twitch i don't see too much of just


---------64:44----------
hate for the sake of hate i


---------64:46----------
i feel it's more just here's drama let's


---------64:48----------
just treat it like a you know


---------64:50----------
reality tv show okay so can you tell me


---------64:53----------
a little bit about like how


---------64:54----------
youtube and twitch and their communities


---------64:56----------
and the level of toxicity is different


---------64:59----------
yeah so i i actually think leafy made a


---------65:02----------
good point with this


---------65:03----------
when before he got banned the on twitch


---------65:06----------
everyone's really kind of looking out


---------65:07----------
for each streamer


---------65:08----------
you know if a streamer is being attacked


---------65:09----------
nine times out of ten you'll see other


---------65:10----------
streamers come to their aid


---------65:12----------
on youtube if someone's being attacked


---------65:14----------
it's the trendy thing to immediately hop


---------65:16----------
on and attack that person as well


---------65:18----------
i mean you saw it with james charles you


---------65:19----------
saw it with pretty much everyone and i'm


---------65:21----------
guilty with the james charles thing in


---------65:22----------
particular


---------65:23----------
but in youtube it's people eating each


---------65:25----------
other right


---------65:26----------
and i'm not saying guilty with the james


---------65:28----------
charles thing like i did anything bad i


---------65:29----------
just meant like


---------65:30----------
i talked about it but on youtube when


---------65:32----------
someone's james charles


---------65:34----------
he's a big makeup youtuber he had like a


---------65:36----------
big scandal and stuff


---------65:38----------
and everyone was talking about it but it


---------65:40----------
turned out it's all just a bunch of


---------65:41----------
[ __ ] but


---------65:43----------
on youtube it's it's best for a lot of


---------65:45----------
these channels to immediately hop


---------65:47----------
on when someone's getting attacked when


---------65:49----------
they're vulnerable because that's where


---------65:50----------
all the views are for those people


---------65:52----------
like you saw it with pokeman every


---------65:54----------
youtuber was making five videos about


---------65:56----------
pokeman because leafy made a video about


---------65:57----------
pokemane


---------65:58----------
that's how it's treated there that's the


---------66:00----------
normal culture of youtube


---------66:02----------
on twitch if that happens from what i've


---------66:04----------
seen for my two years on here


---------66:06----------
when someone's getting attacked like


---------66:08----------
that other streamers aren't super quick


---------66:10----------
to immediately start attacking that


---------66:12----------
person


---------66:12----------
they'll typically wait a lot of times


---------66:14----------
they'll defend the streamer


---------66:16----------
it's it's a very different perspective a


---------66:18----------
very different approach


---------66:20----------
when someone's getting attacked on the


---------66:21----------
platforms youtube it'll be like a dog


---------66:24----------
pile like everyone's trying to


---------66:25----------
desperately recover


---------66:26----------
recover a fumble in football but on


---------66:28----------
twitch it's people feel more connected


---------66:30----------
as like a community


---------66:32----------
that's the biggest difference has that


---------66:34----------
affected you how long have you been on


---------66:36----------
youtube


---------66:38----------
14 years okay so like like have you


---------66:42----------
have have the platform sort of affected


---------66:44----------
you differently


---------66:46----------
no i wouldn't say so i not not me


---------66:49----------
personally but just i can definitely see


---------66:51----------
the differences


---------66:52----------
it's not something that i've been uh


---------66:54----------
victim to or something that i've really


---------66:56----------
been like in the [ __ ] mix of or


---------66:58----------
anything but it's something since i've


---------66:59----------
been on both


---------67:00----------
ever since i've been on that for so long


---------67:02----------
and then coming over here i can


---------67:03----------
immediately recognize


---------67:04----------
the big difference between the two when


---------67:06----------
it comes to that


---------67:08----------
and and do you have to deal with like


---------67:09----------
hate


---------67:11----------
oh i mean everyone does right i mean


---------67:12----------
that's that comes with putting yourself


---------67:14----------
out there everyone has to deal with some


---------67:15----------
level people not liking you or lying


---------67:17----------
about you or something like that


---------67:19----------
that unfortunately does come with the


---------67:21----------
territory and it's something that i've


---------67:22----------
accepted a long time ago


---------67:24----------
so it's not something that bothers me


---------67:26----------
it's not anything that i you know


---------67:28----------
how do you how do you let it not bother


---------67:30----------
you how do you do that


---------67:32----------
i think that's people yeah it's gonna be


---------67:35----------
different for everyone uh


---------67:36----------
it's just a matter of just being there


---------67:38----------
for so long i think at the end of the


---------67:40----------
day


---------67:40----------
it's important to recognize that when


---------67:42----------
somebody's saying these things


---------67:44----------
you know it's not the worst thing in the


---------67:46----------
world it's somebody you don't know it's


---------67:47----------
a stranger you don't know their


---------67:48----------
situation


---------67:50----------
it's just you know it is what it is they


---------67:52----------
felt this strongly and there's nothing


---------67:54----------
you can do to change their mind


---------67:55----------
at the end of the day it's out of your


---------67:56----------
hands and what makes me


---------67:59----------
feel better about it is like you know


---------68:00----------
what i don't know that person


---------68:02----------
they don't really know me they didn't


---------68:04----------
like this about me and that's fine


---------68:06----------
i just let sleeping dogs lie in chat if


---------68:08----------
someone's talking some [ __ ] i'll


---------68:09----------
obviously joke around and start talking


---------68:11----------
[ __ ] back at them that's totally


---------68:12----------
different


---------68:13----------
that's just more banter between two


---------68:15----------
people or sometimes it gets a little


---------68:17----------
more hostile just


---------68:18----------
but that's just for the sake of having a


---------68:19----------
little fun conversation or a little


---------68:21----------
debate


---------68:22----------
but when it comes to like actually


---------68:23----------
getting under my skin it doesn't really


---------68:25----------
anymore


---------68:26----------
and for people that are new to the


---------68:27----------
internet i can absolutely see it really


---------68:29----------
getting them


---------68:30----------
because it gets vicious especially with


---------68:32----------
the way twitter is right now


---------68:33----------
it's like they need everyone to be this


---------68:35----------
perfect robot


---------68:36----------
and i think the sooner you accept that


---------68:38----------
you know


---------68:39----------
you're never going to be perfect not


---------68:41----------
everyone's going to like you the better


---------68:42----------
off you're going to be


---------68:43----------
and getting thicker skin when it comes


---------68:45----------
to people that are either just being


---------68:47----------
mean for the sake of being mean or just


---------68:49----------
lying for the sake of lying for drama


---------68:51----------
it's just a matter of being there going


---------68:54----------
through it and recognizing that it's not


---------68:55----------
the worst thing in the world


---------68:58----------
when we say where the way twitter is


---------69:00----------
nowadays what do you mean by that


---------69:03----------
well you'll see it all the time i don't


---------69:04----------
know how often you engage with that


---------69:06----------
platform the less the better so if


---------69:07----------
you're not on there often


---------69:08----------
big congratulations that [ __ ] is [ __ ]


---------69:10----------
miserable figure it out


---------69:12----------
yeah it's terrible like when i say with


---------69:15----------
the way twitter is


---------69:16----------
if a youtuber so much is like had a wet


---------69:18----------
fart on a camera


---------69:20----------
11 years ago it's gonna get dug up and


---------69:23----------
it's going to be a controversy


---------69:24----------
if you've made an edgy tweet at any


---------69:26----------
point over the last decade it's going to


---------69:28----------
be found


---------69:29----------
and you're going to get [ __ ] for it and


---------69:32----------
that's


---------69:32----------
just kind of the way it is because like


---------69:34----------
i said i think people really just want


---------69:35----------
to find


---------69:36----------
things to be mad about when it comes to


---------69:38----------
internet people or just in general


---------69:40----------
so the easiest target is content


---------69:42----------
creators because everything they do is


---------69:44----------
public


---------69:44----------
people will constantly tweet everything


---------69:46----------
they're feeling


---------69:47----------
show everything that they're feeling


---------69:49----------
post everything


---------69:51----------
so they can easily find something that


---------69:52----------
gets upset about


---------69:54----------
and at some point you have to accept


---------69:56----------
look someone's gonna be mad about


---------69:58----------
something i've done


---------69:59----------
and i can't change that i i know what


---------70:02----------
kind of person i am


---------70:03----------
it's not what they're saying it is it's


---------70:05----------
really just not


---------70:06----------
anything to this level and i just need


---------70:08----------
to be okay with that going forward


---------70:10----------
at least that's kind of the mentality


---------70:12----------
i've adopted i i don't view it as the


---------70:14----------
worst thing there is when it's


---------70:15----------
one or two people on twitter that are


---------70:17----------
like charlie made this tweet 11 years


---------70:19----------
ago where he said


---------70:21----------
[ __ ] i don't even know i don't tweet


---------70:22----------
that much but he said the chupacabra is


---------70:24----------
real because it [ __ ] his grandfather


---------70:26----------
but


---------70:26----------
charlie's grandfather has been dead for


---------70:27----------
four years he lied to us the chupacabra


---------70:29----------
didn't have sex with his grandfather


---------70:31----------
you know i'm not gonna be like wow [ __ ]


---------70:32----------
now they're mad at me for lying i'm not


---------70:34----------
a liar


---------70:35----------
you know yeah


---------70:40----------
bad example but you get what i'm saying


---------70:41----------
i couldn't think of any


---------70:44----------
yeah no i think chupacabra necrophilia


---------70:48----------
is a great example of something to dig


---------70:49----------
up


---------70:50----------
well to be fair i did lie about that


---------70:52----------
i'll set the record straight the


---------70:53----------
chupacabra is most likely still a lie he


---------70:55----------
never had sex with my grandfather


---------70:58----------
i'll just say it now so charlie like


---------71:00----------
what do we do about this


---------71:03----------
that's a great [ __ ] question man


---------71:04----------
because it's it's like just the general


---------71:06----------
mindset right you can't change


---------71:07----------
what people want you can't change what


---------71:09----------
people have fun engaging with right


---------71:12----------
people love to be mad and they love to


---------71:14----------
have someone to be mad at


---------71:16----------
so what like how do you really fix that


---------71:18----------
you you can't


---------71:19----------
it's what people have decided they


---------71:20----------
personally like


---------71:22----------
and i don't really know what you do


---------71:24----------
about it maybe you have a better


---------71:25----------
suggestion but for me


---------71:26----------
i just don't really know what you'd do


---------71:27----------
for it


---------71:39----------
yeah so i i i don't know i i think


---------71:41----------
there's a lot we can do


---------71:42----------
to be honest um i i think uh


---------71:47----------
and and this could probably i mean this


---------71:49----------
actually probably due to my


---------71:51----------
relative naivete it's actually one of my


---------71:54----------
arguably strengths and weaknesses


---------71:56----------
um i remember when i was in training


---------71:59----------
sort of


---------71:59----------
having a couple of patients that were


---------72:02----------
sort of like lost causes


---------72:04----------
kind of thing and i i sort of take on


---------72:06----------
lost causes


---------72:08----------
um because i'm in a sense arguably just


---------72:10----------
too stupid to realize that if a dozen


---------72:12----------
people have worked with this person


---------72:14----------
before and they haven't made any


---------72:15----------
progress


---------72:16----------
i i don't know why i think i would be


---------72:18----------
different i don't think it's really


---------72:19----------
arrogant but i tend to take on


---------72:21----------
challenges that many of my colleagues


---------72:23----------
sometimes


---------72:24----------
wouldn't or you know would kind of say


---------72:26----------
like hey you're not going to get


---------72:27----------
anywhere with this person people have


---------72:28----------
tried


---------72:30----------
um and so the first thing is that there


---------72:33----------
could be like sort of a bias there where


---------72:35----------
you know you kind of say how do you


---------72:37----------
change someone's


---------72:39----------
natural predisposition to want to hate


---------72:42----------
more than be happy


---------72:44----------
feels like an unsolvable problem right


---------72:47----------
yeah absolutely and and so but but in my


---------72:50----------
experience


---------72:50----------
oftentimes the things that keep us stuck


---------72:52----------
in life are the things that keep us


---------72:54----------
from moving forward is because our


---------72:56----------
diagnosis makes it unsolvable


---------72:59----------
so the first issue is like if you change


---------73:01----------
the diagnosis


---------73:02----------
you may have a treatment sometimes the


---------73:06----------
reason that actually in fact


---------73:07----------
if you look at in medicine you know why


---------73:10----------
don't treatments work


---------73:11----------
the most common reason that a treatment


---------73:13----------
doesn't work is because the diagnosis is


---------73:15----------
wrong


---------73:16----------
it's like a no-brainer if someone comes


---------73:18----------
in and


---------73:20----------
um you know gets diagnosed with


---------73:22----------
depression


---------73:23----------
and it turns out that they like their


---------73:25----------
the reason they have trouble getting out


---------73:27----------
of bed all the time


---------73:27----------
is because they have cancer


---------73:31----------
like that's like it's like night and day


---------73:33----------
can look like something like it's


---------73:35----------
you can ask someone hey do you have


---------73:36----------
trouble getting out of bed do you feel


---------73:37----------
like doing anything


---------73:38----------
do you you've lost weight um you know


---------73:41----------
you don't enjoy the things that you


---------73:42----------
usually used to enjoy


---------73:44----------
you feel guilty because you're not able


---------73:46----------
to work and you're not able to like


---------73:48----------
be there for your kids like you can


---------73:50----------
check all the boxes for depression the


---------73:51----------
actual diagnosis is cancer


---------73:53----------
then you'd start that person on an


---------73:55----------
antidepressant medication and then like


---------73:56----------
the antidepressant medication doesn't


---------73:58----------
work then they go see another


---------73:59----------
psychiatrist they go see another


---------74:00----------
psychiatrist


---------74:01----------
and at the end of the day like the


---------74:02----------
problem as you framed it


---------74:04----------
is the problem itself so if your


---------74:07----------
question is how do you get people to


---------74:09----------
stop


---------74:09----------
preferring hate over happiness that's


---------74:13----------
tough to answer but even then have we


---------74:15----------
really tried


---------74:18----------
right which is kind of interesting have


---------74:19----------
you tried to take a single person and


---------74:21----------
try to understand


---------74:22----------
you know why do you hate instead of


---------74:25----------
being happy


---------74:26----------
when people post yeah you want to say


---------74:29----------
something


---------74:30----------
i was gonna say yeah that's a really


---------74:31----------
interesting perspective like maybe


---------74:33----------
because there is people that'll just


---------74:35----------
watch someone to hate


---------74:36----------
watch them right like i know it's become


---------74:38----------
kind of a meme because train will be


---------74:39----------
like you know all these hate watchers


---------74:41----------
dude and [ __ ] like that


---------74:42----------
but you have there are people that do


---------74:43----------
that right a hundred percent


---------74:45----------
so i guess understanding what the


---------74:47----------
purpose is and what they get out of that


---------74:48----------
would be kind of interesting to hear


---------74:50----------
yeah i've ever tried or i know anyone


---------74:53----------
that has so so i think one of the


---------74:54----------
failures we've made as a community is


---------74:56----------
what we do is we call those people toxic


---------74:59----------
and for understandable reasons we just


---------75:02----------
ban them


---------75:03----------
but what we're actually doing is like


---------75:06----------
judging an


---------75:07----------
entire world of people as toxic without


---------75:09----------
ever trying to understand like where


---------75:11----------
does this come from


---------75:13----------
and and recently you know it's kind of


---------75:15----------
interesting so


---------75:16----------
this may be a little bit of a hot button


---------75:18----------
topic but


---------75:19----------
with a lot of the me too stuff that's


---------75:21----------
come out we've really tried very hard to


---------75:22----------
support people who are victims of


---------75:24----------
of inappropriate behavior or sexual


---------75:26----------
assault


---------75:27----------
or things like that but there's a


---------75:29----------
there's a part of me


---------75:31----------
that actually like wonders sometimes


---------75:34----------
like


---------75:34----------
i you know i've worked in a prison and


---------75:35----------
stuff before and and so i remember when


---------75:37----------
i was working in a prison sort of asking


---------75:39----------
myself the question


---------75:40----------
when did this person become a predator


---------75:44----------
and when did this person become a


---------75:45----------
criminal


---------75:47----------
and what i find myself thinking is that


---------75:48----------
for some people honestly like they're


---------75:50----------
straight up like sociopaths


---------75:51----------
and they were sort of like born that way


---------75:53----------
and they had like behaviors at the age


---------75:55----------
of seven or eight that were


---------75:56----------
was like very very problematic but i


---------76:00----------
found that for most people you know i


---------76:02----------
have trouble accepting that like a nine


---------76:04----------
year old kid or 11 year old kid


---------76:06----------
or 13 year old kid as a predator and


---------76:08----------
then something happens in our community


---------76:10----------
right they grow up in a particular way


---------76:11----------
like


---------76:12----------
in some point they become insults and


---------76:13----------
then they become predators or whatever


---------76:15----------
but there's still like i i don't i


---------76:17----------
haven't given up on altering the course


---------76:19----------
of those people because i've i've worked


---------76:22----------
with people whose courses have been


---------76:23----------
altered like i


---------76:25----------
work with some pro gamers and it's been


---------76:27----------
interesting to talk to them about when


---------76:28----------
they were 15 and they were like big


---------76:31----------
right like so some of these pro gamers


---------76:33----------
get really good at a really young age


---------76:34----------
and like


---------76:35----------
how other people in the scene went out


---------76:38----------
of their way to like teach them that


---------76:39----------
some of the things that they were doing


---------76:41----------
or saying were like not okay


---------76:43----------
and you know there were like 15 year


---------76:45----------
olds that were you know saying really


---------76:47----------
inappropriate racial slurs and like


---------76:48----------
homophobic slurs or whatever like in


---------76:50----------
chat because


---------76:51----------
that's what you do and then i remember


---------76:54----------
talking to one of these guys and he was


---------76:56----------
saying that yeah like someone sat me


---------76:57----------
down


---------76:58----------
and said like hey you can't be doing


---------76:59----------
that anymore and his initial response is


---------77:01----------
why it's just


---------77:02----------
words and i get the sense that there's


---------77:06----------
like there's a lack of


---------77:07----------
understanding and then there's like a


---------77:08----------
lack of trying to explain to people


---------77:11----------
that this is a problem and when we label


---------77:14----------
something as toxic


---------77:16----------
i mean it makes sense in terms of like


---------77:17----------
banning people because like you said


---------77:19----------
there's sort of a contagion effect


---------77:22----------
of memeing and toxicity right it's like


---------77:25----------
it's contagious


---------77:26----------
so you gotta ban the people from the


---------77:28----------
chat but at the same time i think part


---------77:30----------
of the reason that we haven't been able


---------77:31----------
to figure out a solution is because


---------77:32----------
we've never tried to we've never


---------77:34----------
diagnosed anything it's like


---------77:36----------
that person is sick let's like shove


---------77:38----------
them off to the side and keep them in a


---------77:39----------
hut


---------77:39----------
and never use a stethoscope never listen


---------77:42----------
to their lungs


---------77:43----------
never look at their eyes look in their


---------77:45----------
mouth let's not try to diagnose anything


---------77:47----------
so my sense is that you know we still


---------77:49----------
have i mean there's some actually like


---------77:51----------
big things in theory i don't know how we


---------77:53----------
go about doing that


---------77:55----------
but sort of exploring toxicity i also


---------77:58----------
think that


---------77:59----------
what we've also seen on twitch i think


---------78:01----------
this is a good example is that


---------78:03----------
there are toxic communities and they're


---------78:04----------
also wholesome communities


---------78:07----------
and that there are people who actually


---------78:08----------
are members of both


---------78:10----------
so we see that a lot on our discord


---------78:12----------
where like we ban people from our


---------78:13----------
discord for being toxic


---------78:15----------
and then we actually recently did


---------78:16----------
something where we like


---------78:18----------
got them on stream and we tried to get


---------78:21----------
their perspective like what's your


---------78:22----------
understanding of why you were banned


---------78:24----------
what did you do why did you do it and


---------78:26----------
it's really cool because when you take


---------78:28----------
these people that have been banned and


---------78:29----------
are viewed as quote unquote toxic


---------78:31----------
that once again twitch chat loves to


---------78:32----------
hate hate on


---------78:34----------
when you expose their human side i think


---------78:36----------
five out of the six people on our band


---------78:38----------
appeal stream


---------78:39----------
we just we actually left it up to twitch


---------78:41----------
and we said chat you guys decide


---------78:43----------
whether we unban them or not and five


---------78:46----------
five out of six


---------78:47----------
uh five out of six of the people


---------78:50----------
got forgiveness and we're allowed back


---------78:52----------
on the server gotta be


---------78:54----------
it's gotta be [ __ ] terrible being


---------78:55----------
that one guy that didn't yeah x-man


---------78:57----------
four-man


---------78:58----------
yeah i know so i i feel for that dude


---------79:00----------
right so i i think though


---------79:02----------
at the same time like you know five out


---------79:04----------
of six like i was expecting because you


---------79:06----------
know twitch loves i mean this is our


---------79:07----------
perception so i was about to say


---------79:08----------
something which i think


---------79:09----------
is a false statement i was about to say


---------79:11----------
twitch loves pitchforks


---------79:13----------
youtube loves pitchforks we love


---------79:15----------
pitchforks lsf loves pitchforks


---------79:18----------
but i think that statement in and of


---------79:20----------
itself is like


---------79:22----------
not expecting more


---------79:26----------
and i think one of the biggest things


---------79:27----------
that i've seen is when you expect very


---------79:29----------
little from another human being


---------79:31----------
your expectations are met


---------79:35----------
and when you expect a lot surprisingly


---------79:38----------
your expectations can often be met


---------79:42----------
and so i choose to have a little bit


---------79:43----------
more faith in humanity and


---------79:45----------
and not to say that you don't have faith


---------79:46----------
in human i think you have a lot of faith


---------79:48----------
in humanity


---------79:49----------
um but i i'm not willing to kind of give


---------79:51----------
up and i don't think we should because i


---------79:52----------
don't think we've really like really


---------79:53----------
honestly tried like i don't know


---------79:56----------
i mean we have tried a lot of people


---------79:57----------
have tried you know the


---------79:59----------
the the victims of the hate have tried


---------80:03----------
to speak against it in some way


---------80:06----------
and generally speaking it doesn't work


---------80:08----------
but i i think we got to figure out


---------80:10----------
you know some for some of these people


---------80:11----------
like who do you think or


---------80:13----------
represe and i i don't mean to be putting


---------80:15----------
a target on your back so don't answer


---------80:17----------
this question if you feel like it is


---------80:18----------
putting a target on your back but who do


---------80:20----------
you think has like toxic communities


---------80:22----------
like


---------80:22----------
who should we be talking to who should


---------80:24----------
we try to understand presuming that


---------80:25----------
they're worth understanding


---------80:27----------
that's a tough question to answer i


---------80:29----------
can't really off the top of my head


---------80:30----------
think of like


---------80:31----------
a toxic community but i can think of a


---------80:33----------
really good community that i think most


---------80:35----------
people would agree we


---------80:36----------
would agree with me on which is moon


---------80:38----------
moon's community


---------80:39----------
moon moon has a really really good


---------80:41----------
community like i think most people could


---------80:43----------
probably agree with that


---------80:44----------
when it comes to a toxic one i can't


---------80:46----------
really think of like


---------80:48----------
a toxic community on twitch i mean if


---------80:50----------
you want to like broaden the definition


---------80:52----------
someone in the chat mentions the smash


---------80:53----------
community and that's


---------80:55----------
fair you know with everything that's


---------80:56----------
gone on there a lot of terrible stuff


---------80:58----------
but i don't think as a whole everyone


---------80:59----------
that plays smash is a toxic


---------81:01----------
predator [ __ ] or anything you know


---------81:02----------
what i mean so for me it's hard to like


---------81:04----------
pinpoint a


---------81:05----------
toxic community one that exists just to


---------81:08----------
insult everyone else and [ __ ] on


---------81:10----------
everyone else's fun or anything


---------81:11----------
what about youtube


---------81:15----------
um that's a little tougher to answer


---------81:18----------
because there's just is


---------81:18----------
so many communities out there but if you


---------81:21----------
don't mind real quick do you mind if i


---------81:22----------
run to the bathroom then


---------81:23----------
no no okay i'll be right back


---------81:27----------
walls so that's how we that's how we


---------81:29----------
propagate some of this


---------81:30----------
this hydratic toxicity right so as when


---------81:33----------
i call it out


---------81:34----------
it increases it no but seriously like


---------81:37----------
what do you guys think i mean do you


---------81:38----------
think it's okay to call out a community


---------81:40----------
for being toxic or


---------81:41----------
naming them that way so


---------81:45----------
how do you guys think that the how do


---------81:47----------
you think that the members of those


---------81:49----------
communities perceive themselves


---------81:52----------
i mean so people are talking about yeah


---------81:53----------
do it to them let them defend themselves


---------81:55----------
i i don't think that's the right


---------81:56----------
approach right so i think that's what


---------81:57----------
creates this problem is that


---------81:59----------
it's an issue of like attack and defense


---------82:02----------
as opposed to like understanding and and


---------82:06----------
like you know trying to foster some


---------82:07----------
amount of cooperation


---------82:10----------
all right i'm back in it yeah so uh


---------82:13----------
charlie i i was asking chat in the


---------82:15----------
meantime like what do you think the


---------82:16----------
people who are


---------82:17----------
members of what we describe as toxic


---------82:19----------
communities quote unquote


---------82:20----------
what do you think they feel do they view


---------82:23----------
themselves as toxic or how do they view


---------82:25----------
themselves


---------82:28----------
okay i think that's a good question so


---------82:30----------
in my perspective i think


---------82:31----------
a hundred percent well okay i can't say


---------82:33----------
100 but i think an overwhelmingly major


---------82:35----------
majority would probably say that yeah


---------82:39----------
i'm being toxic i don't think anyone has


---------82:42----------
this delusion where it's like


---------82:43----------
no no this isn't toxic this is actually


---------82:45----------
constructive i actually think a lot of


---------82:46----------
people embrace it


---------82:48----------
i think that's gonna become a trendy


---------82:50----------
thing to do for some people be like oh


---------82:51----------
i'm an [ __ ] but


---------82:52----------
it's just who i am you know you'll see


---------82:54----------
that in a twitter bio just an [ __ ]


---------82:56----------
you know


---------82:57----------
that for some reason that's become


---------82:58----------
normalized to just kind of be


---------83:00----------
an [ __ ] yep so i don't think anyone's


---------83:02----------
gonna try and hide that


---------83:04----------
but yeah so i it's interesting so i saw


---------83:06----------
a lot of people say like righteous


---------83:08----------
what do you think about that oh there's


---------83:10----------
a hundred oh man you'll see that all


---------83:12----------
over reddit there's some people that are


---------83:14----------
like


---------83:14----------
i am the hero i am the protagonist of


---------83:17----------
this anime i'm fighting this evil


---------83:19----------
streamer


---------83:20----------
or this evil twitter post look at me uh


---------83:22----------
please


---------83:23----------
send me your thank yous and the dms and


---------83:25----------
stuff a hundred percent


---------83:26----------
there are people that have this delusion


---------83:28----------
but i don't think the majority would


---------83:30----------
i think most people recognize yeah i


---------83:33----------
just don't like i just don't like this


---------83:34----------
person i'm being [ __ ] about it


---------83:36----------
i don't think there's so many people out


---------83:38----------
there believing that there's some


---------83:40----------
medieval hero riding in on horseback to


---------83:42----------
save everyone from this evil post


---------83:45----------
interesting okay i i would have had it


---------83:48----------
as


---------83:49----------
flipped really yeah so i think most


---------83:53----------
human beings tend to do things that


---------83:55----------
that what i would call or ego syntonic


---------83:59----------
so ego syntonic versus ego dystonic


---------84:02----------
means


---------84:03----------
aligned with who you think you are


---------84:05----------
versus


---------84:06----------
not aligned with who you think you are


---------84:08----------
so a good example of this in psychiatry


---------84:10----------
is like a lot of people talk about


---------84:12----------
people who are quote-unquote ocd


---------84:14----------
that's not ocd so there are two things


---------84:17----------
one is


---------84:17----------
ocd which is obsessive compulsive


---------84:19----------
disorder another thing is


---------84:21----------
obsessive-compulsive personality


---------84:22----------
disorder or ocpd


---------84:25----------
people who are ocpd are control freaks


---------84:29----------
they really get they love to be in


---------84:31----------
control they love to like organize


---------84:32----------
things they get bent out of shape


---------84:34----------
when things don't go their way but


---------84:37----------
that's a very ego syntonic thing they


---------84:39----------
don't think that they're wrong


---------84:41----------
they don't view themselves as control


---------84:42----------
freaks they think that everyone else


---------84:44----------
is like should like you should put the


---------84:46----------
dishes where they go


---------84:48----------
not over here they go over there so


---------84:51----------
that's very ego-syntonic it's aligned


---------84:52----------
with their identity as a person the


---------84:54----------
interesting thing is people with true


---------84:55----------
ocd


---------84:56----------
it's very egotistic they know that it's


---------84:59----------
ridiculous that they have to turn on the


---------85:01----------
light


---------85:02----------
seven switch the light switch seven


---------85:04----------
times every time they walk into the room


---------85:05----------
they know it's idiotic they know there's


---------85:07----------
no reason to do it


---------85:08----------
and yet they can't help themselves it


---------85:10----------
actually causes them to stress


---------85:12----------
but they have to engage in the


---------85:14----------
compulsions or the obsessions anyway


---------85:17----------
so in one hand like ocd is actually very


---------85:20----------
ego dystonic where people don't like


---------85:21----------
that they have to do these things


---------85:23----------
and ocpd or like what we think of as


---------85:25----------
yeah i'm super ocd that's just who i am


---------85:28----------
that's very ego syntonic right so i'm


---------85:30----------
just an [ __ ] that's who i am is a


---------85:32----------
very ego syntonic way of thinking it's


---------85:33----------
like


---------85:34----------
it actually causes that person no


---------85:35----------
distress that they're an [ __ ]


---------85:38----------
so my sense is that generally speaking


---------85:40----------
people don't behave in a way that is


---------85:42----------
first of all ego-dystonic so they


---------85:44----------
believe in a way that feels aligned with


---------85:46----------
who they are as a person


---------85:47----------
and that righteousness is very ghost and


---------85:50----------
tonic


---------85:51----------
and i think is very very common um


---------85:54----------
especially on the internet where you


---------85:55----------
have people like putting other people in


---------85:57----------
their place


---------85:58----------
yeah maybe just maybe my perspective is


---------86:00----------
a little distorted because of twitter in


---------86:02----------
particular because on there it is so


---------86:04----------
common for people


---------86:04----------
for people to just outright be like yup


---------86:07----------
i'm an [ __ ]


---------86:08----------
i made this account just to be an


---------86:09----------
[ __ ] and


---------86:11----------
i'm just just going to keep you know


---------86:13----------
doing these things you know being an


---------86:15----------
[ __ ]


---------86:16----------
so maybe it's not as common as i think


---------86:18----------
it is maybe it's just a confirmation


---------86:19----------
bias where i'm just seeing it more often


---------86:21----------
because of that


---------86:22----------
so maybe you're absolutely right i have


---------86:24----------
no idea well interestingly enough what


---------86:25----------
you said actually makes me


---------86:27----------
more inclined to take your viewpoint not


---------86:29----------
less because what you're saying is if


---------86:31----------
it's based on twitter


---------86:32----------
that sounds to me like you actually you


---------86:35----------
have real data whereas i have hypotheses


---------86:38----------
well i mean it's all anecdotal right


---------86:40----------
like i don't have actual data it's just


---------86:41----------
what i see when i go on twitter and i


---------86:43----------
see these people


---------86:44----------
like when you see something bad happen


---------86:46----------
you'll have a bunch of people making all


---------86:47----------
these edgy remarks or making all these


---------86:49----------
like terrible things they say about the


---------86:51----------
person


---------86:52----------
and then you go on their their profile


---------86:53----------
and that's all they do that's their


---------86:55----------
entire online identity and they embrace


---------86:57----------
it


---------86:57----------
they wear it like a badge of honor like


---------86:59----------
a little boy scout badge or something so


---------87:01----------
i just see it a lot on there and i think


---------87:03----------
maybe that's just kind of


---------87:04----------
distorted the way i view how common it


---------87:07----------
is


---------87:08----------
yeah so the interesting thing is i


---------87:10----------
wonder if i talk to one of those people


---------87:11----------
who describe themselves as an [ __ ]


---------87:14----------
i don't think they feel like an [ __ ]


---------87:16----------
i think they feel righteous


---------87:18----------
and they recognize disagree okay yeah i


---------87:21----------
really feel like


---------87:22----------
if let's say you brought someone on your


---------87:24----------
show that you know recently made some


---------87:26----------
kind of terrible remark about chadwick


---------87:28----------
boseman or something


---------87:29----------
i think if you brought them on their


---------87:31----------
show on your show they would still keep


---------87:33----------
this persona up maybe they might not


---------87:35----------
actually be a genuine degenerate [ __ ]


---------87:37----------
but i feel like


---------87:39----------
given any internet attention or any


---------87:41----------
anonymity they're going to continue to


---------87:43----------
be that way


---------87:44----------
i don't think they try and hide it i


---------87:45----------
think they'd embrace it they'd feel like


---------87:47----------
the joker from the batman series i


---------87:49----------
completely agree with you but now let's


---------87:52----------
let's so i


---------87:52----------
agree with you i think they'd maintain


---------87:54----------
the persona but the persona that you


---------87:56----------
maintain in the feelings that you have


---------87:58----------
are oftentimes in fact usually


---------88:00----------
in harsh conflict a persona


---------88:03----------
even if we think about the word persona


---------88:05----------
a persona


---------88:06----------
is a false self that we think about just


---------88:09----------
the definition


---------88:10----------
right it's a false self


---------88:16----------
so if a persona is a false self and


---------88:18----------
you're saying


---------88:19----------
this person would maintain the persona


---------88:21----------
that implies that what they are on the


---------88:23----------
inside


---------88:23----------
is not what they're portraying ergo


---------88:27----------
they would not actually feel like


---------88:28----------
[ __ ] the [ __ ] is the front


---------88:31----------
that they put on because there's


---------88:32----------
something else underneath


---------88:35----------
yeah and that's entirely possible a


---------88:36----------
hundred percent it's just hard to know


---------88:38----------
if it even is a persona right like i say


---------88:40----------
that


---------88:41----------
having the belief that maybe they're not


---------88:43----------
this piece of [ __ ]


---------88:44----------
but maybe they just are maybe yes


---------88:47----------
i mean i i think i i tend to be curious


---------88:49----------
i think we've had actually a lot of


---------88:51----------
really interesting


---------88:52----------
um explorations with people that i think


---------88:54----------
are generally viewed as toxic


---------88:57----------
so we had a couple of interesting


---------88:59----------
streams with women like female gamers


---------89:02----------
and then also like women who get hit on


---------89:04----------
by men online


---------89:06----------
um and the really interesting thing at


---------89:07----------
the end of both of those streams is the


---------89:09----------
women were like yeah we'd love to see


---------89:10----------
you do this with a group of


---------89:12----------
the people on the other side of the


---------89:13----------
table like


---------89:15----------
find a group of toxic male gamers and


---------89:16----------
just ask them like why are you guys


---------89:18----------
toxic in games or people who


---------89:20----------
you know will send like inappropriate


---------89:21----------
messages to women online


---------89:23----------
or i mean a lot of times what they were


---------89:25----------
complaining about is not even like


---------89:26----------
inappropriate messages it's sort of like


---------89:28----------
persistence and kind of like


---------89:30----------
guilt-tripping and [ __ ] like that that


---------89:31----------
that people do


---------89:33----------
they're like oh you're not yeah yeah


---------89:35----------
that's become super common right like


---------89:36----------
you see that on twitch all the time like


---------89:38----------
i've been subbed for this long and you


---------89:40----------
don't even remember my name


---------89:41----------
it's like you don't care why you know


---------89:44----------
don't you know i'm lonely and i'm here


---------89:45----------
for this and that like that's something


---------89:46----------
super common these days


---------89:48----------
interesting i'd love to know why people


---------89:49----------
do that because you know where do they


---------89:52----------
get the expectation from right


---------89:54----------
and then that makes that puts all the


---------89:56----------
onus on the streamer to be like feeling


---------89:58----------
bad


---------89:58----------
for not knowing all these things about


---------90:00----------
this person and i think that's a


---------90:01----------
terrible thing as well


---------90:02----------
it's not like your traditional toxic


---------90:04----------
male to female streamer thing like show


---------90:06----------
me your tits [ __ ] you know i've been


---------90:08----------
subbed


---------90:09----------
but it's just as you know it's just as


---------90:11----------
annoying and just as frustrating right


---------90:13----------
to have this person that's been there


---------90:14----------
for so long start blaming you for not


---------90:16----------
knowing everything about their life


---------90:18----------
what's frustrating about that it


---------90:21----------
shouldn't be a


---------90:22----------
streamer's responsibility to kind of be


---------90:24----------
like the mom and dad or the girlfriend


---------90:26----------
to someone that's been subbed for a long


---------90:28----------
time


---------90:29----------
if you know if they don't have an


---------90:30----------
interest in doing that at the end of the


---------90:32----------
day


---------90:32----------
the streamers there to put on a show and


---------90:34----------
be entertaining and just be there for


---------90:36----------
somebody


---------90:36----------
not necessarily to be this pillar in


---------90:39----------
their life


---------90:40----------
and to make them feel bad for not doing


---------90:42----------
that i think is just as toxic


---------90:45----------
does that happen to you no not really i


---------90:48----------
make it pretty clear with my community


---------90:49----------
like this kind of parasocial


---------90:50----------
relationship isn't a healthy thing


---------90:52----------
so i don't really encourage it and i


---------90:54----------
think people understand that like i know


---------90:56----------
a lot of my chats names because i'm good


---------90:58----------
with names and i make an effort to at


---------90:59----------
least


---------91:00----------
know what's going on with some of the


---------91:01----------
regulars because i treat chat like


---------91:03----------
friends


---------91:04----------
i think that's you know i think that's


---------91:05----------
good to have a community that you can


---------91:07----------
joke around with know a little bit about


---------91:08----------
but at the end of the day


---------91:10----------
i'm not their mom i'm not their dad i'm


---------91:12----------
not their either babysitter or anything


---------91:14----------
i'm just there to have some fun with


---------91:16----------
them talk about some [ __ ]


---------91:17----------
joke around and i no one's ever made me


---------91:20----------
feel bad for not knowing certain things


---------91:22----------
about their life or forgetting something


---------91:24----------
but i know it does happen in other


---------91:25----------
streams you see it on twitter all the


---------91:27----------
time where a streamer will post


---------91:28----------
something


---------91:28----------
from someone that's been subbed for 21


---------91:30----------
months who's now you know threatening to


---------91:32----------
kill themselves because the streamer


---------91:34----------
hasn't acknowledged them in the last two


---------91:35----------
resubs or some crazy [ __ ]


---------91:40----------
yeah i think that too is something that


---------91:41----------
is worth understanding because i think


---------91:43----------
we sort of get


---------91:46----------
yeah i i don't know exactly what to do


---------91:48----------
about that but i i think it's kind of


---------91:49----------
interesting because you sort of say you


---------91:50----------
show up and you treat them like friends


---------91:53----------
and at the same time you're pretty clear


---------91:54----------
about the boundaries of the parasocial


---------91:56----------
relationship


---------91:57----------
and i think one of the the interesting


---------91:59----------
actually one of the advantages of twitch


---------92:00----------
i think part of what makes twitch an


---------92:02----------
awesome platform is that people do feel


---------92:03----------
connected


---------92:05----------
you know they yeah there's no yeah i


---------92:07----------
want to make it clear like there's


---------92:08----------
nothing wrong with like connecting with


---------92:09----------
a streamer that's a lot of times how you


---------92:11----------
find the community


---------92:12----------
like i mentioned moon moon i guarantee


---------92:14----------
most of the people in moon moon's chat


---------92:15----------
feel a connection with him


---------92:16----------
but i don't think it's to this level


---------92:18----------
where they're going to be aggressive or


---------92:20----------
angry if moon moon doesn't acknowledge


---------92:22----------
their sub or maybe forgets their name or


---------92:24----------
something like that or doesn't see every


---------92:25----------
message


---------92:26----------
but that does happen and that's an


---------92:28----------
equally toxic thing


---------92:31----------
what do we do about that oh i have no


---------92:34----------
idea that's just such an individual


---------92:35----------
level i don't know how you teach that i


---------92:37----------
think it's just people


---------92:39----------
not understanding you know social


---------92:42----------
relationships right


---------92:43----------
it's people that don't have a real world


---------92:45----------
experience to know what's acceptable and


---------92:47----------
what's not acceptable when it comes to a


---------92:49----------
stranger and


---------92:50----------
at the end of the day it really is still


---------92:52----------
a stranger you don't know the streamer


---------92:53----------
personally


---------92:54----------
you don't know everything about them so


---------92:56----------
it's just someone you're familiar with


---------92:57----------
and


---------92:58----------
it's all about knowing when is the right


---------93:00----------
time to


---------93:01----------
try and connect if you want to and


---------93:04----------
knowing when you probably shouldn't do


---------93:06----------
that


---------93:07----------
and i think a lot of people don't have


---------93:09----------
that because people grow up with so much


---------93:10----------
access to the internet that they just


---------93:12----------
lose that ability to find these things


---------93:15----------
yeah i i do wonder if there's something


---------93:17----------
so it's interesting we've done


---------93:19----------
actually like a couple of trainings for


---------93:21----------
content creators before


---------93:23----------
um where we sort of teach them actually


---------93:25----------
how to set boundaries because i i wonder


---------93:27----------
if some of this stuff is actually just


---------93:29----------
so it sounds like you set a pretty firm


---------93:30----------
limit with your community and your


---------93:31----------
community knows what to expect


---------93:34----------
in terms of their you're there to hang


---------93:35----------
out you're there to you know provide


---------93:37----------
entertainment


---------93:38----------
and that you're not their mom or dad


---------93:42----------
i i i was really surprised and in some


---------93:44----------
sense heartened to find that


---------93:46----------
a lot of streamers do actually


---------93:50----------
go out of their way to try to like


---------93:52----------
support


---------93:53----------
and connect with their community


---------93:55----------
actually especially some of the smaller


---------93:57----------
streams


---------93:59----------
um yeah and and that


---------94:02----------
it's interesting because i can see how


---------94:03----------
that could create the feelings that


---------94:04----------
we're talking about but also i think is


---------94:06----------
like not


---------94:07----------
not in and of itself a bad thing i think


---------94:10----------
it's just about limit setting


---------94:11----------
and boundaries but in and of itself is


---------94:13----------
not like a


---------94:15----------
bad thing that streamers and communities


---------94:17----------
are connected


---------94:18----------
yeah i don't think it's like evil i


---------94:19----------
don't think streamers that try and form


---------94:21----------
this bond between community and


---------94:23----------
themselves or


---------94:24----------
you know dumb or bad people for doing


---------94:26----------
that it's just


---------94:27----------
when that when it becomes this level of


---------94:29----------
unhealthiness you have to understand


---------94:30----------
some individuals aren't going


---------94:32----------
to understand where's too far where that


---------94:35----------
line is


---------94:36----------
and you'll have them having their entire


---------94:38----------
[ __ ] week ruined


---------94:39----------
if you miss their resub or something and


---------94:42----------
it's not the streamer's fault right


---------94:43----------
it's just this person doesn't really


---------94:46----------
understand it


---------94:47----------
so it's just knowing the boundaries and


---------94:50----------
making it pretty clear on


---------94:52----------
you know the expectation i guess yeah


---------94:54----------
having a hard


---------94:55----------
time phrasing that in a way that sounds


---------94:57----------
cohesive no i


---------94:59----------
thought she did great i think it's you


---------95:01----------
know you


---------95:02----------
like you said i think it's about


---------95:03----------
expectation you use that word several


---------95:04----------
times


---------95:05----------
and where people get that expectation


---------95:07----------
i'm also hearing from your


---------95:09----------
words or sort of your statements that


---------95:11----------
like somewhere along the way like


---------95:13----------
interactions on the internet sometimes


---------95:14----------
people


---------95:15----------
aren't don't understand like they just


---------95:17----------
haven't been taught like what


---------95:19----------
is appropriate or not appropriate which


---------95:21----------
also sort of makes sense because no one


---------95:23----------
teaches you internet etiquette


---------95:25----------
right you get taught actually like by


---------95:27----------
your parents and other people how to


---------95:28----------
behave around other human beings


---------95:31----------
no one teaches you that on the internet


---------95:34----------
yeah


---------95:34----------
and if you don't have that experience


---------95:35----------
around human beings like you're kind of


---------95:37----------
[ __ ] right yeah you're just out here


---------95:38----------
blind with your


---------95:39----------
in your hand like you don't know how to


---------95:40----------
act and i feel bad for those people you


---------95:42----------
really do


---------95:43----------
and i think that kind of goes back to


---------95:45----------
like toxic communities because i think


---------95:46----------
in


---------95:47----------
a lot of situations like we don't


---------95:48----------
understand or maybe they don't


---------95:50----------
understand


---------95:50----------
i think it's a little bit arrogant to


---------95:52----------
assume that these people aren't educated


---------95:54----------
and we are more educated and more


---------95:55----------
enlightened


---------95:57----------
um but at the same time i do wonder i


---------95:59----------
think a lot of this me too stuff is like


---------96:01----------
frankly a lot of it sounds like you know


---------96:03----------
dudes who just don't know how to


---------96:05----------
interact with women


---------96:06----------
for the most part some of it is like


---------96:09----------
malicious and predatory but i think a


---------96:10----------
lot of it it's just


---------96:12----------
you know like dudes just don't know how


---------96:14----------
to act


---------96:16----------
like they don't know how to talk they


---------96:17----------
don't know how to interpret signals they


---------96:19----------
don't


---------96:19----------
they just don't know i don't know


---------96:23----------
what you think about that but i what i


---------96:26----------
only know the smash stuff and as far as


---------96:28----------
smash goes like that's


---------96:30----------
that's more than just not knowing how to


---------96:32----------
act that's some terrible like degenerate


---------96:34----------
[ __ ]


---------96:35----------
uh so i i'm not familiar with the smash


---------96:38----------
stuff what


---------96:39----------
oh man you might want to save yourself a


---------96:41----------
headache like every


---------96:42----------
bad [ __ ] thing you can imagine was


---------96:44----------
happening in the smash community


---------96:46----------
i know there definitely is sometimes


---------96:48----------
someone's just like post this twit


---------96:49----------
longer about maybe a bad date they had


---------96:51----------
with somebody online


---------96:52----------
and i could totally see why that would


---------96:54----------
be uncomfortable but it's not like the


---------96:56----------
person was evil just because


---------96:57----------
you know they don't know how to talk in


---------96:59----------
a first date i definitely get that


---------97:01----------
but then there's also of course the


---------97:03----------
really malicious predators that do


---------97:04----------
terrible [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------97:06----------
oh wow i didn't realize things were that


---------97:07----------
bad but okay


---------97:09----------
yeah it was the smash community is it's


---------97:12----------
it's in shambles right now dr k


---------97:14----------
it's it's uh it's it's rough


---------97:17----------
okay maybe


---------97:21----------
maybe we'll look into that and see if


---------97:22----------
there's some way we can help


---------97:24----------
yeah i mean maybe that'd be a good


---------97:26----------
community to look into right now i mean


---------97:28----------
they've gone through a lot of what we've


---------97:29----------
already talked about right like they've


---------97:31----------
had a lot of those things pop


---------97:32----------
up and they've had a lot of cases where


---------97:34----------
a lot of people that looked up to these


---------97:35----------
streamers


---------97:36----------
turns out the streamers were doing


---------97:37----------
terrible things so maybe like getting


---------97:39----------
involved in that community to see


---------97:41----------
where to go from there what to what to


---------97:43----------
fix going forward


---------97:44----------
because they could use some [ __ ]


---------97:45----------
guidance they had the worst ideas


---------97:48----------
they so a lot of it had to do with like


---------97:50----------
you know


---------97:51----------
child predators that a lot of the people


---------97:53----------
in the smash community were kids


---------97:55----------
and one of their suggestions was to mark


---------97:57----------
kids with a colored band and an


---------97:59----------
x on their hands at all in-person events


---------98:02----------
so that way older people would know not


---------98:03----------
to try and [ __ ] them


---------98:05----------
like they have the worst ideas on how to


---------98:07----------
handle this [ __ ] it's terrible


---------98:13----------
yeah so they could use some guidance and


---------98:15----------
it's a it's rough


---------98:18----------
i mean yeah i don't even know what to


---------98:21----------
think about that i


---------98:22----------
i guess like because we do have like you


---------98:24----------
know we do have like you know you a


---------98:25----------
wristband or whatever for like


---------98:27----------
alcohol at parties or whatever right so


---------98:29----------
i mean it's not


---------98:30----------
it's not that crazy of an idea i think


---------98:32----------
the way that you frame it though is


---------98:34----------
speaks that oh no no no it wasn't that


---------98:36----------
it was like we are going to give


---------98:37----------
children a rape whistle and if their


---------98:39----------
parents aren't holding their hands


---------98:40----------
they're not allowed in here because we


---------98:41----------
can't trust our adults in this community


---------98:44----------
yeah right so i think that's that's


---------98:45----------
awful because it's sort of


---------98:47----------
you know the solution there is not to do


---------98:49----------
something with the kid i think it's to


---------98:50----------
do something with the adult


---------98:51----------
100 yeah i think that would be the


---------98:55----------
rational approach so charlie i'm


---------98:57----------
noticing we've kind of meandered around


---------98:59----------
a little bit is there something else


---------99:00----------
that you want to talk about or


---------99:02----------
i mean we sort of talked about toxicity


---------99:04----------
talked a little bit about


---------99:05----------
how you're a warm and fuzzy human being


---------99:11----------
nothing in particular man i just want to


---------99:12----------
compliment you on the good work you do


---------99:14----------
if you don't mind me sucking your dick a


---------99:15----------
little bit like i think you do a


---------99:16----------
great job i think it's really important


---------99:18----------
work you do before


---------99:20----------
i maybe i'm wrong but before you came


---------99:22----------
along on twitch i don't think anyone was


---------99:23----------
ever even really talking about


---------99:25----------
a lot of the subjects that you like to


---------99:26----------
cover and i think that's an important


---------99:27----------
thing to do


---------99:28----------
to both help improve the community


---------99:30----------
around and just get people thinking


---------99:32----------
about


---------99:32----------
themselves and the platform they engage


---------99:34----------
on so just great work man


---------99:36----------
yeah man thank you very much i you know


---------99:38----------
i appreciate the the appreciation


---------99:41----------
um i that actually means a lot charlie


---------99:43----------
because i respect you a lot i respect


---------99:44----------
your thoughts


---------99:45----------
i think you're a good thinker like


---------99:48----------
comment on things like that's what i was


---------99:50----------
saying i recently discovered your


---------99:51----------
content i really like the way that you


---------99:52----------
think and you break apart problems


---------99:54----------
actually


---------99:55----------
um the way that you go through and


---------99:57----------
analyze things so to have


---------99:59----------
to get your seal of approval actually


---------100:02----------
means a lot to me


---------100:03----------
um and yeah


---------100:06----------
thank you very much man well hey anytime


---------100:09----------
man i appreciate the kind words i think


---------100:11----------
this has all been a really great


---------100:12----------
conversation and


---------100:13----------
who knows maybe we'll see something


---------100:15----------
great come from it you know maybe down


---------100:16----------
the line you do talk to some of these


---------100:18----------
communities and these people and we get


---------100:19----------
a little better understanding of exactly


---------100:21----------
what goes on and why some of these


---------100:23----------
behaviors like


---------100:24----------
hate watching and just generally feeling


---------100:27----------
better being mad as opposed to happy


---------100:29----------
persists yeah like i think that'd be


---------100:31----------
very interesting to learn about


---------100:33----------
charlie can i ask you one last question


---------100:36----------
and then we can talk about meditation


---------100:37----------
for a second


---------100:38----------
absolutely so my question is um so


---------100:42----------
what can i do what should i do


---------100:46----------
and you don't have to answer it now um


---------100:49----------
but


---------100:50----------
but i i you know so i like i said i


---------100:52----------
appreciate your ability to look at


---------100:53----------
problems and analyze them and i think if


---------100:55----------
you've watched some of our content


---------100:57----------
and and the positive feedback you've


---------100:59----------
given to me so you know these people you


---------101:01----------
know the youtube community better than i


---------101:02----------
do you know the twitch community


---------101:04----------
better than i know you know the twitter


---------101:06----------
community better than i do


---------101:07----------
if you were to think about me as a


---------101:09----------
resource to deploy


---------101:11----------
which is really what i'm asking like


---------101:13----------
what what should i do


---------101:16----------
man that is that is a tough one um


---------101:22----------
i guess what i would start with if i if


---------101:25----------
i was to


---------101:26----------
launch the icbm known as dr k yes i


---------101:29----------
would immediately start on twitter


---------101:31----------
that would be the first place i'd target


---------101:33----------
because i think a lot of the general


---------101:35----------
like mindset the mind frame of a lot of


---------101:37----------
these people


---------101:38----------
is born from twitter twitter i think is


---------101:40----------
just that the past time a lot of people


---------101:42----------
take where when they're not doing


---------101:43----------
something twitter's just so easily


---------101:45----------
accessible


---------101:46----------
easily digestible that they will just


---------101:48----------
find these things and get locked in this


---------101:50----------
echo chamber and these psycho fans


---------101:52----------
and they'll just start to adopt these


---------101:54----------
beliefs and these mindsets where


---------101:56----------
i'm happier when i'm mad i like to be


---------101:58----------
mad and i just want to stay mad


---------102:00----------
and i think getting to the root of where


---------102:02----------
that kind of comes from


---------102:03----------
in maybe a group i don't know what group


---------102:06----------
you'd start with but maybe like a


---------102:07----------
prominent group where this seems to be


---------102:09----------
common


---------102:10----------
and figure out why they prefer that as


---------102:12----------
opposed to some


---------102:13----------
better content where they're not [ __ ]


---------102:15----------
fuming nine hours a day


---------102:16----------
because i mean people treat twitter like


---------102:18----------
it's a job they'll be on twitter for


---------102:19----------
nine hours


---------102:20----------
spamming all kinds of [ __ ] replying back


---------102:22----------
and forth you'll it's not uncommon to


---------102:24----------
see an account have 200 000 tweets right


---------102:27----------
like why waste their time doing that


---------102:29----------
what do they personally get out of it


---------102:31----------
do they feel fulfilled are they even


---------102:33----------
happy doing it what's the point


---------102:35----------
that would be where i'd start i wouldn't


---------102:36----------
know where to start but


---------102:38----------
the target would be twitter for me okay


---------102:40----------
so you feel like twitter


---------102:42----------
is is where you know the


---------102:45----------
the nexus of the tumor is oh


---------102:49----------
i i would say that is the genesis of a


---------102:51----------
lot of the


---------102:52----------
the the things we're seeing and talking


---------102:54----------
about when it comes to like toxicity and


---------102:55----------
like


---------102:56----------
general [ __ ] weird loser mentalities


---------102:59----------
not to call everyone a loser but you


---------103:00----------
know what i'm saying


---------103:01----------
i think that's where it kind of stems


---------103:03----------
from is they see


---------103:05----------
these posts have so many likes and so


---------103:07----------
much engagement


---------103:09----------
that are really negative and so they'll


---------103:11----------
start doing it maybe to get the same


---------103:12----------
fulfillment i don't know


---------103:13----------
i can only speculate interesting that's


---------103:16----------
not what i was expecting


---------103:18----------
um you know i had thought that that


---------103:21----------
maybe what i should focus on is people


---------103:23----------
who dedicate


---------103:24----------
themselves to making negative content


---------103:28----------
so the content as opposed to the


---------103:29----------
audience


---------103:31----------
yeah so like thinking about what


---------103:32----------
motivates someone to make


---------103:35----------
uh a certain kind of content but which i


---------103:37----------
guess sort of qualifies as twitter right


---------103:39----------
because


---------103:40----------
in twitter what happens is you have the


---------103:41----------
audience making masses of content


---------103:44----------
so the the content creator and the


---------103:46----------
audience become one


---------103:47----------
in twitter so now that i'm thinking


---------103:49----------
about it actually sort of makes sense


---------103:51----------
because twitter is the place where


---------103:53----------
everyone makes content right


---------103:56----------
yeah like i mean the content is every


---------103:58----------
post right so yeah


---------103:59----------
so so it's one where the audience eats


---------104:03----------
and you get to see the audience in a way


---------104:05----------
that oftentimes you don't on other


---------104:06----------
platforms


---------104:08----------
um interesting


---------104:12----------
cool man thank you very much yeah of


---------104:14----------
course and


---------104:15----------
my apologies in advance if you do choose


---------104:17----------
twitter you're gonna have a [ __ ]


---------104:18----------
headache man like that is


---------104:20----------
that is rough yeah we'll see right


---------104:23----------
um yeah and and are you interested in in


---------104:26----------
the deal talking about meditation for a


---------104:28----------
minute or like learning how to meditate


---------104:30----------
if you don't already


---------104:31----------
sure yeah i'd love to hear more about it


---------104:32----------
i've never done it myself i tried it


---------104:34----------
when i was in college once or twice but


---------104:36----------
that's a that's a


---------104:37----------
very hard field to kind of master and


---------104:39----------
figure out


---------104:40----------
sure so um


---------104:50----------
can i think for a second yeah by all


---------104:52----------
means man no rush


---------104:54----------
actually if you don't mind give me just


---------104:55----------
one more second sure i'll be right back


---------104:59----------
okay chat we're gonna do something a


---------105:01----------
little bit more


---------105:03----------
advanced today okay all right i'm sorry


---------105:06----------
about that


---------105:07----------
no problem man how is that you did you


---------105:09----------
get your starlight rare


---------105:11----------
i wish i wish i just pulled it out over


---------105:13----------
there believe it or not i actually have


---------105:15----------
three of the second most valuable


---------105:16----------
starlight rare there is


---------105:19----------
there's more than one starlight rare oh


---------105:21----------
yeah there's like five per


---------105:23----------
every three sets or something like that


---------105:26----------
oh interesting


---------105:27----------
i thought so um


---------105:31----------
charlie what's your understanding of


---------105:33----------
what meditation is


---------105:35----------
the way i understand meditation is it's


---------105:39----------
a short period of time where you clear


---------105:42----------
every single thought and problem


---------105:44----------
for pretty much as long as you can and


---------105:46----------
just kind of


---------105:48----------
be right you just kind of sit on your


---------105:51----------
own


---------105:51----------
without any kind of thoughts or anything


---------105:54----------
weighing you down more or less it's


---------105:55----------
basically just a clean slate for x


---------105:57----------
amount of time


---------105:58----------
sort of that's how i understood it okay


---------106:00----------
that's that's actually like a pretty


---------106:02----------
good starting point


---------106:03----------
so one of the goals of meditation


---------106:07----------
is to shut off your mind so in the east


---------106:10----------
they believe that


---------106:12----------
you as a person as a being are not


---------106:15----------
your mind in the same way that we're not


---------106:18----------
our body


---------106:20----------
right so like if i like this is my hand


---------106:22----------
i even describe it with the word


---------106:24----------
my which presumes for a moment that it's


---------106:27----------
an


---------106:27----------
object that is not me so my pen


---------106:31----------
my hand my finger my fingernail


---------106:34----------
so you don't right so use the possessive


---------106:37----------
the interesting thing is we also


---------106:39----------
so people generally speaking know that


---------106:40----------
they're not their body like in theory if


---------106:42----------
i were to have an accident


---------106:43----------
and lose a finger i wouldn't be like


---------106:45----------
changed as a person


---------106:47----------
the like i may change in some ways like


---------106:50----------
it i may sort of suffer some sense of


---------106:51----------
identity problem or something like that


---------106:53----------
i may mourn i may feel like i'm deformed


---------106:55----------
or all kinds of things can happen


---------106:57----------
but at the end of the day like me still


---------106:59----------
exists


---------107:01----------
and so the interesting thing is that


---------107:02----------
most of us sort of understand that


---------107:05----------
our body is just our body and that we're


---------107:07----------
not necessarily our body somewhat


---------107:09----------
connected of course


---------107:11----------
related interconnected it becomes more


---------107:14----------
difficult when it when it comes to the


---------107:15----------
mind because we tend to think that our


---------107:17----------
mind is


---------107:18----------
us so our sense of like self-worth our


---------107:21----------
sense of identity


---------107:23----------
um you know sort of being a neat or you


---------107:26----------
know being


---------107:27----------
successful or not successful being a


---------107:29----------
streamer being a gamer being a doctor


---------107:31----------
call it whatever you want to we


---------107:32----------
these are all the identifications of the


---------107:34----------
mind we tend to think that that's who we


---------107:36----------
are


---------107:37----------
so meditation is actually the systematic


---------107:39----------
process of trying to discover the true


---------107:42----------
self


---------107:43----------
which is actually outside of body and


---------107:45----------
outside of mind


---------107:47----------
and as a result of that we sort of get


---------107:50----------
to practices that do what you kind of


---------107:52----------
describe which is to shut off your mind


---------107:54----------
or to exist with awareness outside of


---------107:57----------
mind


---------107:58----------
with me so far okay i'm feeling you


---------108:02----------
so what i'm going to teach you today is


---------108:04----------
actually like a practice that i think is


---------108:06----------
pretty useful for


---------108:07----------
addiction i don't think you're addicted


---------108:08----------
to anything but it's just something that


---------108:10----------
i've been


---------108:11----------
i've been sort of teaching a couple of


---------108:13----------
the same things and i actually think


---------108:14----------
that


---------108:15----------
i know this is going to sound bizarre


---------108:17----------
charlie but i think you're spiritually a


---------108:18----------
little bit you're not actually a noob


---------108:20----------
when it comes to spirituality so i'm


---------108:21----------
going to teach you a slightly more


---------108:23----------
rigorous practice if that's okay


---------108:25----------
true so what i'm going to tell you is is


---------108:27----------
first of all


---------108:29----------
the first step of meditation is the


---------108:31----------
concentration of awareness


---------108:33----------
it is letting your awareness or your


---------108:35----------
attention go


---------108:36----------
where you want it to and if there is


---------108:39----------
one basic weakness that we have as a


---------108:42----------
society it is not being able to control


---------108:45----------
our attention so a lot of people say


---------108:48----------
that i'm not


---------108:48----------
disciplined right so what discipline


---------108:51----------
really is is it's the focus of attention


---------108:54----------
it's not it's really not anything else


---------108:56----------
it's just putting your attention where


---------108:58----------
you want it to go so if i sit down in


---------109:00----------
front of a book and i say


---------109:02----------
it's time to study and then i point my


---------109:05----------
attention at this book and then i say


---------109:08----------
i'm going to read these words


---------109:09----------
and then what happens is our mind


---------109:10----------
wanders all over the place right and so


---------109:13----------
then i'm not able to study


---------109:14----------
and what we perceive is discipline is


---------109:16----------
someone who can actually control their


---------109:18----------
attention


---------109:18----------
i'm going to think about and focus the


---------109:20----------
attention of my mind or being where i


---------109:22----------
want it when i want it


---------109:24----------
and it's that basic skill which


---------109:26----------
separates like


---------109:27----------
people who are successful from people


---------109:29----------
who aren't


---------109:31----------
so the next thing to think about is what


---------109:33----------
does pull our attention in different


---------109:35----------
places


---------109:36----------
so the most common thing that pulls our


---------109:38----------
attention in different places


---------109:40----------
are the sense organs or the indriyas so


---------109:43----------
case in point we were talking about


---------109:44----------
earlier like if we use the word hydra


---------109:46----------
dick


---------109:47----------
then a lot of people see that word they


---------109:49----------
hear that word


---------109:50----------
in their mind pay attention right so i'm


---------109:53----------
tempting them so i want you to notice


---------109:55----------
because i'm trying to evoke it at them


---------109:57----------
now everyone is thinking about that and


---------109:59----------
wanting to type that so already what


---------110:01----------
i've done is i've used a sensory


---------110:03----------
input and their mind's attention is


---------110:05----------
automatically going in that direction


---------110:08----------
so notice that right so all it takes is


---------110:11----------
the senses to control the attention of


---------110:13----------
your mind


---------110:14----------
so we can think about that in terms of


---------110:16----------
like oh if you see a yu-gi-oh pack


---------110:18----------
or i talk to you about a yu-gi-oh pack


---------110:20----------
this is something you're hearing


---------110:21----------
something you're seeing and then your


---------110:22----------
mind's attention


---------110:23----------
goes to the yu-gi-oh pack i smell


---------110:26----------
alcohol i see people drinking i smell


---------110:29----------
like a burger cooking or like a hot dog


---------110:31----------
vendor and then my attention goes there


---------110:33----------
and then my behavior follows my


---------110:35----------
attention


---------110:36----------
with me yeah makes sense so what i'm


---------110:39----------
going to teach you today


---------110:41----------
is the practice of separating your


---------110:43----------
indriyas or your sense organs from your


---------110:46----------
attention


---------110:48----------
i'm going to teach you a practice so


---------110:51----------
that you can literally


---------110:52----------
learn how to control your mind and what


---------110:55----------
we're going to do


---------110:56----------
is separate the indirect from the sense


---------110:58----------
organ in a very very simple sense


---------111:01----------
so what i'm going to do is show you


---------111:03----------
something called


---------111:05----------
the sri yantra okay so this is a little


---------111:07----------
bit it has a religious background but


---------111:09----------
you guys don't have to worry about the


---------111:10----------
religious part of it it really doesn't


---------111:12----------
matter


---------111:13----------
um this is uh so let me just think about


---------111:15----------
how to do this


---------111:16----------
okay so y'all aren't going to be able to


---------111:18----------
see moist's face because i can't figure


---------111:20----------
out how to do that


---------111:21----------
and you can't see anything yet right


---------111:25----------
me i see the the screen the the red


---------111:28----------
okay so this is the sri yantra okay so


---------111:31----------
this is what i want you to do i'm going


---------111:32----------
to zoom in a little bit


---------111:36----------
okay so can you see the dot


---------111:39----------
in the middle yes okay so what i want


---------111:42----------
you to do


---------111:43----------
and so that i want all you guys to do


---------111:44----------
this okay so i want you to look at the


---------111:47----------
dot


---------111:48----------
and just stare directly at the dot


---------111:51----------
and then what i want you to do is don't


---------111:53----------
look anywhere else and it's okay to


---------111:55----------
blink if you want to okay so just take a


---------111:56----------
moment to stare at the dot


---------112:04----------
looking at it yeah i feel like i'm about


---------112:06----------
to be like mind controlled or something


---------112:08----------
to rob a bank for you


---------112:09----------
uh close you're about to send me your


---------112:13----------
entire yu-gi-oh collection


---------112:15----------
i'm out all right this is not this okay


---------112:17----------
so what i want you to do is


---------112:18----------
notice uh uh charlie as you as you look


---------112:21----------
at the dot like what your mind is doing


---------112:24----------
is your mind focused on the dot along


---------112:26----------
with your eyes


---------112:27----------
or does your mind kind of fluctuate


---------112:29----------
between the dot and other things


---------112:31----------
fluctuate okay so now what i want you to


---------112:34----------
do


---------112:35----------
is look at the dot and put your


---------112:37----------
attention


---------112:38----------
don't look elsewhere but put your


---------112:40----------
attention on the


---------112:42----------
the red outside the blue box


---------112:45----------
you see there's like a red square


---------112:47----------
outside the blue box


---------112:48----------
yeah so look at the dot but put your


---------112:52----------
attention on the red


---------112:56----------
does that make sense yeah and now i want


---------113:00----------
you to move to the blue square


---------113:02----------
with your attention but don't stop


---------113:03----------
looking at the dot


---------113:09----------
can you move your attention to the blue


---------113:12----------
yeah i think so i think okay


---------113:16----------
and now i want you to notice that there


---------113:19----------
are circles


---------113:20----------
inside the blue square


---------113:23----------
and continue looking at the dot but then


---------113:25----------
tell me what c


---------113:27----------
what color or the circles inside the


---------113:29----------
blue square


---------113:37----------
yellow okay are there others


---------113:40----------
i think yellow red yellow okay


---------113:44----------
so now move further in what's inside the


---------113:46----------
three


---------113:48----------
circles the blue circle


---------113:51----------
okay and then what's inside the blue


---------113:53----------
circle


---------113:55----------
red okay


---------113:59----------
and what's inside red what what does it


---------114:02----------
look like


---------114:03----------
like uh like rose petals it looks like


---------114:06----------
okay


---------114:06----------
okay and then move further inside so


---------114:09----------
keep staring at the dot


---------114:10----------
it's okay to blink but let your


---------114:12----------
attention


---------114:14----------
move closer so what's inside the pink


---------114:17----------
rose petals red rose petals


---------114:20----------
looks like another another little ring


---------114:24----------
of what color


---------114:27----------
it's like a darker yellow okay and then


---------114:30----------
keep on moving inward so let your


---------114:32----------
attention


---------114:33----------
move to the next layer in what's next


---------114:38----------
it's another yellow circle okay and then


---------114:43----------
green triangles k


---------114:46----------
red triangles k blue triangles


---------114:50----------
okay red triangles okay


---------114:53----------
dot okay


---------114:57----------
so what did you notice about how easy it


---------115:00----------
was to


---------115:02----------
attend to things as they came closer to


---------115:05----------
your site


---------115:06----------
oh yeah it was a lot easier the outside


---------115:08----------
was a real struggle


---------115:10----------
yep right so so yeah


---------115:13----------
go ahead i just couldn't figure out what


---------115:15----------
i what i was seeing over there


---------115:17----------
getting pictures of bigfoot or something


---------115:18----------
for all i could tell so what we can see


---------115:21----------
what we can notice first of all is that


---------115:23----------
awareness loves being close to our


---------115:25----------
senses


---------115:27----------
you see that it's just a relief it


---------115:29----------
requires so much


---------115:30----------
strain to pull your awareness away from


---------115:34----------
your senses


---------115:36----------
would you agree with that agreed so now


---------115:39----------
we are first of all understand why


---------115:40----------
studying is hard


---------115:42----------
because in studying like our attention


---------115:44----------
wants to wander somewhere else and it's


---------115:46----------
like


---------115:47----------
our injuries and our mind is going


---------115:49----------
somewhere else it's hard to focus it to


---------115:50----------
where you want to go


---------115:53----------
so now what we're going to do is we're


---------115:54----------
going to do this practice again so we're


---------115:56----------
going to do it for about two minutes


---------115:58----------
i want you to just close your eyes for a


---------115:59----------
second okay


---------116:02----------
and just go ahead and recalibrate so


---------116:03----------
chat did you guys understand that


---------116:10----------
okay so now what we're gonna do uh


---------116:13----------
charlie is we're gonna start again and i


---------116:14----------
want you to open your eyes and look at


---------116:16----------
the red dot


---------116:17----------
okay and what i want you to do is just


---------116:19----------
fluctuate your attention so you can


---------116:21----------
decide you can move from the outside in


---------116:23----------
or the inside out


---------116:25----------
but i want you to move your attention to


---------116:28----------
different layers


---------116:29----------
of the picture okay and just practice


---------116:33----------
moving it


---------116:33----------
in and out and focusing on something


---------116:36----------
focusing on another thing


---------116:37----------
if you want to you are noticing um


---------116:40----------
you know the colors of the triangles but


---------116:44----------
between the triangles there are also


---------116:46----------
shapes so there are shapes created by


---------116:47----------
the negative space


---------116:50----------
okay so you can even notice those


---------116:53----------
but we're going to practice for two


---------116:54----------
minutes and just if you want to the


---------116:56----------
simplest way is just start from the


---------116:58----------
furthest outside and go in and then go


---------117:00----------
back out but you can also just bounce


---------117:01----------
around play with it


---------117:03----------
okay then uh we'll try and freestyle


---------117:05----------
this here


---------117:06----------
okay okay so i'm gonna start inside


---------117:09----------
and just kind of go out so okay red dot


---------117:12----------
red triangles and there's like


---------117:15----------
in the negative space it's like a little


---------117:17----------
yellow


---------117:19----------
i don't know what they called the


---------117:21----------
four-sided shape not the square but the


---------117:23----------
one that's on its side like a rhomboid


---------117:26----------
yep it's blue triangles


---------117:29----------
yellow skinnier rhomboids


---------117:33----------
i sound like a [ __ ] psychopath red


---------117:35----------
triangle okay so so pause for a second


---------117:37----------
notice how


---------117:38----------
you judge yourself for not coming up


---------117:40----------
with the right word right you see how


---------117:41----------
that thought popped up


---------117:43----------
yeah so so for a moment your attention


---------117:46----------
actually deviated completely away from


---------117:47----------
the practice and entered a judgment


---------117:50----------
yeah damn so so that's okay so and then


---------117:52----------
once again you judge yourself


---------117:54----------
for judging yourself so return your


---------117:58----------
attention to the dot okay start in the


---------118:00----------
dot and don't tell me what you see


---------118:02----------
so let's take that off your plate so be


---------118:04----------
silent


---------118:06----------
and just fluctuate your attention play


---------118:07----------
around with it do whatever you want to


---------118:09----------
we're gonna ask everyone to be silent


---------118:10----------
for like


---------118:11----------
let's say about two minutes


---------118:14----------
and just move your attention between the


---------118:18----------
layers


---------119:05----------
keep going we're halfway there


---------119:29----------
you


---------119:49----------
and now go ahead and close your eyes


---------119:52----------
and notice that in the space in front of


---------119:55----------
your mind


---------119:58----------
you may see an image


---------120:03----------
what do you see anything yeah i see the


---------120:07----------
blue square


---------120:08----------
the yellow ring red a red ring inside


---------120:10----------
the yellow ring and then the yellow ring


---------120:12----------
again


---------120:13----------
beautiful so just focus don't stop


---------120:15----------
focusing so continue


---------120:16----------
looking at the image and continue the


---------120:19----------
practice with your eyes closed


---------120:23----------
so focus on the center


---------120:27----------
or keep your mental eye on the center


---------120:30----------
and let your attention fluctuate between


---------120:32----------
the layers and just


---------120:33----------
see with your eyes closed


---------120:44----------
i don't know if this makes sense but do


---------120:46----------
your best not to lose it


---------120:49----------
does that make sense yeah it's weird huh


---------120:52----------
don't lose it


---------120:53----------
hold on i'm trying it's like a tug of


---------120:56----------
war right now


---------120:57----------
yes this is meditation


---------121:01----------
when you win this war you will control


---------121:06----------
yourself


---------121:11----------
i'm gonna open my eyes and it turns out


---------121:13----------
i'm like levitating above my chair or


---------121:15----------
something


---------121:16----------
okay so your attention has wandered so


---------121:19----------
go ahead and stop


---------121:23----------
when you're ready open your eyes yeah


---------121:26----------
i had it for quite a while i'll say a


---------121:29----------
lot longer than i thought i would


---------121:31----------
good so questions


---------121:36----------
yeah how so this exercise right here i


---------121:38----------
imagine this is one you've done


---------121:40----------
a lot of times sort of


---------121:43----------
something similar yeah how long did it


---------121:46----------
take you of doing these exercises before


---------121:47----------
you finally like got the hang of it


---------121:54----------
that's a hard question


---------121:59----------
so here's what my experience with


---------122:00----------
meditation is you think you get the hang


---------122:02----------
of it


---------122:03----------
and then the cool thing is like you


---------122:04----------
start to get the hang of other things


---------122:06----------
i'm still getting the hang of it and i'm


---------122:09----------
also really good at it


---------122:10----------
so i'll give you just an example so i do


---------122:14----------
a particular mantra so this is something


---------122:15----------
called a yantra which is like a physical


---------122:17----------
symbol


---------122:18----------
that's actually like it's actually like


---------122:19----------
magic so if you really look at the


---------122:22----------
tradition of


---------122:22----------
of yantra which is part of the tantric


---------122:25----------
or tantra


---------122:26----------
branch of meditation if you really


---------122:28----------
describe it it's kind of like magic


---------122:31----------
but anyway i don't really put a whole


---------122:32----------
lot of stock into that but i do a mantra


---------122:35----------
so mantra is the chanting of a


---------122:36----------
particular syllab


---------122:37----------
syllable to cultivate a particular kind


---------122:39----------
of energy


---------122:40----------
not really very actually there's some


---------122:42----------
science to it if we're being fair but


---------122:45----------
not not really scientific at all so it


---------122:47----------
took me some amount of time let's say a


---------122:48----------
period of about


---------122:50----------
two weeks to be able to sit and


---------122:53----------
concentrate on the montreal fully


---------122:56----------
but when you say get the hang of it i'd


---------122:58----------
say after a


---------123:00----------
couple of years it's hard to say


---------123:03----------
um it's hard to describe but i started


---------123:05----------
seeing my mantra


---------123:06----------
in other things so i


---------123:10----------
heard when you close your eyes yeah


---------123:12----------
that's a yantra so mantra is a sound


---------123:14----------
so i started to hear the sound of my


---------123:17----------
mantra in


---------123:18----------
the rhythm of life is the best way i can


---------123:20----------
describe it


---------123:21----------
and it's kind of the best indicator i


---------123:23----------
can give you is like close your eyes


---------123:26----------
and listen to the sound of your breath


---------123:32----------
can you hear it no i don't hear a


---------123:34----------
[ __ ] thing


---------123:36----------
okay that's like deep breath so deep


---------123:39----------
breath


---------123:40----------
good so go ahead breathe good


---------123:50----------
so the anyway so i know this is going to


---------123:53----------
sound kind of weird but have you heard


---------123:55----------
that sound anywhere else


---------123:59----------
it is the only time i would have ever


---------124:00----------
really heard that sound that i can think


---------124:02----------
of is maybe during like some big


---------124:03----------
physical exertion where i'm like


---------124:05----------
you know panting or on the verge of


---------124:07----------
collapsing like what pops to mind is


---------124:09----------
when i used to play basketball right


---------124:11----------
okay how close are you to uh the ocean


---------124:16----------
oh not not close okay so one day if you


---------124:19----------
get the chance


---------124:20----------
and you're at the ocean i would listen


---------124:23----------
to the sound of the ocean


---------124:24----------
and then listen to the sound of your


---------124:26----------
breath


---------124:27----------
and see if they sound similar they sound


---------124:30----------
different


---------124:32----------
so this is kind of a leading exercise


---------124:35----------
right so what i discovered it was it's


---------124:36----------
hard to describe but what i found is


---------124:38----------
that my mantra is like


---------124:39----------
a very fundamental sound that can be


---------124:41----------
heard in many many many many places


---------124:43----------
and so in a sense i felt like that's


---------124:45----------
when i really started getting the hang


---------124:46----------
of it


---------124:47----------
and so the goal of meditation is you


---------124:49----------
start to discover things and like learn


---------124:51----------
things about yourself about


---------124:53----------
a universe we're talking really culty


---------124:56----------
but honestly that's what it's


---------124:57----------
like hard to describe but it's like it's


---------124:59----------
sort of like you know when i ask you the


---------125:00----------
experience of is it


---------125:02----------
you know you learn something fundamental


---------125:04----------
today when you look at that thing and


---------125:06----------
you're like


---------125:06----------
it's so difficult to see the outside and


---------125:08----------
it's so easy to see the inside


---------125:11----------
and what you're literally doing is doing


---------125:12----------
push-ups for your mind where you're


---------125:14----------
training your attention to go where you


---------125:17----------
decide


---------125:17----------
instead of it following your indriyas or


---------125:20----------
your sense organs


---------125:22----------
if you become free of your indriyas


---------125:26----------
in terms of where your attention goes


---------125:28----------
your life will be completely different


---------125:31----------
if we think about someone who's


---------125:32----------
disciplined they smell a burger and they


---------125:34----------
order a salad


---------125:35----------
what is that it's separation from


---------125:38----------
attention from the indira


---------125:40----------
separation from the attention to the


---------125:42----------
indriya is one of the most crucial


---------125:43----------
skills and we don't teach it to people


---------125:46----------
and you can start with this practice


---------125:48----------
because literally all it is there's


---------125:49----------
nothing to there's no


---------125:51----------
significance it's just a sterile


---------125:54----------
environment it's a sandbox


---------125:55----------
where you put your indoria in one place


---------125:57----------
and you put your attention somewhere


---------125:58----------
else


---------125:59----------
and it's [ __ ] hard and then what


---------126:02----------
happens is you close your eyes and you


---------126:03----------
see that after image


---------126:05----------
and then i tell you charlie hold


---------126:08----------
on and you're like it's a war you're


---------126:10----------
damn right it's a war


---------126:11----------
and when you start winning that war when


---------126:13----------
you wake up one day and you say on


---------126:15----------
january 1st i'm gonna go to the gym


---------126:17----------
every day


---------126:18----------
there's that thought and it's really


---------126:21----------
easy and you're highly motivated on


---------126:22----------
january 2nd


---------126:23----------
that start thought starts to pull away


---------126:26----------
because you haven't learned how to hold


---------126:28----------
on


---------126:29----------
you don't know how to hold on to


---------126:31----------
something that's slipping away from your


---------126:32----------
mind


---------126:33----------
this is a practice that literally you do


---------126:36----------
push-ups


---------126:36----------
to hold on to what you choose to hold on


---------126:39----------
to


---------126:40----------
and you get better at it


---------126:43----------
and then you'll be able to go upstairs


---------126:45----------
yeah it's that simple


---------126:48----------
but it's very difficult so practice i'll


---------126:50----------
send you a link for the sri yantra if


---------126:52----------
you


---------126:52----------
are interested it's good if you want to


---------126:55----------
i i would get


---------126:56----------
i would get a physical picture so you're


---------126:57----------
not looking at a screen though


---------126:59----------
but it's a good yantra to start with um


---------127:02----------
and


---------127:03----------
it you know it also sent me all your


---------127:05----------
yugioh card


---------127:07----------
don't you ever say we don't even joke


---------127:09----------

---------127:12----------
they have a lasting home they don't need


---------127:14----------
to go anywhere any other questions
