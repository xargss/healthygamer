---------00:10----------

---------01:16----------
that's just my coach oh sorry yeah


---------01:19----------
that's okay


---------01:19----------
it's good you lift you noticed yeah I'm


---------01:24----------
just a little bit like misogynist and


---------01:27----------
kind of go like a negative view on women


---------01:29----------
I guess okay just from that's strange


---------01:35----------
most misogynists describe themselves as


---------01:38----------
misogynists I don't know I don't usually


---------01:44----------
hear that usually people get called


---------01:47----------
misogynists right oh yeah I've been coda


---------01:53----------
misogynist but okay silly what what is


---------01:56----------
that


---------01:57----------
so I don't think I'm fully misogynist oh


---------02:01----------
just like what so what is it when you


---------02:05----------
say you're a misogynist what is it what


---------02:07----------
does that mean just means just negative


---------02:15----------
you and women what does that mean a


---------02:16----------
negative view on women can you help me


---------02:18----------
understand that


---------02:31----------
I don't know like just so bad things to


---------02:35----------
relate to them okay so let me it seems


---------02:40----------
like it's a little bit tricky for you to


---------02:42----------
answer questions is that are you feeling


---------02:44----------
that way yeah yeah yeah


---------02:45----------
so let's let's just try to understand


---------02:47----------
that first are you feeling nervous yeah


---------02:50----------
yeah like on a scale of one to ten how


---------02:55----------
nervous are you right now


---------02:56----------
uh probably like seven eight okay and


---------03:00----------
what is it that's making you nervous


---------03:02----------
do you think uh just the fact that uh


---------03:07----------
I've watched you a lot i watch all the


---------03:10----------
streamers that you interview so like


---------03:12----------
it's kind of like surreal okay


---------03:14----------
thank you okay so justjust do you think


---------03:18----------
some of your nervousness has to do with


---------03:20----------
what we're talking about or is it just


---------03:21----------
being on stream in general yeah and that


---------03:25----------
but I don't know I just don't really


---------03:30----------
like I don't think I'm the biggest in so


---------03:34----------
you could have caught what the man


---------03:37----------
like what's what's up with all these


---------03:39----------
like people coming on that are not


---------03:41----------
gigantic I don't think there's such


---------03:42----------
thing as like what would the biggest


---------03:46----------
insult look like let's start there just


---------03:51----------
really hates everything I mean I hate


---------03:57----------
everything but like really hates you


---------04:04----------
would look ugly you know the head of you


---------04:07----------
would endure you just I think I'm


---------04:13----------
alright okay I would add I think I'm I


---------04:17----------
don't think I look amazing but yeah you


---------04:22----------
and me both brother thanks okay so what


---------04:27----------
what else is different between you and


---------04:28----------
so that the the ultimate insult the


---------04:31----------
final boss of the insults the clan


---------04:33----------
leader of the in cells would be uglier


---------04:36----------
than you are what else would be


---------04:37----------
different about him he'd be a man


---------04:40----------
male yeah okay


---------04:42----------
can you be a female and sell yes okay so


---------04:50----------
that's kind of confusing because you


---------04:53----------
know I asked you like what's an in sell


---------04:54----------
and then you kind of talk started


---------04:56----------
talking about misogyny so what's an


---------05:00----------
insult but just explain it to us like


---------05:03----------
help us understand you got understand


---------05:04----------
right so like back in my day I mean I


---------05:09----------
was probably an insult but they didn't


---------05:12----------
exist so how is more common today cuz


---------05:16----------
the internet like you know I don't


---------05:18----------
really social a lot so like this just


---------05:21----------
the fact that I just stay inside enjoy


---------05:25----------
the time okay what does I don't have to


---------05:29----------
do with you being an insult


---------05:30----------
because I have an opportunity to be in a


---------05:37----------
relationship or they women you don't


---------05:40----------
have an opportunity well less of an


---------05:43----------
opportunity but okay like but yet and


---------05:47----------
but also with like the culture today I


---------05:51----------
think makes for more in sales as well


---------05:54----------
max there are a lot of insults right now


---------05:57----------
I mean you take maximal cells as well no


---------06:02----------
I said wait what was a lot of in cells


---------06:06----------
okay so let's start with this what is


---------06:08----------
the term in cell stand for involuntary


---------06:12----------
celibate picture and help me understand


---------06:15----------
what that means not your choice to be


---------06:20----------
single okay so whose choice is it that


---------06:23----------
you're single it's a woman's fault I


---------06:31----------
don't know okay so let's talk about that


---------06:35----------
how is it the woman's women or a woman


---------06:39----------
let's start there


---------06:44----------
women i matter I don't necessarily agree


---------06:48----------
with that I think it can be it can be


---------06:54----------
but I also like its sorry mind afraid


---------06:57----------
we're gonna be perceived Hayden a little


---------07:03----------
bit but not really really cuz I'm


---------07:07----------
getting a lot of hesitation from you and


---------07:09----------
I'm trying to figure out if that has me


---------07:11----------
I just like generally not know I'm just


---------07:15----------
like not clear in my thoughts


---------07:16----------
okay like I've been thinking about it


---------07:18----------
coming up to the interview but like I've


---------07:20----------
had conversations in my head with you


---------07:22----------
but it's never likely cut like this is


---------07:26----------
what I think this is my opinion it's


---------07:28----------
always like Mackie and like yeah this


---------07:31----------
and this so so let's start there Hayden


---------07:33----------
is this a place where we want people to


---------07:37----------
have clear-cut thoughts and opinions you


---------07:41----------
know is that what people come here for


---------07:44----------
uh no I don't think so yeah so what do


---------07:50----------
people come here for uh take it to help


---------07:55----------
understand the way you think about


---------07:57----------
things okay and so like if I take two


---------08:00----------
people so let's say that our audience is


---------08:02----------
interested in understanding the way that


---------08:04----------
they think and I give them two options


---------08:06----------
one is someone who has done a lot of


---------08:09----------
thinking and is very clear and they're


---------08:10----------
thinking and the other one doesn't


---------08:12----------
understand what the they think and


---------08:14----------
they're thinking is very murky which one


---------08:16----------
do you think our audio which one do you


---------08:17----------
think helps our audience more fake


---------08:20----------
laying straight like to the point person


---------08:24----------
how because you can easily help him


---------08:32----------
understand way he's going wrong well I


---------08:36----------
think you can more than any guy that


---------08:38----------
doesn't know so I actually disagree so


---------08:43----------
the first thing is you have a


---------08:44----------
presumption that the clear-headed person


---------08:46----------
is going somewhere wrong which I don't


---------08:48----------
accept that like I don't think that it's


---------08:49----------
not my job to tell people where they're


---------08:51----------
thinking is flawed right because I just


---------08:54----------
for this situation like I think being an


---------08:57----------
in cell


---------08:57----------
and big misogynist is wrong why but I


---------09:01----------
well I just think it's wrong and stupid


---------09:05----------
but why also it's because I don't know


---------09:18----------
yeah so Hayden I ask you like can we be


---------09:22----------
a little bit critical of ourselves yeah


---------09:25----------
and so the first place that we need to


---------09:27----------
be critical of is placing a value


---------09:29----------
judgment on whether being an insult is a


---------09:30----------
good thing or a bad thing or whether


---------09:32----------
being a misogynist is a good thing or a


---------09:34----------
bad thing


---------09:35----------
nope right so like a I don't know if


---------09:39----------
you've caught some of these streams but


---------09:40----------
a big thing that I've come to appreciate


---------09:42----------
is that our mind does things that are


---------09:44----------
adaptive like anxiety is a protective


---------09:48----------
mechanism right ego is a protective


---------09:52----------
mechanism and so I don't know if that


---------09:56----------
applies to being an insular and


---------09:59----------
misogynist but I'd be curious about that


---------10:01----------
and I think if you want to change which


---------10:05----------
we haven't explicitly talked about but


---------10:06----------
there's you know I kind of had this


---------10:08----------
assumption that you don't want to be an


---------10:09----------
insult anymore is that true Tonda yeah I


---------10:15----------
mean yeah rather have a positive view


---------10:19----------
rather than having in you what's


---------10:22----------
negative about the view of an insult


---------10:25----------
[Music]


---------10:27----------
just how to


---------10:29----------
[Music]


---------10:35----------
I think there is native things like just


---------10:44----------
thinking just judging a person off the


---------10:48----------
agenda is pretty negative but er your


---------10:53----------
judgments accurate I mean if they


---------10:57----------
thought of it I go it's accurate but


---------10:59----------
like if you if you


---------11:02----------
I don't think everybody's like that you


---------11:05----------
know I mean do you think most in cells


---------11:09----------
feel the way that you feel yep that they


---------11:18----------
and what about what about that like do


---------11:20----------
they think that do you think that they


---------11:22----------
don't like being misogynists oh I've no


---------11:27----------
D okay um it's a good answer so hmm


---------11:34----------
so let me I want to share like maybe one


---------11:37----------
or two thoughts and then maybe I can we


---------11:39----------
can ask it kind of different strain of


---------11:40----------
questions because it seems like your


---------11:42----------
thoughts about this aren't clear which


---------11:44----------
other is the first thing I want talk


---------11:46----------
about so that's good I think it's good


---------11:47----------
that you're not clear the reason that


---------11:48----------
our scream helps people is because we


---------11:50----------
take people who have muddy water and we


---------11:52----------
help them clear it up and since other


---------11:55----------
people watch that process like they can


---------11:59----------
clear up their own thoughts whereas if


---------12:02----------
someone comes in with fully formed


---------12:03----------
thoughts that's very clear and


---------12:05----------
understands themselves like that doesn't


---------12:06----------
help us like our audience wants to be


---------12:09----------
that person but they don't know how to


---------12:10----------
get there so let me put it to you this


---------12:13----------
way like what do you think would help


---------12:15----------
people more watching an out-of-shape guy


---------12:17----------
get into shape or watching an in shape


---------12:21----------
guy talk about how he's in shape in the


---------12:26----------
attitude guys absolutely so that's what


---------12:28----------
we're here for we're here for your muddy


---------12:30----------
thoughts we're here for your half-formed


---------12:32----------
thoughts like that's what we want man


---------12:34----------
and and like it's not weird I'm not


---------12:37----------
expecting you to have everything figured


---------12:39----------
out if you you know if you had


---------12:40----------
everything figured out when you would go


---------12:42----------
on a show like you would go on Destiny's


---------12:44----------
stream and like debate it right like


---------12:47----------
people on destinies


---------12:48----------
stream like know what they know and they


---------12:50----------
know what they think and their their


---------12:53----------
beliefs are firmly held like that's why


---------12:55----------
this is the opposite like I want people


---------12:57----------
who don't understand what on earth they


---------12:58----------
think because I don't understand one on


---------13:00----------
earth you think look we're coming


---------13:01----------
we're starting from ignorance not


---------13:03----------
knowledge like that's what the stream is


---------13:04----------
all about it's about ignorance like I


---------13:07----------
start by asking you a question like


---------13:09----------
what's an insult because people think


---------13:10----------
I'm an expert but I don't think you guys


---------13:12----------
get this like do you think I'm an expert


---------13:15----------
what beautiful so you guys do get it


---------13:18----------
right so you we don't expect you to know


---------13:21----------
things and I'm thrilled to hear this


---------13:23----------
because this is a weight off my


---------13:25----------
shoulders because I'm terrified that you


---------13:27----------
guys think I have answers I don't have


---------13:30----------
answers I have questions yeah I know


---------13:34----------
that you have questions no answers


---------13:37----------
great based off the other streams


---------13:39----------
because you know you never see do you


---------13:43----------
say you think you can help somebody


---------13:44----------
don't say you know you can help so


---------13:46----------
absolutely so who's got the answers here


---------13:49----------
they Mir you me absolutely and so you


---------13:56----------
may not know that you have the answers


---------13:58----------
or you may not know what they are yet


---------14:00----------
but my role is to help you figure out


---------14:04----------
what answer you know by asking you


---------14:07----------
questions and that starts with you


---------14:09----------
giving us crappy answers here's how this


---------14:12----------
works


---------14:13----------
I ask you a question you give me a


---------14:15----------
crappy answer I ask you another question


---------14:16----------
you give me a slightly better answer and


---------14:18----------
we do that for about an hour and then


---------14:21----------
hopefully laughs Mansour's who knows


---------14:24----------
what do you think about that


---------14:26----------
damn it makes sense can I rely on you to


---------14:29----------
give me just shitty ass answers yep


---------14:33----------
awesome dude thank you very much so let


---------14:37----------
me ask you this how long have you been


---------14:39----------
in itself pretty much okay so so and


---------14:50----------
alright like could you explain a like


---------14:54----------
the red pill blackwell stuff cuz I think


---------14:57----------
that might help I don't know what that


---------14:59----------
is


---------15:01----------
now then don't worry but yeah well if


---------15:03----------
gets out can you explain it no I just


---------15:07----------
hate people talk about it it's like your


---------15:09----------
assistant asked me about it but okay I


---------15:11----------
didn't know what I don't understand what


---------15:12----------
black pill is but I can explain to you


---------15:14----------
what I know


---------15:15----------
so when I was in college there's this


---------15:18----------
thing that started becoming popular


---------15:20----------
called pickup artists or the PUA


---------15:22----------
community and these were people that


---------15:26----------
thought that essentially getting laid or


---------15:30----------
picking up a girl for a short term


---------15:32----------
sexual satisfaction was like a skill and


---------15:38----------
I think they're right in a sense right


---------15:41----------
so like being able to convince someone


---------15:43----------
to have sex with you is sort of like


---------15:44----------
becoming is like selling a car like it's


---------15:47----------
a skill that you can learn and so what


---------15:50----------
happened is I think that they took what


---------15:51----------
was then the insel community and gave


---------15:53----------
them a light of hope they said that you


---------15:56----------
can get laid too and all you have to do


---------15:58----------
is like work with us and we're artists


---------16:00----------
were pickup artists so we're gonna get


---------16:03----------
and they can't started coming up with


---------16:04----------
all of these in my opinion pseudo


---------16:06----------
scientific concepts they think that


---------16:08----------
they're scientific concepts maybe we'll


---------16:11----------
get there I'm not really sure I'm not an


---------16:13----------
expert in that stuff and and they


---------16:16----------
started coming up so they started like


---------16:17----------
explaining to people that like you're an


---------16:20----------
insulin there's like biology involved


---------16:22----------
and it's anyway so like they started


---------16:24----------
sort of supporting their things with


---------16:26----------
scientific theories and then over time I


---------16:29----------
think this became the red pill community


---------16:31----------
and my understanding of the red pill


---------16:33----------
community is that they're a group of


---------16:35----------
people who believe that men have falsely


---------16:40----------
been lured into a perception about the


---------16:43----------
dynamics between men and women so that


---------16:46----------
like there are some value judgments like


---------16:49----------
marriage and monogamy which are not like


---------16:52----------
which are sort of like I don't really


---------16:55----------
understand this stuff but the best way I


---------16:57----------
can put it is that like some of the


---------16:59----------
assumptions that we have about the


---------17:00----------
relationships between men and women are


---------17:02----------
actually false and this is an analogy


---------17:05----------
from the matrix about like do you want


---------17:07----------
to live in a world of false comfort or


---------17:09----------
do you want to face reality and take the


---------17:11----------
red pill and see things as they are so


---------17:14----------
in that kind


---------17:15----------
of idea they sort of say that like you


---------17:17----------
know some of these like monogamy and


---------17:19----------
other kinds of concepts or like blue


---------17:21----------
pill concepts and then so that's a big


---------17:24----------
part of red pill and I think the other


---------17:25----------
big part of red I mean there are lots of


---------17:27----------
big parts of red pill but as best as I


---------17:29----------
can understand there is also this


---------17:31----------
concept of alphas and betas which is


---------17:34----------
like an alpha is like a Chad and and so


---------17:38----------
that means like a dude who can get women


---------17:39----------
and a beta is a dude who either cannot


---------17:43----------
get women or gets women in a way that


---------17:45----------
sacrifices a lot of his power and


---------17:48----------
there's like there's like power dynamic


---------17:49----------
I think really alpha and beta is not


---------17:51----------
about getting laid the best I can


---------17:52----------
understand it's about a power dynamic


---------17:54----------
between men and women and that's what I


---------18:00----------
understand I actually literally do not


---------18:02----------
know what black pill is so like at some


---------18:05----------
point maybe in the early like 2010-2011


---------18:09----------
I sort of like lost track of the


---------18:12----------
evolution of the pickup artists or red


---------18:14----------
pill community which I was at in essence


---------18:17----------
like sort of a part of in the sense that


---------18:19----------
I had friends who were really into


---------18:20----------
pickup artists and I like read some of


---------18:22----------
their stuff and things like that because


---------18:24----------
I couldn't get a girlfriend how old are


---------18:26----------
you by the way I'm 21 yeah so like I I


---------18:29----------
had real I had never really dated a girl


---------18:34----------
by the time I was your age and you know


---------18:37----------
I went to college and like my freshman


---------18:40----------
and sophomore year I like tried to date


---------18:42----------
women and it just ended catastrophic ly


---------18:44----------
every single time yeah like I think I'm


---------18:48----------
like a like a beta but what does that


---------18:51----------
mean I don't well as you said somebody


---------18:55----------
that uh isn't outgoing you know isn't


---------18:59----------
doesn't approach women I can't chat them


---------19:03----------
up yeah Sarah and I think I'm just a


---------19:06----------
beta that doesn't seem it doesn't like


---------19:10----------
suck up to women or anything like that


---------19:12----------
okay so what is what does that mean suck


---------19:16----------
up to women what I mean just treat them


---------19:22----------
like royalty out of there okay how do


---------19:24----------
you treat women uh just like I would a


---------19:28----------
date


---------19:28----------
is normal okay she's like human a human


---------19:34----------
human a human and and what about where


---------19:37----------
does the misogyny come in there because


---------19:39----------
that doesn't sound very misogynistic me


---------19:40----------
at all I mean some women they have like


---------19:47----------
egos or like yeah baby what what do we


---------19:59----------
go to sickle women do to man


---------20:05----------
some depends well some lead him on some


---------20:14----------
how does that work and well why would a


---------20:17----------
woman lead on a man what does that look


---------20:18----------
like and like what it for Lester Otis


---------20:20----------
what is leading a dude on look like it


---------20:25----------
just looks like just teasing with him


---------20:32----------
just playing with him just like giving


---------20:34----------
him false heart and then and then only


---------20:38----------
using him for her benefit yeah yeah does


---------20:41----------
that happen to you yep can you tell us


---------20:45----------
about that yeah


---------20:52----------
just a situation where those friends of


---------20:56----------
a cheek we got along the look but yeah I


---------21:01----------
was asleep


---------21:03----------
last year okay can you tell us about her


---------21:08----------
you don't have to give like identifying


---------21:09----------
details but like like what kind of


---------21:11----------
person was she like what did you like


---------21:12----------
about her she's hot okay the most


---------21:17----------
important thing yep we got along I mean


---------21:21----------
like like we like thought alike


---------21:26----------
we how did you guys meet


---------21:31----------
through a friend like Oh interesting


---------21:34----------
well no we met we I went clubbing with


---------21:38----------
her and then after that yeah


---------21:42----------
basically huh do betas go clubbing no


---------21:46----------
but I do well I'm a beta vote linkage Oh


---------21:49----------
interest I don't like clubbing but I'm


---------21:51----------
shipping it but yeah I'm surprised to


---------21:54----------
hear that I usually when I imagine a


---------21:56----------
beta I think about you know someone


---------21:58----------
who's in a room like this with


---------22:02----------
electronics and they don't go out and go


---------22:04----------
clubbing it's weird I mean I have


---------22:07----------
friends and like sort of a social life


---------22:10----------
but Flake citizen a so you were out


---------22:13----------
clubbing and you met her while clubbing


---------22:17----------
yeah like whoa she's friends with my


---------22:21----------
friends silly he invited me out to go


---------22:24----------
clubbing with him in like then what and


---------22:27----------
then I went out is he an insult your


---------22:29----------
friend yeah okay


---------22:37----------
but he's friends with hot girls I mean


---------22:41----------
yeah he doesn't have a chance but yeah


---------22:43----------
he's friends with food hmm interesting


---------22:46----------
why don't you think he has a chance


---------22:51----------
because there's always someone better


---------22:54----------
than him in what wakes was looks-wise


---------22:59----------
yeah so people who are better looking


---------23:01----------
than he is yeah and if there's someone


---------23:04----------
better looking than he is he doesn't


---------23:06----------
stand a chance


---------23:08----------
yeah probably okay so what you're


---------23:13----------
telling me is that your perception is


---------23:15----------
that women choose men solely based on


---------23:18----------
looks I mean yeah I think it's a big pop


---------23:24----------
I don't think solely based on looks okay


---------23:29----------
so what else so how do you think women


---------23:33----------
make choices about who they date whoa


---------23:41----------
I think looks and personality in tennis


---------23:46----------
shoes only they like him personality


---------23:50----------
yeah


---------23:52----------
and how much they like them okay so


---------23:55----------
maybe we can kind of get to some of


---------23:57----------
those abstract things in a little bit


---------23:59----------
can can we go back to so you met this


---------24:00----------
girl she was a friend of your friends


---------24:03----------
and she was hot you all were at a club


---------24:05----------
together and did you interact with her


---------24:09----------
when I was out Tommy I awkwardly dancing


---------24:15----------
yeah well enough to his yeah nothing


---------24:22----------
happened in the back


---------24:23----------
slit wake up when you talk to a lady


---------24:27----------
danced did you dance with her yeah the


---------24:31----------
news cringe okay how do you know it was


---------24:36----------
cringe because it just was awkward


---------24:41----------
you felt awkward it was super good okay


---------24:45----------
and so then what happens well then she


---------24:51----------
hooked up with a black dude that was


---------24:53----------
attracted I see at the club that night


---------24:57----------
yep and what is what is hooking up mean


---------25:05----------
just hooking up kissing kissing so you


---------25:09----------
saw them I mean yeah which doing it


---------25:12----------
doing this thing alright I saw I know


---------25:16----------
this is gonna sound bizarre Hayden but I


---------25:18----------
don't know what hooking up means like


---------25:20----------
literally I don't know if that means


---------25:23----------
they had sex I don't know if that means


---------25:26----------
they just uh just thought I'm making up


---------25:33----------
from the club okay and and so did you


---------25:37----------
want to make out with her in the club


---------25:39----------
yeah probably and you saw them making


---------25:43----------
out yep and do you remember how you felt


---------25:46----------
when you saw that


---------25:48----------
I mean yep how did you feel


---------25:53----------
missed opportunity missed opportunity


---------26:05----------
that sounds like a watered down answer


---------26:07----------
to me buddy


---------26:08----------
I think about missed opportunities like


---------26:11----------
so you play games dude yeah so like you


---------26:16----------
familiar with this game Jedi fallen


---------26:18----------
order or whatever yeah kind of haven't


---------26:22----------
watched any gameplay but yeah so yeah I


---------26:26----------
bought this game when this kovat stuff


---------26:28----------
was starting and then about three days


---------26:31----------
after I bought the game it went on sale


---------26:35----------
and so I felt like that was a missed


---------26:37----------
opportunity like oh I could have saved


---------26:40----------
like when I think about the phrase


---------26:41----------
missed opportunity I sort of think about


---------26:43----------
and maybe this is like my perception


---------26:45----------
okay so I'm just sharing with you what I


---------26:47----------
hear when you say that like I think


---------26:48----------
about like oh I could have saved 15


---------26:50----------
bucks like man that was a missed


---------26:51----------
opportunity I think of it like if I was


---------26:56----------
more confident in this like socially


---------26:59----------
awkward and anxious I could have done


---------27:02----------
better so you know didn't have to you


---------27:06----------
know but yeah


---------27:08----------
did you think that maybe you would be


---------27:10----------
better if you were black yep and being


---------27:17----------
black is important because you'd have a


---------27:19----------
bigger dick and look better than Tina it


---------27:25----------
alone yeah so it would you say you don't


---------27:29----------
have that advantage this guy has the I


---------27:31----------
know it's funny what's funny about it


---------27:40----------
it's weird to say isn't it say


---------27:46----------
we're both thinking about the dick size


---------27:48----------
right no no oh just me yeah yeah I just


---------27:54----------
think about the big size when it comes


---------27:57----------
to black man when you're you know what


---------28:01----------
I'm sorry I said it's part of the


---------28:03----------
package it's part of the package yeah so


---------28:05----------
it's like yeah you kind of think about


---------28:07----------
that yeah yeah for a second there I was


---------28:09----------
like maybe oh I guess just dr. K thinks


---------28:12----------
about black dicks like that's just me


---------28:13----------
projecting what's in your head but I'm


---------28:17----------
sure


---------28:18----------
awesome man so yeah so you you kind of


---------28:22----------
thought like so what I'm seeing is that


---------28:24----------
you know you thought that you could have


---------28:25----------
been better if you were black I mean


---------28:31----------
like I think part of its like social


---------28:36----------
like I'm just says if you're anxious and


---------28:39----------
socially awkward and I'm like super like


---------28:43----------
self aware as well so then it just makes


---------28:46----------
everything worse


---------28:47----------
sure anxiety oh yeah no I notice it and


---------28:52----------
then I dance li awkwardly I don't like


---------28:54----------
this cringe like and then yeah


---------28:59----------
that and then yes super awkward and


---------29:05----------
cringe well I'm not a very good dancer


---------29:14----------
so that's pretty oh good how did you


---------29:19----------
feel when you saw her making out with


---------29:21----------
the dude I mean nice - it is what it is


---------29:27----------
right that's a thought how did you feel


---------29:32----------
feel like what does that mean just


---------29:44----------
say I don't know I could have done


---------29:48----------
better okay just feeling okay so we


---------29:54----------
can I'm gonna I'm gonna move us along if


---------29:56----------
that's okay Hayden but I just think it


---------29:58----------
you know I think it's worthwhile noting


---------30:00----------
that like feeling like I hear what


---------30:02----------
you're saying


---------30:03----------
and I kind of know what you mean but I


---------30:05----------
think there are a lot of feelings there


---------30:07----------
right so yeah like I just felt like I


---------30:14----------
wasn't good enough yeah they're not good


---------30:18----------
enough and also that like I'm also


---------30:20----------
getting a sense of powerlessness about


---------30:21----------
this situation like like I'm getting


---------30:25----------
some amount of self-loathing some amount


---------30:26----------
of shame and also some amount of power


---------30:29----------
so like let me take a stab at what may


---------30:32----------
be your thoughts are you know see you


---------30:35----------
kind of sit like I can just imagine like


---------30:37----------
you're kind of dancing with this girl


---------30:38----------
and it probably was like hard to even


---------30:40----------
like get up the courage to even dance


---------30:41----------
with her right like if you feel kind of


---------30:45----------
cringe and awkward and like you're not


---------30:46----------
confident in yourself like it takes a


---------30:48----------
lot to even take that first step and


---------30:50----------
then she kind of like you you put in


---------30:53----------
like a lot of work to like overcome your


---------30:55----------
anxiety and you dance with her and then


---------30:57----------
she goes off and makes out with a black


---------30:58----------
dude and dip and looking at that


---------31:02----------
probably hurts right so I'm just gonna


---------31:04----------
toss out like what I can imagine you


---------31:06----------
felt or maybe a better way to put it is


---------31:08----------
remember the way that I felt when I


---------31:12----------
talked to a girl at a party when I was a


---------31:14----------
freshman in college and you know it was


---------31:18----------
hard and then she ended up talking to


---------31:20----------
another guy or leaving with another guy


---------31:23----------
I felt like things were unfair I felt


---------31:29----------
like I was cursed because you know in


---------31:32----------
your situation I didn't I don't remember


---------31:34----------
having these particular thoughts but


---------31:35----------
like you know you were kind of saying


---------31:37----------
wait because he's black this is why this


---------31:39----------
is happening there's there's there's a


---------31:41----------
sense of you know you're what you get is


---------31:46----------
not yours to control because you're not


---------31:48----------
black let's not judge the thoughts I see


---------31:52----------
you judging the thoughts are you judging


---------31:55----------
the thoughts what do you mean what like


---------31:58----------
are you saying these thoughts are stupid


---------32:01----------
no okay what do you know what do you


---------32:03----------
think I agree I agree with them I'm just


---------32:05----------
thinking like just yeah nothing so I


---------32:13----------
think there's something about alike


---------32:14----------
powerlessness and sort of the sense that


---------32:17----------
things are out of your control but the


---------32:19----------
funny thing is like you also blame


---------32:21----------
yourself right language sort of doesn't


---------32:26----------
make sense because either it's out of


---------32:27----------
your control or it's in your control but


---------32:29----------
you manage to beat yourself up with both


---------32:30----------
of those things it's like right hook


---------32:33----------
left hook you know it's like oh but like


---------32:36----------
if you were better then she would be


---------32:39----------
talking to you instead of


---------32:40----------
dude and if you were black she would be


---------32:44----------
talking to you so it's kind of like


---------32:46----------
you're screwed because you're not black


---------32:48----------
and you're also screwed because you're


---------32:51----------
awkward and cringe and you're anxious


---------32:54----------
and so like it's your fault and it's out


---------32:58----------
of your control


---------32:59----------
that's a terrible place to be feels yeah


---------33:02----------
place to be yeah I also think that um if


---------33:07----------
I wasn't awkward and cringe I could like


---------33:10----------
not care as much is like like losing


---------33:14----------
missing that opportunity


---------33:16----------
well not it wouldn't be missing


---------33:17----------
opportunity just that never happening


---------33:20----------
cuz there's plenty more option nice I


---------33:22----------
could you know go laugh it no get but uh


---------33:26----------
yeah yeah so what happened next


---------33:33----------
nothing just said yeah Ron discord oh


---------33:38----------
yeah now we went back to her friend's


---------33:41----------
house we all slept in the same room and


---------33:44----------
hold on we should she you and her went


---------33:48----------
back to her friend's house and y'all


---------33:51----------
slept in the same yeah yeah no I mean no


---------33:54----------
but we'll all in there because it was


---------33:57----------
her friend's mother's house so we all


---------34:01----------
went back to there and that yeah we just


---------34:04----------
went to bed


---------34:05----------
watched a movie okay and then in the


---------34:08----------
morning telling in the morning no I just


---------34:13----------
made a laugh and we played games on


---------34:17----------
discord you made her laugh how did it


---------34:22----------
feel to do that oh I'll make a little


---------34:27----------
people s ego but wait but yes how did it


---------34:34----------
feel


---------34:38----------
 so when I ask you how you feel and


---------34:41----------
your answer is I make a lot of people


---------34:44----------
laugh what are you doing there


---------34:45----------
why do you say that what is your mind


---------34:48----------
doing kissa is making people laugh isn't


---------34:59----------
really a big deal to me alright okay I'm


---------35:04----------
not so sure I agree with that I mean it


---------35:07----------
like yeah so I'm gonna toss something


---------35:12----------
out Hayden so I get the sense that what


---------35:15----------
you're doing is I asked you how you felt


---------35:18----------
and my sense is that like you felt good


---------35:22----------
it felt good yeah and then when I asked


---------35:26----------
you how you felt


---------35:27----------
instead of saying good you kind of


---------35:29----------
invalidate the way that you feel by like


---------35:31----------
saying it's not that big of a deal I do


---------35:33----------
it all the time do you see that truth


---------35:37----------
but you're kind of stepping away like


---------35:39----------
you're willfully stepping away from your


---------35:41----------
positive qualities and positive


---------35:43----------
interactions yeah yes missing it


---------35:47----------
essentially yeah you're dismissing your


---------35:51----------
good feelings now why do we do that


---------35:55----------
any idea to protect yourself oh wow I


---------36:02----------
didn't think you'd be able to get there


---------36:03----------
Hayden what are you protecting


---------36:05----------
why does dismissing our good feelings


---------36:07----------
what does that protect us from getting


---------36:11----------
disappointed very good protects you from


---------36:15----------
hope how do you feel that Hope Haven


---------36:26----------
just like if I told you that I think


---------36:30----------
that you don't have to be an insult for


---------36:32----------
the rest of your life how would that


---------36:33----------
make you feel good would it make you


---------36:40----------
feel bad too


---------36:46----------
I mean okay cool


---------36:49----------
so we'll see if I'm not actually saying


---------36:52----------
that yet but we'll see


---------36:53----------
maybe we'll get you there do you think


---------36:56----------
you haven't also yeah yeah I think I


---------37:02----------
think I have hope in the right situation


---------37:06----------
okay so let's explore it Kim


---------37:09----------
can we keep talking is that okay dude so


---------37:12----------
you made her laugh yep did you think you


---------37:15----------
had a shot when you made her laugh no


---------37:20----------
but it was nice to make a lot I mean do


---------37:25----------
you and then you guys started playing


---------37:27----------
you added or on discord yeah we played


---------37:31----------
pub G how did you do that did you ask


---------37:34----------
her for her desk or tidy donors mister


---------37:40----------
and dance


---------37:41----------
cuz uh how did you think about who the


---------37:44----------
messenger had a message her if you


---------37:46----------
didn't know well I like I like sorta


---------37:50----------
talk to a once before we went out so I


---------37:52----------
kind of like kind of had an idea who she


---------37:55----------
was


---------37:56----------
and then afterwards so I just knew who


---------38:01----------
she was and I already had a steam I'm


---------38:04----------
pretty sure from okay like ages ago


---------38:08----------
okay like I don't really know right


---------38:10----------
because like like the reason I'm


---------38:12----------
tunneling down into this because a lot


---------38:13----------
of times getting contact information of


---------38:15----------
women is actually a hard thing for in


---------38:17----------
cells yeah right oh when I was growing


---------38:23----------
up I wasn't really Ninh so but I wasn't


---------38:27----------
in so in the way that I didn't have


---------38:30----------
relationships but tolki two women don't


---------38:33----------
just guess when I was growing up it was


---------38:36----------
like easy


---------38:39----------
yeah pretty easy for me there's a Chad


---------38:42----------
deep within you yeah there's an alpha in


---------38:46----------
there man talking they're just girls was


---------38:49----------
easy


---------38:49----------
Wow impress


---------38:52----------
so then what happens so you guys start


---------38:54----------
playing games on on pub G oh yeah then


---------38:59----------
ya know you like her at this point not


---------39:05----------
at this point I was just getting to know


---------39:07----------
uh talking about then yeah I think


---------39:13----------
I didn't really like it to like later on


---------39:20----------
and it took me a while to develop


---------39:26----------
feelings okay what do you what started


---------39:31----------
to happen what kind of feelings did you


---------39:32----------
develop I couldn't really help it as


---------39:39----------
well like the feelings just uh kind of


---------39:43----------
like kind of trouble I got didn't want


---------39:45----------
to feel that way but I couldn't help


---------39:48----------
what feel so to be in a relationship


---------40:02----------
with it alright okay were you in love


---------40:05----------
with her yeah probably do you think I'm


---------40:11----------
trying to figure out why that's hard for


---------40:13----------
you to say or recognize


---------40:19----------
yeah yeah sounds like you felt a lot


---------40:25----------
yeah yeah probably yeah do in cells


---------40:29----------
usual I mean do in cells fall in love


---------40:31----------
what does that happen to them what do


---------40:33----------
you think no well no no I think they do


---------40:39----------
but then they I don't know I think they


---------40:44----------
can't yeah I think it happens a lot yeah


---------40:47----------
what do you think and that's what I


---------40:50----------
become in so yeah great thought like


---------40:55----------
that's what I was thinking too but can


---------40:56----------
you help me understand you know because


---------40:58----------
the last time I assumed we had the same


---------41:00----------
thought it turned out to be very wrong


---------41:01----------
so why do you think that falling in love


---------41:04----------
helps them along the path of becoming it


---------41:06----------
an insult because I get hurt and then


---------41:10----------
you know they're necessarily oh no they


---------41:19----------
just can't they don't have control yeah


---------41:23----------
hmm what don't they have control over he


---------41:29----------
likes them he doesn't do you can't make


---------41:32----------
someone love you back yeah so what did


---------41:37----------
you start doing what did you do anything


---------41:39----------
differently when you started developing


---------41:41----------
feelings for her


---------41:46----------
yeah outside sir would you sergeant I


---------41:49----------
would sound like a message rim or Oxford


---------41:53----------
or play games well then I'll notice it


---------41:56----------
as well cuz you know needy but well yeah


---------42:03----------
what do you mean by that what does that


---------42:04----------
mean needy


---------42:06----------
well like I want to play games with her


---------42:10----------
kids I'm bored and desperate and she's


---------42:14----------
not so its needy on my end cuz how is


---------42:20----------
that bored and desperate I'm confused


---------42:23----------
well I had nothing but I was born in


---------42:27----------
desperate how do you know she has more


---------42:33----------
because she's not pulling desperate how


---------42:36----------
do you know that though because I'm lost


---------42:43----------
how do you know what her social life is


---------42:45----------
though cuz she tells me I see ok yeah I


---------42:49----------
mean I didn't mean to ask though I was


---------42:52----------
just genuinely curious like you're sort


---------42:54----------
of saying that is that what I'm seeing


---------42:55----------
is like early on you kind of said that


---------42:57----------
you treat women like humans right you


---------43:00----------
don't treat them differently and what


---------43:02----------
I'm seeing is like two people who enjoy


---------43:04----------
playing games together and generally


---------43:07----------
speaking people on discord or bored and


---------43:09----------
desperate like that's that's the average


---------43:12----------
skort user right that's it and and even


---------43:18----------
even the women that I've talked to her


---------43:19----------
played games with who are discord also


---------43:21----------
tend to be pretty bored and desperate


---------43:23----------
they tend to be like I don't see a big


---------43:25----------
gender difference in terms of you know


---------43:27----------
how successful or bored people are or


---------43:29----------
desperate people are on discord just in


---------43:31----------
my own experience we're all gamers the


---------43:34----------
end of the day but anyways so it does


---------43:37----------
sound like she had a pretty active


---------43:38----------
social life so what I'm kinda getting a


---------43:41----------
sense of is is maybe what's needy is


---------43:43----------
that she had a life outside of you but


---------43:46----------
you were noticing that your life started


---------43:49----------
to revolve more around her yeah I think


---------43:54----------
while I was working at the time and like


---------43:56----------
when he was getting bad Legos


---------44:00----------
like don't I was working at a factory so


---------44:03----------
then I'd like so old I had time to think


---------44:06----------
cuz it was like a very boring job so


---------44:09----------
that made it like evil was then it was


---------44:12----------
and I was made what even worse just


---------44:17----------
thinking and being like obsessing kind


---------44:21----------
of hmm and it's just creepy and weird


---------44:24----------
but it is what was happening obsessing


---------44:30----------
what kind of thoughts were you having


---------44:35----------
that's just the situations where you


---------44:40----------
could look at so you were fantasizing


---------44:42----------
about how things could work yeah and and


---------44:47----------
what kind of can you walk us through one


---------44:50----------
of those and if that's too personal it


---------44:51----------
makes you uncomfortable we don't have to


---------44:52----------
do but I'm I'm just the reason I'm


---------44:55----------
asking is because I I'm curious whether


---------44:58----------
what you say is gonna resonate with the


---------45:00----------
people that are watching because I think


---------45:03----------
a big problem here yeah we all have


---------45:05----------
these thoughts but like no like you feel


---------45:06----------
alone with those thoughts right you feel


---------45:08----------
pathetic with those thoughts and the


---------45:12----------
point of saying here is that you're


---------45:14----------
pathetic but you're not alone yeah right


---------45:18----------
we're all pathetic yeah situation oh


---------45:28----------
that's just


---------45:35----------
just I think it's more like her changing


---------45:41----------
changing how oh no it's like I'm trying


---------45:49----------
to remember like it thought oh how would


---------45:52----------
think what would you say I guess it's


---------46:00----------
like ego as well because like like I'll


---------46:03----------
think that you know I'm prettier on date


---------46:05----------
you know and then she she just has open


---------46:11----------
eyes or someone listens sure she just


---------46:14----------
has to see how good you are


---------46:16----------
yeah okay yeah pretty much and so so you


---------46:20----------
start thinking about her more and more


---------46:23----------
yeah and so you're thinking about her


---------46:26----------
while you're working and then you play


---------46:28----------
games with her in the evening and what


---------46:29----------
are you do you have certain hopes like


---------46:34----------
what do you want to happen Hayden what


---------46:37----------
did you want to happen I just want to


---------46:40----------
live happily ever after


---------46:41----------
absolutely with her right yeah not with


---------46:45----------
the black dude she was making out no and


---------46:50----------
and so then what happened so like you're


---------46:52----------
thinking about having building a life


---------46:54----------
with her and you guys just play games


---------46:56----------
together did you ever share your


---------46:58----------
feelings there no that


---------47:04----------
what gets in the way of that cuz she


---------47:08----------
doesn't share the same feelings so


---------47:09----------
what's the point


---------47:10----------
how do you know that kiss if she did so


---------47:17----------
we would be dating okay I want I want to


---------47:23----------
put I want you to just try something for


---------47:24----------
I know that I don't have that said stuff


---------47:26----------
but yep what I just said scented dumb


---------47:29----------
but late so so let's just assume it


---------47:35----------
seems but it ended differently what


---------47:39----------
sounds dumb about that


---------47:42----------
well you can never know what somebody


---------47:46----------
else is thinking yeah but that's not


---------47:49----------
what actually happens in your head right


---------47:51----------
like you don't tell yourself you can't


---------47:53----------
actually know what someone else is


---------47:54----------
thinking yeah well like I'm not gonna


---------47:58----------
tell her my feelings when she's you know


---------48:01----------
clubbing and you know and also yeah no


---------48:04----------
she she tells me wait okay well when I


---------48:10----------
was working in the factory and I was


---------48:11----------
like doing about work and and just


---------48:14----------
losing my mind she she like was messaged


---------48:17----------
me about their guy problems as well so


---------48:21----------
that's pretty low you know what Blair so


---------48:25----------
that's how I what was a low blow about


---------48:27----------
that let's think about that for a second


---------48:30----------
cuz stung me yeah what's what's not oh


---------48:34----------
you're not the one she's having guy


---------48:36----------
problems with yeah well I mean if you


---------48:40----------
want if you want to be the guy she's


---------48:41----------
having guy problems with you can just


---------48:42----------
tell her what your feelings are then you


---------48:44----------
guys can have a problem


---------48:51----------
right you could become part of the drama


---------48:54----------
man well I sit on sidelines I don't know


---------48:56----------
if that's a problem that I want but


---------48:59----------
let's think about that for a second


---------49:02----------
cuz you're saying like I want to be the


---------49:05----------
guy that she texts loser in sells about


---------49:07----------
because she's having problems right you


---------49:11----------
want to be in that role no I don't I


---------49:15----------
don't we message brother


---------49:17----------
okay you don't want to be messaged about


---------49:19----------
that but you want to be the


---------49:21----------
you want to be the that she's


---------49:22----------
messaging other dudes about yeah yeah


---------49:27----------
true enough right so like like she has


---------49:30----------
drama with dudes and you don't want to


---------49:32----------
hear about that because you want to be


---------49:34----------
with her why is she sending you those


---------49:36----------
messages because I'm a pretty


---------49:41----------
straightforward and honest person saying


---------49:43----------
I guess she believes my opinion you're


---------49:45----------
straightforward and honest really maybe


---------49:49----------
enough to you but when we're friends


---------49:52----------
yeah no I apologize I didn't mean to I


---------49:56----------
was just really confused because what


---------49:58----------
I'm hearing from you is like you had


---------50:00----------
these feelings and you were anything but


---------50:02----------
straightforward or honest yeah just


---------50:08----------
those feelings here so so I'm not trying


---------50:14----------
to make a value judgment on you as a


---------50:16----------
whole I'm just like it I just surprised


---------50:18----------
to hear you say that because it sounds


---------50:19----------
like you were playing one you know you


---------50:21----------
were interacting with her in a


---------50:22----------
particular way and you were thinking


---------50:23----------
about her in a different way yeah so


---------50:29----------
then what happened did you feel like


---------50:33----------
like she was leading you on at this


---------50:35----------
point


---------50:39----------
no I just thought it sucks but yeah it


---------50:46----------
sounds I think to be in love with


---------50:48----------
someone who sends you text messages


---------50:50----------
about other dudes yep


---------50:53----------
that's so now we get back to what you


---------50:57----------
were saying like I asked you how does


---------50:59----------
that feel and you're like shitty is like


---------51:00----------
okay I got it now since like it feels


---------51:02----------
shitty yeah yeah it does so what


---------51:12----------
happened then um what happened next


---------51:23----------
just like


---------51:29----------
I'm like we we hang out we hanged out


---------51:32----------
like once so it was we went to the city


---------51:36----------
and just went shopping and then after


---------51:40----------
that I asked to hang it again and then


---------51:45----------
she ditch me of your clubbing I was like


---------51:49----------
 II can't


---------51:50----------
oh sorry might ditched you to go


---------51:55----------
clubbing well like we set up playing


---------51:59----------
stood like a guard for a drink'll gonna


---------52:03----------
hang out and like I'm not made out but a


---------52:07----------
Dana and then she bailed on me to get


---------52:12----------
clubbing with a friend you should rather


---------52:15----------
do it and I was like yeah that's kind of


---------52:17----------
shitty when did she bear like the same


---------52:19----------
day or like like that well uh it was


---------52:24----------
like the day before so what did she say


---------52:27----------
we got message her about Italy yeah we


---------52:29----------
still we still gonna hang out but she


---------52:32----------
spelled what did she saying she just


---------52:38----------
said it wasn't on my mind I forgot about


---------52:46----------
it I'm going clubbing


---------52:49----------
mmm not about it or forgot about you sir


---------52:57----------
difference that's what I'm wondering


---------53:00----------
sounds like there isn't it pretty much


---------53:04----------
cuz you don't forget anything about her


---------53:07----------
well right so like it's like you she


---------53:11----------
spends most of her time I mean you spend


---------53:13----------
most of your thought or you spend a lot


---------53:15----------
of your thoughts thinking about her like


---------53:16----------
if you guys had had plans you would


---------53:18----------
never forget it pretty much it feels


---------53:23----------
like you're an afterthought to her yep


---------53:27----------
like if it feels to me like she doesn't


---------53:29----------
value you as a person


---------53:33----------
it pretty much and how does it feel to


---------53:37----------
care a lot about a person who doesn't


---------53:39----------
care a lot about you


---------53:51----------
I mean it is one of these it feels


---------53:55----------
but I can't make them feel sit away sir


---------54:02----------
it's nothing I can do about it you can't


---------54:07----------
make them feel the same way so there's


---------54:09----------
nothing you can do about it I don't know


---------54:12----------
if I agree with that but we'll get there


---------54:17----------
I'm kind of curious ooh so then you know


---------54:20----------
you say you see word that is


---------54:22----------
emitted on twitch because it is


---------54:24----------
offensive and then what happened and


---------54:33----------
then we just stop talking and then after


---------54:36----------
that like we haven't talked for like a


---------54:38----------
and then we started talking like legit a


---------54:41----------
month ago when you say he stopped


---------54:44----------
talking that means when you stopped


---------54:47----------
messaging her oh yeah I just tried


---------54:51----------
forgot about it and she just you know


---------54:54----------
didn't message me either


---------54:56----------
so actually yeah so let me ask you


---------54:58----------
something did it feel like you were


---------55:00----------
doing most of the work of communication


---------55:02----------
like you were you would start all the


---------55:04----------
DMS and then she would receive you was


---------55:07----------
there a part of you that was kind of


---------55:08----------
paying attention to if I don't message


---------55:09----------
her how long is it gonna take her to


---------55:11----------
message me yeah definitely yeah and then


---------55:14----------
when she didn't message you for a week


---------55:16----------
or two did you feel like you were right


---------55:19----------
all along and like you were putting more


---------55:21----------
into this relationship than she was and


---------55:23----------
she actually does I mean about I felt


---------55:25----------
well I didn't you it neither at that


---------55:28----------
point but yeah it would wouldn't make me


---------55:32----------
feel that yeah and so was she leading


---------55:37----------
you on


---------55:43----------
no I mean I wouldn't I wouldn't say so


---------55:47----------
what did she do to you hey me


---------55:56----------
Spiritualist my friend


---------56:01----------
this that doesn't make that doesn't


---------56:04----------
answer my question at all I don't like


---------56:06----------
it sounds like she did something to you


---------56:09----------
how do you feel about her now


---------56:12----------
now just you still I don't really have


---------56:22----------
that no no really


---------56:24----------
well it's more like I don't think I'd


---------56:30----------
still love her or anything okay what why


---------56:35----------
are you smiling


---------56:36----------
oh there's no reason


---------56:41----------
it's just wait cause we're friends are


---------56:43----------
we gonna watch this and it's pretty


---------56:46----------
nerve-wracking your friend not friends


---------56:51----------
your friend see this holy she's uh


---------56:55----------
I hope she never sees this be painful


---------56:59----------
what would be painful about it should be


---------57:03----------
weird what would be weird about it


---------57:06----------
because I would the I'm irrelevant in


---------57:09----------
her head and then it's kind of like


---------57:13----------
creepy is it uh what's creepy about it


---------57:23----------
Oh me talking about her when she does a


---------57:27----------
just no clue sure but what comes off


---------57:32----------
creepy okay can I think for a second


---------57:39----------
yeah sure so first of all huge props to


---------57:42----------
you for saying all this stuff because I


---------57:44----------
mean if your friends are gonna watch it


---------57:45----------
then that's like holy man I didn't


---------57:47----------
even realize that you know yeah I guess


---------57:50----------
I should have put on the two together


---------57:51----------
that if you guys game together there's


---------57:52----------
like a small chance that she is aware of


---------57:55----------
what we are I'm not sure now a


---------57:58----------
friendship


---------57:59----------
good friends are hurt they won't tell


---------58:02----------
her yeah okay I mean sure okay so what


---------58:10----------
is it well so let me ask you the same


---------58:12----------
what does it like to share this story


---------58:13----------
like how do you feel like having talked


---------58:15----------
about this I don't never really talked


---------58:20----------
about it so it's kind of new to me good


---------58:25----------
what is what do you think like it's like


---------58:30----------
we're playing a game for the first time


---------58:31----------
you're like oh I've never played this


---------58:32----------
game before like what do you think about


---------58:34----------
this game what do you think about


---------58:35----------
talking about the things that you've


---------58:38----------
kept locked up inside total noise it's


---------58:43----------
kind of wait


---------58:44----------
it's go to it yeah so we knew you were


---------58:47----------
gonna say that


---------58:47----------
right so it sounds like you're confused


---------58:49----------
about what to feel or that you're


---------58:51----------
feeling things that are unfamiliar


---------58:52----------
that's what we really mean it's a novel


---------58:55----------
experience you I don't know how I feel


---------58:57----------
so what I'm getting from you is that you


---------59:00----------
haven't become unburdened I'm not


---------59:04----------
getting that at all


---------59:05----------
which is perfectly fine and I'm not


---------59:09----------
getting any sense of positivity or


---------59:10----------
negativity what I'm getting a sense of


---------59:12----------
is like this is new for me yeah what's


---------59:20----------
happening like okay let me just think


---------59:23----------
for a second


---------59:27----------
so having talked through this story are


---------59:32----------
there any kind of like thoughts or


---------59:34----------
reflections that kind of pop up about


---------59:36----------
yourself like if you are listening to


---------59:38----------
this this is kind of a weird question


---------59:40----------
it's sort of like I read my mind


---------59:41----------
question so if it doesn't make any sense


---------59:43----------
don't worry about it


---------59:44----------
but like I'm just wondering like has


---------59:46----------
anything kind of popped up to you is


---------59:47----------
like odd or something that you want to


---------59:49----------
think about or maybe explore or what


---------59:51----------
would you say to yourself having heard


---------59:53----------
this story I mean I just think my


---------59:59----------
thoughts really haven't changed much


---------60:01----------
sure


---------60:09----------
would you like how about it yeah oh


---------60:13----------
sorry god I feel bad it's no different


---------60:18----------
okay and any fellow would like my


---------60:20----------
thoughts to change yeah maybe yeah


---------60:28----------
okay so Hayden is it okay if I sort of


---------60:32----------
talk a little bit more and kind of take


---------60:34----------
out like ask you fewer questions for a


---------60:36----------
little bit


---------60:36----------
yes so I still don't understand exactly


---------60:40----------
where the the misogyny comes from like


---------60:43----------
do you believe that all women are gonna


---------60:45----------
treat you like she did do you believe


---------60:51----------
that if you interact with women in the


---------60:52----------
future that you're gonna end up in the


---------60:54----------
same place I mean I think I've high


---------61:02----------
standards said I could so yeah I would


---------61:07----------
end up in that situation what do you


---------61:08----------
mean you have high standards what's that


---------61:10----------
mean I go for attractive sort of like


---------61:20----------
there's a lot of people going after the


---------61:24----------
same person yeah yeah I just just uh


---------61:33----------
would you be okay with lower standards


---------61:41----------
probably not okay I don't think so


---------61:46----------
Japan would you date a girl who's a five


---------61:49----------
out of ten


---------61:54----------
probably know why not which is


---------62:05----------
I'm not attracted to them okay


---------62:17----------
so I don't think you have to be an


---------62:19----------
insult let me start with this can I


---------62:24----------
share some thoughts with you about that


---------62:26----------
you're welcome to you know SWAT them


---------62:29----------
down as they pop up the first thing is I


---------62:32----------
think a lot of your conceptions are in


---------62:35----------
your head like I think the reason that


---------62:38----------
you believe you're an insult is because


---------62:41----------
you set yourself up with a scenario that


---------62:43----------
is unwinnable like the reason that it's


---------62:47----------
not your like you you give up your power


---------62:49----------
basically which is bizarre so like you


---------62:51----------
feel powerless but like you're the one


---------62:52----------
who's actually giving it up and the


---------62:54----------
simplest thing is that you have no idea


---------62:57----------
how she feels but you make assumptions


---------62:58----------
based on what you observe about what her


---------63:03----------
preferences are so I think this is a big


---------63:06----------
problem what are you thinking you're


---------63:08----------
smiling I mean yeah no great I'm just


---------63:13----------
thinking about those situations like


---------63:15----------
what just kind of caught me off guard


---------63:27----------
okay I was just thinking of it that's a


---------63:31----------
situation so kind of evident like what


---------63:35----------
do you what do you what any of those


---------63:37----------
situations are evident what cynics me


---------63:41----------
like message me but the dude that she's


---------63:44----------
obsessed with so why would I


---------63:48----------
I mean yeah so that's the that's the


---------63:53----------
reason why I think that she doesn't like


---------63:57----------
me


---------63:58----------
sure so so so I I agree with that I


---------64:02----------
think that that actually kind of makes


---------64:03----------
sense because I think at some point you


---------64:05----------
guys became friends if she didn't have


---------64:08----------
too much of a romantic interest in you


---------64:10----------
yep so let me kind of share a couple of


---------64:14----------
other things so I think that like are


---------64:15----------
you familiar with like all of this you


---------64:18----------
know like mate selection theory that


---------64:20----------
people like insult like you guys talk


---------64:22----------
about that and insult communities like I


---------64:24----------
don't know I mean if you're part of


---------64:25----------
insel communities or not no okay


---------64:28----------
no okay so you know III think


---------64:31----------
basic issue here is that you know you're


---------64:36----------
somehow assuming her feelings and you're


---------64:40----------
somehow also assuming that she


---------64:42----------
understands yours I mean I don't think


---------64:50----------
she understands Milan but okay


---------64:52----------
so if she doesn't understand your


---------64:55----------
feelings does she have a choice to date


---------64:57----------
you or not so like actually forget about


---------65:02----------
that question let me ask you a different


---------65:03----------
question so let's assume that y'all's


---------65:05----------
positions are reversed so let's say that


---------65:08----------
she hangs out with you she saw you at


---------65:10----------
the club and then she starts to have


---------65:11----------
like a little bit of a crush on you


---------65:13----------
you seem to be dancing with her but you


---------65:15----------
demonstrate no romantic interest so


---------65:18----------
feeling hurt she goes to the first guy


---------65:20----------
that she can find and she starts to make


---------65:22----------
out with him and then at the end of the


---------65:25----------
night she doesn't go home with that guy


---------65:26----------
she goes with her friend with you you


---------65:29----------
guys sleep in the same room together and


---------65:31----------
then you all talk you make her laugh she


---------65:33----------
starts crushing on you a little bit and


---------65:35----------
then you never ask for her number and


---------65:37----------
then you messenger on discord and she's


---------65:40----------
waiting for that and every time you


---------65:43----------
message she responds you guys start


---------65:45----------
playing games together she starts to


---------65:47----------
develop feelings for you and she's


---------65:49----------
waiting for you to ask her out and you


---------65:50----------
share some kind of feeling and


---------65:58----------
she has these feelings for you that you


---------66:03----------
never see I just didn't believe she had


---------66:08----------
feelings I think we're just friends I


---------66:10----------
understand that you don't believe that


---------66:12----------
but if you can hide your feelings from


---------66:15----------
her


---------66:16----------
why can't she hide her feelings from you


---------66:18----------
I think like you see what I'm saying


---------66:26----------
like if if you can if you can hide


---------66:29----------
feelings from another human being why do


---------66:32----------
you assume that you know her feelings


---------66:35----------
like where does that thought come from


---------66:39----------
and I'm not telling you to abandon the


---------66:41----------
thought because it's illogical I'm


---------66:43----------
genuinely asking us I think it comes


---------66:44----------
from somewhere right that's like this is


---------66:46----------
where I'm not trying to prove you wrong


---------66:48----------
I'm trying to point out to you that you


---------66:50----------
have a strong belief that she does not


---------66:53----------
like you and that belief comes from


---------66:55----------
somewhere but it doesn't come from her


---------66:57----------
you see that like she you can't know


---------66:59----------
what's coming from her she can let you


---------67:02----------
know that she does like you but she may


---------67:04----------
like you and you may not be able to


---------67:06----------
detect it what do you think about that


---------67:17----------
yeah I can yeah I could see that so then


---------67:20----------
the question becomes if it's possible


---------67:22----------
for her to like you and you to not know


---------67:25----------
why don't you think about it that way


---------67:28----------
you don't think about it that way how do


---------67:31----------
you think about it when I tell you


---------67:34----------
Hayden


---------67:35----------
there's a chance that she liked you all


---------67:38----------
along what is the instinctive response


---------67:40----------
that you have to that statement


---------67:42----------
forget about logic just can't believe it


---------67:56----------
absolutely good right so like your


---------67:59----------
responses you're crazy man yeah


---------68:02----------
there's no way that's true right that's


---------68:06----------
what your responses you're like sure


---------68:09----------
logically it could be true but you


---------68:11----------
weren't there and you really don't know


---------68:13----------
it's impossible is that how you feel


---------68:17----------
it's impossible yeah


---------68:19----------
it's impossible that she could like you


---------68:25----------
yeah pretty much it okay so then yeah


---------68:31----------
that's the stuff oh not really


---------68:33----------
wait I'm not 100% but nowadays yeah


---------68:37----------
under cent yeah so then the question


---------68:41----------
becomes where did you start to believe


---------68:44----------
that you are unlikable that she couldn't


---------68:49----------
possibly be interested in you because


---------68:51----------
that's that's a belief right like that's


---------68:53----------
a belief you have about yourself that


---------68:55----------
there's no way that she could like you


---------68:58----------
yeah I just think I'm like insecure


---------69:00----------
where does that come from from from my


---------69:07----------
life remember it childhood growing up


---------69:12----------
just situations yeah okay so can can we


---------69:19----------
just think for a moment that like so


---------69:21----------
like even if what I say is like you so


---------69:23----------
you you have this firm belief that


---------69:25----------
someone like her can't like someone like


---------69:28----------
you you can get a five to like you


---------69:31----------
but you can't get it hate to like you


---------69:33----------
yeah right like that's what you think so


---------69:38----------
I think I'm not good enough


---------69:39----------
yep absolutely you know looks good in


---------69:42----------
looks too like you know yeah I mean sure


---------69:51----------
I mean you're not you know fine and and


---------69:56----------
so so my still my sense though is that


---------69:59----------
like so I think you made a couple of


---------70:01----------
mistakes here the first is that you


---------70:03----------
didn't share your feelings with her and


---------70:05----------
why didn't you do that because I didn't


---------70:09----------
think I was good enough yeah you see


---------70:13----------
that but the thing is like I know you


---------70:16----------
believe you're not good enough and I


---------70:18----------
think that's a fair belief but there's a


---------70:21----------
chance you're wrong


---------70:22----------
right like how do you know it's like


---------70:26----------
you're making a judgment for her about


---------70:29----------
whether you're good enough like you're


---------70:30----------
not actually letting her choose whether


---------70:32----------
you're good enough you're deciding for


---------70:33----------
her it's kind of like if you come over


---------70:36----------
and I'm baking a pie and then like


---------70:39----------
you're at my house and I like pull the


---------70:41----------
pie out of the oven and then I look at


---------70:45----------
the pie and I'm about to offer you piece


---------70:46----------
of pie but I'm like oh this pie is


---------70:48----------
like you may like that pie that pie may


---------70:51----------
be good but I'm I'm just I'm gonna make


---------70:52----------
that choice for you I'm gonna say this


---------70:53----------
pie is and I just throw it in the


---------70:55----------
trash and I don't even offer you a piece


---------70:58----------
because I I don't have confidence like I


---------71:01----------
just started baking pies a couple days


---------71:03----------
ago I follow recipes they're not very


---------71:05----------
good does that make sense


---------71:11----------
beautiful all right so the first thing


---------71:14----------
to understand is that in sell like what


---------71:16----------
I'm hearing from you is not that like


---------71:17----------
you're you know you don't need to be a


---------71:19----------
black guy because the problem isn't it


---------71:22----------
the problem is that you're not a black


---------71:23----------
guy the problem is that like you


---------71:25----------
fundamentally don't believe that you


---------71:27----------
don't act like you don't even give her a


---------71:28----------
chance man


---------71:30----------
and so the funny thing is that that


---------71:33----------
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy you


---------71:36----------
meet girl after girl after girl and you


---------71:37----------
don't give him a chance and you don't


---------71:39----------
give him a chance and you don't give him


---------71:40----------
a chance and then you wind up alone and


---------71:42----------
then you start to hate them as


---------71:44----------
the class but this is like this is like


---------71:49----------
I bake a pie you come over and I'm like


---------71:51----------
this pie is and then I throw it


---------71:53----------
away and then the next day you come over


---------71:55----------
and I'm baking another pie I pull that


---------71:57----------
out of the oven and I'm like this pie is



---------71:59----------
then I throw it away then the next day


---------72:01----------
you come over and I bake a third pie and


---------72:03----------
I say this is and then what happens


---------72:05----------
is that night when I'm lying in bed and


---------72:07----------
I'm like no one likes my pies it's


---------72:11----------
 this guy has come over three


---------72:13----------
times and I've not he's not told me he's


---------72:16----------
not giving me a single compliment about


---------72:18----------
my pie does that analogy fit or not yeah


---------72:24----------
but what do you do when she doesn't want


---------72:26----------
you put exactly like like hey like


---------72:30----------
what do I do like you don't want my


---------72:32----------
pie right yeah like you don't want my


---------72:36----------
 pie so I'm not gonna offer you a


---------72:38----------
piece because I know you don't want it


---------72:39----------
so I'm gonna throw it away and you're


---------72:40----------
gonna come over the next day I'm gonna


---------72:42----------
pull another one out of it I'm gonna


---------72:43----------
throw that one away like exactly what do


---------72:47----------
i do Hayden because you don't want my


---------72:49----------
 pie I don't know just how can I get


---------72:57----------
you to like my pie make it better


---------73:06----------
absolutely that's your strategy so day


---------73:09----------
number four rolls around I'm gonna make


---------73:11----------
it even better and I'm gonna pull it out


---------73:12----------
of the oven and I'm gonna say to myself


---------73:14----------
oh this is still it's not that much


---------73:17----------
better than yesterday I haven't changed


---------73:19----------
my recipe that much and you're gonna


---------73:21----------
come over you're gonna sit on my


---------73:22----------
countertop


---------73:23----------
you're gonna sit in my table I'm gonna


---------73:24----------
throw the pie away because it's not good


---------73:26----------
enough and then I'm gonna say tomorrow


---------73:28----------
it's gonna be better and then I'm gonna


---------73:30----------
make it better or I'm not gonna make it


---------73:32----------
better because like I'm a piece of


---------73:33----------
and I've made the best buy that I


---------73:34----------
possibly can and then I'm gonna I'm


---------73:37----------
gonna still tear my hair out because you


---------73:41----------
don't like my pie


---------73:46----------
how do I get you to like my pie Hayden


---------73:49----------
you make it better I've done that five


---------73:52----------
times six times I can't make it any


---------73:54----------
better you can't make yourself better


---------73:56----------
then you can't you just can't make them


---------74:00----------
like you pie okay in this scenario I


---------74:06----------
think the problem is that you've never


---------74:07----------
tasted my pie you get that you know if


---------74:12----------
you don't like if you don't taste it


---------74:13----------
exactly but am I ever offering you a


---------74:15----------
piece of pie maybe I haven't been clear


---------74:19----------
yeah no Dan I get it comes from it yeah


---------74:24----------
as you come over and what I do is I pull


---------74:27----------
the pie out of the oven I throw it


---------74:28----------
straight in the trash and then I say


---------74:33----------
okay Hayden I'll see you tomorrow and


---------74:35----------
then you come over the next day because


---------74:36----------
I want the pie to be perfect I want to


---------74:38----------
be perfect before I'm even gonna give


---------74:39----------
you a taste and then I get upset because


---------74:43----------
you don't like my pie but I've never


---------74:45----------
given you any pie to try what do you


---------74:49----------
think about that I mean I just think


---------74:53----------
what if you make a really good pun you


---------74:55----------
give it to them and they don't like it


---------74:57----------
what if right that's why I'm not giving


---------75:03----------
you the pie because I'm afraid that you


---------75:05----------
won't like it


---------75:05----------
and I want it to be good enough I want


---------75:08----------
to guarantee that you're gonna love the


---------75:09----------
pie I want it to be perfect because if


---------75:12----------
the pie is perfect and I give you a


---------75:14----------
piece then you can't say you don't like


---------75:16----------
it the only security that I need is a


---------75:21----------
guarantee that you're gonna love my pie


---------75:22----------
and until I get that I'm not willing to


---------75:25----------
give you a piece does that make sense


---------75:28----------
yeah


---------75:30----------
the only way you would share your


---------75:33----------
feelings with her is if you were sure


---------75:35----------
she felt the same way about you


---------75:39----------
right yeah


---------75:46----------
now that's that's a bit of a pickle why


---------75:53----------
is that what's the problem with that


---------75:55----------
Hayden well it's just it gets to try you


---------76:02----------
but absolutely so this is the other


---------76:08----------
thing is like you actually don't know


---------76:10----------
like you've ever had a girlfriend before


---------76:12----------
no so like are you a good boyfriend I've


---------76:19----------
known T is that how you feel


---------76:25----------
yeah kind of


---------76:27----------
so I imagine that you feel like you're


---------76:30----------
not a good boyfriend that you're not


---------76:32----------
good boyfriend material I don't think


---------76:34----------
that I would be surprised if that it's


---------76:36----------
really I don't know yeah yeah I think


---------76:47----------
it's reasonable to say I don't know


---------76:48----------
because you have no experience yeah no


---------76:52----------
experience I've nothing to base it off


---------76:54----------
right so you could be good or it could


---------76:56----------
be bad yeah pretty much right are you


---------77:00----------
gonna be great at it what do you think


---------77:09----------
I could be I could not oh yeah so I


---------77:15----------
think honestly hating the chances that


---------77:16----------
you're gonna be great at it or pretty


---------77:18----------
low yeah you know why I think that no


---------77:24----------
experience absolutely but I do think


---------77:29----------
that if you work at it you're gonna get


---------77:31----------
better


---------77:32----------
just like pub G yeah I kind of in a


---------77:37----------
mentality as well with I don't really


---------77:39----------
want a girlfriend until well beautiful


---------77:43----------
for me I don't need to hear I don't need


---------77:44----------
to hear anything else this is the


---------77:46----------
problem I don't want a girlfriend until


---------77:49----------
yeah I know what's after that is


---------77:54----------
irrelevant you see that the problem is


---------77:58----------
the word until I don't want you to taste


---------78:00----------
the pie until XYZ it makes sense so I


---------78:09----------
don't want a girlfriend until dot dot


---------78:11----------
dot so Hayden I think the reason you


---------78:13----------
don't have a girlfriend is because


---------78:14----------
you're not ready I'm not ready to let


---------78:23----------
you try my pie you see that it's not


---------78:26----------
like women is a race or not


---------78:30----------
discriminating against you because


---------78:31----------
you're black although that's a


---------78:33----------
comforting theory because then it


---------78:35----------
absolves you of responsibility you can


---------78:40----------
just hate them in the corner of your


---------78:42----------
home and like uh the world is a terrible


---------78:46----------
place because I'm not a black dude and


---------78:49----------
 those people and those people


---------78:51----------
and those people that's easy man


---------78:56----------
it's a very very comforting little world


---------79:00----------
you built for yourself right it's a safe


---------79:04----------
place because you don't have to put


---------79:06----------
yourself out there you don't have to get


---------79:07----------
hurt because if you never tell her how


---------79:11----------
you feel


---------79:12----------
she can't reject you but she can and she


---------79:15----------
does but like that's the thought that


---------79:19----------
you have right like if you tell her how


---------79:20----------
you feel like what happens if she


---------79:23----------
like the pie what happens if she says I


---------79:29----------
don't feel the same way about you I


---------79:31----------
don't know what happens after that


---------79:34----------
so never experience that is that how you


---------79:38----------
feel you're sounding way too rational to


---------79:42----------
me my friend I mean that's how I feel


---------79:44----------
yeah well that's good right because then


---------79:49----------
like if that's genuinely like if you're


---------79:51----------
genuinely like I really don't know what


---------79:53----------
happens after that


---------79:53----------
because what I was hypothesizing is like


---------79:56----------
the world comes tumbling down around you


---------79:58----------
like everything falls apart


---------80:00----------
and and now I'm projecting cuz like I


---------80:03----------
remember when I liked a girl there was


---------80:06----------
like there was a girl that I was like


---------80:08----------
really really into my freshman year and


---------80:11----------
we were friends and I never told her how


---------80:14----------
I feel felt because I was


---------80:16----------
terrified yeah I think if I would open


---------80:20----------
up it just feel like and she says no


---------80:22----------
just be like hey correct like saying


---------80:27----------
them correct about main Security's


---------80:29----------
absolutely so yeah very good right so


---------80:35----------
you have a fear that you're unlovable or


---------80:39----------
we'll never be able to find a girlfriend


---------80:41----------
and you will you will never risk that


---------80:45----------
being true to you and instead what


---------80:47----------
you're gonna do is never test that


---------80:49----------
hypothesis and by not ever testing it


---------80:52----------
you're going to reinforce it with each


---------80:55----------
girl that you meet it's a hypothesis


---------81:00----------
that's never put to the test but becomes


---------81:02----------
more and more fact it's weird


---------81:04----------
that's not how we handle hypotheses what


---------81:07----------
we do is we test them but here's the


---------81:10----------
problem with testing a hypothesis when I


---------81:12----------
have a hypothesis I don't know that it's


---------81:16----------
wrong when I test the hypothesis what


---------81:19----------
happens what do I put on the table


---------81:22----------
answers absolutely


---------81:28----------
that's what you're avoiding buddy you


---------81:31----------
see that which are terrified of is not


---------81:33----------
women it's answers you're afraid of what


---------81:41----------
it could show so now I've got a question


---------81:45----------
for you Hayden what are you gonna do


---------81:52----------
what do you want to do what do you wish


---------81:58----------
you could do I wish I could just know


---------82:02----------
give a good but you can't yeah what


---------82:12----------
do you wish what else do you wish you


---------82:14----------
could do anything else by not to give a


---------82:20----------
 do you mean not care about any of


---------82:21----------
this stuff or be willing to put answers


---------82:23----------
on the table like be willing to test


---------82:25----------
your hypotheses well but yeah yeah Birds


---------82:33----------
so very concretely now that you are


---------82:35----------
dealing this girl again you gonna tell


---------82:42----------
her anything well okay so can I help you


---------82:48----------
a little bit there yeah so when you know


---------82:52----------
I think you and probably most of twitch


---------82:54----------
at is thinking that what I want you to


---------82:56----------
do is tell her how you feel and that's


---------82:58----------
what I want you to do but I don't think


---------82:59----------
that's gonna look like what you think it


---------83:01----------
looks like so here's the conversation


---------83:04----------
that I think is gonna help you the most


---------83:06----------
and I think it's not gonna be quite as


---------83:08----------
terrifying is you you think I'd be


---------83:10----------
really surprised if you can accurately


---------83:11----------
predict what's gonna come out of my


---------83:12----------
mouth I'm gonna toss this out there okay


---------83:17----------
and I just want you to think about it


---------83:19----------
you don't have to do it so it's not tell


---------83:21----------
her hey I used to be in love with you


---------83:22----------
and I was obsessing about you for years


---------83:24----------
here watch this Twitter stream that's


---------83:27----------
not what I'm saying right so I think


---------83:29----------
this is the big thing it's like people


---------83:31----------
think like the other problem


---------83:32----------
Hayden is that your options of


---------83:35----------
communication with her or tell her


---------83:37----------
everything or tell her nothing that


---------83:40----------
needs to change


---------83:41----------
that's the thing that needs to change


---------83:42----------
the conversation that I think would help


---------83:45----------
you the most and not because it's gonna


---------83:47----------
get her to fall in love with you but


---------83:49----------
because it'll help you grow as a person


---------83:50----------
is hey our friendship meant a lot to me


---------83:54----------
and I was hoping to have like a


---------83:56----------
conversation with you about it and I


---------83:58----------
realize now that I had some feelings for


---------84:01----------
you that were like more than friendship


---------84:02----------
and I was hoping we could just kind of


---------84:04----------
talk that through and then you tell her


---------84:10----------
because now you're in a safe place


---------84:11----------
because you're not in love with her


---------84:12----------
anymore right there is still feeling


---------84:17----------
that changes everything I'm gonna assume


---------84:20----------
for a moment that you're not in love


---------84:21----------
with her because if you're not in love


---------84:22----------
with her then like you don't it's not


---------84:24----------
doesn't matter if she likes your pyre


---------84:25----------
doesn't like your pie yeah I think the


---------84:27----------
conversation you need to have with her


---------84:29----------
is like hey you know I've always thought


---------84:30----------
you're gorgeous and I I value our


---------84:33----------
friendship but I also had some feelings


---------84:34----------
with you for you and then there was one


---------84:38----------
thing that happened we had plans and I


---------84:39----------
felt like you blew me off and that was


---------84:41----------
very hurtful and and so then like I know


---------84:45----------
we've kind of been out of contact and I


---------84:47----------
realize now that that was because like


---------84:48----------
it hurt me when you did that I felt like


---------84:51----------
I wasn't important to you and you were


---------84:54----------
important to me what do you think about


---------84:58----------
that conversation


---------85:05----------
I'll just think yeah I've had that


---------85:08----------
conversation in my head before they I've


---------85:12----------
had sure conversation of flake


---------85:14----------
confessing this no I'm not talking about


---------85:17----------
confessing that's not confessing your


---------85:20----------
love are you hearing that is what I'm


---------85:23----------
saying that's not what I'm saying


---------85:28----------
what do you say I'm gonna say it again I


---------85:31----------
want you to have a conversation about


---------85:35----------
your mixed feelings about her isn't it


---------85:40----------
confessing no because confessing is


---------85:42----------
confessing your love to her it's


---------85:44----------
confessing a unit dimensional feeling my


---------85:47----------
feeling my mixed feelings yes so you say


---------85:50----------
listen to what I'm saying so like Hayden


---------85:53----------
I value it like so you know I've always


---------85:57----------
thought you're gorgeous and I value our


---------86:00----------
friendship and I really like hanging out


---------86:02----------
with you and I enjoyed like you know


---------86:03----------
just being friends with you and I also


---------86:06----------
noticed that like over time I started to


---------86:09----------
have some romantic feelings towards you


---------86:10----------
and I don't know exactly what happened


---------86:14----------
there but at some point you know there


---------86:16----------
was this one plate time where we had


---------86:17----------
plants like go hang out and then you


---------86:19----------
kind of forgot about him and you you


---------86:22----------
know I felt like you sort of didn't


---------86:25----------
value me like I you know I was just


---------86:27----------
disappointed and hurt when you kind of


---------86:30----------
cancel plans and it took me some time to


---------86:32----------
sort of figure that out I'm glad we're


---------86:35----------
talking again I just wanted to share


---------86:38----------
some of those thoughts or feelings with


---------86:40----------
you and like see kind of what you think


---------86:44----------
what are you hearing there are you


---------86:46----------
hearing I I mean yeah I'm just thinking


---------86:50----------
about it what does that fit what does


---------86:54----------
that sound what does that sound like to


---------86:56----------
you


---------86:56----------
that sound like a confession of love


---------87:01----------
saying that you have mixed feelings to


---------87:05----------
me it's like a confession okay


---------87:09----------
how so cuz you're telling them that you


---------87:14----------
have mixed feelings so that's sure let's


---------87:16----------
see yeah but you're confessing what are


---------87:22----------
you confessing to them that you have


---------87:24----------
mixed feelings that's it or that you had


---------87:26----------
mixed feelings you can even put it in


---------87:27----------
the past tense


---------87:29----------
yeah like that you have some feelings


---------87:33----------
but like you want to share the mixed


---------87:34----------
feelings right because then what you


---------87:36----------
want to do with the beauty of this


---------87:38----------
conversation she can go either way


---------87:41----------
she can say yeah your friendship matters


---------87:43----------
to me too and I don't have romantic


---------87:46----------
feelings for you and then you cry or but


---------87:52----------
you'd be surprised or if she says by the


---------87:56----------
way I sort of have mixed feelings for


---------87:57----------
you too and then the interesting thing


---------88:01----------
there is that you're gonna want to go to


---------88:02----------
like one of two places either you're


---------88:04----------
wanting you're gonna want to jump for


---------88:06----------
joy or you're gonna want to be


---------88:07----------
completely crushed I don't want you to


---------88:08----------
do either of those I want you to sit in


---------88:10----------
the blend right and then you guys have


---------88:14----------
another conversation about it do you


---------88:16----------
want to just be friends or do you want


---------88:18----------
to try to like try to date and you talk


---------88:22----------
it through with her so the problem here


---------88:26----------
Hayden is that you're making all of


---------88:27----------
these decisions and shouldering all of


---------88:29----------
the responsibility for y'all's


---------88:32----------
relationship you're holding all of it do


---------88:34----------
you see that she like doesn't get to


---------88:36----------
play a role you're dealing with an NPC


---------88:38----------
not a party member it makes sense so I


---------88:45----------
think what you've got to do is like let


---------88:47----------
her have some agency in this


---------88:49----------
relationship and give her a chance to


---------88:52----------
voice your feelings and by the way you


---------88:55----------
know when we're talking about like


---------88:56----------
things that women are looking for it I


---------88:59----------
know a lot of people have perceptions


---------89:01----------
that it's money or looks or other kinds


---------89:05----------
of things but I would say 90% of


---------89:09----------
successful relationships that I've seen


---------89:11----------
have men who are emotionally available


---------89:15----------
this is a concept that in cells in red I


---------89:18----------
think red pillars don't understand they


---------89:20----------
think it's bata behavior it's not baby


---------89:23----------
do you even know what emotional


---------89:25----------
availability is no not really


---------89:31----------
okay so like what I talked about the


---------89:34----------
conversation that I just gave to you is


---------89:36----------
emotional availability it's the ability


---------89:38----------
to like think like a woman basically and


---------89:42----------
sort of like think like not in terms of


---------89:44----------
black and white but in shades of grey


---------89:46----------
that relationships are complicated and


---------89:49----------
nuanced things where like there's shared


---------89:50----------
decision-making it's not like alpha and


---------89:53----------
beta it's not like you you trick her


---------89:55----------
into sleeping with you or you make her


---------89:57----------
sleep with you there's like no agency


---------90:00----------
it's all like you're it's like you're


---------90:01----------
interacting with the Insull red pill


---------90:03----------
community as best as I understand it


---------90:05----------
which I'm not an expert by any means so


---------90:07----------
someone does understand it better please


---------90:08----------
explain it to me it's almost like they


---------90:10----------
treat women like NPCs like they don't


---------90:14----------
acknowledge that there is like a


---------90:15----------
thinking feeling person there that can


---------90:17----------
make their own choices and you accept


---------90:19----------
all of the responsibilities about


---------90:21----------
whether she's gonna like like this is


---------90:23----------
the thing you gotta understand man you


---------90:26----------
can bake a perfect pie and someone can


---------90:28----------
not like it you can bake an imperfect


---------90:30----------
pie and someone can love it because


---------90:31----------
there's no such thing as a perfect pie


---------90:34----------
right if I'm baking an apple pie


---------90:37----------
some people like it's sweeter some


---------90:39----------
people like it more sour like people


---------90:42----------
have individual preferences and you're


---------90:44----------
not even letting her choose okay it


---------90:50----------
makes sense so the next part if there's


---------90:53----------
gonna be a part two and this is where I


---------90:55----------
encourage you to think a little bit and


---------90:57----------
I'll you know I'll give you a chance to


---------90:58----------
ask questions and stuff but my next


---------91:01----------
question to you is like where did you


---------91:02----------
lose your confidence because this whole


---------91:05----------
insel thing is gonna come tumbling down


---------91:07----------
because like I hope you see this it


---------91:09----------
starts with the basic idea that you


---------91:11----------
presume she's gonna say no it starts


---------91:14----------
with the basic idea that your pie is not


---------91:16----------
good enough that's not a testable


---------91:17----------
hypothesis it's a belief you have faith


---------91:20----------
that she's gonna say no so where does


---------91:25----------
that come from


---------91:29----------
uh I think it just comes from me like


---------91:33----------
being insecure


---------91:35----------
so that's hating myself that's that's


---------91:39----------
what it is that's not where it comes


---------91:40----------
from where it comes from is not people


---------91:44----------
telling me and then like a just not


---------91:50----------
being like successful sure with women


---------91:55----------
yeah so the other thing is that anytime


---------91:57----------
you go through the cycle it's going to


---------92:00----------
make that believe stronger in your mind


---------92:02----------
do you see that yeah but the other


---------92:05----------
interesting thing is that if this is a


---------92:07----------
belief in your mind that is dictating


---------92:09----------
your relationships


---------92:10----------
it also means like that's just a belief


---------92:11----------
you get that that doesn't actually mean


---------92:13----------
it's true like if the belief can


---------92:16----------
strengthen it doesn't mean it's truth


---------92:18----------
and if it comes from people telling you


---------92:20----------
that you're a piece of when you


---------92:21----------
were growing up like that doesn't


---------92:23----------
actually mean you're a piece of it


---------92:24----------
just means that you've been convinced


---------92:26----------
that you're a piece of there's hope


---------92:28----------
because if you can dismantle that belief


---------92:31----------
I think all this is gonna come


---------92:32----------
tumbling down and you'll find yourself


---------92:36----------
with a girlfriend because I think like


---------92:38----------
you said at the beginning Hayden you


---------92:39----------
were a moderately attractive guy who


---------92:40----------
sounds like he's funny


---------92:44----------
and can you land an 8 maybe maybe not


---------92:49----------
you absolutely can by the way thanks but


---------92:55----------
I think your bigger problem is that


---------92:56----------
you're not willing to consider a 5 right


---------93:00----------
that is ego like you have this


---------93:05----------
perception that you want this thing in


---------93:06----------
like in the same way that you want her


---------93:08----------
to notice what's right in front of your


---------93:10----------
eyes omma hypocrite Yeah right but I


---------93:16----------
know that good I'm all ready yeah yeah


---------93:21----------
and it's it's not just you right so like


---------93:22----------
I saw this really interesting like psych


---------93:26----------
psychology article about like you know


---------93:28----------
like there's the there are obese and


---------93:32----------
overweight especially like women like


---------93:34----------
this is I mean I could be wrong


---------93:35----------
statistically about this but my


---------93:37----------
perception is it's women who like want


---------93:39----------
people to be like accepting of all bod


---------93:41----------
types so they'll post about like you


---------93:43----------
know there's no such thing as fat and


---------93:45----------
they'll be like overweight and it's


---------93:46----------
usually women these social media has led


---------93:49----------
me to believe that the paper that I


---------93:50----------
looked at was looking for nominally


---------93:52----------
women and the funny thing is that like


---------93:55----------
people who women who want men to accept


---------93:58----------
them for being overweight and treat them


---------94:01----------
the same as someone who's not overweight


---------94:02----------
are not willing to date overweight men


---------94:08----------
so that's common we're all like that I


---------94:11----------
think it's all ego questions why is it a


---------94:23----------
problem that I have a writing of high


---------94:27----------
standards because I think your standards


---------94:31----------
are unidirectional but they're not


---------94:36----------
complicated enough because I think your


---------94:38----------
standards don't lead to happy


---------94:39----------
relationships which is what I think you


---------94:41----------
really want someone's physical


---------94:43----------
attractiveness is in my experience is


---------94:50----------
not one of the most important parts of a


---------94:53----------
healthy relationship so is it important


---------94:58----------
absolutely I'm not saying that you


---------94:59----------
shouldn't be attractive to other people


---------95:02----------
I mean you shouldn't change who you're


---------95:05----------
attracted to what I'm saying is that


---------95:06----------
like I think you have a false standard


---------95:08----------
of what you're looking for that's fueled


---------95:11----------
by your ego which comes from all this


---------95:13----------
kind of complex I mean yeah like like


---------95:21----------
ticket oh yeah exactly I think it's a


---------95:25----------
fantasy and I think that if you know so


---------95:27----------
like here's that here's what I've


---------95:28----------
observed okay Hayden and this is


---------95:29----------
something that you have to experiment


---------95:30----------
with yeah so I I see possibilities in


---------95:34----------
your life where you remain happy or you


---------95:37----------
become happy or you remain alone and sad


---------95:39----------
and I think the likelihood that you end


---------95:41----------
up being happy in life is greater if


---------95:44----------
you're willing to consider someone under


---------95:46----------
1/8 I'm not saying don't have high


---------95:50----------
standards I'm saying expand the scope of


---------95:53----------
your standards beyond physical


---------95:55----------
Tractatus so I think the average of all


---------96:01----------
of her qualities should be greater than


---------96:03----------
an eighth but I think someone who makes


---------96:07----------
you feel like you're not a piece of


---------96:09----------
is worth way more than how much how


---------96:12----------
attractive she is if there was a 10 out


---------96:17----------
of 10 that made you feel like a piece of


---------96:19----------
 and abuse you but also let you


---------96:24----------
her from time to time I do not like that


---------96:26----------
as a good relationship for you yeah


---------96:29----------
right but like there's the bottom would


---------96:35----------
ya no but like would I still now what I


---------96:40----------
still care about her like I'll just be


---------96:43----------
in a six so yeah you'll be whipped then


---------96:46----------
you'd be a beta wit yeah you'd be a bear


---------96:51----------
that's then you'd be a back then I mean


---------96:57----------
when like just get those hot


---------96:59----------
chick thoroughly absolutely and the


---------97:02----------
camera as well know you'd care a lot


---------97:04----------
because she'd be other people


---------97:05----------
too and she'd make you feel like


---------97:08----------
maybe she wouldn't be other


---------97:10----------
people but I think like like healthy


---------97:12----------
relationships where people feel valued


---------97:14----------
and appreciated and supportive that


---------97:17----------
doesn't necessarily have to do with


---------97:19----------
physical attractiveness right and I


---------97:21----------
think what you want what you really want


---------97:22----------
Hayden is not to just a hot chick I


---------97:25----------
think you want someone to love you back


---------97:27----------
that's what I think you want more than


---------97:29----------
anything else I think you want someone


---------97:33----------
who takes away that feeling that you are


---------97:35----------
a piece of and unlovable and


---------97:37----------
unattractive I think more than now I


---------97:41----------
can't use the f-bomb but okay okay pee


---------97:48----------
wees there okay


---------97:49----------
Thank You lovey


---------97:54----------
okay I'm just gonna have to remain


---------97:58----------
silent cuz I can't talk about this


---------98:00----------
before anyway okay so I think what'll be


---------98:10----------
more satisfying let me put it this way


---------98:13----------
Hayden I think you may disagree with


---------98:16----------
this but I just want you to think about


---------98:17----------
this well what you're gonna find more


---------98:20----------
satisfying than a hot chick I


---------98:22----------
think is having a check who's moderately


---------98:25----------
attractive who wants to you yeah


---------98:39----------
we get so caught up about wearing to


---------98:42----------
 hot chicks but what like makes us


---------98:45----------
feel good is to like have someone come


---------98:47----------
over it's not that like my pie is the


---------98:51----------
best like what you want is someone who


---------98:53----------
wants your pie right like you want


---------98:57----------
someone who's gonna come up to you and


---------98:58----------
appreciate you for who you are and like


---------99:00----------
want you as a person they want to be


---------99:02----------
with you you don't have to convince them


---------99:05----------
to be with you you don't have to worry


---------99:06----------
about them being with you they want to


---------99:09----------
be with you that's what you want more


---------99:10----------
than anything else and if you have a


---------99:13----------
certain standard of attractiveness like


---------99:14----------
I think that's okay if you want to end


---------99:18----------
up only dating eights out of eight out


---------99:20----------
of tens like I think that's fine too


---------99:21----------
like you can choose how you live your


---------99:24----------
life but I don't think you're gonna be


---------99:26----------
happy and it makes sense dots are


---------99:34----------
questions before we wrap up


---------99:41----------
utterly I don't know if I get anything


---------99:48----------
from this like I believe everything you


---------99:52----------
say but like I watch your other videos


---------99:54----------
but please never like I guess all I can


---------100:00----------
do is acknowledge it yep


---------100:02----------
I think you only perception of what you


---------100:07----------
get out of this is going to be very poor


---------100:09----------
I think my perception I don't think


---------100:12----------
we've you haven't had you haven't broken


---------100:14----------
down crying right that's what people


---------100:17----------
think that like Oh to get something out


---------100:19----------
of this you have to break down crying no


---------100:20----------
I think what can you get have a minute


---------100:25----------
yeah really so hey let me be very clear


---------100:28----------
what you get out of this is what you do


---------100:30----------
with the thoughts and reflections that


---------100:34----------
we've come up in here with in here


---------100:36----------
because in order to make change it's not


---------100:38----------
going to come from a conversation it's


---------100:40----------
gonna come from offering the imperfect


---------100:42----------
piece of pie to someone that's what you


---------100:46----------
like no amount of talking to me is ever


---------100:50----------
going to be a substitute for that you


---------100:52----------
understand that


---------100:53----------
like the progress that you need is not


---------100:55----------
going to come from me man


---------100:56----------
how do I be okay if my pie that's a


---------101:02----------
good question so I think we may have to


---------101:03----------
have a part two at some point but let me


---------101:05----------
start here so we're gonna do a little


---------101:07----------
bit of meditation sit up straight


---------101:11----------
close your eyes and feel yourself for a


---------101:17----------
second where is your pie in my


---------101:26----------
anxiety where is that feeling in my


---------101:30----------
chest okay what does it feel like


---------101:41----------
nervous just tightness tightness in your


---------101:45----------
chest right sweating quick baiting Oh


---------101:50----------
sweating in what my house just beating


---------101:53----------
quick quick quick beating art okay so


---------101:56----------
this is the pie right this is what


---------101:58----------
you're saying


---------101:59----------
so now let me ask you Hayden if these


---------102:02----------
feelings were to reduce does that make


---------102:04----------
your pie less shitty uh kind of thing to


---------102:12----------
Stu insecurities sure I didn't say does


---------102:15----------
it make it go away I said does it make


---------102:17----------
it less shitty dear okay so listen let's


---------102:21----------
start there right so this is you're


---------102:23----------
saying how do I get rid of the pie


---------102:24----------
and the answer is it takes time and


---------102:26----------
effort it doesn't happen through one


---------102:28----------
conversation so I think you need to


---------102:31----------
start thinking back to where you started


---------102:34----------
to form these beliefs I think seeing a


---------102:35----------
therapist is a great idea or see one of


---------102:38----------
our coaches they can help you with this


---------102:39----------
kind of thing as soon as they're


---------102:40----------
available to help you with this kind of


---------102:42----------
thing yeah and and right now I want you


---------102:47----------
to just notice those feelings and I want


---------102:49----------
you to breathe into them so put your


---------102:50----------
head up straight neck up straight good


---------102:53----------
there we go


---------102:56----------
relax your shoulders don't hunched over


---------103:02----------
so I want you to are you leaning against


---------103:04----------
the back of the chair too so I want you


---------103:07----------
to sit forward away from the back of the


---------103:09----------
chair


---------103:10----------
yep how tall are you


---------103:15----------
5:11 okay so okay so can you raise your


---------103:21----------
chair a little bit look do you have


---------103:26----------
anybody can sit on no no I I don't want


---------103:29----------
to you know move I when we I wanted to


---------103:30----------
affect your posture not your camera oh


---------103:32----------
yeah I can sit on my pillow like Miss


---------103:34----------
Jones yeah


---------103:35----------
sit on your pillow like Mitch Jones you


---------103:53----------
look like you're hunched are you hunched


---------103:54----------
there we go there it is issue number one


---------103:59----------
you're not gonna be confident if you're


---------104:01----------
sitting like you were sitting before


---------104:04----------
that is the posture of a beta who is


---------104:07----------
insecure how do you feel now I feel like


---------104:15----------
sitting up straight there you go so


---------104:18----------
you're a whole life Haydon you have not


---------104:21----------
been sitting up straight you haven't


---------104:25----------
actually been sitting the way that you


---------104:27----------
really are you've been sitting over


---------104:29----------
hunched smaller than you truly are how


---------104:34----------
does it feel to sit up straight


---------104:42----------
just feels like I'm sitting up straight


---------104:48----------
that I don't have any feelings related


---------104:51----------
to sit up shy okay fine so what's


---------104:54----------
happening in your chest


---------104:55----------
uh I'm just puffing it out okay uh-huh


---------105:01----------
what's your anxiety same same feelings


---------105:03----------
okay so I want you to notice that those


---------105:07----------
feelings are sort of like operating in a


---------105:09----------
different space there's more space in


---------105:11----------
there now can you feel that yeah yeah I


---------105:13----------
can feel it so if there's more space has


---------105:17----------
the anxiety grown or is it sort of just


---------105:19----------
occupying like a portion in the middle


---------105:27----------
it's stayed the same but so is there


---------105:32----------
space around the anxiety that is not


---------105:35----------
anxiety in your chest


---------105:36----------
I think it's filling up because I'm


---------105:39----------
thinking about it good let him so know


---------105:42----------
watch it filling you up sit up straight


---------105:46----------
there we go see as you fill up you start


---------105:51----------
to hunch down so keep yourself straight


---------105:54----------
if you need to now what I want you to do


---------105:56----------
is pick up your pillow and fold it in


---------105:58----------
half and then sit on it there we go


---------106:14----------
eyes closed


---------106:17----------
now what I want you to do is to breathe


---------106:19----------
into your chest and expand it maximal


---------106:25----------
breath hold that feel that tension and


---------106:28----------
then relax let your spine remain erect


---------106:33----------
your shoulders can relax but your spine


---------106:36----------
should stay straight there we go


---------106:38----------

---------106:40----------

---------106:56----------

---------107:04----------

that feeling of idiocy I can't okay


---------111:24----------
breathe through it four more breaths sit


---------111:28----------
up straight


---------111:29----------
expand your chest


---------111:39----------
we're gonna throw you another curveball


---------111:41----------
I want you to try to ignore what I'm


---------111:44----------
saying listen to what I'm saying


---------111:46----------
notice the thoughts and feelings it


---------111:48----------
evokes and then go back to your breath


---------111:50----------
now you're sitting like a Chad now


---------111:53----------
you're sitting like an alpha I'm gonna


---------112:00----------
troll you harder and harder buddy


---------112:01----------
just 12 breathe through it


---------112:10----------
see you were you ready for the next one


---------112:13----------
so you thought the bad part about this


---------112:16----------
twitch stream was your friends watching


---------112:17----------
the bad part is when I asked you to


---------112:19----------
meditate and then make it really really


---------112:21----------
hard for you


---------112:24----------
sit up straight three breaths focus on


---------112:31----------
that contraction in your throat


---------112:34----------
beautiful and then out


---------112:43----------
now three more breaths count to seven


---------112:45----------
for the inhalation and seven for the


---------112:47----------
exhalation


---------113:21----------
beautiful


---------113:23----------
now if you're done now just notice what


---------113:26----------
you feel


---------113:34----------
the anxieties there the embarrassment


---------113:38----------
the embarrassment is there so so now


---------113:54----------
Hayden I'm going to ask you a couple of


---------113:56----------
last questions so your question to me


---------113:59----------
was how do you do things if you're if


---------114:03----------
you believe your pipe tastes like


---------114:05----------
so did you feel anxiety today yeah did


---------114:09----------
you feel embarrassment today yeah did


---------114:12----------
you feel like you were doing a bad job


---------114:15----------
yeah how did you do this then


---------114:25----------
I'm confused I thought that if you felt


---------114:29----------
those negative things you couldn't do


---------114:31----------
things right that's what you're telling


---------114:36----------
me you're saying I have these feelings


---------114:38----------
how do I act but just now you had a


---------114:42----------
bunch of feelings and I didn't make it


---------114:43----------
easier on you just rolling you the


---------114:47----------
entire time making you look like more


---------114:49----------
and more of an idiot how did you do this


---------115:03----------
I just did Oh hmm so I think your answer


---------115:10----------
to your question now you've done it once


---------115:14----------
I'm gonna leave it up to you to reflect


---------115:16----------
and figure out what you did today


---------115:19----------
because you came on the stream in front


---------115:21----------
of thousands of people and aired the


---------115:23----------
dirtiest most shameful parts of your


---------115:26----------
inner being and you opened up you cut


---------115:29----------
open your pie and you showed people all


---------115:31----------
of the inside alive in front of


---------115:36----------
thousands of people how did you do that


---------115:46----------
it wasn't easy but Edie tell you just


---------115:49----------
had the idea yeah you're damn right it


---------115:52----------
wasn't easy that's why it's valuable


---------115:54----------
because if this was easy then you


---------115:56----------
couldn't like that doesn't help you man


---------115:58----------
why do you think I was making it harder


---------116:00----------
for you it's because like we want to


---------116:05----------
make it harder for you we don't want to


---------116:07----------
make your life easy because you're you


---------116:08----------
what you're dealing with is not easy


---------116:10----------
it's hard so we have to train you to do


---------116:13----------
things in spite of your emotions that


---------116:15----------
are difficult and you've done it you've


---------116:20----------
done it once how did you do it I'm not


---------116:22----------
even sure all I know is that this seems


---------116:25----------
to work I don't know how this works I


---------116:27----------
just know that does in something about


---------116:30----------
people who so this is the thing hey do


---------116:33----------
you part of it is getting to the root of


---------116:35----------
why you feel this way in dispensing with


---------116:37----------
that the other half of that is not


---------116:39----------
bothering with the root but just


---------116:41----------
accepting that like your pie is kind of


---------116:43----------
shitty you can have negative emotions


---------116:46----------
but don't let them paralyze you because


---------116:48----------
they don't actually control you and then


---------116:54----------
the more you understand and reflect upon


---------116:56----------
what happened here today that dr. K like


---------117:00----------
he didn't teach you meditation he


---------117:02----------
trolled you during meditation and then


---------117:04----------
trolled you harder and harder and harder


---------117:06----------
and harder and harder and yet you did it


---------117:12----------
so how does that work I don't know but


---------117:15----------
something tells me that if you can


---------117:16----------
understand what happened here today


---------117:18----------
you'll have the answer to your question


---------117:20----------
now remind me again who's got questions


---------117:23----------
and who's got answers you ask me a


---------117:25----------
question who's got the answer me


---------117:28----------

all right boys and girls


---------118:38----------
okay so okay awesome so what we're gonna


---------118:45----------
do


---------118:46----------
let me see if we want to do our late


---------118:54----------
yo do we have time for two questions do


---------119:01----------
we have time for two questions yeah


---------119:04----------
awesome let's do it oh yeah can you hear


---------119:14----------
me look hey what's up man hey how's it


---------119:18----------
going good um first off I just want to


---------119:22----------
say how much I appreciate the work


---------119:24----------
you're doing you're addressing a problem


---------119:26----------
within a community that probably needs


---------119:27----------
it the most right now in this day and


---------119:29----------
age but uh so my question is that I was


---------119:33----------
wondering if you had any advice for


---------119:35----------
someone with low self-worth and how to


---------119:38----------
stop comparing yourself to others yeah


---------119:41----------
so um I think yeah so I think like I was


---------119:46----------
kind of telling Haden there are two


---------119:48----------
pieces to that right one is that you


---------119:52----------
have to understand where this low


---------119:54----------
self-worth comes from so like when did


---------119:57----------
you start to believe that you're like


---------120:00----------
not a good person and if you can go back


---------120:03----------
to the source like when like so think


---------120:06----------
about when you feel ashamed about


---------120:08----------
yourself so I'm just tossing out the


---------120:09----------
word ashamed and what am i calling you


---------120:10----------
buddy uh an oral integral okay so


---------120:14----------
integral when you think about like when


---------120:16----------
you feel that shame or you find yourself


---------120:18----------
comparing and then you fall short right


---------120:21----------
because when you compare you fall short


---------120:22----------
of other people yeah and I guess that's


---------120:28----------
why I have trouble sort of approaching


---------120:31----------
other girls or you know I'll start


---------120:34----------
talking to them and then I'll just stop


---------120:36----------
because I feel like they're gonna be


---------120:37----------
disappointed in me yeah so the first


---------120:40----------
question is when was the first time you


---------120:43----------
felt that feeling


---------120:48----------
I couldn't give you a time but it's just


---------120:51----------
basically when I I don't want to give


---------120:54----------
you the whole spiel but it's basically


---------120:56----------
when I started behaving and and


---------120:59----------
observing that I'm acting just like my


---------121:03----------
father does and he's just somebody I


---------121:05----------
really don't want to be look okay so I


---------121:10----------
think like your journey actually starts


---------121:14----------
with like something it sounds like it


---------121:15----------
starts with something around your father


---------121:17----------
right so I encourage you to actually


---------121:18----------
reflect and and sort of think a little


---------121:23----------
bit about did he make you feel a certain


---------121:25----------
way did you watch him and feel a certain


---------121:28----------
way and you really have to like dig in


---------121:30----------
to that kind of stuff and I've got to


---------121:33----------
think a little bit about how to better


---------121:35----------
help you guys structure those


---------121:36----------
explorations and the second thing is to


---------121:41----------
just recognize the comparison right and


---------121:44----------
when you when you're doing the


---------121:45----------
comparison like just like what what we


---------121:47----------
were doing with with Hayden you can have


---------121:50----------
feelings and generally speaking those


---------121:52----------
feelings control you but you can also


---------121:55----------
have like you can though they don't have


---------121:57----------
to but we kind of feel like they do and


---------122:01----------
people don't understand that your


---------122:03----------
feelings don't have to control you until


---------122:05----------
you start the process of not letting


---------122:08----------
them control you and that happens in


---------122:10----------
little little ways right so so if you're


---------122:13----------
trying to talk to a girl and you find


---------122:15----------
yourself like comparing yourself to


---------122:17----------
other people in your head and saying oh


---------122:19----------
this girl's not gonna like me because


---------122:21----------
I'm not so and so so you have to start


---------122:25----------
by finding the the lowest value


---------122:27----------
comparison so forget about girls but


---------122:30----------
it's like maybe it's something like I'm


---------122:32----------
gonna smile at the person at the grocery


---------122:35----------
store and then there's gonna be a small


---------122:38----------
part of your in your voice that's in


---------122:40----------
your head that's gonna be like a voice


---------122:42----------
that's like oh you're gonna look dumb if


---------122:44----------
you smile at people and so you notice


---------122:47----------
that but the question is can you get


---------122:48----------
away with it


---------122:49----------
despite the voice telling you that


---------122:52----------
you're gonna look dumb can you do it


---------122:53----------
anyway because right now there's a power


---------122:56----------
struggle between you and that voice and


---------122:58----------
right now that voice is winning


---------123:00----------
so the way you start to win against the


---------123:02----------
voice as you take the battles that you


---------123:04----------
can write you're fighting a war against


---------123:06----------
an opponent who's far stronger than you


---------123:08----------
you are so you don't face them in battle


---------123:11----------
like in an open field and get run over


---------123:13----------
because that's forcing yourself to ask a


---------123:15----------
girl out that's gonna end terribly you


---------123:17----------
take you do guerrilla warfare so what


---------123:20----------
are the small battles that you can fight


---------123:22----------
against the voice that you can actually


---------123:23----------
win and I'd start with something as


---------123:25----------
simple as do you smile at people when


---------123:27----------
you see them well it's it's super


---------123:32----------
insightful again it's just like I never


---------123:34----------
think about that kind of thing but um


---------123:36----------
thank you so much


---------123:38----------
what for answering what the I asked you


---------123:40----------
a question do you not really I mean like


---------123:48----------
occasionally once in a while but it's


---------123:51----------
like so literally integral you should


---------123:56----------
start by smiling at people and every


---------124:00----------
time you do that you're gonna run a


---------124:02----------
little experiment in your head like when


---------124:05----------
I tell you like the next person like


---------124:06----------
who's the neck I know it's Kovac but


---------124:08----------
who's the next person you're gonna see


---------124:14----------
besides my parents probably who said


---------124:18----------
that you can't smile it not sight and


---------124:20----------
besides onion do you smile at your


---------124:21----------
parents ah barely I mean okay yeah I bet


---------124:26----------
occasionally yeah you know they they


---------124:29----------
tell me something but it's it's not like


---------124:30----------
a regular thing you know absolutely


---------124:33----------
that's why it's important the goal here


---------124:36----------
is to get you to do things that you


---------124:37----------
don't normally do not do things that are


---------124:39----------
regular things for you right right so


---------124:44----------
start by smiling at your parents it's


---------124:48----------
gonna be feel weird you right


---------124:51----------
we're on the same page about that but


---------124:54----------
that's why you've got to do it okay try


---------124:59----------
practice on them and then you'll see a


---------125:02----------
stranger and then you can practice on


---------125:04----------
that so you are practicing the skill you


---------125:06----------
are leveling up the ability you're


---------125:08----------
leveling up your emotion resistance


---------125:12----------
that's what this is you guys got a


---------125:14----------
resistant to your emotions and act


---------125:16----------
anyway right it gives you like an attack


---------125:19----------
penalty but you don't stop swinging just


---------125:21----------
because you've got an attack penalty you


---------125:23----------
gotta still take the swing you're gonna


---------125:25----------
miss because you have an attack penalty


---------125:27----------
fine build up your emotional resistance


---------125:30----------
your attack penalty will decrease and


---------125:33----------
you'll start hitting hitting things


---------125:35----------
hopefully women like isn't sexually not


---------125:41----------
like physically abuse okay I'm gonna


---------125:51----------
stop before I get bad all right thank


---------125:55----------
you so much take care dude


---------126:05----------
okay who's next who's next


---------126:10----------
wait one one more two more one more okay


---------126:14----------
then I have a question hold on


---------126:16----------
it's Randolph from the discord asks


---------126:19----------
could you ask dr. K how he met his wife


---------126:21----------
if he's struggling with it or maybe it


---------126:24----------
was arranged that would be interesting


---------126:26----------
to hear yeah so it was not arranged I'm


---------126:30----------
happy to say so I met my wife at summer


---------126:32----------
camp and so like I had some interesting


---------126:34----------
armor so I really lucked out so I met my


---------126:36----------
wife at summer camp so I went to India


---------126:38----------
for like three months and towards the


---------126:41----------
end of the that time I came back to the


---------126:43----------
US and I went to this like Hindu summer


---------126:46----------
camp basically where I was gonna teach a


---------126:49----------
lot because I had learned all this stuff


---------126:50----------
and you know in the old country so and I


---------126:54----------
decided to become a monk and so the cool


---------126:57----------
thing that so then I'd her and and she


---------127:00----------
was a counselor at the camp I was a


---------127:01----------
counselor at the camp you know I was


---------127:04----------
teaching all this wonderful knowledge I


---------127:05----------
had about meditation that I've learned


---------127:07----------
in these ashrams in these remote areas


---------127:09----------
of India and everyone was like oh right


---------127:12----------
because they're a bunch of like


---------127:13----------
second-generation Indian kids at this


---------127:16----------
camp and so the interesting thing is I


---------127:18----------
think I kind of got lucky because in my


---------127:21----------
mind like I had taken a relationship off


---------127:23----------
of the table and so what I struggled


---------127:26----------
with is like I thought like I cared


---------127:28----------
about what women thought when I talked


---------127:30----------
to them so I had trouble being me


---------127:33----------
because I tried to be someone who was


---------127:35----------
not me to get them to like me more so


---------127:39----------
there's like real all oak and then


---------127:42----------
there's the all oak and real all oak


---------127:44----------
doesn't think that women can like him so


---------127:46----------
he tries to be fake all oak and it turns


---------127:49----------
out that being fake all oak is


---------127:51----------
unattractive to women just like most of


---------127:53----------
the time being a fake person is like


---------127:56----------
people are attracted to like


---------127:57----------
authenticity you know I was super


---------127:59----------
stressed out because I was trying to


---------128:00----------
maintain this persona that I was not I


---------128:02----------
was just like faking it right and and so


---------128:05----------
the funny thing that happened is like


---------128:07----------
when I decided to become a monk I kind


---------128:09----------
of let that go because I was like okay


---------128:10----------
there's no way I'm gonna date anyone


---------128:11----------
anyway I'm gonna become a monk right


---------128:14----------
because that was the way that I


---------128:15----------
protected myself from the rejects


---------128:18----------
because I've protected myself because if


---------128:20----------
it's like if there's no chance that I


---------128:22----------
can you know if I it's like I don't have


---------128:27----------
to feel like a reject if I'm not willing


---------128:29----------
to date them in the first place you get


---------128:33----------
rejected from you protect yourself from


---------128:37----------
rejected rejection 100% when you don't


---------128:40----------
apply


---------128:41----------
you know you get 0% rejected from jobs


---------128:44----------
if you apply to zero jobs zero rejection


---------128:48----------
safety and so the way that I did that in


---------128:52----------
my mind was like I was gonna take all


---------128:54----------
those feelings if I'm a piece of


---------128:55----------
and then I said I'm bad oh I'm gonna be


---------128:57----------
a monk I'm going to give up it's not


---------129:00----------
it's not in cell it's like voluntary


---------129:03----------
celibacy so I was like a vol cell and


---------129:08----------
and so the interesting thing is that it


---------129:10----------
turned out that like when I just was


---------129:12----------
myself that sometimes women find that


---------129:15----------
attractive and then I got really really


---------129:17----------
confused because as I started dating her


---------129:20----------
like women that I was interested in for


---------129:22----------
two years like at college started to


---------129:25----------
like hit me up whereas just like Haden a


---------129:29----------
lot of my communications felt one-way so


---------129:32----------
unless I reached out to them they didn't


---------129:33----------
reach out to me and then suddenly like


---------129:36----------
you know a year after I'm dating someone


---------129:38----------
I run into someone and then they're like


---------129:41----------
and then throughout so that I got


---------129:43----------
confused by that for a little while and


---------129:45----------
I wasn't really sure what was going on


---------129:46----------
and then I got busy and tried to uh you


---------129:49----------
know put my life together and stop so I


---------129:51----------
didn't have time for that and then


---------129:53----------
like the funny thing is that even


---------129:54----------
throughout like med school and stuff


---------129:56----------
like that kept happening like and and


---------129:59----------
you know I just didn't care so like by


---------130:01----------
the time so I was older than many people


---------130:02----------
when I started med school so like the


---------130:04----------
average age of people coming to med


---------130:05----------
school was like 23 24 I was 27 I got


---------130:08----------
married after my first year of med


---------130:10----------
school or like during my first year of


---------130:12----------
med school and then like the really


---------130:15----------
crazy thing is like like so then I


---------130:16----------
really didn't care so like once I knew


---------130:18----------
out like once I got engaged I was like I


---------130:19----------
went into med school and really didn't


---------130:21----------
care like there's no possibility that


---------130:23----------
I'm gonna date anyone there because I'm


---------130:25----------
engaged


---------130:26----------
sounds like okay that's figured out I


---------130:28----------
sorted through that and so I just


---------130:30----------
started to be


---------130:31----------
myself and then suddenly like nurses


---------130:36----------
started hitting on me I was like is this


---------130:39----------
just because I'm gonna be a doctor one


---------130:40----------
day because that's what you would think


---------130:41----------
right but it turns out that that's not


---------130:44----------
the case I mean you guys can talk to


---------130:45----------
doctors who are in cells and they'll


---------130:47----------
tell you that they thought that once


---------130:48----------
they become a doctor the women are just


---------130:49----------
gonna be like trying to bash down their


---------130:51----------
door and date them and it turns out


---------130:53----------
unfortunately it's not true and this is


---------130:56----------
where like I think people have a lot of


---------130:57----------
like incorrect perceptions about what


---------130:59----------
women are looking for because once you


---------131:02----------
have friends who are doctors and in


---------131:03----------
cells and becoming a doctor doesn't


---------131:05----------
change their Insull status then you


---------131:07----------
start to question what is it that makes


---------131:09----------
an in cell so I think at the end of the


---------131:12----------
day you know I met her and kind of


---------131:15----------
lucked out because my ego had sort of


---------131:18----------
protected me from in a weird way had


---------131:21----------
protected me from like that whole


---------131:22----------
complex of thinking and that's why I


---------131:25----------
believe that like if we listen to Hayden


---------131:27----------
Hayden isn't actually cursed in life


---------131:29----------
like what's holding him back is in here


---------131:32----------
it's not out there and the reason I


---------131:35----------
believe that is because I realize like


---------131:36----------
the difference between me not being able


---------131:38----------
to get a girl to date me and then like


---------131:40----------
suddenly falling into a girlfriend is is


---------131:43----------
like has nothing to do with like my


---------131:46----------
physical attractiveness or my ethnicity


---------131:48----------
and as everything to do with like what


---------131:51----------
my thoughts are and how I carry myself


---------131:53----------
because my I carry myself relates to my


---------131:55----------
thoughts and you guys like get what I


---------131:58----------
was saying when like like Hayden looked


---------131:59----------
less pathetic right you guys with me


---------132:06----------
anyway does that answer your question


---------132:08----------
Moses or other dude yeah do you have


---------132:10----------
follow-ups I think so not really that's


---------132:15----------
a pretty good answer all right man we


---------132:19----------
should all go to summer camp and to cure


---------132:21----------
our insulin yeah so it's I know you just


---------132:26----------
about that but I do think it's


---------132:28----------
worthwhile to like engage in activities


---------132:30----------
where you're not looking for a date


---------132:33----------
right like that's people people say that


---------132:35----------
but like it's fun I mean as funny as


---------132:36----------
that is yeah like you should go out you


---------132:38----------
should just do stuff for the sake of


---------132:39----------
doing stuff and be yourself and then oh


---------132:42----------
yeah you know don't have your head up


---------132:44----------
your ass


---------132:44----------
and then you will be surprised right


---------132:49----------
yeah anyway like not not healthy I'm so


---------132:54----------
I can have some babies good yeah did the


---------132:57----------
retreat last year


---------132:58----------
let's do summer camp let's do it oh yeah


---------133:02----------

---------133:05----------

---------133:05----------

---------133:10----------

---------133:12----------

---------133:15----------
very much for your donations


---------133:17----------
subscriptions all that kind of stuff you


---------133:20----------
know we're here to help people


---------133:22----------
understand themselves and we're not


---------133:24----------
gonna judge right so hopefully I wasn't


---------133:26----------
judgmental but I think that you know if


---------133:28----------
you're an in cell this is the other


---------133:30----------
thing so by the way what's up with like


---------133:31----------
all the softball in sauce maybe this is


---------133:34----------
the second guy who's like I'm sort of an


---------133:36----------
in cell and then he says like he uses


---------133:38----------
the c-word and then he drops misogyny


---------133:40----------
but like if he stops using the c-word


---------133:41----------
like he doesn't really seem like a


---------133:43----------
misogynist like what what's up with that


---------133:46----------
like do we just is it because we're such


---------133:49----------
a wholesome stream that we can't attract


---------133:51----------
the right kind of you know breathing


---------133:54----------
fire sort of insel like if we get like a


---------134:01----------
like maybe what we need instead of an in


---------134:04----------
cell is a red pillar right can we get


---------134:09----------
can we get some real just toxic


---------134:12----------
masculine you know just the yes so what


---------134:21----------
is a black pillar I don't even know


---------134:22----------
anyway
