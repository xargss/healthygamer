---------00:00----------
like the number of casualties from


---------00:01----------
military conflicts in the last decade is


---------00:04----------
like less than how many men choose to


---------00:07----------
take their own life in one year


---------00:14----------
but I think the diagnosis of the problem


---------00:16----------
is beautifully put right and I think the


---------00:18----------
best thing I think chat was talking


---------00:22----------
about this


---------00:24----------
why do I feel like [ __ ] even though all


---------00:26----------
of my necessities are met and I also


---------00:28----------
like this sentence almost everything


---------00:30----------
that's enjoyable feels like it's lit


---------00:33----------
lacks of central meaning so the first


---------00:35----------
thing is I want to know like do you guys


---------00:37----------
want me to read more suffer do you guys


---------00:39----------
actually want to talk about things


---------00:46----------
I I am kind of confused about I feel


---------00:49----------
like I should talk about this


---------00:51----------
um but I need to know okay so the first


---------00:55----------
thing is do you guys know how in the


---------00:58----------
last seven years you guys know how much


---------01:01----------
the suicide rate under the age of 18 has


---------01:03----------
changed


---------01:06----------
let's start there


---------01:11----------
that's a yes-or-no question well played


---------01:15----------
yeah so it's gone up it's gone up by


---------01:19----------
about 50% in seven years


---------01:22----------
right and that's like that's crazy so


---------01:26----------
the first thing is I think if you guys


---------01:27----------
are making observations about the world


---------01:29----------
do your best to find data okay so I


---------01:33----------
think it's fine to have theories and the


---------01:35----------
internet loves theories right like


---------01:36----------
people on reddit or like always posting


---------01:38----------
their opinions about [ __ ] but ultimately


---------01:41----------
I'm a scientist so like I want data so


---------01:44----------
the first question is is here oh


---------01:47----------
leukemias premise correct are people


---------01:51----------
suffering at a greater rate than they


---------01:53----------
used to and actually the answer is yes


---------01:55----------
so we have evidence so mental health has


---------01:59----------
now surpassed cancer and cardiovascular


---------02:03----------
disease in the United States is the


---------02:05----------
number one contributor of morbidity and


---------02:08----------
mortality mental health now costs this


---------02:11----------
nation more than cancer and heart


---------02:14----------
attacks so it's it's like it's crazy but


---------02:18----------
the data actually supports exactly what


---------02:21----------
hero leukemia is noticing which is that


---------02:24----------
like the primary problem we face today


---------02:26----------
is not physical its mental so as we look


---------02:29----------
back like let's say 50 years a hundred


---------02:32----------
years 200 years a thousand years the


---------02:35----------
main sources of stress or challenges


---------02:38----------
that humans faced were not mental they


---------02:41----------
were physical like people had trouble


---------02:43----------
finding enough food people had trouble


---------02:45----------
getting eaten by like lions and tigers


---------02:49----------
people had trouble like dealing with


---------02:51----------
winters and there like these like


---------02:53----------
famines and stuff from like the early


---------02:54----------
1900's and 1800s that like wiped out


---------02:57----------
large swathes of people like there was a


---------03:01----------
flu in the last hundred years I forget


---------03:03----------
which one it was that wiped out like


---------03:05----------
fifteen to thirty percent of the


---------03:07----------
population of Europe or something like


---------03:09----------
15 percent of the population died from


---------03:11----------
the flu the flu doesn't really kill


---------03:12----------
anyone anymore


---------03:14----------
so the challenges that was it Spanish


---------03:17----------
flu I don't remember


---------03:19----------
so the challenges that Humanity is


---------03:21----------
facing are changing like it's not


---------03:25----------
infections that are killing us anymore


---------03:29----------
it's not even like I mean chronic


---------03:31----------
illnesses are killing us but we've


---------03:32----------
gotten way better in terms of like


---------03:34----------
cardiovascular disease the leading cause


---------03:35----------
of like problems in people's lives now


---------03:38----------
or is mental health so the question is


---------03:40----------
why


---------03:42----------
why


---------03:44----------
and I think the answer in my mind is


---------03:47----------
just it's a little bit simplistic and


---------03:48----------
it's because we're not worrying about


---------03:49----------
the other [ __ ] anymore because we don't


---------03:51----------
die from it like I could get the flu but


---------03:54----------
like I'm not I don't stress about the


---------03:57----------
flute right what I stress about now is


---------03:59----------
meaning fulfillment and at the same time


---------04:02----------
that we're sort of caught in the process


---------04:04----------
of conquering physical illness our


---------04:06----------
brains are being a sale to by technology


---------04:09----------
so I don't think we realized what we


---------04:11----------
were doing when like you know people


---------04:14----------
talk about the end of the world being


---------04:16----------
like nuclear apocalypse


---------04:17----------
you guys know what I think is gonna be


---------04:19----------
the end of humanity you know what I


---------04:20----------
really think is gonna be the end of


---------04:22----------
humanity virtual reality girlfriends and


---------04:26----------
boyfriends attached to sexual


---------04:30----------
instruments with haptic feedback does


---------04:33----------
anybody know what that means


---------04:36----------
you guys know what happed ik feedback is


---------04:45----------
so like someone is going to develop a


---------04:48----------
device like so about 15 years ago I was


---------04:53----------
involved with my dad was actually


---------04:55----------
involved with a really interesting like


---------04:58----------
cancer diagnosis device so this was back


---------05:01----------
when like what this is still going on


---------05:03----------
but I don't know if you guys know this


---------05:04----------
but


---------05:06----------
you know like the Middle East has a lot


---------05:08----------
of American institutions that are


---------05:10----------
opening up branches they're like


---------05:11----------
especially your hospitals like Cleveland


---------05:14----------
Clinic and like Duke and things like


---------05:16----------
that are all like opening up like


---------05:19----------
Medical like hospitals and stuff in in


---------05:20----------
the Middle East like especially like in


---------05:22----------
around the UAE


---------05:23----------
and and so so my dad was involved in the


---------05:27----------
production of a device which was a glove


---------05:29----------
which would allow him so that so he puts


---------05:32----------
on a glove in Houston Texas at MD


---------05:34----------
Anderson and someone in Hawaii is


---------05:37----------
wearing a glove and what happens is the


---------05:40----------
person who's wearing the glove then


---------05:42----------
palpates a breast right so like when


---------05:44----------
you're doing cancer diagnosis for breast


---------05:47----------
cancer like the the the doctor feels the


---------05:50----------
breast and you like feel for lumps and


---------05:52----------
then what my dad feels so like the the


---------05:56----------
the glove measures the resistance and


---------05:58----------
then translates that feeling and then


---------06:01----------
creates a sensation on my dad's hand so


---------06:03----------
he can like palpate a breast from like a


---------06:06----------
thousand miles away


---------06:08----------
right so like the sexual stuff aside


---------06:10----------
like it's a clinical diagnosis right and


---------06:12----------
so that technology is going to start


---------06:15----------
getting used by virtual reality suit so


---------06:18----------
what's going to happen is we're gonna


---------06:19----------
like put on a haptic feedback suit so


---------06:21----------
I'm gonna put on a pair of scrubs that


---------06:23----------
has all these like pressure sensors and


---------06:26----------
what's gonna happen is there's gonna be


---------06:28----------
like some sort of like genital device


---------06:30----------
right like something on the spectrum of


---------06:33----------
like a dildo or vibrator or like flesh


---------06:35----------
light or something like that and there's


---------06:37----------
gonna be virtual reality pornography


---------06:39----------
that you're going to be able to feel


---------06:42----------
and then like somewhere along this


---------06:43----------
doomsday scenario is going to be like an


---------06:45----------
AI that's a girlfriend so you're going


---------06:48----------
to go on virtual dates with an AI that


---------06:50----------
throws temper tantrums and then like


---------06:52----------
sometimes doesn't put out and


---------06:56----------
and then you'll be able to like have


---------06:58----------
your sexual needs gratified and then


---------07:01----------
you're gonna stop like procreating with


---------07:03----------
regular humans and then the human race


---------07:04----------
is going to die out but these are the


---------07:07----------
pressures like this is not something


---------07:08----------
that our brain was designed to deal with


---------07:11----------
it's scary


---------07:12----------
and on the other end of the spectrum


---------07:15----------
like that's like a doomsday apocalypse


---------07:17----------
in this scenario but on the other end of


---------07:18----------
the spectrum is the like button


---------07:20----------
you guys know like when when Facebook


---------07:22----------
blew up it was because of the like


---------07:23----------
button


---------07:25----------
like Facebook was a thing that college


---------07:27----------
kids used until the like button


---------07:30----------
and we're in a society where like


---------07:34----------
there's all this kind of FOMO kind of


---------07:36----------
stuff like people talk about this stuff


---------07:37----------
right they talk about FOMO


---------07:38----------
and everyone was envious of other people


---------07:41----------
but like envy wasn't shoved in your face


---------07:43----------
eight hours a day like you didn't just


---------07:46----------
you know you didn't wake up open up your


---------07:48----------
bedroom window and see a beach with


---------07:51----------
someone else like hanging out on the


---------07:53----------
beach and then you would put on your


---------07:55----------
coat and walk into like the


---------07:56----------
Massachusetts winter and then walk to


---------07:59----------
your job and take the subway like we're


---------08:02----------
bombarded with all of the amazing stuff


---------08:04----------
that people are doing and so this is


---------08:07----------
kind of like a huge assault on our


---------08:09----------
psychology because our brains are


---------08:11----------
designed to compare they're designed to


---------08:13----------
compare that's what they're made for


---------08:15----------
like monkeys compare humans compare it's


---------08:19----------
just what we do


---------08:22----------
and so technology is taking advantage of


---------08:24----------
all of the stuff in our brain the other


---------08:27----------
basic problem is as our basic needs get


---------08:29----------
met like we think about Maslow's


---------08:31----------
hierarchy of needs like food and shelter


---------08:33----------
and stuff we're sort of getting taken


---------08:35----------
care of you know you have experiments


---------08:36----------
with universal basic income in some


---------08:38----------
parts of Scandinavia and so previously


---------08:42----------
in society we needed people to produce


---------08:46----------
stuff for society to function but why do


---------08:49----------
we as a society value jobs because jobs


---------08:54----------
were necessary for the function of


---------08:56----------
humanity like you needed to have a


---------08:59----------
cooper to make a barrel and you needed


---------09:01----------
to have a blacksmith to do things and


---------09:03----------
you needed to have a farmer but it's


---------09:06----------
technology produces as is like machines


---------09:09----------
get better


---------09:10----------
his automation gets better as lab-grown


---------09:12----------
meat comes online like what do we need


---------09:15----------
people for we don't need people for


---------09:17----------
anything


---------09:18----------
it's like we don't need people for stuff


---------09:21----------
you can now grow in once like in one


---------09:26----------
story block you can grow like a thousand


---------09:30----------
acres worth of lettuce on one square


---------09:33----------
block right we have lab-grown meat so


---------09:35----------
instead of like pastures and animals


---------09:37----------
like we can just grow that [ __ ] in lap


---------09:41----------
and all the big like fast food producers


---------09:42----------
are actually investing in this stuff so


---------09:44----------
I think it's gonna be edible in the next


---------09:45----------
10 15 years and so human beings don't


---------09:49----------
need to have like you don't need to work


---------09:51----------
for like food and shelter and stuff like


---------09:53----------
in the night you know a lifetime it's


---------09:54----------
going to happen


---------09:55----------
so the more that our needs get met the


---------09:57----------
more we move ups Maslow's hierarchy of


---------09:59----------
needs and then we get to this thing


---------10:00----------
called self-actualization I think mental


---------10:03----------
health is somewhere in that realm right


---------10:06----------
like that's the spectrum of mental


---------10:07----------
health meaning purpose I'm a no one and


---------10:10----------
then not only are we army needs getting


---------10:13----------
bad but then we have like social media


---------10:14----------
that's telling us that other people are


---------10:16----------
like more important than we are


---------10:18----------
right and that's where you get this


---------10:21----------
situation this is why mental illness is


---------10:24----------
higher than ever before because our our


---------10:26----------
our survive like our other needs are


---------10:29----------
being met so like the mind is what's


---------10:31----------
left the mind is where the major source


---------10:34----------
of stresses if you think about you know


---------10:37----------
our our sympathetic nervous system are


---------10:39----------
our fight-or-flight system was designed


---------10:41----------
to help us against tigers and snakes and


---------10:44----------
now what does it do what is it what do


---------10:47----------
we get stressed out up mortgages


---------10:49----------
quarterly reports


---------10:52----------
getting a promotion at the end of the


---------10:54----------
year our sympathetic nervous system was


---------10:56----------
not designed to be active for months at


---------11:01----------
a time which is what it is now if you're


---------11:04----------
a college senior with a liberal arts


---------11:06----------
degree and a pile of debt your


---------11:09----------
sympathetic nervous system your


---------11:11----------
adrenaline system is going haywire for a


---------11:13----------
year it's not designed to do that we


---------11:15----------
were supposed to see a tiger in the span


---------11:17----------
of 15 minutes run away kill it or get


---------11:19----------
eaten that's what our nervous system was


---------11:21----------
designed for it's not designed for these


---------11:24----------
protracted periods of stress


---------11:28----------
that's also why obesity is getting worse


---------11:30----------
like I know we can talk about obesity in


---------11:33----------
the physiology of obesity but stress


---------11:36----------
literally makes you fat it literally


---------11:40----------
makes you fat so when you have a high


---------11:42----------
level of cortisol


---------11:44----------
what happens is cortisol mobilizes blood


---------11:47----------
sugar so it causes your body to like


---------11:50----------
break down fat and protein and glycogen


---------11:52----------
and put blood blood I put sugar in your


---------11:55----------
blood because the purpose of cortisol


---------11:57----------
was after you run away from a tiger for


---------12:00----------
the next 4 to 12 hours the tiger may be


---------12:02----------
sniffing your your footprints and may be


---------12:05----------
showing up so you need to have a lot of


---------12:07----------
energy available so your body would put


---------12:09----------
a bunch of sugar into your blood so that


---------12:11----------
you have easily available energy over


---------12:13----------
the next 12 hours


---------12:16----------
and so what we used to do like what


---------12:18----------
you'd use like if you see a tiger and


---------12:20----------
you run away


---------12:20----------
you're gonna hike for the next eight


---------12:22----------
miles to get away from the area that the


---------12:23----------
Tigers and that's what cortisol is


---------12:25----------
designed for is to provide you with


---------12:26----------
energy so you can hike eight miles now


---------12:30----------
when I'm worried about making mortgage


---------12:33----------
at the end of the month like what do I


---------12:34----------
do I sit here in this chair and so then


---------12:38----------
my body gets confused my body's like we


---------12:41----------
have a bunch of sugar in our blood we


---------12:42----------
must have just eaten a meal let's


---------12:44----------
release some insulin


---------12:46----------
and then if we release some insulin then


---------12:49----------
what it's going to do is cause that


---------12:50----------
sugar to be stored as fat so literally


---------12:54----------
what cortisol does is cause muscle


---------12:57----------
breakdown to increase your blood sugar


---------13:00----------
and then your body your your pancreas is


---------13:03----------
like oh [ __ ] we have a bunch of blood


---------13:05----------
sugar because we don't burn it like we


---------13:06----------
were supposed like we used to do and


---------13:08----------
then it's like oh we must have had a big


---------13:10----------
meal so let's release insulin so then


---------13:12----------
what happens is you get this okay


---------13:22----------
so


---------13:25----------
how am I gonna do this real you get this


---------13:39----------
this is called a buffalo huh


---------13:43----------
this is what happens when you have a


---------13:45----------
cortisol tumor


---------13:47----------
this is literally what a cortisol tumor


---------13:49----------
does to your body look at that


---------13:52----------
[Music]


---------13:53----------
and this is the [ __ ] that we have done


---------13:55----------
this is where it stressed us we're


---------13:57----------
stressed all the time this is what's


---------13:58----------
happening to you physiologically


---------14:00----------
obesity rates in this country or 30% is


---------14:03----------
that due to sugary beverages sure


---------14:07----------
it's also due to stress stress literally


---------14:12----------
makes you fat people talk about stress


---------14:14----------
eating like it's a psychological problem


---------14:15----------
it's not a [ __ ] psychological problem


---------14:17----------
it's a physiologic problem


---------14:21----------
and like look at this


---------14:26----------
like this is what stress is doing to us


---------14:29----------
[Music]


---------14:33----------
so I think my hero leukemia spot-on


---------14:40----------
right that something is changing in our


---------14:44----------
society


---------14:46----------
that we're killing ourselves at a higher


---------14:48----------
rate than ever before


---------14:50----------
and you could talk about you know like


---------14:52----------
gender dynamics a lot I mean I think


---------14:55----------
that there's a lot of gender inequality


---------14:57----------
but I think it's shocking that


---------15:01----------
let me just think about you see if I can


---------15:04----------
find the statistic


---------15:05----------
[Music]


---------15:11----------
men killed so 80% of suicides in this


---------15:14----------
country are men right why are men


---------15:16----------
killing themselves I think we have like


---------15:18----------
something like thirty or seventy


---------15:19----------
thousand people a year killed themselves


---------15:21----------
thirty to seventy thousand men a year


---------15:22----------
which is an astronomical number like the


---------15:28----------
number of casualties from military


---------15:30----------
conflicts in the last decade is like


---------15:32----------
less than how many men choose to take


---------15:35----------
their own life in one year


---------15:39----------
like that's staggering


---------15:42----------
so I I do think that there's a lot of


---------15:45----------
gender discrimination in in this country


---------15:47----------
and in the world and I think that things


---------15:49----------
are not equal between men and women and


---------15:51----------
I think that a lot of men are really


---------15:54----------
struggling right now and because of all


---------15:56----------
this dialogue around gender


---------15:57----------
discrimination like men don't feel open


---------16:01----------
about sharing like you can't like the


---------16:03----------
male victim is like it's hard to be a


---------16:05----------
male victim nowadays


---------16:07----------
right because there are a privileged


---------16:08----------
class I see this a lot because I work


---------16:10----------
with like these men come to my office


---------16:12----------
and it's hard because they can't


---------16:14----------
complain


---------16:17----------
and so I think that there's the


---------16:19----------
pressures I think by Hiro leukemia has


---------16:21----------
it spot-on


---------16:23----------
that why is it that most advanced


---------16:27----------
countries in the world are also


---------16:28----------
countries with the highest rates of


---------16:29----------
suicide


---------16:31----------
it's because the best of the most


---------16:34----------
developed countries push us towards the


---------16:36----------
top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs


---------16:40----------
right so that mental illness is what


---------16:43----------
becomes more problematic social media


---------16:46----------
and technology definitely exacerbate


---------16:48----------
that problem


---------16:48----------
[Music]


---------16:52----------
humans have always questioned the


---------16:54----------
meaning of life and it seems like we're


---------16:55----------
getting further from the answer as time


---------16:57----------
goes by absolutely because the meaning


---------16:59----------
of life used to be like you didn't have


---------17:00----------
the luxury of the meaning of life


---------17:02----------
like my grandmother grew up with it like


---------17:05----------
11 people living in like a 10 by 10 room


---------17:08----------
like literally like 11 people living in


---------17:12----------
that room


---------17:13----------
and


---------17:15----------
life expectancy in her day was like in


---------17:17----------
the 50s so the meaning of life was


---------17:19----------
[ __ ] surviving that was the meaning


---------17:21----------
of life back then we conquered that so


---------17:24----------
now we have to find more ephemeral and


---------17:26----------
diaphanous meanings of life


---------17:28----------
it's these subtle things it's like


---------17:30----------
Dharma


---------17:31----------
purpose meaning like before it was just


---------17:34----------
about getting by like all this is


---------17:35----------
boomers nowaday they're talking about


---------17:37----------
like lack of purpose was like because


---------17:39----------
their job was just like they they were


---------17:41----------
just trying to get by and now we're


---------17:43----------
doing a pretty good job of getting by so


---------17:44----------
now our challenges are more mental


---------17:49----------
and I would be a little bit careful


---------17:54----------
um about assuming that let people were


---------17:56----------
happier before like that's a really


---------17:58----------
common bias I don't really know if I


---------17:59----------
have data to support that like everyone


---------18:02----------
says that right like life was simpler


---------18:04----------
when we used to live in nature and


---------18:05----------
things like that


---------18:07----------
I mean infant mortality used to be


---------18:10----------
something like 30% I find it hard to


---------18:13----------
believe that like a thousand years ago


---------18:15----------
when infant mortality was 30% like
