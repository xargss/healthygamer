---------01:31----------
mostly valerie but then i switched some


---------01:32----------
other stuff in there so yeah


---------01:35----------
yeah awesome that


---------01:36----------
and when did you become a full-time


---------01:38----------
streamer


---------01:39----------
about 10


---------01:41----------
months ago


---------01:42----------
10 or 11 yeah how's that been


---------01:46----------
amazing


---------01:47----------
so i actually uh graduated school with a


---------01:49----------
nursing degree and then i kind of just


---------01:52----------
was like well i'm at a crossroads here


---------01:54----------
let me just try out full-time streaming


---------01:56----------
and it worked out for me so i'm i'm


---------01:57----------
really truly happy with what i do


---------02:00----------
congratulations on graduating


---------02:02----------
thank you thank you


---------02:04----------
um and also you know going full time as


---------02:06----------
a streamer that's not easy to do


---------02:08----------
yeah thank you i appreciate it i'm


---------02:10----------
really happy though i don't i don't


---------02:11----------
regret any choices i made


---------02:13----------
yet


---------02:14----------
yet well there are other choices i


---------02:17----------
regret but you know here we are


---------02:19----------
yeah


---------02:20----------
so sid is there something in particular


---------02:22----------
that you wanted to talk about today or


---------02:24----------
or anything that i can help you with


---------02:27----------
um i think some things that you know i


---------02:30----------
had brought up prior were just like


---------02:32----------
multiculturalism is a huge thing for me


---------02:34----------
um in a discussion that i have on stream


---------02:36----------
pretty often uh imposter syndrome moving


---------02:39----------
into full-time streaming and like you


---------02:41----------
know


---------02:42----------
kind of


---------02:43----------
just my life completely flipping the


---------02:45----------
opposite direction of where i thought i


---------02:47----------
was gonna go has been a big thing for me


---------02:48----------
lately so kind of just feeling like i


---------02:51----------
fit in here or belong


---------02:53----------
with like where i am


---------02:55----------
okay awesome um i mean not that you have


---------02:57----------
an imposter syndrome but i think these


---------03:00----------
are wonderful things to talk about that


---------03:01----------
i think will be you know very


---------03:03----------
educational and hopefully helpful so can


---------03:05----------
you start by um telling me a little bit


---------03:07----------
about what multiculturalism means


---------03:11----------
yeah so


---------03:12----------
for me like i'm half black and half


---------03:14----------
white and i've grown up in a community


---------03:16----------
that


---------03:17----------
a community of people that never looked


---------03:19----------
like me and my entire life you know i've


---------03:22----------
been around people who don't look like


---------03:23----------
me um and so it's been


---------03:26----------
an interesting adjustment to just try


---------03:29----------
and balance the two cultures that i


---------03:31----------
share between like being black and white


---------03:33----------
um and i've always found it really


---------03:35----------
difficult and like as i continue to get


---------03:37----------
older


---------03:38----------
i continue to find myself in spaces


---------03:41----------
uh where i don't feel well represented


---------03:43----------
like even on twitch you know i don't


---------03:44----------
necessarily feel well represented as a


---------03:46----------
black woman um and so like having these


---------03:48----------
two cultures is


---------03:50----------
so much of my identity but i often times


---------03:53----------
don't feel like i


---------03:55----------
you know


---------03:56----------
fit in or have people around me who are


---------03:59----------
similar so um it's just a big thing for


---------04:01----------
me to


---------04:02----------
kind of


---------04:05----------
uh recognize both and then try and


---------04:07----------
figure out how i can


---------04:08----------
live harmoniously with all of it


---------04:13----------
it sounds like a lot like a lot of


---------04:15----------
moving pieces that you have to


---------04:16----------
continually like try to fit together


---------04:20----------
it feels like that


---------04:22----------
yeah


---------04:22----------
because i'm also kind of noticing that


---------04:24----------
if you know if if your identity has


---------04:27----------
different facets in any given group


---------04:29----------
there may be a part of you that fits in


---------04:31----------
but other parts of you that don't


---------04:34----------
exactly


---------04:37----------
that sounds challenging


---------04:40----------
it is a hundred percent i think there's


---------04:41----------
like this famous lyric that's like too


---------04:44----------
black for the white kids and two white


---------04:45----------
for the black and that's like exactly


---------04:47----------
how i feel um for the entirety of my


---------04:50----------
life that's how i felt so


---------04:52----------
uh it is definitely an interesting


---------04:54----------
balance


---------04:55----------
yeah so i think that reminds me of one


---------04:57----------
of my own kind of experiences growing up


---------04:59----------
so i am what is known as a coconut which


---------05:02----------
means brown on the outside and white on


---------05:04----------
the inside


---------05:05----------
gotcha so i i grew up in east texas


---------05:08----------
where um you know i was like


---------05:11----------
not indian enough for the indian kids


---------05:13----------
like i didn't go to indian dance class


---------05:15----------
and like didn't know how to do like the


---------05:16----------
ball like i didn't watch bollywood


---------05:17----------
movies or listen to indian music


---------05:20----------
um and listen to like you know blink 182


---------05:23----------
and and other angsty emo things


---------05:27----------
and then but also was you know faced a


---------05:29----------
fair amount of racial discrimination in


---------05:31----------
east texas


---------05:32----------
oddly enough because i looked mexican so


---------05:34----------
most of the insults were actually


---------05:36----------
directed towards a race that wasn't even


---------05:38----------
mine which is kind of


---------05:39----------
funny in some ways yeah


---------05:42----------
because it's like how racist are you


---------05:43----------
that you don't even know


---------05:44----------
no


---------05:45----------
yes i am you know


---------05:47----------
and


---------05:48----------
and then occasionally you know


---------05:50----------
appropriate racial insults


---------05:52----------
um yes


---------05:55----------
but i you know i i still think i imagine


---------05:57----------
in some ways it was


---------05:59----------
easier for me because at least i you


---------06:00----------
know i


---------06:02----------
i don't know it it sounds more


---------06:04----------
challenging for you than what i remember


---------06:06----------
my experience being


---------06:08----------
but


---------06:09----------
so can you tell me a little bit about um


---------06:11----------
you know what it was like to grow up


---------06:14----------
uh you know with one parent who was


---------06:16----------
caucasian and one parent who was


---------06:18----------
black oh


---------06:20----------
um


---------06:22----------
difficult i guess because


---------06:26----------
because


---------06:27----------
you know i think there's a phenomenon


---------06:29----------
where people more heavily identify with


---------06:31----------
their


---------06:33----------
like their culture that is um


---------06:35----------
kind of discriminated against right so i


---------06:37----------
feel like i maybe lean more towards


---------06:39----------
being a black woman that's if you walk


---------06:41----------
past me on the street you see me as a


---------06:42----------
black woman you know all those things


---------06:44----------
and i think that i often


---------06:46----------
talked growing up like i forgot about my


---------06:49----------
white side or like my mom would feel


---------06:51----------
hurt by me because she thought that i


---------06:53----------
would like forget that i'm also white


---------06:55----------
you know um so that was always really


---------06:57----------
hard to balance with my my mom because i


---------07:00----------
didn't ever want her to think that i


---------07:01----------
wasn't proud to be her daughter or


---------07:03----------
whatever else um but


---------07:06----------
that was that was difficult and also i


---------07:09----------
just kind of felt like my mother could


---------07:11----------
never truly understand what i go through


---------07:14----------
as a black woman as much as she tries


---------07:16----------
you know and is is a part of my life and


---------07:19----------
my experiences and like


---------07:21----------
seeing how i've you know had to grow up


---------07:23----------
in this world but i think uh


---------07:27----------
there are some things that she will just


---------07:28----------
never understand you know and so


---------07:31----------
um


---------07:32----------
i don't know i guess like a lot of my a


---------07:34----------
lot of my experiences as a black woman


---------07:36----------
like she's never faced the same


---------07:37----------
discrimination so she can't like truly


---------07:39----------
understand what i've been through you


---------07:41----------
know she can see it and she can hurt for


---------07:43----------
me and be empathetic which she very much


---------07:45----------
is um but it's just like


---------07:48----------
she's never


---------07:51----------
she doesn't like walk into stores and


---------07:53----------
notice that people are like watching her


---------07:55----------
or whatever you know she doesn't have


---------07:56----------
those thoughts whereas like when i walk


---------07:58----------
into


---------07:59----------
uh


---------08:00----------
the sephora and i notice that the person


---------08:02----------
at the front door is like kind of


---------08:04----------
following me around i i see those things


---------08:06----------
where she would never notice if she was


---------08:07----------
walking with me yeah so that kind of


---------08:09----------
stuff i i love how illustrative that


---------08:12----------
example is


---------08:14----------
like


---------08:14----------
you know because i i think sometimes


---------08:16----------
when we think about discrimination we


---------08:18----------
think about statistics


---------08:21----------
like you know like things that are like


---------08:22----------
measurable but but what i'm hearing from


---------08:24----------
you is it's it's kind of just baked into


---------08:27----------
when you walk around


---------08:29----------
yeah yeah it's very like uh a lot of


---------08:31----------
microaggressions all the time that most


---------08:34----------
people wouldn't recognize unless it's


---------08:36----------
happened to them


---------08:37----------
every time they've walked into you know


---------08:39----------
a place


---------08:40----------
can you tell me what a microaggression


---------08:42----------
is


---------08:43----------
yeah i mean i guess i don't know the


---------08:45----------
exact


---------08:46----------
uh


---------08:48----------
description for it but i would just say


---------08:51----------
that like it's these small


---------08:54----------
um


---------08:55----------
under like undertones of racism that i


---------08:58----------
would face


---------08:59----------
day to day things like uh that you


---------09:02----------
wouldn't expect me to


---------09:05----------
really pick out but someone's saying


---------09:06----------
like something i got growing up was like


---------09:08----------
oh you're so pretty for a black woman


---------09:10----------
you know like you're so pretty for a


---------09:11----------
black girl and it's like you're not


---------09:14----------
being super aggressively outwardly


---------09:16----------
racist but you're like putting in this


---------09:19----------
very backhanded portion of what you're


---------09:21----------
trying to say to me so it's like these


---------09:23----------
very yeah


---------09:24----------
passive-aggressive sly things that


---------09:27----------
happen


---------09:30----------
an insulting compliment


---------09:32----------
yes


---------09:33----------
that's what it feels like


---------09:35----------
interesting um i actually really like


---------09:37----------
that


---------09:37----------
that


---------09:38----------
uh example as well


---------09:40----------
um


---------09:42----------
yeah so i you know sid i find myself


---------09:46----------
and you know we can talk about whatever


---------09:47----------
you want to but the thing that i


---------09:48----------
actually find myself so curious about is


---------09:50----------
just wanting to hear more about what


---------09:52----------
your life


---------09:53----------
like is like you know what is it like


---------09:56----------
it's so illustrative


---------09:59----------
for me to just


---------10:00----------
um


---------10:02----------
you know to hear about your experience


---------10:03----------
at sephora and and like just what it


---------10:06----------
looks like because i think a lot of


---------10:07----------
times especially on the internet you


---------10:09----------
know words like microaggressions get


---------10:11----------
tossed around and people will like say


---------10:13----------
like oh like microaggressions or bs or


---------10:15----------
like microaggressions are real but i i i


---------10:17----------
think the thing that i appreciate the


---------10:19----------
most about talking to you is how you


---------10:21----------
bring some of these like abstract


---------10:23----------
concepts that people on the internet


---------10:25----------
argue about to life


---------10:26----------
because i think everyone i would hope


---------10:28----------
can understand you know how that's


---------10:30----------
it's like oh you're pretty for black


---------10:32----------
girls like it's kind of


---------10:34----------
you know yeah


---------10:35----------
the the underlying tone of you're pretty


---------10:38----------
for a black girl is like i don't find


---------10:39----------
black women pretty but you oh you're


---------10:41----------
pretty which feels really bad


---------10:44----------
and um uh it's definitely a comment i


---------10:48----------
got growing up all the time and i didn't


---------10:49----------
realize that it made me feel bad until i


---------10:51----------
got older and then i was like oh yeah


---------10:53----------
that's not a nice thing to say at all


---------10:55----------
yeah


---------10:56----------
so


---------10:58----------
yeah it's interesting kind of reminds me


---------10:59----------
of like cough syrup where they like make


---------11:01----------
it artificially sweet


---------11:04----------
but it still tastes nasty


---------11:05----------
yeah


---------11:06----------
it's like


---------11:08----------
um


---------11:08----------
yeah so can you just tell me a little


---------11:10----------
bit more about so it sounds like your


---------11:11----------
mom is white and your dad is black


---------11:15----------
and do you have siblings


---------11:16----------
i do um i have a younger brother and a


---------11:20----------
yeah a younger brother and a younger


---------11:21----------
sister and an older brother and an older


---------11:22----------
sister okay


---------11:24----------
um and and so what was growing up like


---------11:26----------
for you like we're you know


---------11:28----------
and i know that sometimes people are


---------11:30----------
sense like you should be sensitive to


---------11:31----------
privacy and stuff so you don't have to


---------11:32----------
give me like a specific city or anything


---------11:33----------
like that but i'm just curious like what


---------11:35----------
was


---------11:35----------
you know what was life like for you


---------11:37----------
growing up


---------11:38----------
yeah so i grew up and i lived with my


---------11:41----------
mom mostly because my parents have been


---------11:43----------
separated since i was young um i lived


---------11:46----------
in the suburbs outside of seattle so uh


---------11:50----------
definitely predominantly white and


---------11:51----------
korean i would say that i


---------11:54----------
i think i had like


---------11:56----------
a few other black students in school and


---------11:58----------
like we all knew each other but i wasn't


---------12:00----------
close with any of them um


---------12:03----------
so i felt like a lot of the time i was


---------12:05----------
making friends outside of my race which


---------12:07----------
is totally cool and awesome and like i


---------12:08----------
got to learn about a ton of other


---------12:09----------
cultures and things like that but um


---------12:12----------
it definitely makes you feel really


---------12:14----------
alienated and i grew up


---------12:17----------
if i'm being super candid hating the


---------12:19----------
color of my skin i hated my skin i hated


---------12:22----------
that i was different um


---------12:24----------
i


---------12:25----------
hated my curly hair i


---------12:28----------
didn't like you know my more black


---------12:30----------
features that i had


---------12:32----------
um


---------12:32----------
and that took me a really really long


---------12:34----------
time to accept myself for who i am and


---------12:36----------
like now i'm completely on the opposite


---------12:38----------
spectrum i like love the color of my


---------12:40----------
skin i love my culture you know whatever


---------12:42----------
it is um but it was really hard growing


---------12:44----------
up for sure because all you want to do


---------12:46----------
is is fit in especially in high school


---------12:48----------
like the last thing you want to do is be


---------12:50----------
different than everybody else


---------12:52----------
um so i would do things like


---------12:54----------
i don't know straighten my hair every


---------12:56----------
single day i would uh if it was sunny


---------12:59----------
outside i'd make sure that i didn't have


---------13:01----------
any skin showing so that i wasn't


---------13:03----------
getting any darker like real self-hate


---------13:05----------
stuff um growing up


---------13:08----------
and


---------13:09----------
it was something that i couldn't talk to


---------13:11----------
anyone about because i didn't have


---------13:12----------
anyone who could relate to me and my dad


---------13:15----------
is like this super


---------13:17----------
um


---------13:19----------
proud to be black man black man right


---------13:22----------
and so i didn't feel i didn't want him


---------13:24----------
to feel


---------13:25----------
disappointment or sad if i came to him


---------13:28----------
and was like i hate being black you know


---------13:30----------
um that wasn't a conversation that i


---------13:32----------
wanted to have with my dad because i


---------13:33----------
would feel so bad and then like


---------13:36----------
my siblings


---------13:38----------
not super close to growing up


---------13:41----------
um had very very different experiences


---------13:44----------
so


---------13:45----------
i definitely felt very very alone but


---------13:49----------
a part of something at the same time


---------13:50----------
because i was in sports and leadership


---------13:52----------
and like asb and all that kind of stuff


---------13:54----------
so it was like i fit in but only because


---------13:57----------
i was trying so hard to fit in


---------14:00----------
hmm


---------14:03----------
sid i


---------14:04----------
you know you


---------14:07----------
you do a wonderful job of like


---------14:09----------
constructing a narrative


---------14:11----------
like it's so interesting to hear a


---------14:12----------
little bit about you know how you kind


---------14:13----------
of piece things together and um


---------14:16----------
it's also kind of interesting because


---------14:18----------
what i'm sort of hearing is that you


---------14:19----------
felt a lot of shame but you couldn't


---------14:21----------
share that shame with your dad


---------14:23----------
and at the same time you kind of like


---------14:25----------
also like identified with being black


---------14:28----------
and that made it hard for your mom so


---------14:29----------
i'm sort of noticing that it was hard


---------14:31----------
for you to like really


---------14:33----------
openly and authentically connect with


---------14:35----------
either of your parents maybe yeah


---------14:38----------
um


---------14:39----------
and and i guess that's where the kind of


---------14:40----------
the feeling of alienation comes in or is


---------14:42----------
that like more related to school


---------14:45----------
uh


---------14:46----------
no i definitely think it was a little


---------14:48----------
bit of both and i mean not being able to


---------14:50----------
relate to my siblings my parents or the


---------14:52----------
people that i go to school with was just


---------14:53----------
kind of like


---------14:55----------
feeling alone in that aspect all the


---------14:57----------
time


---------14:59----------
you said that you used to hate the color


---------15:01----------
of your skin can you help me understand


---------15:03----------
like where those when you started to


---------15:05----------
have those thoughts


---------15:07----------
like how did that happen


---------15:08----------
oh


---------15:09----------
um


---------15:11----------
i couldn't


---------15:13----------
necessarily pinpoint i want to say maybe


---------15:15----------
around middle school is like when it


---------15:17----------
really became apparent to me that the


---------15:19----------
color of my skin was going to


---------15:22----------
affect the way that people around me


---------15:24----------
treat me or act or what they expect of


---------15:27----------
me there are so many expectations


---------15:30----------
as a black woman


---------15:32----------
you know my age but so many expectations


---------15:34----------
as a young black woman as well


---------15:36----------
um


---------15:38----------
and so i was oh sorry


---------15:40----------
yeah no of course i guess like things


---------15:43----------
like


---------15:44----------
um


---------15:46----------
you don't sound black as something that


---------15:48----------
i would get all the time and i'm like oh


---------15:49----------
because i'm eloquent and well spoken and


---------15:51----------
you know whatever i don't sound black


---------15:54----------
you expect me to sound this very certain


---------15:56----------
way that's a comment that you know


---------15:59----------
i would get growing up and i didn't


---------16:00----------
really understand i would be like oh


---------16:02----------
what does what does sounding black mean


---------16:04----------
you know and it's


---------16:06----------
what people are expecting of a black


---------16:08----------
woman


---------16:09----------
is these very like stereotypical things


---------16:11----------
that you see


---------16:13----------
in in movies and like that's what you


---------16:15----------
that's what you expect and if you don't


---------16:17----------
get that people are like shook you know


---------16:19----------
um


---------16:21----------
so those those sort of expectations or


---------16:24----------
um as i've gotten older an expectation


---------16:26----------
that i feel put on me often is that like


---------16:29----------
i need to be this really strong


---------16:31----------
independent black woman and like yeah


---------16:33----------
that's what i have to do and if i'm not


---------16:35----------
that you know if i'm vulnerable or


---------16:38----------
any of those type of things then like


---------16:40----------
i've failed as like the strong


---------16:42----------
independent black woman


---------16:44----------
so the expectations have changed but


---------16:46----------
they've always been there


---------16:50----------
sounds rough


---------16:52----------
yeah yeah


---------16:54----------
i guess i also don't want to make it out


---------16:55----------
to sound like it's all bad or like it's


---------16:57----------
always sucked for me you know um


---------17:00----------
because i guess that's what it sounds


---------17:02----------
like right now


---------17:03----------
but that's what i'm asking about okay


---------17:06----------
okay right but i'd love to hear about


---------17:08----------
you know how has it been good


---------17:10----------
um yeah i guess it just like it makes me


---------17:13----------
different i have these very different


---------17:14----------
experiences than other people and i feel


---------17:17----------
like not only was i taught empathy from


---------17:20----------
a young age from my parents i also feel


---------17:22----------
like i


---------17:24----------
learned it through my experiences like i


---------17:26----------
don't want other people to feel the way


---------17:27----------
that i've had to feel and so


---------17:29----------
it's made me this like really empathetic


---------17:31----------
person so i kind of try and twist them


---------17:34----------
into like positive things


---------17:36----------
that i would never like pass along to


---------17:38----------
other people or i also think like now


---------17:40----------
the fact that i have a platform feels


---------17:42----------
really good because i get to talk about


---------17:44----------
my experiences and i feel like


---------17:46----------
in my chat at least so many people


---------17:48----------
relate to me or


---------17:50----------
feel heard or seen or like i'm here to


---------17:53----------
be representation on twitch and so i'm


---------17:56----------
like really proud of that and happy that


---------17:57----------
i could can be a part of that too


---------18:03----------
how does it feel to be a part of


---------18:05----------
representation on twitch


---------18:08----------
um


---------18:10----------
yeah i mean obviously i want more i'm


---------18:12----------
always gonna want more uh


---------18:15----------
i just remember like


---------18:17----------
sorry go for it go for it


---------18:20----------
um i remember coming on twitch and like


---------18:22----------
the first time that i started watching


---------18:24----------
it was never something that i could see


---------18:25----------
like myself


---------18:27----------
doing right and then i saw another like


---------18:30----------
black girl streaming and it was like oh


---------18:32----------
okay this is there are black people on


---------18:34----------
the platform like i could do this you


---------18:35----------
know i feel seen i feel hurt i feel


---------18:37----------
represented um and so


---------18:39----------
i


---------18:40----------
like the idea of me being able to do


---------18:43----------
what she did for me for other people


---------18:46----------
um


---------18:47----------
and yeah of course i'm always going to


---------18:48----------
want more representation


---------18:50----------
of of like black women in gaming and


---------18:52----------
black women black women and twitch


---------18:55----------
but i'm happy to be you know a start of


---------18:57----------
it or and a part of it


---------18:59----------
why do you want more representation of


---------19:01----------
black women and in gaming and twitch


---------19:04----------
because growing up like obviously i've


---------19:07----------
always been into games um i've always


---------19:09----------
read comic books i've always gamed and


---------19:10----------
then i felt like


---------19:13----------
there wasn't space for me in the


---------19:15----------
community


---------19:16----------
um and when i came on twitch and then


---------19:19----------
saw nobody that looked like me it made


---------19:22----------
me feel like there was even less space


---------19:23----------
and i'm like wow is there


---------19:25----------
you know could i stream on this platform


---------19:27----------
would i be able to make fred you know


---------19:28----------
whatever um and then when i found that


---------19:31----------
there is like a community of of black


---------19:33----------
people on twitch definitely feels more


---------19:35----------
like


---------19:38----------
would be accepted you can be a part of


---------19:40----------
this and like just despite your race


---------19:41----------
because


---------19:42----------
growing up the way that i did and i have


---------19:44----------
like you


---------19:46----------
kind of a count race into a lot of


---------19:48----------
things you know


---------19:49----------
how do you


---------19:50----------
um


---------19:52----------
uh


---------19:54----------
i guess a lot of the time i'm like


---------19:57----------
seeking out


---------19:59----------
people who look like me like i'm seeking


---------20:01----------
out representation like i want to see


---------20:03----------
black movies uh you know black


---------20:05----------
blockbuster movies like selling out


---------20:07----------
whatever those kind of things and so i


---------20:09----------
just kind of move


---------20:10----------
through life in that way so i come on


---------20:12----------
twitch and i'm like yeah i'm excited to


---------20:14----------
watch video games but then on my like


---------20:16----------
third day on the platform i go


---------20:18----------
but where can i find the black streamers


---------20:20----------
like where where are the black streamers


---------20:21----------
on here winning which is like what i


---------20:23----------
really want to see


---------20:24----------
so can you help me understand like when


---------20:26----------
you see


---------20:27----------
you know let's say like


---------20:29----------
black representation being successful


---------20:31----------
like let's say like a like you said like


---------20:33----------
a you know box office or like a you know


---------20:36----------
a black streamer with let's say 50 000


---------20:38----------
views or whatever how does that make you


---------20:40----------
feel to see those things


---------20:42----------
it makes me feel great like hi so help


---------20:45----------
me understand that


---------20:50----------
i


---------20:51----------
understand the setbacks


---------20:54----------
um


---------20:56----------
that


---------20:57----------
these people have


---------20:59----------
gone through right and i understand that


---------21:02----------
they probably felt the same way as me


---------21:03----------
where they feel like


---------21:05----------
uh pigeonholed or feel like the space


---------21:07----------
isn't for them


---------21:09----------
and then they're able to come on and


---------21:12----------
transcend that so like i know they had


---------21:14----------
to work really hard and they've probably


---------21:16----------
been through it and like


---------21:17----------
i mean the amount of racist comments


---------21:20----------
that i get in my chat i can't imagine if


---------21:23----------
you have 50 000 viewers how much how


---------21:25----------
much of that you're getting you know um


---------21:27----------
and so i just recognize how hard it it


---------21:31----------
can be and so it feels very like i feel


---------21:34----------
very triumphant for them like their win


---------21:36----------
is also my win because like i get to see


---------21:38----------
this


---------21:39----------
you know black creator succeed


---------21:42----------
so i'm almost noticing like some degree


---------21:44----------
of like identification


---------21:47----------
with this person like there's there's


---------21:48----------
like like i'm getting a strong sense of


---------21:50----------
us


---------21:52----------
yeah absolutely and so their win is is


---------21:55----------
my win


---------21:56----------
i'm also kind of curious can you tell us


---------21:58----------
a little bit like have you been


---------21:59----------
pigeonholed like you've mentioned a


---------22:00----------
couple of microaggression kind of


---------22:02----------
comments


---------22:03----------
right like you don't sound like a black


---------22:05----------
girl and you're ready for a black girl


---------22:07----------
have there particular been particular


---------22:08----------
times where you feel like you've been


---------22:10----------
kind of


---------22:12----------
you know pushed or forced to behave a


---------22:14----------
particular way based on the color of


---------22:16----------
your skin


---------22:18----------
um


---------22:19----------
i definitely think


---------22:21----------
pushed yes i wouldn't say


---------22:23----------
force necessarily because i don't think


---------22:25----------
i've ever really like


---------22:27----------
conformed to those


---------22:29----------
ideas that are pushed upon me except for


---------22:31----------
when i was younger because i was trying


---------22:33----------
so hard to fit in you know but like


---------22:35----------
yeah


---------22:36----------
now i'm like


---------22:38----------
you know you can think this way about me


---------22:40----------
but that doesn't mean that i have to act


---------22:41----------
that way um


---------22:43----------
but i definitely think


---------22:45----------
yeah like in high school i was like i


---------22:47----------
was you know i did sports that's what i


---------22:49----------
was like supposed to do i didn't talk


---------22:51----------
about gaming or my interest in it like i


---------22:53----------
would go home and play video games and


---------22:55----------
not tell anyone or like read comments


---------22:57----------
and not tell anyone that kind of thing


---------23:00----------
because it didn't feel like it was the


---------23:01----------
space that was available for me um so


---------23:04----------
and those points yes i definitely felt


---------23:05----------
pigeon holed


---------23:07----------
that's so interesting that you were like


---------23:09----------
publicly into sports and privately into


---------23:11----------
gaming


---------23:12----------
yeah yeah


---------23:16----------
yeah and and were there particular


---------23:18----------
experiences in in middle school or high


---------23:20----------
school that made you feel like


---------23:22----------
fitting in was super important or you


---------23:25----------
know times where you kind of like had to


---------23:27----------
learn that harsh lesson of like you need


---------23:29----------
to maybe talk differently or


---------23:31----------
straighten your hair or things like that


---------23:34----------
um


---------23:36----------
i think like


---------23:40----------
sorry can you repeat the question yeah


---------23:41----------
so sorry it was a weird abstract


---------23:43----------
question so let me ask a better one um


---------23:45----------
so you said that you used to hate the


---------23:47----------
way that you look


---------23:49----------
yeah so help me understand how you


---------23:52----------
learned to hate the way you look um


---------23:56----------
i think i just learned it through


---------24:00----------
like the fact that i was different like


---------24:02----------
always seeing people who look different


---------24:04----------
than me and like that's the beauty


---------24:05----------
standard so the girls who are considered


---------24:07----------
the prettiest in school looked


---------24:09----------
absolutely nothing like me so if i'm


---------24:11----------
constantly being told like


---------24:13----------
so and so


---------24:15----------
is is beautiful and like that's you know


---------24:17----------
everybody is you know interested in this


---------24:19----------
girl or i think she's the prettiest and


---------24:21----------
then i'm like well my hair doesn't look


---------24:22----------
like her my nose doesn't look like her


---------24:24----------
my lips don't my skin doesn't then it's


---------24:26----------
like


---------24:28----------
you just learn to not like the way that


---------24:30----------
you look when you're the opposite of the


---------24:31----------
beauty standard um


---------24:33----------
but then yeah also through the


---------24:35----------
microaggressions that definitely like


---------24:39----------
helps with that for sure um and then on


---------24:42----------
top of that not only am i like getting


---------24:44----------
it in my school but i'm getting it in


---------24:45----------
media too like the prettiest celebrities


---------24:47----------
or the people who are you know


---------24:49----------
pop stars or whatever um it can just be


---------24:53----------
yeah hard to see


---------24:54----------
to look around and not see anybody that


---------24:56----------
looks like you


---------24:57----------
yeah so that that's


---------24:59----------
so what i'm hearing is that it's not so


---------25:01----------
much


---------25:02----------
like you were made fun of or anything


---------25:04----------
like that like you weren't like bullied


---------25:05----------
because you were a black girl it was


---------25:07----------
more like you know


---------25:08----------
there's like clearly like everyone kind


---------25:10----------
of agrees


---------25:12----------
on what's good like who has the


---------25:14----------
prettiest hair


---------25:15----------
top three all of them have straight hair


---------25:17----------
who's the prettiest girl in the class


---------25:19----------
all of the girls are white


---------25:21----------
you know when you watch a movie


---------25:23----------
the heroine is usually a white girl


---------25:26----------
yeah


---------25:27----------
and and um


---------25:30----------
and even then i mean i'm kind of like


---------25:32----------
noticing in media that you know you'll


---------25:33----------
have people who go


---------25:37----------
like you'll have like a movie that's


---------25:39----------
designed for a black audience which will


---------25:41----------
have a black heroine but you won't have


---------25:43----------
like a black heroine in like a regular


---------25:45----------
movie right like even there's like


---------25:47----------
separation there


---------25:48----------
where there's like the regular they're


---------25:49----------
the movies for everyone


---------25:51----------
and then they're like the movies for the


---------25:53----------
other people and you all get to be the


---------25:55----------
prettiest over here


---------25:56----------
yes but you're not going to be the


---------25:58----------
prettiest over here


---------25:59----------
exactly that's another form of like that


---------26:02----------
pigeonhole feeling like i'm supposed to


---------26:04----------
watch those black movies to feel good


---------26:06----------
and like there's this whole like i love


---------26:07----------
that there is obviously this like black


---------26:09----------
genre for us by us for us to watch you


---------26:12----------
know um but at the same time it does


---------26:15----------
like have that effect on you it's like


---------26:17----------
well you're only allowed space separate


---------26:19----------
from what's mainstream


---------26:21----------
yeah


---------26:22----------
you get to be the prettiest in the


---------26:23----------
special category yes


---------26:26----------
exactly yeah so you know i said i i


---------26:29----------
really um


---------26:31----------
really appreciate your characterization


---------26:32----------
because i i think that


---------26:35----------
when i think about racism what i i just


---------26:37----------
realized and connect this until now but


---------26:39----------
when i think about racism the way that i


---------26:41----------
define it is by these things that are


---------26:43----------
upvoted on reddit


---------26:45----------
right like they're like very overt


---------26:48----------
racism


---------26:49----------
it's like things on like you know with


---------26:51----------
people freaking out and like you know


---------26:53----------
i'm walking down the street and someone


---------26:55----------
starts calling me the n-word or whatever


---------26:56----------
like people like everyone's got cell


---------26:57----------
phones so you tape it gets uploaded to


---------26:59----------
the internet gets passed around every


---------27:00----------
looks like oh like look at how bad


---------27:02----------
racism is but what i'm i'm kind of


---------27:04----------
really appreciating from hearing you is


---------27:06----------
that


---------27:08----------
it is systemic right it's not like it's


---------27:11----------
not like overt


---------27:12----------
i mean there's that too


---------27:15----------
yeah but that that you know there are


---------27:16----------
young girls or boys


---------27:18----------
um who are growing up


---------27:21----------
in these particular scenarios where like


---------27:24----------
the the rules of the game are set in a


---------27:26----------
particular way that like kind of creates


---------27:29----------
an experience for you


---------27:31----------
you know


---------27:32----------
um and and so how did you start to


---------27:36----------
not hate yourself


---------27:39----------
or hate the way you look i should say


---------27:41----------
yeah


---------27:42----------
i don't


---------27:43----------
know when i really


---------27:45----------
started i would say


---------27:48----------
maybe like after high school


---------27:51----------
um after high school i went to college


---------27:53----------
um i


---------27:55----------
joined the black student union um albeit


---------27:58----------
my college was still mostly white um but


---------28:02----------
i definitely had the opportunity to


---------28:04----------
surround myself and i made the choice to


---------28:05----------
surround myself with other


---------28:07----------
black people and


---------28:09----------
i finally felt like i found a community


---------28:11----------
in that


---------28:13----------
and i saw the way that other people in


---------28:17----------
that community had similar experiences


---------28:19----------
to me but then other people in that


---------28:20----------
community had didn't have that at all


---------28:22----------
they like grew up in areas where they


---------28:23----------
were always surrounded by black people


---------28:25----------
and they're just like yeah i love myself


---------28:27----------
and i love my skin and i see that and


---------28:30----------
i'm like wow i want that so badly like


---------28:32----------
i'm tired of hating myself i've done it


---------28:34----------
for 18 years like it's time to move on


---------28:36----------
um


---------28:38----------
and


---------28:39----------
yeah i just kind of made a point of


---------28:42----------
like faking it until i make made it you


---------28:44----------
know and then i it was a really long


---------28:47----------
journey and i would say i'm 24 now it


---------28:49----------
probably


---------28:50----------
i didn't really like love love myself


---------28:53----------
until it was i was like 22


---------28:55----------
almost 23 probably so the last year has


---------28:58----------
been awesome but


---------29:00----------
you know fine finding that was


---------29:02----------
definitely hard


---------29:04----------
yeah that's so interesting so what i'm


---------29:06----------
almost hearing is that you know when you


---------29:07----------
join the black student unit i may be


---------29:09----------
simplifying this a bit but like everyone


---------29:11----------
there is like proud to be black and you


---------29:13----------
had all these like feelings of being


---------29:14----------
ashamed to be black but they're all


---------29:16----------
proud to be black so you're going to


---------29:17----------
pretend to proud to be proud to be black


---------29:20----------
yeah and then internally maybe there was


---------29:22----------
some degree of conflict and then i like


---------29:24----------
faking it till you make it then at some


---------29:26----------
point you're like oh actually like i


---------29:27----------
can't take pride in this that sounds


---------29:29----------
really great


---------29:30----------
yeah um


---------29:32----------
i think it highlights for me the


---------29:33----------
importance or also how long it takes


---------29:37----------
if you've grown up believing something


---------29:39----------
you know how long it takes to start


---------29:41----------
changing the way that you think


---------29:43----------
and how powerful of an influence you may


---------29:45----------
need to kind of


---------29:47----------
you know


---------29:49----------
feel that way


---------29:50----------
um i'm also super curious about how many


---------29:52----------
people now in like black student unions


---------29:55----------
are secretly still partially ashamed of


---------29:58----------
the way that they look or the way they


---------29:59----------
feel


---------30:00----------
and and you know it's kind of


---------30:01----------
interesting because it sounds like it's


---------30:02----------
not a place that really voices those


---------30:04----------
kinds of experiences because we're all


---------30:06----------
proud


---------30:07----------
you know strong independent black woman


---------30:11----------
yeah i wonder


---------30:12----------
i'm trying to think did i ever feel like


---------30:14----------
i couldn't i guess i put that on


---------30:17----------
myself to feel like i couldn't share


---------30:18----------
that i'm sure everyone i could have


---------30:21----------
yeah i think we definitely could have


---------30:23----------
had the conversation but because i felt


---------30:25----------
so much shame now for instead of being a


---------30:27----------
black person now i feel shame for being


---------30:29----------
a black person who's not proud to be a


---------30:30----------
black person and so like ah i don't want


---------30:32----------
to voice this either


---------30:34----------
i think i probably did that to myself


---------30:36----------
yeah it's kind of interesting i also


---------30:37----------
think it's it's fascinating that when


---------30:39----------
people talk about you know positive


---------30:41----------
black women that they define them with


---------30:43----------
the same three words every single time


---------30:45----------
yes


---------30:47----------
what do you think about that


---------30:49----------
um it just creates another box


---------30:52----------
uh it creates an expectation


---------30:54----------
uh


---------30:55----------
it puts me in a position where now i


---------30:58----------
feel like if i


---------31:00----------
don't hit those expectations those three


---------31:02----------
words then it's like well


---------31:04----------
am i the


---------31:06----------
right black am i am i the right black


---------31:08----------
woman um and so it feels hard to do but


---------31:11----------
i think one of the things that i want to


---------31:14----------
like a mold that i want to break is that


---------31:16----------
black women are also sensitive


---------31:18----------
and you know you know all these other


---------31:20----------
things that they're are opposite of the


---------31:22----------
words that they're given to work with


---------31:24----------
yeah so i'm kind of curious said who


---------31:26----------
makes that box


---------31:32----------
i don't know


---------31:34----------
um


---------31:37----------
first thought is like media


---------31:40----------
you know and and the there's like a


---------31:43----------
i think it's i don't know what old trend


---------31:45----------
it is or if it was a video or what it


---------31:47----------
was but it was like i'm a strong


---------31:48----------
independent black woman and blah blah


---------31:50----------
and it just kind of like


---------31:52----------
stuck


---------31:53----------
you know or like the the


---------31:55----------
aggressive or angry black woman has just


---------31:58----------
like stuck in media and it's like


---------32:00----------
constantly represented that way it feels


---------32:02----------
like


---------32:03----------
um


---------32:05----------
and


---------32:06----------
so i i'm sure it's not just media but


---------32:09----------
off the top of the head


---------32:10----------
off the top of my head that's what i'm


---------32:12----------
getting


---------32:13----------
yeah so i can kind of see how media


---------32:15----------
would propagate it like what i'm


---------32:17----------
noticing actually is that um and you


---------32:19----------
know let me know if this this is


---------32:21----------
offensive in any way but like what i'm


---------32:23----------
noticing is actually like i think that


---------32:25----------
the black student union put you in a box


---------32:27----------
too


---------32:30----------
right that like pride is what we have to


---------32:32----------
feel


---------32:33----------
and i can understand why why they would


---------32:35----------
feel that way because like you have to


---------32:37----------
fight really hard for that pride


---------32:40----------
yeah


---------32:41----------
but it's it's kind of interesting


---------32:42----------
because i i sort of notice and i know


---------32:45----------
this is like shaky ground but like a


---------32:48----------
parallel in terms of you not feeling


---------32:50----------
comfortable sharing your shame in that


---------32:52----------
situation because it wasn't like what


---------32:55----------
was socially acceptable like what do you


---------32:57----------
think


---------32:58----------
yeah that's why i definitely think it


---------33:00----------
was like i have


---------33:01----------
two opposite shames but both are bad i


---------33:04----------
guess i kind of viewed one as equally


---------33:06----------
worse because it dug me out of this like


---------33:08----------
really deep hole you know yeah but


---------33:10----------
essentially it's it's the same thing


---------33:13----------
yeah which is fascinating there's so


---------33:14----------
much about you that's very yin-yang


---------33:17----------
in terms of


---------33:19----------
you know yes


---------33:20----------
not to capture the color of the imagery


---------33:22----------
but like really that's the term that i


---------33:24----------
think of it's not because you're half


---------33:26----------
black and half white it's because you're


---------33:27----------
consistent


---------33:28----------
you know it's just very fitting though


---------33:30----------
yeah


---------33:31----------
is that is that a microaggression or is


---------33:33----------
that fair


---------33:34----------
no i think that's fair okay


---------33:36----------
you gotta let me know if i micro


---------33:37----------
aggressive


---------33:39----------
i think that's fair a joke i would have


---------33:41----------
made for sure okay


---------33:43----------
um


---------33:44----------
yeah so that that's so sid i'm really


---------33:47----------
noticing that like


---------33:48----------
oh man let me just think for a second


---------33:50----------
cause i'm feeling something i just don't


---------33:53----------
know what it is


---------33:56----------
um


---------34:04----------
yeah so i guess the main thing that i'm


---------34:06----------
kind of noticing that has changed for


---------34:08----------
you is that you felt uncomfortable with


---------34:10----------
who you were


---------34:11----------
and then as you started to move in a


---------34:14----------
direction towards like being more


---------34:16----------
accepting of your black half for lack of


---------34:18----------
a better term even then like


---------34:21----------
there are certain norms that are put on


---------34:23----------
like actually


---------34:25----------
norms or boxes that i think


---------34:27----------
you know black people put on other black


---------34:29----------
people that you have to be a particular


---------34:31----------
way


---------34:32----------
um and and that you know i think it


---------34:34----------
comes down to kind of the strong


---------34:36----------
independent black woman which i i just i


---------34:39----------
always think it's so interesting that i


---------34:40----------
just hear all three of those words and


---------34:42----------
it's like you can't be


---------34:43----------
you know degenerate gamer independent


---------34:46----------
black woman yes yeah you know like but


---------34:49----------
what


---------34:51----------
and and what i i'm not surprised that


---------34:53----------
you left nursing school or not sorry


---------34:55----------
left nursing as a career because and


---------34:57----------
this is i think what i was kind of


---------34:58----------
hitting on is that you kind of said that


---------35:00----------
in the last year you've learned to love


---------35:02----------
yourself and i don't think it's


---------35:03----------
coincidental that you being able to love


---------35:05----------
yourself and stepping away from maybe


---------35:08----------
the path that the world has laid out for


---------35:10----------
you and jumping towards a path that is


---------35:13----------
actually like not easy right like you're


---------35:15----------
on an uphill battle there where you know


---------35:17----------
when i i mean occasionally i'll get the


---------35:19----------
racist comment when i stream


---------35:21----------
but you know it's not most of what i


---------35:23----------
deal with thankfully whereas like you're


---------35:25----------
choosing to fight this somewhat uphill


---------35:27----------
battle


---------35:28----------
and like help me understand i mean is


---------35:30----------
that fair to say that loving yourself


---------35:31----------
and deciding to go full time on twitch


---------35:33----------
like has some connection


---------35:36----------
yeah definitely i think it's because you


---------35:39----------
know in loving myself i've found this


---------35:42----------
confidence that no matter what i do like


---------35:44----------
i'm gonna do it well and


---------35:47----------
i like truly believe in myself to


---------35:49----------
make it work and if it doesn't work i


---------35:51----------
know i can pivot like that kind of thing


---------35:53----------
and that's i think a chance that i


---------35:54----------
wouldn't have taken


---------35:56----------
if i was still hating myself i wouldn't


---------35:58----------
have believed myself i wouldn't have


---------36:00----------
believed that i could have done it


---------36:03----------
so i'm yeah that's so interesting so


---------36:05----------
like


---------36:07----------
how did you learn that


---------36:10----------
i know i'm trying to find a better


---------36:12----------
answer for that no no no that's what


---------36:14----------
we're here for right because i think


---------36:16----------
here's the thing sid what we see for you


---------36:19----------
is somewhat of the finished product like


---------36:21----------
you told us a little bit about where you


---------36:23----------
started a little bit in the middle but i


---------36:24----------
think when it comes to people who


---------36:26----------
gravitate towards twitch


---------36:28----------
i think it's like people who


---------36:29----------
[Music]


---------36:31----------
you know there's a part of all of us


---------36:33----------
that like is happy to be


---------36:36----------
part of twitch


---------36:37----------
but then we're also like ashamed because


---------36:39----------
we're not like the other people


---------36:41----------
yeah and


---------36:42----------
i think it would be so curious to try to


---------36:44----------
learn


---------36:45----------
a little bit about how that confidence


---------36:47----------
came about and like where it came from


---------36:52----------
um


---------36:53----------
i think it helped because my parents


---------36:54----------
were always really supportive of


---------36:56----------
everything that i did they always


---------36:58----------
believed in me wholeheartedly um so that


---------37:01----------
helped a lot if you're just like


---------37:02----------
constantly being told which i know not


---------37:04----------
everybody experiences that especially


---------37:06----------
from their parents so that's like one


---------37:09----------
portion um


---------37:11----------
another is that i kept seeing things


---------37:17----------
work out for me like i knew i had the


---------37:19----------
work ethic to do it you know i just have


---------37:21----------
the motivation to like get things done


---------37:24----------
and i had the work ethic and like those


---------37:26----------
kind of things like i succeeded in like


---------37:27----------
school and like anything that i put


---------37:29----------
myself to i did well so


---------37:33----------
once you've seen it go well enough times


---------37:35----------
you kind of go okay this isn't just like


---------37:38----------
a random one-off like i'm making this


---------37:40----------
happen like i feel like i felt a lot of


---------37:42----------
autonomy and the things that happened


---------37:44----------
around me so it wasn't


---------37:46----------
you know any outside forces that made me


---------37:49----------
successful it was me that made me


---------37:50----------
successful


---------37:52----------
um


---------37:54----------
and


---------37:56----------
i


---------37:59----------
guess


---------38:00----------
i just found confidence or i found


---------38:02----------
comfort in knowing that everybody else


---------38:04----------
around me has their own stuff going on


---------38:06----------
like everyone else is worried about


---------38:09----------
you know


---------38:11----------
their meeting today or they're also


---------38:13----------
feeling insecure or whatever else as


---------38:15----------
soon as i could look around and be like


---------38:17----------
oh yeah all these people around me are


---------38:18----------
human beings too and they're all they


---------38:20----------
all have their own struggles it made me


---------38:22----------
go okay my struggles are okay because


---------38:24----------
everyone's going through it essentially


---------38:26----------
i guess that helps too


---------38:28----------
oh that's that's a beautiful answer so


---------38:30----------
there are a couple pieces of that that i


---------38:32----------
think are quite illustrative


---------38:34----------
um


---------38:35----------
not that i'm like the ultimate judge on


---------38:36----------
this but one is that i i think it's


---------38:39----------
really interesting when you mention


---------38:40----------
autonomy


---------38:41----------
that's not usually something that i hear


---------38:44----------
when i ask people where their confidence


---------38:45----------
came from


---------38:46----------
but it's such an interesting way to


---------38:48----------
think about it because i think


---------38:50----------
people who lack confidence i think


---------38:52----------
ultimately believe that the world is


---------38:54----------
going to determine what happens to them


---------38:58----------
yeah right it's sort of like i don't


---------39:01----------
have the power to change what the world


---------39:04----------
is going to give me


---------39:05----------
whereas people who are confident


---------39:06----------
acknowledge that the world kind of like


---------39:08----------
you said because at the beginning you're


---------39:09----------
like if i put my mind anything i'll


---------39:11----------
succeed and i'm like i don't know if


---------39:12----------
that's true but then you kind of qualify


---------39:14----------
that in a second and you said if i fail


---------39:16----------
i'll pivot


---------39:18----------
yeah and i think that's the key thing


---------39:20----------
about autonomy that even if you do kind


---------39:22----------
of stumble


---------39:23----------
even if you do have a setback that you


---------39:25----------
actually have agency and that you can


---------39:28----------
affect your future


---------39:30----------
um


---------39:31----------
so that's interesting because when i


---------39:33----------
when i talk to people who aren't


---------39:34----------
confident i don't hear that


---------39:37----------
you know i hear people


---------39:38----------
feeling kind of like fatalistic and like


---------39:40----------
that they don't really have a choice and


---------39:43----------
it's not in their control or that


---------39:44----------
nothing is in their control or there is


---------39:46----------
not enough in their control


---------39:48----------
yeah and the second thing is that i


---------39:49----------
think a lot of people who are not


---------39:51----------
confident compare their insides to other


---------39:53----------
people's outsides


---------39:55----------
so they compare the way that they feel


---------39:57----------
to what they see other people doing yeah


---------39:59----------
and my my favorite example of this is


---------40:01----------
like class presentations everyone is


---------40:02----------
nervous no one looks yeah


---------40:05----------
yes


---------40:06----------
but i'm really i think it's really


---------40:08----------
interesting to see that you sort of


---------40:09----------
realize that like


---------40:12----------
you know we're all struggling here yes


---------40:15----------
and it's okay to struggle


---------40:17----------
um


---------40:17----------
which is cool


---------40:19----------
can i ask you a question that may be


---------40:20----------
like a little bit


---------40:26----------
i feel like we're there's a


---------40:28----------
positive vibing right look we're talking


---------40:30----------
yeah oh my god like oh like you're


---------40:32----------
so brave like


---------40:34----------
you've grown it's just struggling to pin


---------40:35----------
a black woman


---------40:37----------
breaking barriers on twitter like it's


---------40:39----------
all that's true right it's like


---------40:41----------
i'm with you and i i genuinely feel that


---------40:43----------
excitement and pride but i want to ask


---------40:45----------
you something that i just really


---------40:46----------
struggle with as a medical professional


---------40:48----------
and as someone and i'm going to lean on


---------40:50----------
you for expertise here okay okay can i


---------40:53----------
do that could we do that or you want to


---------40:54----------
say yes


---------40:56----------
we do not need to stay safe here it's


---------40:58----------
okay so this is something i really


---------40:59----------
struggle with so like i know there are


---------41:01----------
people who get discriminated against i


---------41:04----------
know we have beauty standards i accept


---------41:06----------
all of that you know i faced a fair


---------41:07----------
amount of racism myself


---------41:09----------
um


---------41:10----------
interestingly enough i also have like


---------41:11----------
positive racism which is kind of weird


---------41:13----------
like i get stereotyped like i remember


---------41:14----------
when i was in med school i would have um


---------41:17----------
female black colleagues who when we were


---------41:19----------
all doctors they people would refer to


---------41:21----------
them as nurses and when i was like a


---------41:23----------
first-year medical student in my suit


---------41:24----------
and tie everyone thought i was a doctor


---------41:26----------
because i was indian yeah yeah and


---------41:28----------
that's


---------41:29----------
you know so like i even have the


---------41:30----------
benefits in some ways of of you know


---------41:32----------
being brown um but what i'm really what


---------41:35----------
i really struggle with as a medical


---------41:36----------
professional is like fat acceptance


---------41:40----------
like what do you think about that like


---------41:42----------
can you help me understand how you view


---------41:44----------
sort of like the fat shaming fat


---------41:46----------
acceptance movement


---------41:48----------
yeah i guess um it's


---------41:52----------
interesting for me because i don't


---------41:54----------
necessarily have direct experience right


---------41:57----------
so i can empathize sympathize try my


---------41:59----------
best to understand what you know people


---------42:02----------
who have experienced fat shaming have


---------42:04----------
gone through but i myself haven't


---------42:06----------
because i have the privilege opposite of


---------42:08----------
that


---------42:09----------
um


---------42:10----------
so for me in terms of like


---------42:12----------
the movement i guess i'm always going to


---------42:16----------
support people who are like


---------42:18----------
healthy and


---------42:20----------
feel good about themselves right so like


---------42:23----------
if you're someone who has been


---------42:26----------
discriminated against your entire life


---------42:28----------
because of your body but you feel


---------42:30----------
healthy in yourself and you're happy


---------42:32----------
with the way that you look and like


---------42:34----------
you've like worked so hard to accept


---------42:36----------
yourself i'm gonna be appreciative of


---------42:37----------
your acceptance and like i'm proud of


---------42:39----------
you for that of course and then if you


---------42:41----------
are in a different direction and you're


---------42:43----------
like i want to


---------42:44----------
lose weight like people in my family


---------42:46----------
have struggled with this so i've like


---------42:47----------
seen kind of firsthand the struggle but


---------42:49----------
i've never experienced so it's kind of


---------42:52----------
hard to say but like in watching my


---------42:54----------
family go through like the weight loss


---------42:55----------
acceptance you know that kind of thing


---------42:57----------
it's like


---------42:59----------
you can


---------43:01----------
try so hard and it can be one of those


---------43:03----------
uphill battles all the time to lose


---------43:04----------
weight and then eventually you can get


---------43:06----------
to a point where it's like i'm happy


---------43:08----------
with where i'm at then i'm like proud of


---------43:11----------
that too i guess my thing i'm like


---------43:14----------
really dancing around an answer because


---------43:17----------
it's so hard to say when you don't


---------43:20----------
really know but i just want to be


---------43:22----------
supportive


---------43:23----------
i guess of like whatever journey it is


---------43:24----------
if it's a self-acceptance journey i'm


---------43:26----------
supportive of that if it's a weight loss


---------43:28----------
journey i'm supportive of that


---------43:30----------
so i don't answer your question yeah you


---------43:33----------
did um was it okay that i asked it or is


---------43:35----------
that like too much of a


---------43:36----------
you know


---------43:38----------
no i think it's fine i mean like my goal


---------43:40----------
coming on here today was to be super


---------43:42----------
open and candid so i don't


---------43:45----------
i mean i'm happy to talk about whatever


---------43:47----------
yeah so i i really thank you so much for


---------43:50----------
engaging in the conversation because i i


---------43:52----------
think it's like um


---------43:55----------
just as someone who's faced a lot of


---------43:56----------
discrimination and as you can we're kind


---------43:58----------
of talking about like i can understand a


---------44:00----------
lot of aspects of you know that


---------44:02----------
perspective


---------44:03----------
yeah um you know in terms of having a


---------44:05----------
particular beauty standard right so like


---------44:07----------
when you think about a beauty standard


---------44:09----------
like


---------44:10----------
it's not equal in terms of body types


---------44:12----------
and there's actually like you know


---------44:13----------
there's research from that started 100


---------44:16----------
years ago that human beings basically


---------44:17----------
have three body types and that all three


---------44:20----------
are like normal variants within the


---------44:21----------
population there's an ectomorph


---------44:23----------
mesomorph and endomorph


---------44:25----------
and and endomorph is what we call big


---------44:28----------
boned


---------44:29----------
um


---------44:30----------
uh ectomorph is what we call like you


---------44:32----------
know people who have a fast metabolism


---------44:33----------
they can like eat whatever they want to


---------44:35----------
and they kind of won't gain weight and


---------44:36----------
then mesomorph it tends to be what most


---------44:39----------
of our male actors are


---------44:41----------
in terms of their like you know muscular


---------44:44----------
don't have too much fat but aren't too


---------44:46----------
skinny


---------44:46----------
so there's definitely like standards


---------44:48----------
within these three biological body types


---------44:50----------
that is not equal


---------44:52----------
i can kind of get behind that i think


---------44:55----------
what i'm really curious about is when


---------44:56----------
you say like healthy


---------44:58----------
like you say that you know you can


---------44:59----------
support anyone in their journey which is


---------45:01----------
what i try to do


---------45:02----------
yeah so i try to just you know meet


---------45:04----------
people where they're at and support them


---------45:06----------
in in terms of like self acceptance and


---------45:08----------
stuff but i'm curious like what when you


---------45:10----------
use the word you know


---------45:12----------
healthy what does that mean to you when


---------45:14----------
it comes to fat shaming or fat


---------45:16----------
acceptance


---------45:18----------
um


---------45:21----------
so i used to work at an eating disorder


---------45:23----------
clinic actually when i was in nursing


---------45:24----------
school and i got to see a lot of people


---------45:27----------
who were


---------45:29----------
mentally unhealthy because of the things


---------45:31----------
that they had experienced right so like


---------45:33----------
a lot of these eating disorders were


---------45:34----------
like a product of


---------45:36----------
their environment and like you're you


---------45:38----------
know like being told this your entire


---------45:40----------
life or you're in sports or whatever and


---------45:43----------
this this this that about your weight


---------45:45----------
and like that's really really mentally


---------45:46----------
unhealthy which obviously affects your


---------45:48----------
physical self um and so


---------45:50----------
to me i'm like if you are working


---------45:53----------
towards being mentally and physically


---------45:54----------
healthy like


---------45:56----------
that's what's important like if you


---------45:59----------
if accepting your weight and feeling


---------46:01----------
comfortable where you are


---------46:03----------
improves your mental health it's you


---------46:05----------
know they kind of like go hand in hand


---------46:07----------
and so for me it's like


---------46:10----------
that


---------46:11----------
that is health like you you feel good


---------46:13----------
about your weight you're accepting of it


---------46:15----------
like you're managing it that kind of


---------46:18----------
thing and when i say managing i just


---------46:20----------
mean like


---------46:22----------
you're you're you've like


---------46:23----------
hmm


---------46:29----------
i'm i don't want to say


---------46:31----------
that in order to be


---------46:33----------
healthy


---------46:34----------
you have to like


---------46:38----------
eat less or work out more but like you


---------46:40----------
know you're just like eating well you're


---------46:41----------
feeding your body what it needs


---------46:43----------
i guess and so that might be more for


---------46:45----------
one person than it is for the other


---------46:47----------
person and that's still healthy for them


---------46:49----------
because that's


---------46:50----------
the that's what they need


---------46:52----------
does that make sense yeah i i'm getting


---------46:54----------
this one


---------46:54----------
sorry no it's okay like i i like this is


---------46:57----------
why i was honestly asking for permission


---------46:59----------
because i recognize i could i may have


---------47:01----------
just dropped you off in my mine field


---------47:03----------
said


---------47:04----------
well it's not necessarily that it's just


---------47:06----------
i'm not well versed on this at all you


---------47:08----------
know like in terms of like my


---------47:10----------
my


---------47:11----------
um


---------47:12----------
time at the eating disorder clinic is


---------47:15----------
like i'm on the opposite side of the


---------47:16----------
spectrum so when it comes to you know


---------47:18----------
being overweight i


---------47:20----------
have only seen it in like my family and


---------47:23----------
so yeah definitely i am trying to be


---------47:24----------
careful because i don't want any of my


---------47:26----------
ideas to be misconstrued and ultimately


---------47:30----------
for me it's just about


---------47:32----------
is the individual happy with where they


---------47:34----------
are do they feel mentally healthy and do


---------47:36----------
they feel good about their body if so


---------47:38----------
awesome if not i would be happy to like


---------47:40----------
help support someone to get there


---------47:43----------
so let me let me um


---------47:45----------
make sure i understand you because i


---------47:47----------
want to acknowledge this too so here we


---------47:48----------
are two people who have body types that


---------47:52----------
generally speaking are more acceptable


---------47:54----------
in society that that conform generally


---------47:56----------
speaking to you know a beauty standard


---------47:59----------
that society has and we're commenting


---------48:02----------
about the experience of people that


---------48:05----------
we're not it's like you know two old


---------48:07----------
white men talking about what it's like


---------48:08----------
to be a young black woman right so let's


---------48:10----------
just acknowledge that and i appreciate


---------48:12----------
that acknowledgement part of the reason


---------48:14----------
that i actually asked you is because


---------48:16----------
is because actually we're both separate


---------48:18----------
from it so i'm really curious because


---------48:19----------
you have lived through i think some of


---------48:22----------
the things that are similar


---------48:23----------
to what these people face


---------48:26----------
and so that's why i was kind of curious


---------48:27----------
about because i'm never gonna just like


---------48:29----------
you said i'm never gonna maybe i will


---------48:32----------
but you know i've already grown up being


---------48:35----------
an ectomorphic body type so like


---------48:37----------
throughout high school and stuff i was


---------48:38----------
like super skinny now i have like a


---------48:40----------
solid dad bod which is like you know


---------48:42----------
that's just where i am now but um


---------48:46----------
you know it and maybe there's some


---------48:47----------
amount of acceptance there and an


---------48:49----------
appreciation that i've got a dad bought


---------48:50----------
but


---------48:51----------
you know like i i i really appreciate


---------48:54----------
your carefulness and and your um


---------48:57----------
stating very clearly that you don't know


---------48:59----------
what it's like to live that live in that


---------49:00----------
person's shoes


---------49:02----------
and that's actually why i really also


---------49:04----------
appreciate what you said which is sort


---------49:05----------
of like it's not about kind of an


---------49:07----------
objective right or wrong it's about


---------49:10----------
supporting someone in their journey and


---------49:13----------
kind of trying to help them get to the


---------49:14----------
goals where they're where they want to


---------49:17----------
go right and which i'm with 100


---------49:20----------
and this is something that much like you


---------49:22----------
i've worked with eating disordered


---------49:23----------
patients


---------49:24----------
and and the challenge there though is


---------49:26----------
that i noticed you kind of said like


---------49:28----------
mental health and you said like


---------49:29----------
acceptance


---------49:31----------
but i'm a little bit curious and you


---------49:33----------
kind of will tiptoe out and so i'm going


---------49:34----------
to pin you down a little bit with all


---------49:36----------
those cabinets okay so you kind of said


---------49:38----------
like you know if they're eating food


---------49:39----------
that


---------49:40----------
is what their body needs and to


---------49:42----------
recognize that different people have


---------49:43----------
different caloric requirements and


---------49:44----------
things like that i think like you know


---------49:47----------
uh professional like olympic swimmers


---------49:49----------
will eat like 9 000 calories a day or


---------49:51----------
something ridiculous because that's just


---------49:52----------
what your body needs


---------49:53----------
but what about for people who aren't


---------49:55----------
eating food that's physically healthy


---------49:58----------
in terms of like junk food


---------50:00----------
sure


---------50:01----------
or excessive calories


---------50:03----------
um yeah i mean


---------50:06----------
i can't be one to say like you should or


---------50:10----------
shouldn't do that right it's not my job


---------50:11----------
i'm not their doctor um or their


---------50:14----------
nutritionist or whatever uh


---------50:16----------
but as like i guess if it were my friend


---------50:19----------
who was eating in an unhealthy manner uh


---------50:24----------
i definitely think it kind of depends on


---------50:26----------
what relationship i have with that


---------50:28----------
person but of course like if


---------50:30----------
i could be there to help if they want to


---------50:32----------
have a more healthy lifestyle then i'm


---------50:34----------
like happy to be there supporting that


---------50:35----------
kind of thing but i also know that it's


---------50:37----------
really hard to like


---------50:39----------
force someone to do something that they


---------50:40----------
don't want to do you know and i'm not


---------50:41----------
going to try and be like oh well you


---------50:43----------
should eat less or you should eat


---------50:44----------
healthier you should come to the gym


---------50:45----------
with me or like those kind of things you


---------50:47----------
know because


---------50:48----------
uh unless they've explicitly asked for


---------50:51----------
that kind of support i'm not going to


---------50:53----------
force that on them


---------50:55----------
yeah i think that makes a lot of sense i


---------50:58----------
i really


---------50:59----------
am grateful that you're talking about


---------51:00----------
this because i think it's helped me


---------51:02----------
navigate how i'm going to work with some


---------51:05----------
people that i you know have


---------51:07----------
in a clinical capacity


---------51:09----------
so here's the kind of key takeaway that


---------51:11----------
i have which makes so much sense


---------51:14----------
because i think with eating disorders


---------51:15----------
you know we sort of have an objective


---------51:17----------
right that we're shooting towards as


---------51:19----------
medical professionals that is um


---------51:23----------
kind of independent of their particular


---------51:26----------
views and that's why i get really kind


---------51:28----------
of confused about um how to handle fat


---------51:31----------
shaming versus fat acceptance because i


---------51:33----------
can acknowledge a lot that you know


---------51:34----------
there are unfair beauty standards and


---------51:36----------
things like that so i'm with i'm there


---------51:39----------
uh


---------51:40----------
and at the same time you know one of the


---------51:42----------
most devastating things you could


---------51:45----------
i could say in this kind of situation is


---------51:47----------
that


---------51:48----------
fat acceptance and fat shaming


---------51:50----------
it can be correlated with an eating


---------51:52----------
disorder right so to say take this


---------51:54----------
journey of acceptance and pathologize


---------51:56----------
and say you're sick


---------51:57----------
yeah and at the same time i think after


---------51:59----------
talking to you i now understand that i


---------52:01----------
think it's kind of irrelevant that


---------52:03----------
really the goal is to accept because


---------52:04----------
this is what i do with people who do


---------52:06----------
have eating disorders is you know you


---------52:08----------
accept them for who they are


---------52:10----------
and then you kind of see what they're


---------52:12----------
what they're willing to do what they're


---------52:14----------
interested in doing you you kind of as a


---------52:16----------
trader i try to align my goals i don't


---------52:19----------
determine goals for my patients i align


---------52:21----------
my goals based on what they want


---------52:23----------
and kind of accept them for who they are


---------52:24----------
and where they are and then


---------52:26----------
you know offer an opinion maybe but like


---------52:28----------
not to say that that's


---------52:31----------
you know i mean it is kind of


---------52:33----------
objectively right in some situations


---------52:34----------
like sometimes when i'm working with


---------52:35----------
like hospitalized people who like you


---------52:37----------
know yeah late stages of starvation and


---------52:39----------
stuff but


---------52:41----------
um but even then usually in those cases


---------52:43----------
the more that i can accept where they


---------52:45----------
are and what their goals are the more


---------52:46----------
effective treatment is


---------52:48----------
absolutely i think like patients feel


---------52:50----------
really supported too when that's when


---------52:52----------
that's done


---------52:54----------
yeah accepting and listening of


---------52:56----------
what they want


---------52:57----------
and and i know it sounds kind of weird


---------52:59----------
but sometimes what the conversation


---------53:00----------
turns into is like


---------53:02----------
there are medical consequences to your


---------53:04----------
decision but you are actually allowed to


---------53:05----------
make those medical consequences


---------53:08----------
right it's your choice and if this is


---------53:09----------
the life that you want to live whether


---------53:11----------
it's an alcoholic who's got you know


---------53:13----------
fatty liver disease


---------53:14----------
or a smoker who's you know well on their


---------53:16----------
way to emphysema people get to make


---------53:18----------
choices and they get to make choices


---------53:20----------
that can damage their body and if that's


---------53:23----------
the life that they want to live and now


---------53:24----------
i recognize i'm doing it again because


---------53:26----------
suddenly i'm lumping in fat shaming and


---------53:28----------
fat acceptance with like smoking and


---------53:30----------
things like that that's something i try


---------53:31----------
to avoid


---------53:32----------
um


---------53:33----------
but i i do think that eating fast food


---------53:35----------
let's say you know which is something


---------53:37----------
i'm guilty of from time to time


---------53:40----------
but thank you so much for kind of taking


---------53:41----------
that tangent


---------53:43----------
yeah of course helping i feel like i


---------53:45----------
understand it a lot better


---------53:47----------
um


---------53:49----------
yeah cool so do you want to talk about


---------53:51----------
imposter syndrome or any questions or


---------53:53----------
what do you want to talk about


---------53:55----------
um i don't know i'm pretty open to


---------53:57----------
anything i have like seen you chat about


---------53:59----------
imposter syndrome before so if you're


---------54:01----------
like totally sick of it we could talk


---------54:02----------
about something else too but it's you


---------54:05----------
know i think kills a lot of streamers so


---------54:08----------
yeah so tell me about imposter syndrome


---------54:11----------
why do you think that you have imposter


---------54:12----------
syndrome


---------54:13----------
um i think part of it is like i


---------54:16----------
never expected myself to be here and


---------54:19----------
i kind of like always thought i was


---------54:21----------
gonna be doing something in the medical


---------54:22----------
field or science you know and then to


---------54:23----------
kind of like switch it so quickly it's


---------54:25----------
never too hard


---------54:27----------
yeah well


---------54:28----------
it is never too late and that's you know


---------54:30----------
that's part of my pivot that i was


---------54:32----------
talking about earlier is like i have


---------54:35----------
you know i'm here and i'm doing this but


---------54:37----------
if it ever comes to it i'll just you


---------54:38----------
know pivot to nursing and whatever um


---------54:42----------
but


---------54:43----------
yeah i just always thought one thing for


---------54:45----------
myself and then to switch and have


---------54:46----------
another that i


---------54:49----------
you're kind of like given this idea that


---------54:51----------
you need to dream about whatever it is


---------54:53----------
you're gonna do and you're gonna need to


---------54:55----------
work so hard in school like most of your


---------54:57----------
life to get where you will be as an


---------54:59----------
adult right but like i didn't spend


---------55:02----------
10 years streaming and like building


---------55:04----------
this craft or whatever it is


---------55:07----------
um and so to be where i am now kind of


---------55:09----------
feels like well i didn't work that you


---------55:11----------
know i didn't work that hard where i


---------55:13----------
obviously i did you have to work hard to


---------55:15----------
like


---------55:15----------
stream for the most part


---------55:18----------
um what do you deserve


---------55:22----------
well


---------55:24----------
i feel like i don't deserve most of the


---------55:26----------
things that i have but


---------55:28----------
i think that other people


---------55:30----------
like my friends and my family would look


---------55:32----------
at me and say that i deserve it which is


---------55:34----------
why i try and like reframe my my brain


---------55:36----------
to think so but


---------55:38----------
it's just


---------55:39----------
hard to feel deserving of the life that


---------55:42----------
i get to live now like that i get to


---------55:44----------
wake up and do something that i love


---------55:46----------
every day


---------55:47----------
and be a part of such a cool community


---------55:49----------
and like those kind of things it doesn't


---------55:51----------
necessarily feel like i


---------55:55----------
like i get really awesome opportunities


---------55:57----------
and when they're brought to me i'm like


---------55:59----------
why are you talking why is this for me


---------56:00----------
like why are you bringing this to me or


---------56:03----------
what did i do you know


---------56:06----------
okay which whenever i say it obviously


---------56:08----------
like sounds really silly but it's just a


---------56:10----------
like one of those things in the back of


---------56:12----------
your head that you have to like work


---------56:13----------
through all the time why does it sound


---------56:14----------
silly


---------56:17----------
i don't know i guess like when i when i


---------56:19----------
say it


---------56:20----------
to my to friends or people around me


---------56:22----------
they're always like well you can't


---------56:24----------
you know you can't say that about


---------56:26----------
yourself or you are deserving of what


---------56:27----------
you've done like you've worked really


---------56:28----------
hard and so if people are constantly


---------56:30----------
telling you the opposite then you feel


---------56:32----------
really silly for thinking those things


---------56:34----------
or i feel really silly


---------56:35----------
yeah so let me ask you when


---------56:37----------
you know are your friends accepting you


---------56:40----------
in that moment


---------56:42----------
yeah i definitely think so um i would


---------56:44----------
disagree


---------56:46----------
i think i think they're i don't think


---------56:48----------
they're trying to tell me that i'm being


---------56:49----------
silly i think that they're trying to


---------56:52----------
um combat those


---------56:55----------
negative feelings that i have


---------56:57----------
yeah so are they accepting you


---------57:00----------
or are they combating you


---------57:02----------
okay fair enough fair enough


---------57:05----------
you're interested right


---------57:06----------
yeah i guess i guess that's the way that


---------57:09----------
i deal with it too when my friends come


---------57:10----------
to me so then i'm like oh well i'm doing


---------57:12----------
it wrong too because to me if a friend


---------57:14----------
comes in like oh i don't think i deserve


---------57:16----------
this opportunity i'm like well no of


---------57:18----------
course you do like you worked so hard


---------57:19----------
for this and like blah blah and that's


---------57:21----------
always felt like the right thing


---------57:23----------
yeah so


---------57:25----------
now this is great because we're back


---------57:27----------
back in the black student union


---------57:29----------
yeah right


---------57:30----------
yeah oh of course like everyone deserves


---------57:33----------
it man like oh we work so hard like


---------57:35----------
you're strong and you're independent and


---------57:37----------
you've worked so hard you absolutely


---------57:39----------
deserve it


---------57:40----------
well you're crazy for thinking that you


---------57:42----------
don't deserve it


---------57:44----------
yeah


---------57:45----------
now hold on a second


---------57:47----------
because you've done this before this is


---------57:48----------
your strategy sid


---------57:50----------
you fake it till you make it


---------57:52----------
you're gonna have this internal struggle


---------57:53----------
where a bunch of people are gonna tell


---------57:55----------
you you deserve to be proud and


---------57:56----------
eventually they'll convince you and


---------57:57----------
eventually you'll understand it for


---------57:59----------
yourself and all that kind of good stuff


---------58:00----------
like i think it's good i think it's


---------58:02----------
normal right they're trying to be


---------58:03----------
supportive they care about you yeah i


---------58:04----------
don't think they have negative


---------58:05----------
intentions


---------58:06----------
yeah and at the same time i don't think


---------58:08----------
they're accepting you and it's kind of


---------58:09----------
weird


---------58:12----------
because like


---------58:13----------
and this is where i i'd kind of ask like


---------58:15----------
do people get what they deserve


---------58:20----------
sometimes i'm sure other times i'm sure


---------58:23----------
not


---------58:24----------
and so it's kind of interesting because


---------58:26----------
if if people if you're saying you know


---------58:28----------
if the structure of your imposter


---------58:30----------
syndrome is i don't deserve this there


---------58:31----------
are two things


---------58:32----------
one is you can convince yourself that


---------58:34----------
you deserve it


---------58:35----------
or


---------58:36----------
or


---------58:37----------
you can say so what


---------58:43----------
why do you need to deserve it like why


---------58:45----------
can't you just


---------58:46----------
like i don't deserve i honestly said


---------58:49----------
just between me and you i don't deserve


---------58:50----------
90 of what i've got


---------58:53----------
like i really don't and i don't think i


---------58:55----------
say that out of like shame i think it's


---------58:57----------
just true


---------58:58----------
like my kids are amazing


---------59:00----------
like i have not done


---------59:02----------
that much good in the universe to


---------59:04----------
deserve having my kids in fact i don't


---------59:07----------
even deserve the professional


---------59:11----------
success that i have to be honest i


---------59:12----------
 up royally like most people


---------59:15----------
up really royally until the age of 26


---------59:17----------
and 27 and they don't get to wind up


---------59:19----------
where i am


---------59:21----------
i don't think i actually deserve it i


---------59:22----------
think i'm lucky


---------59:25----------
what do you think about that


---------59:28----------
i have questions good um


---------59:31----------
one i'm curious if


---------59:34----------
like does that feel like you're


---------59:35----------
discrediting yourself


---------59:37----------
no i forget the things that you've done


---------59:40----------
no i think it's actually accurately


---------59:41----------
crediting myself


---------59:44----------
so i think that the credit that i


---------59:46----------
deserve is the effort that i put in


---------59:49----------
it's not the outcome it's not the


---------59:51----------
success


---------59:53----------
what i get credit for is applying to


---------59:54----------
medical school three times in a row and


---------59:56----------
not giving up


---------59:58----------
but the third time if i didn't get in i


---------60:00----------
mean i didn't get in the first two times


---------60:02----------
so like i don't think i deserved to get


---------60:04----------
in the third time does that make sense


---------60:08----------
kind of yeah


---------60:10----------
so you're


---------60:12----------
yeah i had another question but now i


---------60:13----------
can't really remember it so


---------60:15----------
so i know it's kind of a weird way of


---------60:18----------
thinking because it's clear to me you've


---------60:19----------
done a lot and i think your strategy


---------60:20----------
will work people will eventually


---------60:22----------
convince you that you deserve it


---------60:24----------
yeah if you keep getting brainwashed


---------60:27----------
it'll happen


---------60:28----------
and then you'll have it


---------60:31----------
worked once it'll work again


---------60:34----------
and at the same time i know it sounds


---------60:35----------
kind of weird but like


---------60:37----------
you know if you get something that you


---------60:39----------
deserve i know it's weird but it's like


---------60:42----------
in a weird way it's hard to feel


---------60:43----------
grateful for it


---------60:45----------
and if we think about where resentment


---------60:47----------
comes from it's not getting what you


---------60:49----------
deserve


---------60:51----------
you know so i would say oddly enough


---------60:53----------
like you can we can try to convince you


---------60:55----------
like oh like sid you're strong you're a


---------60:57----------
strong black woman like you deserve it


---------60:58----------
like the world has denied it to you


---------61:00----------
you've worked so hard and like you


---------61:02----------
absolutely deserve your success like i'm


---------61:03----------
totally fine with that line of reasoning


---------61:04----------
i really am


---------61:07----------
i think what you


---------61:09----------
but i i think even if you don't deserve


---------61:11----------
what you have like you can still be


---------61:12----------
grateful for it and be like i lucked out


---------61:15----------
that's a pass for me


---------61:16----------
i'm going to try to help other people


---------61:18----------
and like there there are people people


---------61:21----------
who have been you know transformative in


---------61:22----------
my life and like people who inspired me


---------61:24----------
to become a twitch street streamer i


---------61:26----------
actually don't deserve the success i


---------61:27----------
have on twitch but i'll take it i'll be


---------61:29----------
grateful for it and i'll


---------61:32----------
try to make the world a better place


---------61:33----------
with the platform that i have


---------61:35----------
what do you think about i think


---------61:37----------
i think that particular reasoning is so


---------61:40----------
hard for me to kind of break what i've


---------61:43----------
told myself my entire life in terms of


---------61:45----------
like autonomy


---------61:47----------
you know how we spoke about it earlier


---------61:48----------
it's like very much like well i if i


---------61:51----------
want to get somewhere i have the power


---------61:53----------
to do that you know so then the whole


---------61:55----------
like luck thing is really hard


---------61:57----------
to


---------61:58----------
fit into this idea that i've always had


---------62:00----------
you know and i'm not saying that i'm


---------62:02----------
opposed to it i'm absolutely not opposed


---------62:04----------
to it all super open-minded those type


---------62:06----------
of things it's just more like um


---------62:10----------
i'm going against the grain in thinking


---------62:12----------
that way or it's a little bit harder for


---------62:14----------
me to think that way which i'm willing


---------62:15----------
to do love it love it so here's what i


---------62:17----------
love so much about your response so


---------62:20----------
generally speaking


---------62:21----------
if we think about growth


---------62:23----------
growth is actually stepping away from


---------62:26----------
the things that we used to believe


---------62:29----------
right so like it's kind of i mean i i'm


---------62:32----------
sure that sort of makes sense but a lot


---------62:33----------
of times like growth is is people and


---------62:35----------
this is kind of what we


---------62:37----------
you know what i've seen in people who


---------62:38----------
are successful is that what gets them to


---------62:41----------
their point of success becomes


---------62:42----------
maladaptive at some point


---------62:45----------
and that is as people continue to like


---------62:46----------
grow and become more successful they


---------62:48----------
have to let go of the things that got


---------62:50----------
them there which is terrifying so one of


---------62:53----------
my supervisors once told me that growing


---------62:55----------
up is literally giving up what used to


---------62:57----------
work


---------62:59----------
so i'm with you that at some point you


---------63:01----------
had to sort of discover that confidence


---------63:03----------
comes from autonomy


---------63:05----------
but i think actually we can squeeze in


---------63:07----------
if we don't want to talk about luck but


---------63:08----------
like you know i think there's some


---------63:10----------
philosophy here but i think the key


---------63:12----------
thing here is i think what you can what


---------63:13----------
you have autonomy in is your choices not


---------63:16----------
the outcomes what do you think about


---------63:17----------
that


---------63:21----------
i agree i feel like my


---------63:24----------
choices


---------63:26----------
like dictate the outcomes you know like


---------63:28----------
it's like a causal relationship which is


---------63:31----------
not necessarily


---------63:33----------
true sometimes i can work so hard and


---------63:35----------
nothing will come of it or i can work


---------63:37----------
really hard and something will come of


---------63:39----------
it you know there's it really can go


---------63:41----------
other ways it's just easier for me to


---------63:44----------
think that like if i work really hard


---------63:46----------
then it's gonna be really great you know


---------63:49----------
there you go


---------63:50----------
that's the problem and you've just


---------63:52----------
figured it out yeah your mind chooses


---------63:54----------
the easy route because otherwise the


---------63:57----------
world is a terrifying place


---------63:59----------
yes


---------64:00----------
yeah right the idea that it's out of my


---------64:03----------
control really is terrifying


---------64:06----------
yeah


---------64:08----------
but


---------64:08----------
let me explain something to you said


---------64:10----------
you know i'm not that i don't really


---------64:12----------
understand this stuff maybe you can go


---------64:14----------
ask an actually successful twitch


---------64:15----------
streamer


---------64:16----------
but i would argue that you actually


---------64:18----------
can't control who shows up when you


---------64:21----------
stream


---------64:23----------
and if we're saying success means like


---------64:25----------
how many people are watching you can't


---------64:26----------
control that all you can control is like


---------64:29----------
clicking the go live button


---------64:32----------
what you're wearing you can control what


---------64:34----------
you play you can control what you say


---------64:36----------
you can control the attitude that you


---------64:38----------
bring you can control but you can't


---------64:40----------
control who shows up


---------64:42----------
yeah and it's absolutely a terrifying


---------64:45----------
way to think about life because what i'm


---------64:46----------
asking you to do is actually


---------64:48----------
not surrender your autonomy technically


---------64:51----------
because you still have choice but you


---------64:53----------
don't you get to you know if you're


---------64:55----------
crushing on someone and you ask them out


---------64:57----------
that you get to control


---------64:59----------
whether they say yes or not you don't


---------65:01----------
deserve


---------65:03----------
and if you understand half the


---------65:05----------
resentment of the internet it's crushing


---------65:07----------
on someone and


---------65:08----------
you know not getting the answer that


---------65:09----------
they want to that they want right yeah


---------65:13----------
so i'm i'm with you i'm i'm happy to


---------65:14----------
hear that you're saying you know i don't


---------65:16----------
quite accept that like i'm not ready


---------65:17----------
like i'm open to it but i'm not which is


---------65:19----------
great i don't think you should accept it


---------65:21----------
i think you should think about it


---------65:22----------
yeah no i definitely think i i am


---------65:25----------
thinking about it i guess um


---------65:27----------
one of my things and like i hate to use


---------65:29----------
the term but i would definitely consider


---------65:31----------
myself a control freak and so i work


---------65:34----------
really hard like those say that


---------65:36----------
situation where it's like i'm crushing


---------65:38----------
on someone i would not


---------65:40----------
say anything until i knew that the


---------65:42----------
answer was like 99 gonna be yes and if i


---------65:46----------
knew it was 99 gonna be no i wouldn't


---------65:48----------
say anything so i like put myself in


---------65:50----------
positions where the risk is really low


---------65:53----------
and i've like pretty much always lived


---------65:55----------
my life that way until it came to


---------65:58----------
jumping into streaming that's like the


---------65:59----------
riskiest


---------66:01----------
choice i've ever made for sure and it


---------66:04----------
feels like the only one


---------66:06----------
and how did that what was your


---------66:07----------
experience of jumping into streaming


---------66:09----------
it worked out fantastically


---------66:12----------
um


---------66:13----------
i


---------66:14----------
obviously there's like lots of you know


---------66:15----------
downsides to streaming and whatever else


---------66:18----------
but like


---------66:19----------
i'm the happiest i've ever been so i


---------66:21----------
took a risk and it really worked out but


---------66:25----------
it could have failed


---------66:26----------
it could have


---------66:28----------
it's still but then why would you do


---------66:30----------
that


---------66:32----------
i guess because i was


---------66:34----------
i don't know if i was confident i guess


---------66:36----------
it was just like no matter what i'm


---------66:37----------
gonna be okay even if it fails i know i


---------66:40----------
can do something else but what i've


---------66:42----------
prepared myself


---------66:45----------
well i don't know it it went out the


---------66:46----------
window for that one decision for that


---------66:48----------
one singular decision i just


---------66:50----------
left it up to chance and


---------66:53----------
what do you think about using that


---------66:55----------
strategy again was that just a one-off


---------66:57----------
or you think maybe sounds terrifying


---------67:02----------
that sounds terrible


---------67:04----------
i don't want to do it again it happened


---------67:06----------
this one time there's no way it happens


---------67:08----------
twice


---------67:09----------
ah you lucked out


---------67:14----------
i might have i might have


---------67:16----------
right so


---------67:18----------
because you you certainly didn't deserve


---------67:19----------
it


---------67:21----------
right it doesn't feel like it no to my


---------67:23----------
standards it doesn't feel like it and i


---------67:25----------
i would i know some kind of sound kind


---------67:27----------
of weird right


---------67:28----------
i agree with you


---------67:30----------
you don't deserve it


---------67:32----------
i don't think you deserve success on


---------67:34----------
twitch


---------67:35----------
i think what you're entitled to is what


---------67:36----------
you choose to do


---------67:38----------
so i don't applaud the if you want me to


---------67:40----------
cheer for you you want me to say you go


---------67:42----------
girl i'm not going to say it because


---------67:44----------
you're successful on twitch i'll say it


---------67:46----------
because you decided to step away from


---------67:48----------
from nursing and hit the go go live


---------67:50----------
button for that i'm 100 in your corner


---------67:55----------
whether people show up or not is like


---------67:58----------
that's not up to you


---------68:00----------
yeah and so what i judge you for what i


---------68:02----------
value you for what i respect you for


---------68:05----------
is not your success it's for your


---------68:06----------
choices


---------68:09----------
what do you think about that


---------68:13----------
i think it feels good because so much of


---------68:17----------
the way that we are taught to value


---------68:19----------
people in this society is based off of


---------68:21----------
success so to be valued


---------68:24----------
off of something else feels good as


---------68:27----------
counter-intuitive as it may seem like oh


---------68:28----------
you told me that i don't deserve this


---------68:30----------
you know i'm sure chad d colin what the


---------68:32----------
heck whatever you know but


---------68:34----------
ultimately like


---------68:36----------
you're saying that


---------68:39----------
you're proud of me for doing something


---------68:40----------
outside of my comfort zone for taking


---------68:42----------
that risk whatever it is rather than


---------68:44----------
like


---------68:45----------
proud of the success which feels good


---------68:47----------
because i had autonomy in the choices


---------68:49----------
that i made but no autonomy and a


---------68:51----------
success


---------68:52----------
yeah


---------68:53----------
and so then now we have to talk about


---------68:55----------
the fun stuff which is like


---------68:56----------
so you don't have to answer this if you


---------68:58----------
don't want to but you know since you


---------68:59----------
mentioned that you're not going to ask


---------69:00----------
someone out until you're 99 sure they're


---------69:02----------
going to say yes


---------69:04----------
you know are you in a relationship right


---------69:06----------
now do you feel comfortable answering


---------69:07----------
that


---------69:08----------
um i'm not i'm seeing someone yes okay


---------69:12----------
so like is it okay if we talk a little


---------69:14----------
bit about and you can say no i can see


---------69:16----------
you


---------69:17----------
so maybe we should i should


---------69:18----------
i just haven't told my chat so if my


---------69:20----------
chat's in here and they're like


---------69:22----------
so that's all no i'm not so concerned


---------69:25----------
about the details of your personal life


---------69:27----------
what i think it's a really good um


---------69:30----------
what i what i think is useful is that


---------69:33----------
rigging the odds in your favor


---------69:35----------
because when it comes to romantic


---------69:37----------
interactions boy do we do that


---------69:39----------
and what i want to have a conversation


---------69:41----------
about is like not so much the details of


---------69:43----------
what's going on but like what was in


---------69:45----------
your head in that process


---------69:47----------
of like approaching in early phases how


---------69:49----------
did you try to stack the deck


---------69:51----------
why does the deck need to be stacked why


---------69:53----------
do you have to wait until 99 percent to


---------69:55----------
like shoot your shot


---------69:56----------
because i'm a terrified projection


---------69:59----------
okay


---------70:00----------
what does that mean


---------70:02----------
that means that like literally worst


---------70:04----------
case scenario this person is not as


---------70:07----------
interested in me as i am in them or


---------70:10----------
whatever else and


---------70:12----------
that would put me in shambles so


---------70:14----------
how does that put you in shambles


---------70:16----------
i don't know because i just don't


---------70:19----------
um


---------70:21----------
i know not to take it personally right


---------70:23----------
like it's probably don't


---------70:26----------
well


---------70:28----------
i don't know how to explain it like it


---------70:30----------
doesn't feel good no one likes to be


---------70:32----------
rejected right it doesn't feel good to


---------70:34----------
be rejected so i don't want to be


---------70:35----------
rejected there you go but don't feed me


---------70:38----------
that line of that you were


---------70:40----------
going down a second ago


---------70:42----------
well what the thing that me and my i


---------70:44----------
like try and tell myself is like if


---------70:46----------
someone rejects me


---------70:48----------
it's not a me thing it's because it's


---------70:50----------
like wrong time or like whatever else


---------70:53----------
you know unless someone is like


---------70:54----------
explicitly like i don't want to date you


---------70:56----------
because xyz then obviously i'm like okay


---------70:59----------
this is a me thing and whatever but in a


---------71:02----------
way to cope with rejection oh


---------71:06----------
hold on


---------71:07----------
so if someone says it's a you thing how


---------71:09----------
would you feel


---------71:11----------
i would be like damn that really sucks


---------71:14----------
uh now i need to take a look at like why


---------71:16----------
xyz is so bad or i didn't know xyz so


---------71:20----------
let's fix xyz if i think it needs to be


---------71:22----------
fixed if it's someone like i don't like


---------71:24----------
the way you organize your shoes like


---------71:25----------
whatever like okay whatever but if it's


---------71:27----------
a really valid reason that someone


---------71:29----------
doesn't like me then


---------71:31----------
just just think about what you said


---------71:33----------
because that's brilliant


---------71:35----------
right so you're saying like if i get the


---------71:37----------
fear of getting rejected i'm going to


---------71:40----------
assume it's going to feel personal but


---------71:42----------
if someone actually told you no and it's


---------71:44----------
because of something personal your


---------71:46----------
response to that is crushing it


---------71:48----------
dude


---------71:49----------
it's like i'm going to do some self i'm


---------71:50----------
going to do some introspection i'm going


---------71:52----------
to see like is this something i actually


---------71:53----------
want to change you're not actually going


---------71:54----------
to wind up in shambles if someone


---------71:56----------
personally rejects you


---------71:59----------
yeah i guess it would still suck though


---------72:01----------
like it would feel really bad


---------72:03----------
i'm with you that it'll feel bad but i


---------72:06----------
also want to point out that if someone


---------72:07----------
actually rejected you as a person


---------72:11----------
i think you're going to handle it


---------72:13----------
bizarrely well


---------72:14----------
yeah i would explore those feelings like


---------72:16----------
why


---------72:18----------
is it something that's valid do i agree


---------72:20----------
should i be working on this


---------72:22----------
whatever else yeah which which doesn't


---------72:25----------
sound like shambles to me


---------72:27----------
now i'm not doubting that you'll wind up


---------72:29----------
in shambles we'll get there in a second


---------72:31----------
and we'll wind up in shambles but but


---------72:33----------
let's just understand that if the


---------72:34----------
scenario that you are so afraid of


---------72:37----------
actually does happen i think you'll


---------72:38----------
actually handle it pretty well


---------72:41----------
yeah i'd be all right but if you get


---------72:42----------
rejected you'll you'll wind up in


---------72:44----------
shambles and we'll get to that that'll


---------72:45----------
just do with self-confidence and


---------72:46----------
imposter syndrome and all that crap


---------72:48----------
okay we'll get there a second but can we


---------72:50----------
acknowledge for a second that instead of


---------72:52----------
feeding me the line of bs which is like


---------72:53----------
oh like don't take it personally no


---------72:55----------
you'd like if if you did take it


---------72:56----------
personally if someone said this is a you


---------72:58----------
thing


---------72:59----------
you would actually introspect you'd


---------73:01----------
pivot it's actually what makes you


---------73:03----------
awesome right you'd like come out of


---------73:05----------
that kind of badass because you're


---------73:06----------
someone who takes feedback and works on


---------73:08----------
yourself and you try to like be a good


---------73:09----------
person and all that


---------73:11----------
you know so that's good so if someone


---------73:14----------
you know with a particular person like


---------73:16----------
what is the thought of someone saying no


---------73:18----------
like what is that how does that make you


---------73:19----------
feel


---------73:22----------
um


---------73:23----------
i mean yeah i guess i


---------73:26----------
would take it personally uh because


---------73:30----------
yeah it's probably a me thing


---------73:32----------
but i i that's also expecting someone to


---------73:35----------
tell me like a lot of people just say


---------73:38----------
random right like i


---------73:40----------
i am expecting that person to be like


---------73:42----------
yeah this isn't gonna work out because


---------73:44----------
blank you know where as i feel like a


---------73:46----------
lot of the time people are like this


---------73:47----------
isn't going to work out and then i'm


---------73:48----------
sitting there like well why is it going


---------73:50----------
to work out what did i do and it's like


---------73:52----------
this really deep dark ugly hole that i


---------73:54----------
don't want to go down okay


---------73:56----------
now we're getting somewhere right so


---------73:57----------
when someone doesn't give you a reason


---------73:59----------
when there's a question mark what does


---------74:01----------
your mind do


---------74:03----------
oh i would be haunted for like years to


---------74:06----------
come


---------74:06----------
okay so let's think about that for a


---------74:08----------
second so like this is going to be kind


---------74:10----------
of weird okay said because we're


---------74:12----------
okay


---------74:13----------
where does your mind know how to fill in


---------74:16----------
that question mark


---------74:18----------
like where where does it you know


---------74:20----------
because it could be like


---------74:24----------
you know because like when when when we


---------74:25----------
are faced with a question mark in life


---------74:27----------
our mind supplies us with answers yeah


---------74:30----------
yeah so where does all that stuff come


---------74:32----------
from like what kind of things would you


---------74:34----------
have


---------74:35----------
it would be stuff that i've seen in like


---------74:36----------
tv or movie


---------74:38----------
tv or movies it would be like what i've


---------74:40----------
seen happen in my like with my friends


---------74:42----------
or with my family or like reasons why


---------74:45----------
you know they've been dumped or whatever


---------74:47----------
tell me tell me i mean don't oh you know


---------74:50----------
no no violating a privacy or anything


---------74:51----------
but yeah yeah


---------74:54----------
yeah so um


---------74:56----------
i guess i've seen like on so i watch a


---------74:58----------
 ton of reality tv shows


---------75:00----------
specifically baby ones it is my vice


---------75:04----------
it is my advice love island binges for


---------75:06----------
12 hours at a time okay


---------75:09----------
so i


---------75:11----------
the disappointment in your face but like


---------75:13----------
i'll see people like yeah it's not gonna


---------75:15----------
work out because you are too hot-headed


---------75:18----------
or something like that right then i'm


---------75:19----------
like oh my god am i too hot-headed i


---------75:21----------
know that's not true so what's the next


---------75:22----------
one um is it because i'm not emotionally


---------75:26----------
available well that very well might be


---------75:27----------
true um so i would assume something like


---------75:30----------
that or


---------75:31----------
uh i


---------75:33----------
am not


---------75:35----------
vulnerable enough is like okay now i'm


---------75:37----------
just like


---------75:39----------
telling you my relationship fears


---------75:42----------
um i'm scared yeah i'm not vulnerable


---------75:44----------
enough with my partner or


---------75:47----------
um


---------75:49----------
something like i'm really scared to be


---------75:51----------
boring i'm really scared to bore my


---------75:53----------
partner


---------75:54----------
uh okay


---------75:56----------
so now


---------75:57----------
so yeah so you


---------76:00----------
good job


---------76:02----------
you're telling me your emotional


---------76:05----------
this has nothing to do with them it has


---------76:08----------
nothing to do with the reason they


---------76:09----------
rejected you what your mind fills in


---------76:12----------
is coming from you


---------76:18----------
right so why do we fear


---------76:20----------
fail like because like because here's


---------76:22----------
the thing


---------76:23----------
if you stack the odds in your favor and


---------76:25----------
they say yes what happens to all your


---------76:27----------
doubts about your emotional availability


---------76:29----------
and you're scared to be boring and all


---------76:30----------
that crap


---------76:31----------
they say yes what happens to all those


---------76:33----------
insecurities


---------76:34----------
i mean they're definitely still there


---------76:36----------
they're just kind of like


---------76:38----------
subsided for the moment that they're


---------76:40----------
like


---------76:41----------
yeah damn right and then if if i'm just


---------76:44----------
gonna assume a heteronormative


---------76:46----------
perspective for a moment so like if if


---------76:48----------
you text him over a weekend and he


---------76:49----------
doesn't respond what happens to those


---------76:51----------
dormant fears


---------76:53----------
they just pop right back up there we go


---------76:55----------
yeah so when you stack the odds in your


---------76:58----------
favor and you trick them into saying yes


---------77:01----------
in the back of your mind


---------77:02----------
we're gonna act


---------77:04----------
we're gonna put on this act we're gonna


---------77:05----------
be look at you like in the first 30


---------77:07----------
seconds what did i say about you look at


---------77:09----------
how lively you are


---------77:10----------
heaven forbid you appear to be boring


---------77:13----------
oh my goodness


---------77:16----------
right


---------77:17----------
yeah


---------77:18----------
and so as long as you like stack the


---------77:19----------
odds in your favor i know this is kind


---------77:21----------
of weird but you're actually


---------77:22----------
hamstringing yourself in terms of


---------77:24----------
developing confidence


---------77:26----------
because if you put on this show and you


---------77:28----------
like work extra hard to not be you


---------77:30----------
because heaven forbid they see all that


---------77:32----------
ugliness on the inside so i'm going to


---------77:33----------
put on this act i would make sure that


---------77:35----------
this person is going to say yes


---------77:36----------
but then it's tricky because like


---------77:39----------
when you say you're kind of not


---------77:40----------
emotionally available i think what your


---------77:41----------
it sounds like what you're not


---------77:43----------
comfortable doing is being vulnerable in


---------77:44----------
a relationship


---------77:47----------
and then


---------77:49----------
you know


---------77:51----------
i don't know exactly where i'm going


---------77:52----------
with this but it feels


---------77:54----------
like it's in the right direction if yeah


---------77:56----------
it does for me too yes


---------78:01----------
i feel like i should give you some kind


---------78:02----------
of answer instead of just


---------78:04----------
making you feel naked on stream


---------78:06----------
no no it's okay it's okay i i will help


---------78:09----------
you just give me a second fair enough


---------78:13----------
i ended up so this is the problem when i


---------78:15----------
tend to be right is like usually when


---------78:17----------
i'm wrong i can ask more questions


---------78:20----------
but when i say things and it seems to be


---------78:22----------
right i like hit the end of the train


---------78:23----------
like way too quickly so you got to give


---------78:25----------
me any any thoughts or questions about


---------78:27----------
this


---------78:28----------
um


---------78:29----------
no i guess it's like uh yeah one of


---------78:32----------
those you pulled the table cloth out and


---------78:36----------
like


---------78:36----------
everything kind of shattered not really


---------78:39----------
not in a bad way but just sort of like


---------78:40----------
oh yeah well these insecurities are my


---------78:43----------
own and i'm projecting them into like


---------78:46----------
the way that i handle


---------78:48----------
relationships or like these fears are


---------78:50----------
never going to go away no matter how


---------78:51----------
much validation i get from my partner


---------78:53----------
it's like a band-aid it feels like a


---------78:56----------
band-aid


---------78:57----------
okay now we're gonna no no they will go


---------78:59----------
away they're absolutely okay but what


---------79:02----------
you need to get from your partner is not


---------79:04----------
validation


---------79:06----------
because here's the thing like what you


---------79:07----------
need to get like what you like here's


---------79:09----------
the problem you can't if you're tricking


---------79:11----------
someone into falling in love with you


---------79:13----------
sid


---------79:14----------
stacking the odds 99 in your favor


---------79:16----------
you're gonna do your hair cute you're


---------79:17----------
gonna look cute and it's gonna be great


---------79:18----------
and like he's not he's not gonna know


---------79:20----------
what hit him like all that stuff is


---------79:21----------
fantastic but then the problem is that


---------79:23----------
like you can never have confidence that


---------79:25----------
he's into you


---------79:28----------
right because it's the odds stacked in


---------79:30----------
your favor because you've compensated in


---------79:33----------
your mind the more you stack the odds in


---------79:35----------
your favor the more you're compensating


---------79:37----------
for all the negative stuff


---------79:39----------
and so if he says yes why did he say yes


---------79:41----------
is it because of the way that you stack


---------79:42----------
the odds or is it because


---------79:45----------
does that make sense


---------79:47----------
yeah i guess one thing that i do want to


---------79:50----------
say is like the whole stacking the odds


---------79:51----------
and the favor thing feels very


---------79:53----------
preliminary for me like


---------79:55----------
once i'm past that


---------79:57----------
initial


---------79:58----------
like


---------80:00----------
i'm equally like i'm interested in this


---------80:02----------
person and that they're equally


---------80:03----------
interested in


---------80:05----------
me


---------80:06----------
like that stuff kind of goes out the


---------80:07----------
window like i but i also feel like


---------80:10----------
everybody puts on their best face when


---------80:12----------
they're like beginning dating someone


---------80:14----------
yeah i'm not saying like it makes sense


---------80:16----------
you know be slovenly


---------80:20----------
you go out you know but but so so that's


---------80:22----------
a really good point so like what happens


---------80:24----------
is you start to stack the odds in your


---------80:25----------
favor right like they say yes now you


---------80:27----------
feel reassured you can show them a


---------80:29----------
little bit more and then we get to your


---------80:31----------
other fears which is like you're not


---------80:32----------
emotionally available you're scared to


---------80:34----------
be bored


---------80:35----------
and you know whatever and so then i


---------80:37----------
think the next thing is is that if we


---------80:39----------
like talk about relationships and if


---------80:40----------
you're dating someone at some point


---------80:42----------
you're gonna have like


---------80:44----------
level two of that thing i don't know how


---------80:47----------
else to put it but you're gonna have an


---------80:48----------
opportunity to stack the odds in your


---------80:51----------
favor and not show something


---------80:54----------
or


---------80:54----------
be vulnerable for a moment and give the


---------80:57----------
other person a chance to accept or


---------80:59----------
reject you


---------81:00----------
and the confidence comes when you


---------81:03----------
actually like put yourself out there


---------81:06----------
and give him a chance to reject you


---------81:09----------
yeah


---------81:10----------
right so like


---------81:12----------
show and that can be incredibly


---------81:14----------
terrifying because you don't actually


---------81:15----------
know like you know the thought


---------81:18----------
that


---------81:19----------
you'll be rejected for all of these


---------81:20----------
things that you because you're afraid


---------81:22----------
right and you don't ever want to give


---------81:24----------
yourself a situation where you will be


---------81:26----------
proved correct


---------81:27----------
because right now you've got doubt on


---------81:29----------
your side baby


---------81:30----------
you could be wrong it's all my


---------81:32----------
insecurities thank god it's not real


---------81:35----------
it's just my insecurities but if you


---------81:37----------
ever take a chance


---------81:39----------
and it turns out that your insecurities


---------81:41----------
are real


---------81:42----------
then you're sol


---------81:44----------
with me


---------81:46----------
yeah


---------81:47----------
so it's it's the trickiest thing in the


---------81:48----------
world but like we can never like this is


---------81:50----------
what paralyzes people is that


---------81:53----------
the insecurities that we have we never


---------81:55----------
really give people an authentic chance


---------81:58----------
to like


---------81:59----------
it's not about validation it's about


---------82:01----------
like testing them


---------82:03----------
and instead when you tell your friends


---------82:05----------
all they're going to do is reassure you


---------82:07----------
what does that do to your reassure your


---------82:09----------
insecurities


---------82:11----------
it's like a band-aid fix again yep and


---------82:14----------
they'll come back


---------82:15----------
yeah and so when i asked you about


---------82:16----------
developing confidence when you say fake


---------82:18----------
it till you make it like i think you


---------82:19----------
made something there's something very


---------82:21----------
real there


---------82:22----------
i don't think they just convinced you i


---------82:24----------
think that on some way there is


---------82:25----------
conditioning right so they started to


---------82:27----------
tell you particular things and this is


---------82:28----------
where you know honestly if i you know i


---------82:30----------
hope i can authentically be like oh my


---------82:32----------
god you're watching dating shows because


---------82:33----------
this is where there may be a real thing


---------82:35----------
going on which is that if your mind like


---------82:37----------
i know it sounds weird but we do get


---------82:39----------
conditioned by what we're exposed to so


---------82:41----------
in the case of black student union you


---------82:43----------
got exposed to like tons of like


---------82:45----------
positive language and so you started to


---------82:47----------
like really test it for yourself i don't


---------82:49----------
actually think that dating i mean i


---------82:51----------
would i would be curious but i don't i


---------82:52----------
don't think it's really the dating


---------82:54----------
show's fault but i would be curious if


---------82:56----------
you kind of cut back on the dating shows


---------82:58----------
or you even acknowledged that this is


---------83:00----------
the dating show talking


---------83:02----------
and see its effect on your mind whether


---------83:04----------
that would help


---------83:06----------
but those things don't even approximate


---------83:08----------
reality right


---------83:09----------
no


---------83:10----------
okay yeah no it's all


---------83:14----------
yeah i don't know i guess like


---------83:17----------
it's stuff that i've always watched


---------83:19----------
though like


---------83:20----------
even when i was younger i would i


---------83:22----------
watched like


---------83:23----------
i don't know next in parental control


---------83:25----------
and like all of that garbage um


---------83:28----------
so it's hard for me to say


---------83:30----------
what it


---------83:32----------
the take that i would have on


---------83:33----------
relationships if i wasn't watching it


---------83:36----------
yeah i mean


---------83:37----------
i i gotta say


---------83:39----------
the more that i think about it the more


---------83:40----------
i think i'm just kind of memeing with


---------83:42----------
you that i don't really think i mean


---------83:43----------
because it sounds like your insecurities


---------83:45----------
are based on real experiences actually


---------83:47----------
which is what they usually are


---------83:49----------
yeah because


---------83:50----------
you know


---------83:51----------
because i


---------83:53----------
something tells me that


---------83:55----------
you know being emotionally unavailable


---------83:57----------
is not like what


---------83:59----------
they demonstrate on dating shows


---------84:03----------
yeah i guess sometimes like when i see


---------84:06----------
there's definitely like a season that i


---------84:08----------
was watching with my friends and there


---------84:09----------
was this girl who like could not share


---------84:11----------
her feelings i was like oh my god like


---------84:13----------
my friends were like oh look it's you


---------84:14----------
you know like those kind of things and


---------84:15----------
it's like yeah that's uh yeah that's me


---------84:18----------
um or but it is an experience that i've


---------84:20----------
had


---------84:21----------
on my own in dating and then it's like


---------84:24----------
you just see it in someone else and


---------84:27----------
you're like oh that's how i act that's


---------84:29----------
crazy ah so maybe this is a chicken or


---------84:31----------
egg issue because maybe it's not the


---------84:33----------
dating shows that condition you


---------84:36----------
but maybe it's your own because that's


---------84:38----------
that's why we watch twitch right that's


---------84:40----------
why people actually watch this channel


---------84:41----------
it's because the people on here are like


---------84:44----------
representations of what we ourselves


---------84:46----------
experience


---------84:47----------
yeah


---------84:48----------
so i i'm so now i think if we want to


---------84:51----------
try to make this productive because now


---------84:52----------
for some reason i'm feeling bad


---------84:54----------
um oh


---------84:56----------
i'm not quite sure why but so i want to


---------84:59----------
try to help you be more emotionally


---------85:00----------
available


---------85:03----------
what do you think gets in the way of you


---------85:05----------
being emotionally unavailable


---------85:07----------
or emotionally available what makes it


---------85:09----------
hard for you


---------85:10----------
um i think there's a lot of things if


---------85:13----------
i'm getting super personal about it two


---------85:15----------
things in my life come to mind first


---------85:18----------
one is that my mom and watching her date


---------85:22----------
so like my dad and my mom separated when


---------85:24----------
i was young like three or something like


---------85:26----------
that and there


---------85:28----------
have my mom has like been in and out of


---------85:30----------
love a lot of


---------85:31----------
times growing up and so


---------85:33----------
i was constantly witnessing her


---------85:36----------
put her heart on like she wears her


---------85:38----------
heart on her sleeve right she's very


---------85:39----------
emotionally available like


---------85:42----------
um upfront about those kind of things


---------85:44----------
and i just saw


---------85:46----------
it not work out so often


---------85:48----------
that it made me go well i need to be the


---------85:50----------
complete opposite and i don't want


---------85:53----------
i don't want to go through like what my


---------85:55----------
mom went through you know


---------85:57----------
so that's one of them and then i think


---------85:58----------
the other one is this strong independent


---------86:01----------
black woman box that i'm supposed to


---------86:03----------
live in


---------86:04----------
um makes me feel like if i am vulnerable


---------86:08----------
and open or like weak you know like


---------86:12----------
that's seen as weak it's the opposite of


---------86:14----------
like this box that i'm supposed to be a


---------86:16----------
part of


---------86:17----------
um


---------86:19----------
and so it makes it


---------86:20----------
really uncomfortable and hard for me to


---------86:23----------
express the way that i feel


---------86:29----------
damn you are introspective


---------86:31----------
you're good at this


---------86:33----------
thank you


---------86:37----------
it's like speed running


---------86:41----------
okay


---------86:48----------
all right so i've got three things for


---------86:50----------
you


---------86:50----------
number one i think it's it's makes sense


---------86:53----------
right so


---------86:55----------
you saw firsthand over and over and over


---------86:58----------
again the consequences of being


---------87:00----------
emotionally available


---------87:02----------
and you were like this is a bad strategy


---------87:05----------
it leads to suffering


---------87:07----------
and so we're not going to do that so i i


---------87:09----------
think oddly enough


---------87:12----------
changing our behavior like if we want to


---------87:14----------
become more emotionally available the


---------87:16----------
first thing to understand


---------87:18----------
is that emotional unavailability is not


---------87:21----------
a problem


---------87:22----------
it's a solution


---------87:24----------
so it's a solution that protects you


---------87:26----------
so this is the biggest biggest mistake


---------87:29----------
in general that i see with people trying


---------87:31----------
to change themselves is they see the


---------87:33----------
thing that they want to change is a


---------87:34----------
problem that needs to be fixed whereas


---------87:36----------
what they really need to understand is


---------87:38----------
that is a solution


---------87:39----------
that as long as the problem that that's


---------87:42----------
fixing is there it's going to be really


---------87:44----------
hard to like let it go


---------87:48----------
um so i don't know exactly how so and i


---------87:51----------
think essentially what you're saying is


---------87:52----------
that like you're not


---------87:54----------
you're doing it to protect yourself


---------87:57----------
yeah right it's like protecting me from


---------87:59----------
that rejection or whatever else yeah so


---------88:03----------
this is do you have a therapist


---------88:05----------
actually okay so i think this is have


---------88:07----------
you talked about this with your


---------88:08----------
therapist


---------88:10----------
a little bit yeah so i think this is the


---------88:12----------
the great thing to do i would recommend


---------88:14----------
that you spend this time like with your


---------88:16----------
therapist and what i would actually


---------88:17----------
recommend you do is like talk about the


---------88:19----------
actual experiences of watching your mom


---------88:22----------
go through what she went through


---------88:24----------
and something cool will happen there i


---------88:26----------
mean it's going to hurt when you recall


---------88:28----------
it


---------88:29----------
but the cool thing is that the more you


---------88:30----------
kind of like process and metabolize


---------88:33----------
those emotions


---------88:34----------
the less need you will need the less


---------88:37----------
important that shield will become


---------88:40----------
it's just how it works okay


---------88:42----------
the second thing is the box now this is


---------88:44----------
important sid


---------88:48----------
you got to let yourself be a weak


---------88:50----------
dependent


---------88:51----------
black woman


---------88:53----------
yeah


---------88:55----------
right like we have to like


---------89:00----------
that's going to be tough but i think


---------89:01----------
that's the short of it like so i think


---------89:03----------
the problem with a lot of this


---------89:05----------
you know acceptance stuff is that we


---------89:06----------
only accept a certain kind of acceptance


---------89:09----------
yeah


---------89:11----------
and and you know like we should like


---------89:13----------
accept people who are like overweight


---------89:14----------
and we should accept minorities but


---------89:16----------
heaven forbid we be compassionate


---------89:18----------
towards people who support donald trump


---------89:20----------
screw those guys


---------89:21----------
or like we shouldn't be compassionate


---------89:23----------
towards like anti-vaxxers or


---------89:24----------
anti-masters or whatever right like like


---------89:27----------
we have it's kind of interesting because


---------89:28----------
as a society we sort of have something


---------89:30----------
that is acceptable to cheer and if you


---------89:33----------
don't live up to that then you don't


---------89:34----------
deserve


---------89:36----------
you know and so i i love the way that


---------89:39----------
you kind of talk about the box of the


---------89:41----------
strong independent black woman because


---------89:42----------
like i think if you want to be a weak


---------89:44----------
dependent black woman you go girl and


---------89:46----------
you've got my support either way


---------89:48----------
and i i think oddly enough what happens


---------89:50----------
is that whether you're strong or not is


---------89:52----------
not fitting into that box i think your


---------89:55----------
strength is not something that can be


---------89:56----------
measured by like what people's put in


---------89:58----------
the box that i see very clearly i think


---------90:00----------
your strength is in your choices it's in


---------90:02----------
the things that you do it's in your


---------90:04----------
failures it's in you know putting


---------90:06----------
yourself out there it's in


---------90:08----------
you know having these challenges and


---------90:10----------
coming on the internet and like talking


---------90:12----------
about and that's your strength it's not


---------90:13----------
like whether you succeed and wind up in


---------90:15----------
a good relationship it's like what you


---------90:16----------
choose to do it's how you choose to live


---------90:18----------
your life


---------90:20----------
i don't know how you go about accepting


---------90:22----------
yourself as a weak dependent black woman


---------90:25----------
but i would say that you deserve your


---------90:28----------
love and your compassion and your


---------90:30----------
respect either way


---------90:32----------
and that you don't have to be a


---------90:33----------
particular thing to like be respected


---------90:35----------
right like if that's the choice that you


---------90:37----------
make just kind of like what you were


---------90:38----------
saying when we were talking about you


---------90:39----------
know fat acceptance versus fat shaming


---------90:41----------
which is like


---------90:42----------
you you accept the people for what they


---------90:44----------
want to do


---------90:46----------
yeah and the third thing is skills just


---------90:48----------
practice


---------90:50----------
so like this is where i'd say very


---------90:52----------
concretely like you know if there's


---------90:53----------
someone that you care about and you have


---------90:55----------
a feeling that your mind is telling you


---------90:56----------
don't share it


---------90:58----------
just share it a tiny tiny tiny bit


---------91:01----------
i've gotten better about that for sure


---------91:04----------
i've actually been very vocal with the


---------91:06----------
person that i'm seeing about these


---------91:09----------
issues that i have


---------91:10----------
and have


---------91:12----------
they they understand how hard it is for


---------91:14----------
me to say the things that i want to say


---------91:17----------
or like when i do


---------91:19----------
you know


---------91:20----------
express my feelings they they understand


---------91:22----------
how difficult it is for me which helps a


---------91:24----------
lot


---------91:24----------
yeah so you actually stumbled upon a


---------91:26----------
really cool technique there which is if


---------91:28----------
you have trouble talking conveying your


---------91:30----------
feelings


---------91:32----------
what you can actually do is go meta so


---------91:34----------
go one level above it and say hey i'm


---------91:35----------
having trouble conveying my feelings


---------91:37----------
yeah


---------91:39----------
and it's i'm serious it's it's how you


---------91:41----------
because then then as he accepts that


---------91:43----------
then you're gonna feel like more


---------91:45----------
comfortable talking to him and then


---------91:46----------
you'll get there so i'd say you know use


---------91:49----------
this what sid has stumbled upon which is


---------91:51----------
if you have trouble communicating your


---------91:52----------
feelings or even if you don't know what


---------91:53----------
you feel you can just explicitly say


---------91:55----------
that to your partner


---------91:57----------
hey i feel


---------91:58----------
like i don't know what to say right now


---------92:01----------
or it's hard for me to connect with you


---------92:04----------
and then that's actually really good


---------92:06----------
um i don't know if that's a solution for


---------92:08----------
you or not but i felt compelled to give


---------92:10----------
one i don't even know why because i


---------92:11----------
usually don't feel compelled to do that


---------92:14----------
uh in terms of like


---------92:16----------
practicing yeah that yeah no i


---------92:19----------
definitely


---------92:20----------
do


---------92:21----------
think it is a solution


---------92:23----------
and i'm trying really hard at it it's


---------92:26----------
just different there's a butt there's


---------92:28----------
nobody no no no


---------92:30----------
it is it is a solution it is hard


---------92:34----------
what's the butt give me the butt


---------92:36----------
is it really no butt


---------92:38----------
um


---------92:40----------
no i mean like okay it is a solution but


---------92:42----------
it sucks like it's not fun it's hard


---------92:44----------
it's really hard for me to do but i


---------92:47----------
understand that it's like probably good


---------92:49----------
for me


---------92:50----------
yeah yeah and then but what


---------92:53----------
okay so now now we okay so we're gonna


---------92:55----------
come full circle and maybe this will be


---------92:57----------
the end


---------92:59----------
so is it okay to not use that solution


---------93:02----------
is it okay for it to be hard and for you


---------93:04----------
to decide actually you know what this is


---------93:06----------
too hard for me today


---------93:10----------
i think so but it would not be something


---------93:12----------
that i would want to give up entirely


---------93:14----------
like if like one day i feel compelled to


---------93:16----------
say something but i'm like oh yeah this


---------93:17----------
is too hard i'll try again tomorrow


---------93:19----------
which is actually something i do really


---------93:21----------
often like really really often that's


---------93:23----------
awesome i'm really happy to hear that


---------93:25----------
because i think what that's actually


---------93:26----------
allowing yourself to do is be weak


---------93:29----------
i get to be weak today


---------93:31----------
i don't have to be strong every day


---------93:34----------
because the strong version of me would


---------93:36----------
have said it and like pushed myself past


---------93:38----------
what i yeah yeah exactly so i i said i


---------93:41----------
think you're doing fantastic i'm very


---------93:42----------
optimistic for you


---------93:44----------
hey um


---------93:45----------
as far as being an imposter


---------93:48----------
i know we were supposed to talk about


---------93:50----------
that


---------93:52----------
hmm any thoughts about that how are you


---------93:54----------
feeling about that whole thing


---------93:58----------
[Music]


---------94:02----------
for me


---------94:03----------
it's a feeling that doesn't have an an


---------94:06----------
end necessarily like i i'm not like oh


---------94:08----------
once i'm able to do this i will no


---------94:10----------
longer feel like an imposter i don't


---------94:12----------
know


---------94:14----------
what that is going to look like it feels


---------94:16----------
like something that i'm like gonna need


---------94:17----------
to reframe over time but i don't really


---------94:19----------
know how to do that you know um


---------94:22----------
but i suppose i'm like optimistic about


---------94:25----------
it i'm hopeful that eventually it'll be


---------94:27----------
something that i'm able to get past


---------94:28----------
another part of me recognizes that so


---------94:31----------
many of my peers feel that way that it's


---------94:33----------
like oh does it is it just like the


---------94:34----------
territory that comes with what we do


---------94:37----------
yeah so


---------94:38----------
let me share one or two thoughts about


---------94:40----------
that um and i apologize that you know we


---------94:42----------
didn't spend more time on that so one is


---------94:46----------
it's interesting because imposter


---------94:47----------
syndrome


---------94:49----------
so we have an internal sense of identity


---------94:52----------
and that internal sense of identity has


---------94:54----------
evolved like literally like over the


---------94:56----------
course of evolution our internal sense


---------94:58----------
of identity is slow to change


---------95:00----------
so if we think about like a human being


---------95:02----------
like


---------95:04----------
you know like i'm a kid and then i'm a


---------95:06----------
teenager and then i'm an adult but i'm


---------95:07----------
not really like a full adult


---------95:09----------
like i'm adult in the sense that you


---------95:12----------
know i have a job but i don't know how


---------95:14----------
to pay my taxes yet


---------95:16----------
you know those kinds of things and then


---------95:18----------
we like gradually become the people that


---------95:20----------
we are right it's not like an overnight


---------95:22----------
transition even if you thought think


---------95:23----------
about you know your transition from high


---------95:25----------
school to like confidence was like a


---------95:27----------
five or six year thing


---------95:29----------
so imposter syndrome literally like this


---------95:31----------
is like what i think i consider it's not


---------95:33----------
really a diagnosis but the diagnostic


---------95:35----------
criteria it's when your external value


---------95:40----------
skyrockets outer proportional to your


---------95:42----------
internal value


---------95:44----------
so you see this with people who become


---------95:46----------
very successful very quickly because


---------95:48----------
your internal sense of value hasn't


---------95:50----------
because generally speaking like how


---------95:52----------
successful we are is like a gradual


---------95:54----------
upward slope and what we see especially


---------95:56----------
with content creators and social media


---------95:58----------
is that people will explode right so one


---------96:01----------
year ago you were like a nursing student


---------96:04----------
yeah and now you're sid


---------96:08----------
and so it just it literally takes your


---------96:10----------
brain when there's a discrepancy between


---------96:11----------
your internal sense of value and your


---------96:13----------
external sense of value which happens a


---------96:15----------
lot in terms of the pace of social media


---------96:18----------
imposter syndrome increases so imposter


---------96:20----------
syndrome is the gap between what you


---------96:21----------
feel you are and the way that the world


---------96:23----------
treats you


---------96:24----------
so i also see imposter syndrome is more


---------96:27----------
common at places like harvard and


---------96:29----------
especially places like harvard medical


---------96:31----------
school so the greater the external value


---------96:33----------
that society places on you the more


---------96:35----------
likely you are to experience imposter


---------96:37----------
syndrome


---------96:39----------
so i think over time


---------96:41----------
assuming that your growth starts to


---------96:44----------
become somewhat linear at some point the


---------96:46----------
imposter syndrome will slowly hopefully


---------96:48----------
start to fade


---------96:50----------
the second thing that you can do is kind


---------96:52----------
of take a step back and like we were


---------96:54----------
sort of saying like acknowledge that


---------96:55----------
your external value


---------96:57----------
doesn't actually correlate with your


---------96:59----------
internal value


---------97:00----------
and that who you are is who you are and


---------97:03----------
just because you blew up on twitch


---------97:04----------
doesn't mean that you know you're a


---------97:06----------
special person that you're just a


---------97:07----------
regular person and this kind of gets


---------97:09----------
back to all that deserving stuff and


---------97:11----------
lucky stuff and things like that and


---------97:12----------
what i ultimately tend to find is that


---------97:14----------
when people really work through this


---------97:16----------
idea of what you're responsible for and


---------97:18----------
what you deserve credit for is your


---------97:20----------
actions not that your follower count


---------97:22----------
which is separate from this idea that


---------97:24----------
you know obviously you can count you


---------97:25----------
make calculated decisions to like grow


---------97:27----------
your brand and things like that right so


---------97:28----------
we're not saying it's random but your


---------97:31----------
fundamental sense of value does not get


---------97:33----------
determined by


---------97:36----------
you know your following


---------97:38----------
yeah and the more that you navigate that


---------97:40----------
i think the better imposter syndrome


---------97:41----------
will get


---------97:44----------
the last thing is to accept yourself for


---------97:46----------
being weak because then you don't have


---------97:48----------
to be an imposter like you can just suck


---------97:50----------
and that's okay and the moment that you


---------97:53----------
being successful and sucking is


---------97:56----------
has the same weight for you imposter


---------97:58----------
syndrome won't be a thing


---------98:02----------
you look like you're about to say


---------98:03----------
something


---------98:05----------
um


---------98:07----------
no i was so present and listening to you


---------98:09----------
that whatever i was about to say is gone


---------98:11----------
great


---------98:15----------
okay yeah i guess it's like


---------98:17----------
the imposter syndrome thing i


---------98:20----------
it's it's like a buzzword that you hear


---------98:22----------
so often but i've never had it explained


---------98:24----------
in a way where it's like


---------98:26----------
you know the way that you explain the


---------98:27----------
deficit and it definitely makes a lot


---------98:29----------
more sense


---------98:31----------
for me in that way like it that made


---------98:33----------
some things click for sure


---------98:35----------
and so the way that i think about it is


---------98:37----------
people are treating you in a way that


---------98:39----------
you don't deserve you feel but you don't


---------98:42----------
feel you deserve to be treated right and


---------98:44----------
that's because you deserve to be treated


---------98:46----------
this way but this is the way that people


---------98:48----------
are treating you and it's in that gap


---------98:51----------
that imposter some syndrome exists


---------98:54----------
so if you detach from the idea that you


---------98:56----------
deserve to be treated a particular way


---------98:58----------
then you'll be fine too


---------99:00----------
yeah


---------99:01----------
you can grow as a person


---------99:03----------
you can


---------99:05----------
cave your viewership


---------99:06----------
which in turn will not actually fix


---------99:08----------
things


---------99:10----------
because you'll still feel like a failure


---------99:11----------
you just won't feel like an imposter


---------99:12----------
syndrome you won't get an imposter


---------99:14----------
because they're treating you the way


---------99:15----------
that you know you deserve to be treated


---------99:16----------
which is still negative and then you


---------99:18----------
know you can grow grow your internal


---------99:20----------
sense of value over time and like you


---------99:22----------
know nice healthy real life


---------99:23----------
relationships where people where you


---------99:25----------
express vulnerability and people value


---------99:28----------
you anyway because hey i know it's kind


---------99:30----------
of weird sid you're allowed to be boring


---------99:34----------
you know


---------99:35----------
no you're not that's no i could say it


---------99:37----------
you're like no i'm not that's fine it's


---------99:40----------
it's hard to feel that way but i know i


---------99:42----------
am it's just like uh


---------99:45----------
i think on top of


---------99:47----------
you know like i have this job in


---------99:48----------
entertainment essentially i'm like i


---------99:50----------
never want to come on stream and be


---------99:51----------
boring but i don't want to be boring for


---------99:52----------
like my friends or the people around me


---------99:54----------
either you know um but i know it's okay


---------99:57----------
to be boring like if i just want to sit


---------99:58----------
on the couch all day and do nothing


---------100:00----------
that's okay


---------100:01----------
it


---------100:02----------
it's about it's okay for others


---------100:08----------
yeah so we're gonna try one last thing


---------100:10----------
so i i think you're right said like you


---------100:12----------
don't other people can be boring but


---------100:14----------
like you've got to be better than that


---------100:17----------
yeah


---------100:18----------
how does that make you feel when i say


---------100:19----------
that


---------100:20----------
other people can afford that you can't


---------100:21----------
afford that


---------100:23----------
well yeah obviously it feels bad


---------100:25----------
does it


---------100:27----------
i mean


---------100:28----------
it feels in line with the way that i


---------100:31----------
feel about myself but it's not something


---------100:33----------
that it's my fear that allows me to say


---------100:37----------
that to myself but i don't want to hear


---------100:38----------
other people say it to me right because


---------100:39----------
now my fear is realized and you saying


---------100:41----------
that i'm not or like i can't be boring


---------100:45----------
so that's kind of yeah it makes a lot of


---------100:47----------
sense but i would say that something


---------100:48----------
weird also happened is that you realized


---------100:52----------
the irrationality of your thoughts when


---------100:54----------
i supported them


---------100:56----------
yeah


---------100:57----------
because you started calling it your fear


---------100:59----------
right so when i start when i say oh like


---------101:01----------
you're allowed to be boring the voice in


---------101:03----------
your head pops up and resists it when i


---------101:05----------
say oh man it's like tough because like


---------101:07----------
it sounds like you really can't afford


---------101:08----------
to be boring


---------101:10----------
and then you're like well


---------101:12----------
that doesn't make sense


---------101:13----------
yeah even though it agrees so you see it


---------101:15----------
you see how that


---------101:16----------
happens yeah where like whatever like if


---------101:19----------
i agree with you like your mind will


---------101:21----------
naturally pop up and defend against it


---------101:24----------
and say that's my fear and that's


---------101:26----------
actually progress so this is the first


---------101:28----------
time that you've taken that thought


---------101:29----------
process and you've applied the


---------101:31----------
possessive to it instead of saying i am


---------101:34----------
you said it's my fear


---------101:36----------
literally i think it's the first time in


---------101:37----------
the interview and that's actually how


---------101:38----------
you overcome it like something just


---------101:40----------
shifted in your neurons where you


---------101:43----------
you own it now instead of it being true


---------101:45----------
does that make sense you're


---------101:47----------
externalizing it as a fear which is good


---------101:51----------
i feel like that became apparent to me


---------101:54----------
when we were talking about my


---------101:56----------
insecurities and how they're like my


---------101:58----------
insecurities that i'm projecting and


---------102:00----------
like that's what i'm afraid of yeah and


---------102:02----------
that i didn't get it from shows and


---------102:03----------
stuff like that so it so


---------102:05----------
yeah so the cool thing about your


---------102:07----------
insecurities is that they're not truths


---------102:09----------
the problem with our insecurities we're


---------102:11----------
afraid their truth but it's not it's


---------102:12----------
just your insecurity you're just


---------102:14----------
carrying that around


---------102:16----------
you know yeah


---------102:18----------
i think it's clear to me that you are


---------102:21----------
oh can i say this


---------102:23----------
i was about to say awesome


---------102:25----------
but you can accept that right


---------102:28----------
yeah


---------102:29----------
okay so you're awesome we're agreed


---------102:32----------
i i think i accept compliments well okay


---------102:37----------
yes sure also i think you'd be great


---------102:40----------
even if you weren't awesome


---------102:42----------
thank you


---------102:45----------
actually you know what you're you're not


---------102:47----------
great all the time


---------102:48----------
but i'm still a big fan


---------102:51----------
how does that feel


---------102:52----------
that's fair yeah


---------102:54----------
that feels good


---------102:56----------
all right well


---------103:00----------
um


---------103:01----------
i sometimes teach meditation on stream


---------103:03----------
are you interested in learning something


---------103:05----------
or you want to


---------103:06----------
pause or


---------103:07----------
kind of just bow out at this point or


---------103:09----------
what i mean i'm down um the issue that


---------103:11----------
i've had with like meditation and stuff


---------103:13----------
like that in the past is i don't um like


---------103:16----------
i don't have any visual imagery and so


---------103:18----------
people are like i don't produce my own


---------103:20----------
visual imagery with that um fantasia get


---------103:23----------
rid of it


---------103:24----------
so people will be like oh like imagine a


---------103:26----------
beach or something like that i don't


---------103:28----------
imagine it and so then i can't like


---------103:31----------
do that part of it but i'm down to hang


---------103:34----------
out and and try


---------103:36----------
we're not gonna have you visualizing


---------103:38----------
anything okay okay if i don't have to


---------103:39----------
visualize i'm cool wait you what is this


---------103:42----------
condition that you have is this like a


---------103:43----------
medical thing


---------103:44----------
well it's like not um it's something


---------103:46----------
that i heard about recently and it's not


---------103:48----------
like diagnosed or anything like that but


---------103:49----------
it's a thing called a ontasia where you


---------103:51----------
don't


---------103:52----------
like my entire reality changed recently


---------103:55----------
when i realized that other people see


---------103:57----------
imagery in their head they like picture


---------104:00----------
they like


---------104:02----------
yeah can actually picture things whereas


---------104:03----------
i i can't at all


---------104:05----------
okay so we're gonna we don't need you to


---------104:08----------
picture anything i teach you meditation


---------104:09----------
without imagery i i personally am not i


---------104:12----------
actually wonder if maybe my problem with


---------104:14----------
guided meditations because i don't do


---------104:15----------
guided meditations


---------104:17----------
and maybe it just occurred to me that


---------104:19----------
maybe the reason i don't is because i've


---------104:20----------
never been able to do them


---------104:22----------
i wonder if i actually have the same


---------104:23----------
thing


---------104:24----------
you should look it up


---------104:26----------
definitely look it up because like i've


---------104:27----------
always liked i don't teach like you know


---------104:29----------
most of the meditation apps and stuff


---------104:30----------
will be like guided imagery meditation


---------104:33----------
yes yes and i'm like this does nothing


---------104:35----------
it does nothing for me


---------104:37----------
so


---------104:38----------
so we're okay so we're going to teach


---------104:39----------
you a very simple


---------104:41----------
breathing meditation it's going to be a


---------104:42----------
focusing meditation okay


---------104:44----------
so i want you to raise your right hand


---------104:46----------
spread out your fingers okay


---------104:49----------
and then i want you to fold these two


---------104:50----------
fingers down can you do that good and


---------104:53----------
then can you put these together


---------104:55----------
okay uh hopefully this will work with


---------104:57----------
your nails you can close your nostrils


---------104:59----------
with your nails right


---------105:00----------
yeah yeah okay so got it okay so what


---------105:03----------
we're going to do is sit up straight


---------105:06----------
okay i'm going to t


---------105:08----------
huh


---------105:09----------
oh i was sitting criss crossed i put my


---------105:11----------
feet down


---------105:12----------
oh no you could say chris are you like


---------105:13----------
you were sitting cross-legged yeah yeah


---------105:16----------
that's just your back should be straight


---------105:19----------
but okay


---------105:20----------
so i'm going to teach you a technique


---------105:21----------
called nari shudi or nadi shodhana which


---------105:24----------
means like it means cleansing of your


---------105:27----------
energy channels okay so we're gonna do


---------105:29----------
is block our right nostril with our


---------105:31----------
right thumb and breathe in through our


---------105:33----------
left


---------105:36----------
hold the breath and switch


---------105:40----------
and breathe out


---------105:44----------
excellent now breathe in for the same


---------105:47----------
nostril


---------105:52----------
switch


---------105:54----------
and breathe out


---------106:00----------
in


---------106:06----------
switch


---------106:07----------
out


---------106:12----------
good now close your eyes


---------106:14----------
and continue at your own pace remember


---------106:16----------
to breathe in


---------106:20----------
and then switch with a full breath of


---------106:22----------
air


---------106:25----------
and then breathe out


---------106:29----------
and then in through the same nostril


---------106:36----------
switch


---------106:37----------
out


---------106:41----------
beautiful


---------106:42----------
in again


---------106:48----------

---------106:55----------
in


---------107:00----------
switch


---------107:01----------
out


---------107:06----------
you're doing great we're gonna do three


---------107:07----------
more breaths in


---------107:13----------
switch


---------107:14----------
out


---------107:20----------
in


---------107:25----------
switch


---------107:26----------
out


---------107:30----------
and last one in


---------107:36----------
switch


---------107:38----------
out


---------107:41----------
excellent now let your eyes stay closed


---------107:44----------
let your hand relax


---------107:55----------
i want you to sit in this space


---------107:59----------
sit in the experience of yourself


---------108:05----------
notice your breathing


---------108:21----------
just be


---------108:25----------
notice that in this moment you are not a


---------108:27----------
strong independent black woman


---------108:29----------
or a weak independent black woman


---------108:34----------
you're not even black and you're not


---------108:36----------
even a woman


---------108:38----------
you're just you


---------108:46----------
when you're ready


---------108:47----------
go ahead and come on back


---------108:57----------
that was nice i like breathing exercises


---------109:00----------
what were you


---------109:02----------
what was your experience like


---------109:04----------
i don't i know it's kind of a weird


---------109:05----------
question


---------109:07----------
um


---------109:09----------
very present i feel like


---------109:12----------
a lot of the time i'm living ahead of


---------109:14----------
myself or behind myself


---------109:17----------
but


---------109:18----------
yeah being able to like practice


---------109:19----------
breathing and just


---------109:21----------
focus on my body and what i'm doing


---------109:22----------
feels very present


---------109:24----------
were you thinking things


---------109:27----------
not really i like was kind of


---------109:30----------
um like when you said just be in the


---------109:32----------
moment i was like i can't have a fan on


---------109:35----------
so i was like hearing whirring which was


---------109:37----------
nice and i just like felt very relaxed


---------109:40----------
not thinking about too much


---------109:42----------
so this is so good job you've now


---------109:45----------
meditated


---------109:46----------
so the interesting thing about


---------109:48----------
meditation is that it's the absence of


---------109:50----------
thoughts that's really what we're


---------109:52----------
shooting for


---------109:54----------
so it's kind of weird but like you're


---------109:56----------
present you exist you're awake you're


---------109:58----------
conscious but you're not thinking and


---------110:01----------
it's normal for us to have thoughts here


---------110:03----------
or there but like as we focus on the


---------110:05----------
practice


---------110:06----------
as we drive our attention towards a


---------110:08----------
particular thing the thinking will


---------110:10----------
actually stop


---------110:12----------
and so like now we're like thinking


---------110:14----------
again and so just keep doing that and as


---------110:16----------
you do that i think even like


---------110:17----------
insecurities and stuff will start to


---------110:19----------
kind of like melt away because i don't


---------110:21----------
know if this makes sense but


---------110:22----------
even in that brief moment you know if


---------110:25----------
you look at the middle of the practice


---------110:26----------
like you weren't emotionally unavailable


---------110:29----------
you weren't emotionally available none


---------110:31----------
of those things actually existed you're


---------110:32----------
just you


---------110:34----------
right all that stuff is like crap that


---------110:36----------
our mind makes it's like all these


---------110:37----------
insecurities we have and stuff like it's


---------110:38----------
all function of the mind it's not


---------110:40----------
actually who we are


---------110:42----------
and so stepping outside of your mind


---------110:44----------
from time to time can actually alleviate


---------110:46----------
some of the pressures of what our mind


---------110:48----------
places on us like oh my god you have to


---------110:50----------
be better sid you have to be like you


---------110:52----------
have to be so good you can't be born


---------110:53----------
like no you can just be you just just


---------110:55----------
who you are you're great the way you are


---------110:58----------
even with all your flaws


---------111:02----------
cool


---------111:03----------
any last thoughts or questions before we


---------111:05----------
wrap up


---------111:07----------
