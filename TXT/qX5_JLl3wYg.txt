---------00:00----------
and so we're about to do QA so this is a


---------00:04----------
weird question but let me just think


---------00:08----------
about okay so let's do some questions


---------00:10----------
about meditation because we just


---------00:11----------
meditated I always thought meditation


---------00:15----------
was some kind of [ __ ] where people


---------00:16----------
say they reach some whole new level of


---------00:18----------
holiness and all of that can you put it


---------00:20----------
in a simple way why should regular


---------00:22----------
people meditate once in a while yeah


---------00:24----------
absolutely


---------00:24----------
so if you guys want the simplest reason


---------00:30----------
to meditate the goal of meditation is to


---------00:34----------
actually be conscious without the


---------00:38----------
function of the mind so to be conscious


---------00:40----------
without thinking so understand that your


---------00:43----------
mind is the thing that thinks the mind


---------00:45----------
is the thinking machine and this may


---------00:47----------
need more questions I mean you guys may


---------00:49----------
have to ask more questions I'm happy to


---------00:51----------
explain more but the simplest reason to


---------00:53----------
meditate is because you need to spend


---------00:54----------
time outside of your mind so understand


---------00:57----------
that anxiety sadness depression all of


---------01:00----------
those happen within the mind right those


---------01:02----------
are products of the mind and so


---------01:04----------
meditation gives you a state of being


---------01:06----------
that is completely outside of mind so


---------01:09----------
all of the stuff that comes out of mind


---------01:11----------
cannot exist when you're in that state


---------01:13----------
of meditation hopes dreams love


---------01:18----------
attachment expectations desires sadness


---------01:22----------
anxiety all of that [ __ ] gets wiped away


---------01:25----------
when you meditate that's why you should


---------01:29----------
meditate because your brain deserves a


---------01:31----------
break from you


---------01:34----------
that's why you should meditate right


---------01:36----------
that's the simplest reason about the


---------01:37----------
simplest reason that's it so let's talk


---------01:39----------
about that for a second we think we are


---------01:44----------
our minds and if we think we are we our


---------01:49----------
sense of identity has to do with our


---------01:50----------
mind so I identify certain things like


---------01:53----------
I'm a doctor I'm a Boomer apparently I'm


---------01:56----------
a gamer I'm a father I'm a psychiatrist


---------02:02----------
I'm a slacker I'm a legend to scrub on


---------02:06----------
dota these are the ways that identify


---------02:09----------
with myself right and each of those


---------02:11----------
things comes like brings attachments


---------02:13----------
with it and those attachments can lead


---------02:16----------
to like comment some kind of suffering


---------02:18----------
so to meditate is to be like neutral is


---------02:20----------
to find like a part of like the truest


---------02:23----------
version of yourself because each of


---------02:25----------
those statements about myself are can


---------02:29----------
like change over time like those are not


---------02:31----------
the real me like one day I may not be a


---------02:33----------
legend to scrub I may be like an ancient


---------02:36----------
one scrub I used to be ancient by the


---------02:38----------
way before I you know had kids and stuff


---------02:40----------
for K MMR back in the day like 5 years


---------02:43----------
ago back when I used to play dota and


---------02:47----------
one day I may not be a physician one day


---------02:49----------
I may not be a father one day I may not


---------02:51----------
be a Boomer right I may learn how to use


---------02:53----------
the internet one day and so all of these


---------02:56----------
parts of our identity are fluctuating


---------02:58----------
like they change like I feel like I'm


---------03:01----------
successful I feel like I'm a failure


---------03:02----------
like maybe one day I get banned from


---------03:04----------
twitch and then I'm like I'm not a


---------03:05----------
twitch streamer anymore so all of that


---------03:07----------
when we think about ourselves we think


---------03:09----------
about a lot of things that we believe


---------03:11----------
are permanent but aren't actually


---------03:13----------
permanent they're temporary so how do


---------03:15----------
you find out what you really are how do


---------03:18----------
you find the thing that is completely


---------03:20----------
stable and is the real you because all


---------03:22----------
the others all the other [ __ ] can change


---------03:25----------
sense of identity like even things that


---------03:27----------
we used to think we're super stable like


---------03:29----------
a sense of gender identity is fluid


---------03:31----------
right people like grow up thinking that


---------03:33----------
they're a man and then one day they wake


---------03:34----------
up and they're like I'm a woman trapped


---------03:36----------
in a man's body fine so identity


---------03:39----------
fluctuates so how do you find the real


---------03:41----------
you you meditate because all of that


---------03:44----------
stuff exists within the mind and when


---------03:46----------
you meditate all of that stuff goes away


---------03:48----------
and you see the fundamental experience


---------03:52----------
of who you are


---------03:55----------
and that changes you so I'll tell you


---------03:57----------
guys something like so this was kind of


---------03:59----------
my journey to understanding this as I


---------04:01----------
learned how to meditate and then um my


---------04:05----------
father passed away and I remember being


---------04:08----------
like really really sad this was about


---------04:09----------
eight years ago so I was like filled


---------04:11----------
with grief and stuff cuz he's my dad and


---------04:12----------
he was super proud like he won he was a


---------04:14----------
doctor and he wanted me to go to medical


---------04:16----------
school and then I got into medical


---------04:18----------
school and like the day that I called


---------04:19----------
him and I told him I got in and he like


---------04:21----------
wept he was just so happy for me


---------04:23----------
and then about eight months later he


---------04:26----------
passed away so when I was a first year


---------04:28----------
medical student so I remember like


---------04:30----------
flying back to Texas from Boston and I


---------04:33----------
watched his so I went to the funeral and


---------04:36----------
so then there's his corpse right and I


---------04:40----------
saw his corpse and I broke down crying


---------04:42----------
and then like while I was crying I was


---------04:45----------
like let me try to meditate real quick


---------04:47----------
and sometimes when I meditated I I had


---------04:50----------
this sense of like vast emptiness within


---------04:53----------
me it was kind of comforting but it was


---------04:55----------
just like this vast like ocean of just


---------04:57----------
like nothingness it's hard to describe


---------04:59----------
the way I would describe is I felt like


---------05:01----------
I was a star in the sky which doesn't


---------05:03----------
make any sense unless you've experienced


---------05:05----------
it it's like trying to explain an orgasm


---------05:07----------
to someone who hasn't had sex they're


---------05:09----------
just never gonna get it right so I had


---------05:12----------
this experience and then I I was I was


---------05:14----------
like okay right now like this is like


---------05:16----------
I'm filled with grief can I still find


---------05:19----------
that thing so I meditated and then sure


---------05:22----------
enough like that part that I felt that


---------05:24----------
was meditating was exactly the same it


---------05:28----------
was like exactly the same and I felt


---------05:29----------
like completely peaceful and on top of


---------05:32----------
the peace I felt like this overwhelming


---------05:34----------
grief it's a really bizarre thing to


---------05:35----------
describe and then one month later I got


---------05:38----------
married I mean the wedding was planned


---------05:42----------
it wasn't like you know I was like so


---------05:44----------
like grief distraught that I proposed or


---------05:47----------
got someone pregnant so I was gonna get


---------05:49----------
married


---------05:49----------
it's like planned and then it was sort


---------05:52----------
of a you know people were like it was


---------05:53----------
kind of bittersweet because obviously my


---------05:54----------
dad had just passed away and then I like


---------05:56----------
presumably I was super happy like I was


---------05:58----------
getting married I was having a lot of


---------05:59----------
fun and then when I was like supposedly


---------06:02----------
what like one of the happiest moments of


---------06:03----------
my life I stopped and I meditated and I


---------06:06----------
found that same sensation


---------06:08----------
that there is a part of me that is


---------06:10----------
constant and that that is the real me


---------06:13----------
and that everything else above all of


---------06:16----------
the experiences of life sadness


---------06:18----------
happiness success failure devastation


---------06:21----------
joy underneath all of that is something


---------06:24----------
that is constant that's why you should


---------06:28----------
meditate so you can find that thing


---------06:30----------
because most people go through life


---------06:32----------
without any kind of constant everything


---------06:36----------
about their life is subject to change so


---------06:40----------
when people talk about [ __ ] like the


---------06:41----------
true self they say like meditate to like


---------06:44----------
find your inner self man find that true


---------06:46----------
self all manly


---------06:47----------
yeah like Lululemon pants and Oprah


---------06:49----------
Winfrey like find yourself yeah like


---------06:51----------
yoga studios yeah like they're no that's


---------06:56----------
[ __ ] stupid there is a part of you


---------06:58----------
like oh that's true but they don't


---------06:59----------
understand what the [ __ ] they're talking


---------07:01----------
about there's a part of you that is


---------07:03----------
literally unchanging and once you


---------07:06----------
discover that part of you life becomes


---------07:08----------
way easier


---------07:10----------
so I remember a couple years later I was


---------07:13----------
in the operating room and there was this


---------07:16----------
vascular surgeon I was doing a vascular


---------07:18----------
surgery for a carotid endarterectomy


---------07:20----------
which is you have this thing called the


---------07:22----------
carotid artery and the carotid artery


---------07:24----------
gets blocked too with like [ __ ] and then


---------07:26----------
people have strokes because it's blocked


---------07:28----------
and that's the main artery that feeds


---------07:29----------
you know the front side of your brain


---------07:32----------
and so what you do is you go in with


---------07:35----------
surgery and you pull the gunk out so not


---------07:39----------
[ __ ] yeah I mean it gets filled with


---------07:40----------
like cholesterol and stuff like the same


---------07:42----------
stuff that hardens the arteries of your


---------07:43----------
heart and gets inflamed and things like


---------07:46----------
that so so I was in this surgery right


---------07:52----------
and surgeons are not the nicest people


---------07:55----------
and so this guy is doing the surgery and


---------07:58----------
then he like cut something that he's not


---------08:00----------
supposed to cut and the [ __ ] starts


---------08:02----------
bleeding and like the field of vision


---------08:04----------
for a neck surgery is like tiny it's


---------08:08----------
like you've got this little patch of


---------08:09----------
like maybe you know one and a half inch


---------08:12----------
by one and a half inch of like the neck


---------08:14----------
that's open it's very small so it


---------08:16----------
doesn't take a whole lot of blood to


---------08:17----------
like fill it up and he doesn't see what


---------08:20----------
the he doesn't see where the


---------08:22----------
LEED is coming from so he's on one side


---------08:23----------
of the table I'm on the other side of


---------08:25----------
the table and then he's like looking for


---------08:28----------
the blood like he's looking for like


---------08:30----------
what he caught in what's bleeding and he


---------08:31----------
can't find it and so he's kind of an


---------08:34----------
[ __ ] so I tend to stay quiet but I


---------08:36----------
say like hey this guy's been a [ __ ]


---------08:37----------
stroke out and so I make the mistake of


---------08:41----------
opening my mouth because he can't see it


---------08:42----------
because he's on this side of the table


---------08:44----------
and it's like spurting out like down


---------08:46----------
here like over here so I'm on the other


---------08:48----------
side of the table I can see exactly


---------08:50----------
where the blood is coming from and so I


---------08:52----------
make the mistake of opening my [ __ ]


---------08:54----------
mouth and I say dr. so-and-so I think


---------08:57----------
the bleed is on this side and what do


---------09:00----------
you guys think his responses medical


---------09:12----------
student when I want your [ __ ] opinion


---------09:15----------
I will ask for it right


---------09:19----------
so most medical students in this


---------09:21----------
situation would be devastated but I


---------09:24----------
laugh inside myself and I was like fine


---------09:27----------
like you're a [ __ ] [ __ ] I can see


---------09:31----------
the bleed if you don't find it this


---------09:34----------
guy's gonna like be brain damaged


---------09:37----------
you're a dick and like most people are


---------09:41----------
devastated because it's a high-stakes


---------09:42----------
kind of thing and he's like yelling at


---------09:44----------
you I may have even said something snide


---------09:49----------
because other people in the room started


---------09:50----------
laughing I don't remember but and and so


---------09:56----------
like when you find that thing underneath


---------09:58----------
you like normally getting yelled at by a


---------10:00----------
surgeon in the o.r there's so many of my


---------10:02----------
colleagues that would like start crying


---------10:03----------
and like because like you get deficit


---------10:05----------
they like these [ __ ] [ __ ] people


---------10:07----------
they yell at you and then you feel like


---------10:08----------
a piece of [ __ ] because they're all high


---------10:10----------
and mighty and you're like a lowly


---------10:11----------
person like getting yelled at by someone


---------10:13----------
is like not nice it's a stressful


---------10:15----------
situation the emotions are running high


---------10:16----------
but if you find that core of yourself


---------10:19----------
that is not like sad or happy or


---------10:21----------
anything like it gives you so much


---------10:23----------
strength you just go to that thing you


---------10:26----------
go to that thing and you find it


---------10:28----------
and there are times where you know like


---------10:30----------
like I don't know if it's so sometimes I


---------10:32----------
have a cup of tea in the morning and


---------10:33----------
like when I drink my tea like for a few


---------10:35----------
moments I'm like nothing I'm just like


---------10:37----------
one with the tea and you're drinking


---------10:39----------
that team it's [ __ ] delicious


---------10:40----------
you have no hopes you have no fears you


---------10:43----------
have no anxieties you're just like one


---------10:45----------
with no he ended up finding the bleed


---------10:48----------
and the guy was okay


---------10:49----------
he found the bleed because I told him


---------10:51----------
where it was I was like it's over here


---------10:53----------
and then he like mopped it up and then


---------10:55----------
found it and sewed it right and you have


---------11:04----------
that being fine I ended up getting a


---------11:06----------
good grade in the rotation too by the


---------11:08----------
way I ended up getting honors so they


---------11:13----------
actually tried to convince me to be a


---------11:15----------
vascular surgeon and I thought about it


---------11:16----------
for a hot second they said I was too I


---------11:18----------
was too smart to become a psychiatrist


---------11:20----------
that's what they told me at the end of


---------11:22----------
the rotation like you'd be [ __ ]


---------11:24----------
wasted in psychiatry you should become a


---------11:26----------
real doctor I was like thank you


---------11:31----------
so I'm seriously that that was their


---------11:34----------
feedback honest to god so you know I


---------11:39----------
think fine like so the reason you should


---------11:41----------
meditate us to find that thing within


---------11:43----------
yourself right to find the part of you


---------11:45----------
that's constant and doesn't fluctuate


---------11:46----------
and once you discover that thing and you


---------11:49----------
have access to that thing you can kind


---------11:51----------
of like you're kind of like floating


---------11:52----------
above the rest of your life it's like


---------11:55----------
you know I don't know how else to


---------11:58----------
describe it so that's why you should


---------12:00----------
meditate and I think what happens when


---------12:03----------
you find that thing is you become like


---------12:04----------
holier so we have this concept of


---------12:06----------
holiness which is like I don't know


---------12:08----------
exactly what that means but I think


---------12:10----------
generally like things like compassion


---------12:11----------
become more easy like patience becomes


---------12:15----------
easier compassion becomes easier dealing


---------12:18----------
with sadness becomes easier dealing with


---------12:20----------
happiness becomes easier you become like


---------12:23----------
more like level which is I think part of


---------12:25----------
what they mean by holy so I'm gonna


---------12:27----------
relate this to another question how do


---------12:31----------
you gain confidence as a clinician


---------12:32----------
that's another question that I got and I


---------12:34----------
gained confidence because I find this


---------12:35----------
thing like and so sometimes I do a bad


---------12:38----------
job as a clinician and sometimes I do a


---------12:40----------
good job as a clinician because


---------12:41----------
not a perfect clinician right just like


---------12:43----------
we were talking about I try to do the


---------12:44----------
best job that I can every day and I come


---------12:48----------
on stream and I just try to do the best


---------12:49----------
job that I can which is sometimes it's


---------12:51----------
like if I stop and think about coming on


---------12:52----------
stream it's [ __ ] terrifying just


---------12:54----------
think about this for a second when you


---------12:56----------
guys show up on stream like what are you


---------12:58----------
looking for


---------13:00----------
you're looking for salvation that's why


---------13:04----------
you guys come right and just think about


---------13:06----------
this for a second like what the [ __ ]


---------13:12----------
isn't like for me to come on and be like


---------13:14----------
oh [ __ ] Friday at 3 p.m. time to give


---------13:17----------
out some dad salvation time to transform


---------13:20----------
people's lives like I can't do that [ __ ]


---------13:24----------
come on right like I can't like you


---------13:28----------
can't expect that of me and I can't


---------13:30----------
expect it it myself but somewhere along


---------13:31----------
the way I start to think like oh my god


---------13:34----------
like I better save someone's lot like I


---------13:35----------
got a I got to help these people today


---------13:37----------
and then then it's like oh [ __ ] if I


---------13:39----------
start thinking that then it's gonna be


---------13:40----------
hard so then I just like I meditate and


---------13:43----------
then I recalibrate and then I focus on


---------13:45----------
the person sitting across from me and I


---------13:47----------
crossed my fingers and I pray to God


---------13:48----------
that it's going to help you that's


---------13:50----------
that's the only way to do it


---------13:53----------
right so meditation is about like


---------13:55----------
forgetting all that stuff it's not about


---------13:57----------
saving the world like it's like sureiy


---------13:59----------
oe healing is cool and all that's what


---------14:00----------
I'm trying to do but I can't expect that


---------14:03----------
I'm gonna transform the world with my


---------14:04----------
streams like it's not an expectation I'm


---------14:07----------
just gonna show up and try to help in


---------14:09----------
the way that I can and like if people


---------14:10----------
get transformed great if they don't


---------14:11----------
that's okay too


---------14:12----------
and it's like no big no big deal no big


---------14:15----------
deal


---------14:16----------
NBD okay so that's why you should


---------14:19----------
meditate I hope that's good enough of an


---------14:21----------
answer and simple enough of an answer


---------14:22----------
and the reason that you become holier


---------14:24----------
and compassion is cuz you get out of


---------14:25----------
your [ __ ] head so it's like you know


---------14:28----------
I didn't like you can be in more decent


---------14:30----------
human being because you're less caught


---------14:31----------
up in your own [ __ ] and like being a


---------14:34----------
decent human being people start calling


---------14:35----------
you like holy or and a saint like that's


---------14:37----------
just because it's hard because you're


---------14:39----------
normally caught up in your own stuff


---------14:41----------
okay
