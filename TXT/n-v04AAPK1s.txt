---------00:16----------
so the first question that


---------00:19----------
gamer's ask me is do I have a problem am


---------00:23----------
I actually addicted to video games and


---------00:26----------
that's actually the best question to


---------00:28----------
start off with how do you know whether


---------00:30----------
your gaming is just a normal part of


---------00:32----------
your life it's a way of having fun it's


---------00:35----------
a form of recreation or is it a problem


---------00:38----------
is it actually an addiction and it kind


---------00:42----------
of makes sense I mean it's a tricky


---------00:44----------
question because gaming actually offers


---------00:47----------
us a lot of positive things in life if


---------00:50----------
we think about it gaming serves as a


---------00:52----------
form of recreation it's something that


---------00:54----------
you do with your friends it serves as a


---------00:57----------
way to de-stress and actually cope with


---------01:00----------
problems it serves as a way to connect


---------01:03----------
with other human beings and form


---------01:04----------
relationships and so it's a completely


---------01:07----------
reasonable question to ask you know is


---------01:09----------
the gaming that I do like when I play


---------01:11----------
let's say a whole weekend of World of


---------01:15----------
Warcraft after a week of finals is that


---------01:19----------
a problem when I game for 12 hours a day


---------01:20----------
on Saturday and Sunday after studying my


---------01:22----------
ass off for the semester is that a


---------01:27----------
problem and it's it's a great question


---------01:30----------
and I think at the end of the day the


---------01:32----------
answer is relatively simple if it's


---------01:35----------
causing a problem it is a problem in


---------01:39----------
psychiatry we we have one very simple


---------01:41----------
line that if you cross that line we say


---------01:44----------
that you've got an illness and that line


---------01:46----------
is simply does it impair your function


---------01:49----------
does it actually get in the way of


---------01:51----------
something that you want to do so if we


---------01:53----------
take a look at for example distressing


---------01:56----------
we see that you know if I have a long


---------01:58----------
day and I go home and I play video games


---------02:00----------
that's kind of a healthy coping


---------02:02----------
mechanism but let's say that I have a


---------02:05----------
job that's super stressful and then I go


---------02:08----------
home and I play games for hours to kind


---------02:11----------
of decompress from that job and the next


---------02:13----------
day I go to the job and it's super


---------02:15----------
stressful and I come home and I


---------02:17----------
decompress and that goes on for days and


---------02:19----------
weeks and months that's a problem if


---------02:23----------
you're not changing your life in any way


---------02:25----------
if the gaming is getting in the way of


---------02:28----------
you talking to your boss about why your


---------02:30----------
job is a problem if your gaming is


---------02:33----------
in the way of you trying to find another


---------02:35----------
job that's not so stressful then I'd say


---------02:37----------
it is a problem if you're gaming it's


---------02:40----------
fine to use gaming is a coping mechanism


---------02:41----------
in a way to de-stress from your day but


---------02:45----------
if you're not actually dealing with the


---------02:46----------
sources of your stress if you're not


---------02:49----------
actually improving things and you're


---------02:52----------
kind of ignoring a problem or letting a


---------02:53----------
problem fester then I think gaming is a


---------02:56----------
problem so just to sum up you know if


---------03:00----------
you guys are asking yourself the


---------03:02----------
question am i addicted to video games I


---------03:05----------
would ask you is your gaming getting in


---------03:08----------
the way of things that you want to do is


---------03:10----------
your gaming getting in the way of your


---------03:12----------
academic performance are you not doing


---------03:14----------
as well in school as you should be


---------03:16----------
because you're playing video games is it


---------03:18----------
getting in the way of your professional


---------03:20----------
success are you not getting promoted or


---------03:23----------
are you not looking for a better job


---------03:25----------
are you not switching fields are you not


---------03:28----------
growing in a professional capacity


---------03:29----------
because you spend so much time gaming is


---------03:32----------
gaming interfering with your physical


---------03:34----------
health are you gaining too much weight


---------03:37----------
should you be losing weight is gaming


---------03:40----------
getting in the way of your sleep or do


---------03:43----------
you are you not able to run a mile


---------03:45----------
comfortably if gaming is impairing if


---------03:48----------
you're spending so much time gaming that


---------03:50----------
you're not actually taking care of


---------03:52----------
yourself physically that's a problem


---------03:54----------
does gaming create problems in your


---------03:57----------
relationships are you not able to find a


---------04:01----------
romantic partner like a girlfriend or


---------04:03----------
something like that because you spend so


---------04:04----------
much time gaming is gaming stressing


---------04:07----------
creating stress between let's say you


---------04:09----------
and your parents they think you spend


---------04:11----------
too much time gaming you think you spend


---------04:13----------
just the right amount of time Gaming is


---------04:15----------
there some problem that's happening in


---------04:17----------
your relationship because of your gaming


---------04:19----------
if the answer to any of those questions


---------04:22----------
is yes then I think your gaming is a


---------04:24----------
problem the most subtle problem that a


---------04:27----------
lot of gamers actually end up with is


---------04:29----------
actually that gaming prevents their


---------04:31----------
creative pursuits so I've met a lot of


---------04:34----------
gamers who are really smart and I'm sure


---------04:36----------
you guys all all of you have either a


---------04:39----------
great idea for a video game or a great


---------04:41----------
idea for a startup or you have some sort


---------04:44----------
of great idea for a novel that you want


---------04:47----------
right or you have this sci-fi TV show


---------04:50----------
that you think would be absolutely


---------04:51----------
awesome but you never actually worked


---------04:53----------
towards it you never actually sit down


---------04:56----------
and start to write the opening scene of


---------04:58----------
your TV show because you spend so much


---------05:00----------
time gaming and I think that that's


---------05:02----------
actually the most dangerous and


---------05:04----------
insidious part of a video game addiction


---------05:08----------
is that it actually prevents you from


---------05:10----------
becoming the person that you actually


---------05:12----------
want to be in this world sure the game


---------05:15----------
is fun and you enjoy playing it but five


---------05:17----------
years down the road are you gonna be


---------05:19----------
happy with where you are or would you


---------05:21----------
have rather spent some of that time


---------05:23----------
doing something else and if the answer


---------05:26----------
to that question is yes I would rather


---------05:28----------
have spent my time doing something else


---------05:29----------
then you've got a problem and that's


---------05:32----------
what I'm here to help you with
