---------00:00----------
i don't know if you guys have have


---------00:02----------
noticed but


---------00:03----------
um i make less i make fewer boomer


---------00:05----------
mistakes now


---------00:07----------
i'm proud of you yeah wait hold on i


---------00:10----------
can't


---------00:11----------
oh i i can't see myself i was just about


---------00:14----------
to


---------00:15----------
make another mistake um so welcome


---------00:18----------
everyone


---------00:19----------
thank you thank you so i think maybe


---------00:22----------
what we can do


---------00:23----------
is um so i understand we're going to be


---------00:26----------
talking about setting boundaries


---------00:28----------
and potentially the friend zone is that


---------00:30----------
right


---------00:32----------
yeah yes okay and i noticed that there


---------00:35----------
was a pretty lively discussion ahead of


---------00:37----------
time but i


---------00:37----------
i wasn't i haven't read it yet


---------00:41----------
um just a couple of things so what we'll


---------00:42----------
do is we'll start with introductions


---------00:45----------
and uh we'll also kind of do like a


---------00:47----------
sound check at the same time and and


---------00:49----------
maybe we'll have to adjust a couple of


---------00:50----------
things


---------00:51----------
um and then yeah we'll kind of see where


---------00:54----------
things take us


---------00:55----------
just a quick disclaimer i tend to say


---------00:57----------
you guys which i don't


---------00:58----------
mean to offend anyone um so i sort of


---------01:02----------
use it in the gender-neutral way which


---------01:03----------
maybe is part of the problem but


---------01:05----------
uh so forgiveness i'll do my best to


---------01:07----------
avoid using that


---------01:08----------
oftentimes i'll just say y'all which i


---------01:10----------
think is way better


---------01:12----------
um but you know i don't mean to offend


---------01:15----------
anyone


---------01:16----------
so let's go ahead and let's get started


---------01:19----------
with introductions so why don't we start


---------01:21----------
with


---------01:21----------

---------02:04----------
um math of the valley


---------02:08----------
yeah hi my name is math uh i'm a student


---------02:11----------
and i'm 19 years old and i can


---------02:13----------
come here with more of a perspective of


---------02:17----------
uh someone who hasn't had many things


---------02:20----------
happen to her


---------02:21----------
but the few experiences i've had are bad


---------02:24----------
enough that i want to speak about it


---------02:26----------
and i also want to speak as a few like i


---------02:29----------
want to speak stories that my friends


---------02:30----------
went through as well


---------02:32----------
okay wow that's yeah i don't know if


---------02:34----------
that's like


---------02:35----------
fortunate or unfortunate that on one


---------02:37----------
hand


---------02:38----------
you know you haven't dealt with it a


---------02:39----------
whole lot but it sounds like when you


---------02:41----------
have had to deal with it it's been


---------02:42----------
pretty bad


---------02:43----------
sorry to hear that thanks for coming


---------02:46----------
thank you um and risaka


---------02:49----------
yeah my name is risa i am 24 years old


---------02:52----------
i'm currently working as a content


---------02:54----------
manager


---------02:54----------
in the team fight tactics esports scene


---------02:56----------
and yeah i'm really looking forward to


---------02:58----------
this conversation all the ladies here


---------02:59----------
has been


---------02:59----------
extremely supportive and wonderful and i


---------03:01----------
think that this is a great conversation


---------03:03----------
for everyone to


---------03:04----------
kind of have more insights about okay


---------03:06----------
great yeah so we're i think we're really


---------03:08----------
here to learn and we'd really


---------03:10----------
love to have your perspective i think


---------03:12----------
you know most of our community


---------03:14----------
is men although that's changing rapidly


---------03:16----------
so i think when we started streaming it


---------03:18----------
was like


---------03:19----------
95 to 90 percent men and and five to ten


---------03:22----------
percent women and i think it's like


---------03:24----------
closer to 70 30 now


---------03:26----------
um and so i you know hopefully we can


---------03:28----------
learn a lot thanks for coming on risa


---------03:30----------
thank you uh star sleeps


---------03:35----------
yeah you can just call me star um i'm 22


---------03:39----------
i'm an artist here on twitch but i'm


---------03:41----------
also a student studying engineering so


---------03:44----------
i've had some stories in both of those


---------03:46----------
categories that we can get into


---------03:48----------
oh unfortunately real life stories and


---------03:51----------
the internet stories yeah


---------03:54----------
okay that also i don't know i mean that


---------03:57----------
sounds actually unfortunate because it


---------03:58----------
sounds like there's nowhere to escape to


---------04:01----------
native style stay in bed i guess


---------04:05----------
um champaloo yes um you can call me


---------04:09----------
champ


---------04:10----------
okay um i am 23 years old i live in


---------04:14----------
switzerland that's in europe


---------04:16----------
um i'm working in the banking industry


---------04:19----------
and


---------04:20----------
i'm a business admin student um


---------04:23----------
i have also experiences in real life and


---------04:27----------
online and i think this is a really


---------04:30----------
relevant


---------04:31----------
um like thing to know like about setting


---------04:34----------
boundaries


---------04:35----------
um yeah and i'm just i just want to


---------04:38----------
spread that aoe healing


---------04:40----------
for all of you guys thank you so much i


---------04:43----------
hope we can learn from that


---------04:44----------
yeah so let me ask y'all um you know


---------04:47----------
just to start off so first of all thank


---------04:49----------
you all for coming


---------04:50----------
uh i was i'm trying to debate a little


---------04:54----------
bit


---------04:55----------
about how do we want to approach this


---------04:57----------
discussion so


---------04:58----------
you know champ said this is an important


---------05:00----------
thing to talk about


---------05:02----------
and i'm wondering whether we should


---------05:04----------
start by defining


---------05:06----------
what is this or if we just want to jump


---------05:10----------
right into like an actual experience


---------05:12----------
what do you guys think would be like


---------05:13----------
better to do first definition


---------05:17----------
doesn't it yeah okay um


---------05:20----------
i didn't even know what boundaries were


---------05:25----------
what does that mean so remember that


---------05:27----------
like you know there's a group of people


---------05:28----------
who are watching and maybe


---------05:29----------
you know hundreds of thousands more will


---------05:32----------
watch on youtube one day


---------05:34----------
and i i don't know um i know there's a


---------05:37----------
sort of a presumption that we're going


---------05:38----------
to be talking about


---------05:39----------
female male boundaries but


---------05:43----------
you know this could apply beyond that


---------05:44----------
there are certainly women who


---------05:46----------
don't respect boundaries in terms of um


---------05:49----------
their relationships with men


---------05:51----------
um and also i think we're going to sort


---------05:53----------
of take a default heteronormative


---------05:55----------
approach which we don't necessarily have


---------05:57----------
to but in my experience


---------05:59----------
you know boundaries it doesn't matter


---------06:00----------
whether you're heterosexual homosexual


---------06:02----------
or something in between


---------06:03----------
boundaries or boundaries doesn't matter


---------06:05----------
what gender you are um


---------06:07----------
and so yeah it sounded like star you


---------06:10----------
wanted to say something


---------06:13----------
oh no i would i said i waved because you


---------06:15----------
said potentially hundreds of thousands


---------06:23----------
um so yeah so what is this how do we


---------06:27----------
define what are we talking about today


---------06:30----------
um yeah go ahead


---------06:34----------
today we're talking about boundaries so


---------06:35----------
boundaries can affect in a lot of


---------06:37----------
different parts of the life


---------06:39----------
so with your partners you have to talk


---------06:41----------
about like what you're okay with each


---------06:42----------
other peop


---------06:43----------
like are doing but outside partners who


---------06:46----------
is even more than that right like you


---------06:48----------
have friends


---------06:48----------
you have people that you just meet


---------06:50----------
online so like what are some stuff that


---------06:52----------
you're comfortable talking


---------06:53----------
with them about how you interact with


---------06:55----------
them every person is different and this


---------06:57----------
is the type of communication that's so


---------06:59----------
important you have that most people


---------07:00----------
don't


---------07:01----------
people just assume certain things that


---------07:03----------
is okay from another person


---------07:05----------
do those things and then make others


---------07:07----------
uncomfortable so that's why this is such


---------07:09----------
an important conversation to have


---------07:10----------
especially with covert going on


---------07:12----------
there's so much online interactions


---------07:13----------
right now so just kind of learning


---------07:15----------
how to define this boundary that you


---------07:17----------
have between people through online


---------07:19----------
would be really helpful okay yeah


---------07:22----------
and strangers in the street as well


---------07:25----------
like a lot of people in the street think


---------07:27----------
um


---------07:29----------
just because you don't know the person


---------07:30----------
it's okay to step out of the boundary


---------07:32----------
it's not like it's i think it's in every


---------07:34----------
case online friends and


---------07:36----------
strangers yeah okay so how is someone


---------07:39----------
supposed to learn


---------07:40----------
what the right boundary is um


---------07:44----------
i think setting boundaries has always


---------07:47----------
been about


---------07:48----------
well what i've learned is that it's


---------07:49----------
about communicating your limits


---------07:51----------
and how you want to be treated so in


---------07:54----------
order for somebody to know


---------07:56----------
how you should be treated you have to


---------07:58----------
communicate that to them in a way


---------08:00----------
where they'll understand


---------08:03----------
yeah okay um but unfortunately


---------08:07----------
i have had more cases of strangers


---------08:10----------
of people that i don't really talk to


---------08:12----------
and


---------08:13----------
it's really hard to communicate with


---------08:15----------
someone you just met like two seconds


---------08:17----------
ago so


---------08:18----------
i think it's also just uh common sense


---------08:21----------
in what you should or should


---------08:22----------
do but when you have that close


---------08:25----------
relationship with someone


---------08:26----------
yes like they should be more established


---------08:28----------
after that


---------08:30----------
okay and also what i think gets confused


---------08:32----------
a lot is like when you finally


---------08:34----------
express your boundaries there are still


---------08:36----------
some people who think


---------08:38----------
that they are entitled to deflate those


---------08:40----------
boundaries that they know better


---------08:42----------
what to tell you what is right and wrong


---------08:44----------
like oh no this is actually not that bad


---------08:46----------
or


---------08:47----------
oh this is you know this is don't make a


---------08:49----------
scene out of this


---------08:51----------
right but i think there's nothing wrong


---------08:53----------
about


---------08:54----------
setting your boundaries and


---------08:55----------
communicating your boundaries


---------08:58----------
okay what do you guys think motivates


---------09:00----------
someone


---------09:01----------
to try to deflate your boundary


---------09:05----------
ego what does that mean


---------09:09----------
um i think a lot of people don't like


---------09:12----------
um being told something don't like being


---------09:15----------
told that they were doing something


---------09:16----------
wrong


---------09:17----------
and out of ego they try to deflate you


---------09:19----------
and what makes you comfortable or


---------09:21----------
uncomfortable


---------09:22----------
okay linda i think i think maybe a lot


---------09:25----------
of people also just don't


---------09:27----------
think that things apply to them because


---------09:29----------
they like try to read you and then they


---------09:32----------
assume that they're special for some


---------09:33----------
reason


---------09:34----------
so that the boundaries just don't apply


---------09:37----------
to them anymore for some reason


---------09:39----------
interesting okay i think it could also


---------09:42----------
be a power dynamic


---------09:44----------
um because i've experienced that at work


---------09:46----------
and in relationships too


---------09:48----------
because when people feel like they have


---------09:51----------
a certain authority over you


---------09:53----------
it's almost like they're setting the


---------09:55----------
boundaries not necessarily


---------09:56----------
listening to yours so it makes it hard


---------09:59----------
to


---------10:00----------
communicate what you're not okay with um


---------10:03----------
just out of fear that they might


---------10:04----------
retaliate or


---------10:06----------
um won't listen to you okay um is it


---------10:10----------
okay if i kind of challenge some of what


---------10:11----------
y'all are saying i know it sounds


---------10:13----------
bizarre yeah


---------10:14----------
for sure yeah so so like we don't have


---------10:16----------
to get into this now but i just want to


---------10:18----------
think a little bit about like


---------10:19----------
a counterpoint so as a psychiatrist i'm


---------10:22----------
a big fan of setting firm boundaries you


---------10:24----------
know


---------10:25----------
here's my cell phone it's appropriate to


---------10:27----------
use it if you


---------10:28----------
want to schedule something or if you're


---------10:30----------
in a true crisis


---------10:32----------
but it's not uh just text me at random


---------10:34----------
hours of the day


---------10:36----------
at the same time so when we think about


---------10:38----------
um so i think setting boundaries is


---------10:40----------
really important it's a lot of what i


---------10:41----------
try to educate people on


---------10:43----------
at the same time when it comes


---------10:44----------
especially to romantic relationships


---------10:46----------
i think a lot of romantic relationships


---------10:49----------
thrive with a lack of boundaries


---------10:52----------
right so i'm trying to figure out like


---------10:54----------
if you think about flirtation


---------10:56----------
so flirtation is almost like kind of by


---------10:58----------
definition


---------10:59----------
not saying thanks yeah


---------11:03----------
right yeah okay so some that's why i'm


---------11:06----------
so it's just a different perspective you


---------11:08----------
all are welcome to disagree


---------11:09----------
or sort of educate us on like how that


---------11:12----------
isn't the case


---------11:13----------
but i i just know i'm i'm actually


---------11:14----------
thinking about you know when my wife and


---------11:16----------
i got together like


---------11:17----------
we were apparently dating and i wasn't


---------11:19----------
even aware of it


---------11:22----------
i thought i was just showing her around


---------11:24----------
town she thought we were going on dates


---------11:25----------
and there was a lot of you know


---------11:27----------
confusion there yeah and


---------11:29----------
and i think frankly i probably would


---------11:31----------
have done a far worse job if i thought i


---------11:33----------
was on a date


---------11:34----------
i thought we were just hanging out and


---------11:37----------
and so sometimes when i do look at


---------11:38----------
relationships sometimes things are a


---------11:40----------
little bit ambiguous right so like


---------11:42----------
at what point do you set a boundary with


---------11:45----------
someone about like what your


---------11:47----------
relationship


---------11:48----------
is like do you meet someone and say


---------11:50----------
hello i'm so-and-so


---------11:51----------
i'm single and i'm not looking for a


---------11:53----------
relationship nice to meet you


---------11:56----------
you know when you meet people online


---------11:58----------
kind of yes to be honest


---------12:00----------
so it's actually a genuine question


---------12:02----------
right so like i i get what you guys are


---------12:04----------
saying about the value of setting what


---------12:05----------
your limits are


---------12:06----------
completely agree with that the thing


---------12:08----------
that i'm a little bit confused


---------12:10----------
about um and i imagine our community is


---------12:12----------
confused about is like


---------12:14----------
when and how do you actually do that


---------12:17----------
in my experience and i don't think this


---------12:19----------
is like the best way to do it but in my


---------12:21----------
experience most of those conversations


---------12:23----------
have happened


---------12:24----------
like after someone's crossed a boundary


---------12:26----------
and you have to like


---------12:27----------
go back and be like hey sorry that i


---------12:29----------
gave you the wrong idea


---------12:31----------
um i'm not in love with you you know


---------12:34----------
yeah or whatever it might be


---------12:36----------
and that's a huge problem right is


---------12:37----------
because like there's a lack of


---------12:39----------
setting boundaries and then you get into


---------12:41----------
a situation


---------12:42----------
where there's confusion on both sides


---------12:45----------
and so what i'm


---------12:46----------
kind of like really curious about is


---------12:47----------
like part of what we try to do on stream


---------12:49----------
is to make things applicable


---------12:51----------
and what i'm envisioning is like if i'm


---------12:53----------
a 17 year old kid watching stream


---------12:56----------
what can i learn from y'all about how i


---------12:59----------
interact with like women i feel that


---------13:02----------
whenever you are unsure


---------13:04----------
ask and obviously not from the start we


---------13:07----------
don't go out and just be like i'm single


---------13:09----------
and i'm talking to you because i'm


---------13:10----------
interested like that's just not going to


---------13:12----------
happen right


---------13:13----------
yeah so yeah like obviously a lot of


---------13:14----------
interaction starts off as friendship and


---------13:16----------
maybe


---------13:17----------
that person is flirting you don't know


---------13:18----------
you're confused so after hanging out


---------13:21----------
ask them be like hey like i just want to


---------13:23----------
make sure i'm not


---------13:24----------
taking the wrong hints like is this that


---------13:28----------
whenever you're unsure about anything at


---------13:30----------
all regarding you and another person


---------13:32----------
it's so scary for that confrontation but


---------13:34----------
you just have to go and ask


---------13:36----------
okay so scary for the confrontation i


---------13:39----------
think that's a really important point


---------13:40----------
yeah


---------13:42----------
and also um at least in my experience i


---------13:45----------
think


---------13:46----------
um that part of if you're


---------13:49----------
if you don't want if you're scared to


---------13:50----------
communicate in your you might step


---------13:53----------
a boundary i think it should only happen


---------13:55----------
when you know for sure you're already


---------13:57----------
very comfortable with that person uh i


---------14:00----------
think like


---------14:00----------
if you already have a little bit of not


---------14:03----------
trust like friendship with that person


---------14:04----------
you already know them well the person


---------14:07----------
you


---------14:07----------
you didn't come in like trying to


---------14:09----------
immediately step


---------14:10----------
um step on the boundaries


---------14:14----------
then like if you have that trust then


---------14:18----------
at least in my case if i already trust


---------14:20----------
someone if they step a boundary


---------14:21----------
and uh i think i like if i have like a


---------14:24----------
responsive um


---------14:25----------
with the same way they they're coming


---------14:27----------
towards me i will also


---------14:29----------
i'll be comfortable with it because i


---------14:30----------
already trust them but i think


---------14:32----------
a lot of people step the boundary too


---------14:34----------
soon sometimes


---------14:36----------
okay and there needs to be a trust okay


---------14:39----------
so i'm seeing a bunch of questions kind


---------14:41----------
of rise to the surface


---------14:42----------
how do you develop trust right um


---------14:46----------
and not that we have to answer these


---------14:48----------
right away but and then i i also kind of


---------14:50----------
heard from um


---------14:51----------
star that you know it sounds like


---------14:53----------
sometimes the boundary conversation


---------14:55----------
happens


---------14:59----------
and oddly enough i can kind of see how


---------15:02----------
mafin


---------15:03----------
and stark kind of may be talking about


---------15:05----------
something like that's similar which is


---------15:06----------
that


---------15:07----------
you start a relationship you're not sure


---------15:09----------
exactly where the boundary is


---------15:10----------
you start to develop really like


---------15:12----------
friendship and trust and then maybe they


---------15:14----------
think it's one thing you think it's


---------15:15----------
another thing


---------15:16----------
you kind of cross that boundary and then


---------15:18----------
you have a conversation about it


---------15:20----------
although that doesn't really sound ideal


---------15:22----------
but i'm sort of seeing value to


---------15:24----------
you know not having the conversation the


---------15:26----------
first time you meet someone


---------15:28----------
and also like that seems too early


---------15:31----------
and then in in stars case it seems like


---------15:34----------
some of those conversations happen way


---------15:36----------
too late


---------15:37----------
and so you know how do we find that


---------15:39----------
medium


---------15:40----------
and i think that's something practically


---------15:42----------
that if the at the end of


---------15:43----------
of today if we could sort of have some


---------15:45----------
guidance around that i think that would


---------15:46----------
be a really cool


---------15:48----------
like takeaway what do you all think for


---------15:51----------
sure


---------15:51----------
okay so does anybody want to like let's


---------15:53----------
let's dive in does anybody want to share


---------15:55----------
like a situation that they've been in i


---------15:58----------
kind of want to hear from star


---------15:59----------
but which one which is not


---------16:02----------
i don't know i'm just trolling you so


---------16:05----------
seriously


---------16:06----------
anyone wanna i mean i do want to hear


---------16:07----------
from you but i didn't mean to put you on


---------16:08----------
the spot


---------16:09----------
no you're good um you see guys what i


---------16:11----------
did there as i tested a boundary i was


---------16:13----------
like asking oh a storm is it


---------16:14----------
okay but does anybody feel like they


---------16:18----------
want to share a situation


---------16:21----------
later i think if she goes first it's


---------16:23----------
it's okay i have


---------16:25----------
um so mine gets into power dynamics i


---------16:30----------
had a


---------16:31----------
situation i guess i could say with a


---------16:33----------
professor


---------16:34----------
oh [ __ ] yeah


---------16:38----------
yeah and so like i'm laughing because


---------16:40----------
i'm uncomfortable


---------16:43----------
same i'm good i don't know look we're


---------16:45----------
here to talk about real experiences so


---------16:47----------
as long as it's not going to


---------16:49----------
the one thing that i strongly strongly


---------16:50----------
recommend that people do on stream is


---------16:52----------
recognize that this is public and if


---------16:54----------
this is going to actually impact you in


---------16:56----------
a negative way in terms of your


---------16:57----------
education star


---------16:58----------
i would actually actually say you know


---------17:01----------
no


---------17:01----------
you're okay i've already been through uh


---------17:04----------
some stuff with my school regarding the


---------17:05----------
incident but basically


---------17:08----------
yeah um basically i


---------17:12----------
i'm an engineering student and you're


---------17:15----------
like first two years of engineering they


---------17:16----------
kind of make you take classes in every


---------17:18----------
field to


---------17:21----------
get you like up to speed on the


---------17:24----------
different industries


---------17:25----------
and so i had a professor that wasn't


---------17:27----------
really in my major


---------17:28----------
i'm mechanical and he was an electrical


---------17:30----------
engineering professor


---------17:32----------
um and he was like hey like


---------17:36----------
i think you should come and work in my


---------17:38----------
lab which is like a huge opportunity for


---------17:40----------
a student right and especially like


---------17:42----------
i definitely wasn't qualified right like


---------17:44----------
i'd taken one electrical engineering


---------17:46----------
class at this point and i had like a b


---------17:48----------
in it i think


---------17:49----------
um and so like he sort of had ulterior


---------17:52----------
motives there right um


---------17:55----------
and so i went out to his lab once


---------17:59----------
he it was just kind of uncomfortable he


---------18:01----------
like hugged me when i got there


---------18:03----------
and like like put his hand on my


---------18:06----------
waist while he was showing me around the


---------18:08----------
lab and stuff and i was like okay


---------18:10----------
not going back there right like but i


---------18:13----------
was then put in a situation where like i


---------18:15----------
have to go back to class and see him


---------18:17----------
right like i have to


---------18:19----------
continue to be you know like i can't


---------18:23----------
like if it was


---------18:24----------
if it was outside of school i could be


---------18:25----------
like [ __ ] off you know


---------18:27----------
but with a professor i don't really have


---------18:29----------
that opportunity


---------18:31----------
so it was just like he would he got my


---------18:34----------
number to like


---------18:35----------
i don't know why i [ __ ] gave him my


---------18:37----------
number in hindsight but i gave him my


---------18:38----------
number to like coordinate when i would


---------18:40----------
be at the lab


---------18:41----------
um and he would text me like hey like


---------18:43----------
what are you doing today you want to


---------18:44----------
come out to the lab and i'd have to like


---------18:46----------
like 12 times in a row i had to come up


---------18:48----------
with some excuse


---------18:50----------
because i didn't want to say no to a


---------18:52----------
professor that like


---------18:54----------
had my grade in his hand you know


---------19:00----------
i'm processing that's fair


---------19:09----------
i'm gonna need a second this is just


---------19:13----------
how old was the professor uh like 50.


---------19:19----------
okay what do you all think about that


---------19:31----------
but it's also not surprising which is i


---------19:34----------
think the more


---------19:35----------
like like it doesn't even really shake


---------19:38----------
you anymore


---------19:39----------
it's almost like you're used to


---------19:40----------
listening to stuff like that linda


---------19:42----------
what's not surprising about it


---------19:44----------
that that the situation happened like


---------19:50----------
it feels so normal to hear about these


---------19:52----------
things almost to a point where it


---------19:54----------
doesn't


---------19:55----------
yeah almost like oh you too


---------19:58----------
you know yeah yeah which is a sad thing


---------20:02----------
you know


---------20:03----------
to yeah to relate i mean to be fair


---------20:07----------
that kind of behavior oversets


---------20:09----------
boundaries and it's


---------20:10----------
just predatory like uh


---------20:13----------
what's predatory about it he is a fifth


---------20:16----------
year old


---------20:17----------
professor who is trying to have this


---------20:20----------
type of relationship or conversation


---------20:21----------
with a student who is much younger than


---------20:23----------
he is so


---------20:25----------
yeah yeah there's the power dynamic


---------20:26----------
there with the profession obviously


---------20:28----------
and then also the setting of where all


---------20:30----------
this is taking place as well


---------20:34----------
um i also have a story about


---------20:37----------
more of the theme of power dynamic that


---------20:39----------
happened to a friend of mine


---------20:41----------
um she was being followed by a man


---------20:45----------
and yeah she was being followed by a man


---------20:48----------
and she went to the police


---------20:50----------
i went with her the first time then we


---------20:52----------
had to go to another place


---------20:54----------
and she was taking care of the business


---------20:57----------
of the matter


---------20:58----------
and the policeman that gave her his


---------21:00----------
number


---------21:01----------
and so she could call him when she was


---------21:03----------
being followed and they could get there


---------21:05----------
he started asking if she had a boyfriend


---------21:08----------
and if they could meet out


---------21:09----------
outside of her house at night alone and


---------21:12----------
she had to get


---------21:13----------
one of her co-workers to pretend to be


---------21:16----------
her boyfriend for him to


---------21:18----------
stop messaging her and it just really


---------21:21----------
makes me angry because


---------21:22----------
it's you can't call the police on the


---------21:25----------
police so


---------21:26----------
it just makes me really angry that she


---------21:28----------
had to go through that situation where


---------21:30----------
her only safety net just exploded


---------21:33----------
basically and we only didn't report this


---------21:37----------
because um she was already so devastated


---------21:39----------
about the whole thing that she did not


---------21:41----------
have the emotional energy to


---------21:42----------
go report it


---------21:46----------
okay this is way heavier [ __ ] than what


---------21:48----------
i was mentally prepared for


---------21:51----------
no i mean i think it's like i'm just


---------21:53----------
sharing how i feel i don't think


---------21:55----------
we should stop it's just like wow


---------21:59----------
i was expecting something along the


---------22:00----------
lines of


---------22:02----------
you know someone messages me on on


---------22:05----------
discord


---------22:06----------
and then i have to block them after a


---------22:07----------
couple of days


---------22:09----------
you know we can talk about that too yes


---------22:11----------
we also have those stories


---------22:14----------
there's a lot more of those


---------22:17----------
i mean so you know it's interesting


---------22:19----------
because you know lin uh star said


---------22:21----------
i can't tell him to [ __ ] off


---------22:24----------
and i'm noticing the same thing in math


---------22:26----------
story the thing that i think


---------22:28----------
actually terrifies me the most and when


---------22:30----------
i think about what's my instinctive


---------22:31----------
reaction to hearing you guys


---------22:33----------
is it's actually like a powerlessness


---------22:37----------
because when someone dm's you on discord


---------22:39----------
you can tell them to [ __ ] off


---------22:41----------
yeah but it's like these situations


---------22:43----------
where sort of like


---------22:45----------
it almost feels like you can't enforce a


---------22:47----------
boundary


---------22:50----------
right and yeah and so i'm kind of


---------22:52----------
curious how do you guys deal with


---------22:54----------
a situation where you can't tell someone


---------22:56----------
to [ __ ] off and then that also begs the


---------22:58----------
question of why can't you


---------23:00----------
um um can you repeat the questions


---------23:05----------
i was just saying why can't you tell


---------23:07----------
them to [ __ ] off


---------23:10----------
for me it's like let's start with alyssa


---------23:15----------
it's what alyssa um it's always been a


---------23:18----------
fear of retaliation


---------23:20----------
something bad happening to me um you


---------23:23----------
know getting punished


---------23:24----------
or um you know i've watched lots of


---------23:27----------
those um


---------23:29----------
stories about girls who have you know


---------23:32----------
said


---------23:32----------
one wrong thing and then they got killed


---------23:35----------
or you know something really


---------23:36----------
um terrible happening so it's just a


---------23:39----------
fear of


---------23:40----------
any of that on top of um even having to


---------23:43----------
go to the police sometimes like i was


---------23:46----------
also


---------23:47----------
um followed by a man when i was about 19


---------23:50----------
to my job and um i didn't know what to


---------23:53----------
do


---------23:53----------
i didn't feel comfortable going to the


---------23:54----------
police so when he showed up to my


---------23:58----------
my job i was like i froze i'm


---------24:01----------
the type of person to freeze so um


---------24:04----------
yeah like you're saying in that moment i


---------24:06----------
felt very powerless


---------24:07----------
and i think that that um that pressure


---------24:11----------
to like do something but also not


---------24:13----------
knowing what to do


---------24:14----------
is what has kept me silent many times


---------24:18----------
because it's like i don't want to make a


---------24:19----------
wrong move and have that backfire on me


---------24:22----------
lisa you had something to say uh for me


---------24:26----------
just due to a lot of bad experience i've


---------24:29----------
learned now to just


---------24:31----------
simply say like like you suddenly [ __ ]


---------24:32----------
off or in a nicer way but like be very


---------24:35----------
firm


---------24:35----------
with people but the times that i yes how


---------24:38----------
do you say that in a nicer way


---------24:40----------
um so like if it's dms and they like


---------24:43----------
keep pushing be like hi sorry i'm just


---------24:44----------
not interested or like i'm


---------24:46----------
going through a lot right now and i do


---------24:47----------
not want to make this connection with


---------24:48----------
you


---------24:49----------
and then they keep pushing and overset


---------24:51----------
that boundary i was like i actually will


---------24:53----------
tell them be like hi you are going


---------24:54----------
way overboard right now i'm actually


---------24:56----------
going to block you now


---------24:58----------
so that's usually the most direct way if


---------25:00----------
it's someone that are really persistent


---------25:01----------
the times i did feel very powerless is


---------25:03----------
usually if it's in regards to


---------25:05----------
people related to my career um just


---------25:08----------
because


---------25:09----------
i can't say [ __ ] off to someone that may


---------25:12----------
be uh


---------25:12----------
detrimental to like a networking system


---------25:15----------
um


---------25:16----------
so those times it's very hard for me to


---------25:19----------
share with


---------25:19----------
anyone because it's like who do i trust


---------25:21----------
where this won't spread or like i don't


---------25:23----------
want this to cause


---------25:24----------
this like deal or anything so just just


---------25:27----------
a lot of


---------25:28----------
uncomfortable feelings usually during


---------25:30----------
those times i will talk to


---------25:32----------
like my someone like i'm really close


---------25:34----------
with in terms of my co-workers i'll


---------25:35----------
tell my boss about it or like someone in


---------25:37----------
hr


---------25:38----------
and but i have to say that not much is


---------25:42----------
usually done per se it's usually they


---------25:45----------
listen to me


---------25:46----------
we feel better about it and they try to


---------25:48----------
limit my interaction with that person


---------25:50----------
but there's been not a lot of


---------25:52----------
repercussion towards that individual


---------25:54----------
which


---------25:55----------
is honestly kind of my thing too because


---------25:57----------
i'm scared of it i'm just oh i don't


---------25:59----------
want repercussions to him because i


---------26:00----------
don't know


---------26:01----------
like it will like fire back at me so


---------26:04----------
those are the times where i'm definitely


---------26:05----------
really quiet and i'm scared even though


---------26:07----------
any other time i'm usually the first one


---------26:09----------
to talk yeah it's interesting i don't


---------26:11----------
know if you guys get the sense but i i


---------26:13----------
get


---------26:13----------
the sense that risa doesn't [ __ ] around


---------26:16----------
you guys


---------26:17----------
we've learned that about her in the last


---------26:19----------
three years so it's like


---------26:21----------
it's pretty easy to tell and at the same


---------26:23----------
time


---------26:24----------
there are also things that get her to


---------26:27----------
kind of like


---------26:27----------
step carefully and and remain quiet


---------26:30----------
which also is like


---------26:31----------
extra terrifying because rhys is staying


---------26:34----------
quiet


---------26:35----------
which means that there's got to be


---------26:36----------
something you know pretty significant


---------26:39----------
um so i i'm noticing some and i'm sorry


---------26:42----------
did somebody else want to speak


---------26:44----------
linda or champ


---------26:48----------
okay no it's fine maybe later


---------26:51----------
um so i i'm noticing a certain tone of


---------26:54----------
language which is like repercussion


---------26:56----------
punishment retaliation


---------26:59----------
um so it sounds like you guys have some


---------27:01----------
amount of fear


---------27:03----------
about what could happen if you set a


---------27:06----------
boundary


---------27:09----------
right so like on the one hand there's


---------27:10----------
like repercussions which is like hey i


---------27:12----------
think this is inappropriate


---------27:13----------
and someone should be punished but


---------27:16----------
that's like at one end of the spectrum


---------27:18----------
so i i do think that like a formal


---------27:20----------
complaint against this


---------27:21----------
professor like sounds like a good idea


---------27:24----------
um


---------27:24----------
just because but on the other hand i


---------27:26----------
also wonder a little bit about like


---------27:30----------
um you know education and i'm just


---------27:33----------
thinking about


---------27:34----------
observing some some of my own


---------27:36----------
experiences so i


---------27:37----------
i once worked in a hospital where there


---------27:40----------
was uh


---------27:40----------
there was like a senior doctor who was


---------27:42----------
like from foreign country where


---------27:45----------
sexuality was like way more acceptable


---------27:49----------
and so he would like openly say sexual


---------27:52----------
things to


---------27:53----------
people including his junior people and


---------27:56----------
they seem to actually be okay with it


---------27:57----------
like i'm not sure i didn't really have a


---------27:59----------
conversation


---------27:59----------
but he would even like talk to his


---------28:01----------
junior people and he would be like when


---------28:03----------
are we going to have sex


---------28:05----------
and then everyone it's crazy and then


---------28:07----------
everyone would just kind of laugh and


---------28:09----------
like it sort of continued


---------28:12----------
and and i don't get the sense like


---------28:14----------
honestly just


---------28:15----------
reading people's facial expressions and


---------28:16----------
stuff i i thought that everyone was just


---------28:18----------
sort of like oh like that's just how he


---------28:20----------
is


---------28:20----------
and some people even he was also like a


---------28:22----------
good-looking european dude


---------28:24----------
um you know in shape and in his 40s and


---------28:26----------
with a good head of hair


---------28:28----------
and so sometimes i wonder a little bit


---------28:29----------
about that kind of thing but it's like a


---------28:31----------
strange thing where i'm not sure like


---------28:32----------
a repercussions appropriate is education


---------28:35----------
appropriate like what's the


---------28:36----------
right


---------28:40----------
you know so i think that's the thing is


---------28:43----------
they're pro


---------28:44----------
oh sorry you go first i've talked more


---------28:46----------
um i think that


---------28:47----------
in that case people just let it slide


---------28:51----------
because they i don't know maybe they're


---------28:53----------
used to seeing people like that it's


---------28:55----------
just oh it's it's just how he is


---------28:56----------
but you should really educate them that


---------28:59----------
no one said anything


---------29:00----------
but they could have been very


---------29:02----------
uncomfortable maybe there was


---------29:04----------
one person who had a closer experience


---------29:06----------
with him and no one said and


---------29:07----------
no one knows about it i think it's more


---------29:09----------
of an education thing


---------29:12----------
even if yes how do you do that


---------29:15----------
i don't know but what i could


---------29:18----------
observe like in a work environment is


---------29:21----------
that you know everyone


---------29:22----------
kind of don't want to like you know


---------29:25----------
stand out they just want to blend in


---------29:27----------
and don't make a scene and keep it you


---------29:29----------
know yeah


---------29:30----------
professional and quiet so they are just


---------29:33----------
observing


---------29:34----------
you know their environment and they are


---------29:35----------
just can adapt to that


---------29:38----------
you know they are they can't really like


---------29:41----------
give some like authentic view on things


---------29:45----------
because they think that yeah i have this


---------29:46----------
job now


---------29:47----------
my job is just to do that job and to


---------29:49----------
kind of like blend in and not


---------29:51----------
cause a scene so it's really hard in


---------29:55----------
work environment i think


---------29:59----------
see i i work as a strainer as well


---------30:03----------
sometimes um and i mean


---------30:06----------
it's like sort of like i will


---------30:09----------
flirt with people that come into my gym


---------30:11----------
i will [ __ ] with my co-workers and stuff


---------30:13----------
like that because it like gives a little


---------30:14----------
bit of an extra kick and motivation if


---------30:16----------
it makes sense so it's like


---------30:18----------
it doesn't actually seem that odd to me


---------30:20----------
personally so


---------30:22----------
i don't think you can't even blame that


---------30:24----------
person just because like


---------30:25----------
like you mentioned the reception seemed


---------30:26----------
positive everyone's just like laughing


---------30:28----------
along with him and there's also this


---------30:29----------
quote that


---------30:30----------
i like and dislike heavily that's just


---------30:32----------
how he is right


---------30:34----------
and honestly he doesn't know better if


---------30:36----------
no one has ever spoken up against him


---------30:38----------
i think the most important point here is


---------30:40----------
that if someone


---------30:41----------
goes up to him and it's like hey i am


---------30:43----------
uncomfortable with this


---------30:45----------
he should never respond with that's just


---------30:47----------
how i am


---------30:48----------
but if noah has ever spoken to him like


---------30:51----------
that before then


---------30:52----------
him acting this way honestly i'm not


---------30:54----------
upset just because it has


---------30:56----------
been positive for him yeah so i'm gonna


---------30:58----------
once again


---------30:59----------
challenge this or play devil's advocate


---------31:01----------
for a minute okay so like let's say that


---------31:03----------
i'm


---------31:04----------
a 19 year old guy in the gaming


---------31:06----------
community


---------31:07----------
and and or let's let's not even say 19.


---------31:10----------
let's say i'm 26.


---------31:12----------
and i'm a caster for a particular esport


---------31:15----------
and i'm a prominent caster


---------31:17----------
and i tend to be a little bit vivacious


---------31:20----------
a little bit inappropriate a little bit


---------31:23----------
humorous it's part of my on-screen


---------31:25----------
personality that makes me successful


---------31:28----------
and so what i'm kind of curious about is


---------31:30----------
like especially when you kind of think


---------31:32----------
about power dynamics if you all are


---------31:33----------
reluctant to speak


---------31:34----------
and i'm not blaming you for feeling that


---------31:36----------
way because there could be repercussions


---------31:38----------
and we've heard


---------31:38----------
some of those stories before and and


---------31:41----------
you know at the same time like no one


---------31:43----------
has really ever told me that i'm doing


---------31:44----------
something wrong


---------31:47----------
um you know how am i supposed to know


---------31:50----------
like


---------31:52----------
what's appropriate or inappropriate


---------31:58----------
i guess and if i can talk i guess in


---------32:01----------
that situation


---------32:02----------
i wouldn't blame that person unless


---------32:04----------
someone


---------32:05----------
came to them and said this was


---------32:07----------
inappropriate and they


---------32:09----------
like tried to brush that off does that


---------32:13----------
make sense like


---------32:14----------
i think in some situations it


---------32:17----------
depends more on the person's reaction


---------32:19----------
than


---------32:21----------
on their initial actions and i mean


---------32:25----------
in a way especially like public people


---------32:28----------
like


---------32:29----------
casas like that especially when they're


---------32:31----------
like popular


---------32:32----------
i mean those are one of the most like


---------32:35----------
discussed people i don't really know how


---------32:37----------
to say it but like there's like [ __ ]


---------32:39----------
tons of reddit posts and people's


---------32:40----------
opinions online so


---------32:42----------
i mean i guess i can get like really


---------32:44----------
hard to filter stuff out and to listen


---------32:46----------
to what's like


---------32:47----------
probably morally right but then that's


---------32:50----------
like different for everybody anyway


---------32:53----------
so um


---------32:56----------
yeah so i mean that makes a lot of sense


---------32:58----------
to me i'm just and it kind of goes back


---------32:59----------
to what risa was saying too


---------33:01----------
if they respond with that's just how i


---------33:03----------
am so what i'm hearing you guys say is


---------33:05----------
not so much that


---------33:06----------
i mean it sounds certainly like some


---------33:08----------
behavior is inappropriate right


---------33:10----------
very inappropriate and at the same time


---------33:13----------
there is like


---------33:14----------
there's a space between punishing


---------33:17----------
someone for behaving inappropriately


---------33:19----------
and educating them and really not so


---------33:22----------
much about like


---------33:24----------
that you're setting a boundary with them


---------33:25----------
but the way that they respond to


---------33:27----------
and respond to your boundary setting


---------33:30----------
that's actually like the really


---------33:31----------
important thing


---------33:33----------
the setting that you put to the caster


---------33:35----------
as someone who works with a lot of


---------33:36----------
casters and they're all


---------33:38----------
amazing like saying that first


---------33:41----------
it's so important for them to like


---------33:43----------
bounce off of like


---------33:44----------
the other casters and whoever they're


---------33:46----------
working with and that's how they get


---------33:47----------
their reactions they gauge reactions


---------33:49----------
observing is literally their job


---------33:51----------
and so i feel like it's very hard


---------33:54----------
for them to miss if someone's obviously


---------33:56----------
uncomfortable


---------33:58----------
interesting like in your in your example


---------34:00----------
where if someone's just


---------34:01----------
the personality is that they just make a


---------34:03----------
lot of these like remarks out


---------34:05----------
if i was a fellow caster and they did


---------34:07----------
something like that to me and i suddenly


---------34:09----------
just shut up and go


---------34:11----------
like that i feel there's certain stuff


---------34:12----------
that i will automatically instantly


---------34:15----------
react to even if i'm not like hey that's


---------34:16----------
like awful


---------34:18----------
that caster is ignorant


---------34:21----------
if they choose not to look into that


---------34:23----------
reaction i feel like they're just like


---------34:25----------
all right just moving on this is just


---------34:26----------
how i am so like i


---------34:27----------
mentioned that's the excuse again that's


---------34:29----------
just how i am i feel like if you're


---------34:32----------
uh okay uh i don't know i just feel like


---------34:34----------
working on observing


---------34:35----------
because i think the pivotal is still for


---------34:37----------
someone to speak up and tell him


---------34:39----------
like hey like this action actually makes


---------34:40----------
me uncomfortable because you can't just


---------34:42----------
assume they would know but


---------34:44----------
people should work on observing skills


---------34:46----------
in general to try to


---------34:48----------
like view boundaries absolutely it


---------34:50----------
sounds like it's really important


---------34:52----------
um so i'm kind of curious when it comes


---------34:54----------
to uh


---------34:56----------
you know responding or or so what i'm


---------35:00----------
hearing is that


---------35:00----------
at some point you guys generally or may


---------35:03----------
or may not try to communicate


---------35:05----------
depending on your sense of of fear about


---------35:08----------
repercussions


---------35:09----------
your sense of power and the relationship


---------35:11----------
um


---------35:13----------
you know so maybe you guys will say


---------35:14----------
something maybe you won't and then the


---------35:16----------
way that they respond to that


---------35:18----------
is really important so can you guys


---------35:20----------
share


---------35:21----------
just your experiences of when you have


---------35:24----------
tried to communicate so it sounds like


---------35:25----------
sometimes you don't feel comfortable


---------35:27----------
um and and when you have tried to


---------35:29----------
communicate what happens


---------35:30----------
i i saw a star raise your hand i well i


---------35:33----------
just wanted to share


---------35:35----------
with my professor um


---------35:39----------
so well this is just like his response


---------35:42----------
um


---------35:42----------
which wasn't to me so i ended up telling


---------35:45----------
another professor that i trusted and he


---------35:48----------
told me that there was like an office


---------35:50----------
that


---------35:50----------
handles this kind of stuff and so i went


---------35:53----------
to them and said like hey like this


---------35:54----------
professor made me a little uncomfortable


---------35:55----------
they did like these things you know um


---------35:59----------
and i later found out that i like wasn't


---------36:01----------
the only student that said something


---------36:03----------
about him that semester


---------36:04----------
um and so they like wrote up our


---------36:07----------
statements and like sent it to him and


---------36:08----------
then he made a statement and then


---------36:10----------
they like sent us the like follow-up or


---------36:13----------
whatever


---------36:14----------
and he literally said like this


---------36:16----------
generation is so sensitive


---------36:18----------
like that was his like official quote in


---------36:21----------
response that he was like what


---------36:22----------
what do they want by saying this and i


---------36:24----------
was like all right dude


---------36:26----------
like gr you know at that point what do i


---------36:29----------
do


---------36:31----------
what what what do you do


---------36:35----------
i mean i don't i just blocked his number


---------36:36----------
i never talked to him again


---------36:39----------
how'd you do in the class i actually got


---------36:42----------
an a


---------36:44----------
i stopped going to class but my grades


---------36:47----------
on my


---------36:48----------
like tests were enough to get an a i


---------36:50----------
didn't need him


---------36:54----------
yeah wow what other experiences of


---------36:57----------
trying to respond to people and how that


---------36:59----------
that's received


---------37:03----------
like i i often see like guys


---------37:06----------
playing that yield card whenever you


---------37:09----------
are addressing your boundaries like for


---------37:13----------
example


---------37:14----------
like there was a user who you know i was


---------37:18----------
just


---------37:18----------
in the mood to listen to someone and


---------37:20----------
there was a user who


---------37:22----------
explained me his things and i'm like


---------37:25----------
okay


---------37:25----------
you know so i listened to that person


---------37:28----------
and then


---------37:29----------
at one point he messaged me and said


---------37:31----------
like oh


---------37:32----------
like i think i have a crush on you


---------37:35----------
you know that stuff and i'm like


---------37:38----------
okay look first of all like


---------37:43----------
did this how how does this work right


---------37:47----------
like i'm just here listening and you


---------37:49----------
have a crush on me like you actually


---------37:51----------
don't know


---------37:51----------
really who i am and it's kind of like


---------37:53----------
weird to me that just from


---------37:55----------
speaking to someone you can have a crush


---------37:58----------
on right like i can tell you whatever i


---------38:00----------
want online basically right you don't


---------38:02----------
know me


---------38:03----------
you don't know where i live you don't


---------38:04----------
know when like you don't know anything


---------38:06----------
about me


---------38:07----------
um so i was saying to him like look this


---------38:11----------
is this is


---------38:11----------
this can't work like i was just like


---------38:13----------
fine listening to


---------38:15----------
to you and i feel bad for your situation


---------38:17----------
but this is just


---------38:19----------
um yeah like this is not my attempt you


---------38:23----------
know like i didn't try to


---------38:24----------
you know to engage any like relationship


---------38:27----------
with you


---------38:29----------
so what he said is oh


---------38:32----------
like you know uh


---------38:36----------
i am like really in a good spot and


---------38:39----------
why are you rejecting me and why are you


---------38:42----------
doing this


---------38:43----------
to me and i'm like like how how how


---------38:46----------
should i react


---------38:47----------
in that situation like should i feel


---------38:51----------
guilty for rejecting him for


---------38:53----------
telling him my boundaries like right i i


---------38:55----------
thought i was


---------38:56----------
like i don't have to tolerate everything


---------39:00----------
right i can right yeah i don't have to


---------39:03----------
do this


---------39:05----------
and that's like that guilt card on me is


---------39:07----------
like


---------39:09----------
yes and it's not the first time like


---------39:11----------
it's also in real life that happens like


---------39:13----------
what is that


---------39:14----------
feeling what is the feeling that you get


---------39:16----------
when someone


---------39:18----------
says like why do you think that you have


---------39:22----------
to put


---------39:23----------
all your weight on my shoulders like


---------39:26----------
why do you think that i have to be that


---------39:28----------
person manipulation


---------39:31----------
yes how does how do you guys imagine


---------39:34----------
champ


---------39:34----------
feels when they do that frustrated


---------39:39----------
by what math because she


---------39:42----------
is afraid that her actions will have


---------39:45----------
um a reaction but at the same time it's


---------39:49----------
not her


---------39:50----------
job to take care of him like he's a baby


---------39:53----------
so


---------39:54----------
it's just guilt it's manipulation


---------39:58----------
sounds like emotional blackmail yeah


---------40:01----------
i've had that happen to me too


---------40:03----------
i was 17 i had a group of friends on


---------40:05----------
discord


---------40:06----------
and this 24 year old dude started


---------40:08----------
speaking to me also a thing of like two


---------40:10----------
three weeks


---------40:11----------
speaking um i wasn't saying i was like


---------40:15----------
not interested but then in the end i


---------40:16----------
just i just like no i'm not interested


---------40:18----------
at all to speak to you


---------40:20----------
and he made me feel guilty for rejecting


---------40:23----------
him to the point


---------40:24----------
where i was crying my eyes out even


---------40:25----------
though i didn't like him


---------40:27----------
and he was fine i called him and he was


---------40:29----------
fine and i was crying my eyes out


---------40:31----------
he was making me feel guilty for


---------40:33----------
rejecting him and


---------40:34----------
after all of that happened i was banned


---------40:37----------
from the group of friends


---------40:38----------
so i felt at the time i didn't see it


---------40:40----------
but now i look back into it


---------40:42----------
and i realized i was just


---------40:47----------
some someone he could speak to for them


---------40:50----------
it didn't work out so just they didn't


---------40:51----------
need me anymore and


---------40:53----------
the worst part of it they made me feel


---------40:55----------
bad for it okay so because


---------40:57----------
i didn't want to be with him yeah so let


---------40:59----------
me ask you something how does someone


---------41:01----------
make


---------41:01----------
you feel guilty because


---------41:04----------
they're expressing their sadness and you


---------41:07----------
think


---------41:08----------
and it's obviou when you make someone


---------41:10----------
sad it could be from your actions but in


---------41:12----------
that case he was faking it he was


---------41:14----------
manipulating it


---------41:15----------
to make me feel sad for for me to stay


---------41:19----------
how do you know he was faking it i


---------41:21----------
called him


---------41:22----------
and i was crying my eyes out and what he


---------41:24----------
was saying in text


---------41:26----------
was he was fine and called he was


---------41:27----------
speaking normally


---------41:29----------
he wasn't sad at all it was his stone


---------41:31----------
sure i can i cannot be


---------41:33----------
100 sure but he was fine


---------41:36----------
okay so what i'm hearing is that


---------41:38----------
sometimes people yeah


---------41:39----------
linda go for it oh i was just going to


---------41:42----------
say that


---------41:42----------
for me a lot of the time is like when


---------41:45----------
someone


---------41:46----------
like confesses to me or something that


---------41:48----------
that especially online it's been that


---------41:50----------
we've already spent time together and


---------41:52----------
we've like sort of


---------41:53----------
built a bond as in like a lot of guys


---------41:56----------
actually


---------41:56----------
open up a lot and talk about their


---------41:58----------
problems with you


---------41:59----------
um and i'm not sure whether that comes


---------42:01----------
from like they don't trust


---------42:03----------
to guys to talk about it um


---------42:06----------
but they're a lot more open towards well


---------42:09----------
me or something like that


---------42:10----------
um and then at that point it's like


---------42:14----------
you know the [ __ ] that is going on in


---------42:16----------
their life you know how bad they feel


---------42:17----------
about certain things and like


---------42:19----------
in a way how like lost they are and you


---------42:22----------
like want to help them


---------42:24----------
um but then


---------42:27----------
then they come out and they they tell


---------42:29----------
you that they like you and then you


---------42:31----------
suddenly sit in that spot where you have


---------42:32----------
to hurt them


---------42:33----------
and you sit in a call with them and you


---------42:35----------
listen to them to their like voice


---------42:37----------
while they speak to you and it just like


---------42:39----------
destroys you because you're like


---------42:41----------
you're their friend and you're trying to


---------42:43----------
be there for them but you literally


---------42:45----------
can't and it just hurts them


---------42:46----------
and it sucks yeah


---------42:50----------
so i i think that's also uh there are a


---------42:53----------
couple of important points here about


---------42:56----------
what confiding in someone means and i


---------42:59----------
think sometimes


---------43:00----------
different people me think it means


---------43:02----------
different things


---------43:03----------
one thing that i kind of want to point


---------43:05----------
out for a second is that what i'm


---------43:07----------
hearing from math and


---------43:08----------
and from y'all is that you know they can


---------43:10----------
say words that


---------43:12----------
make you feel a certain way is that fair


---------43:15----------
yeah and so what i'm kind of curious


---------43:18----------
about in hearing linda's case is i


---------43:20----------
wonder if the opposite is also true


---------43:21----------
where you can say words that make them


---------43:24----------
feel a certain way


---------43:26----------
i mean absolutely so then what i'm kind


---------43:29----------
of curious about is like if you hold


---------43:31----------
them responsible


---------43:32----------
which is sort of what i'm hearing for


---------43:34----------
making you feel guilty


---------43:36----------
can they hold you responsible for making


---------43:39----------
them feel love


---------43:41----------
i don't really


---------43:44----------
like i i can't really blame them you and


---------43:47----------
and like


---------43:48----------
i also like sort of if if someone has


---------43:51----------
feelings for me i could


---------43:52----------
sort of encourage that they get it out


---------43:53----------
because it like helps


---------43:55----------
right it helps to talk about um so i


---------43:57----------
don't actually mind it too much it's


---------43:59----------
just like


---------44:00----------
i'm i'm just like not sure how to like


---------44:03----------
emotionally deal with it myself


---------44:04----------
because i'm inflicting this pain by


---------44:07----------
rejecting them


---------44:09----------
yep the thing with that too is that if


---------44:12----------
someone is protecting their sadness to


---------44:13----------
me i don't find them


---------44:15----------
like guilty of anything they're honestly


---------44:17----------
i don't even call them fake or anything


---------44:18----------
if they're sad they're sad right


---------44:20----------
but the issue is if i tell them that


---------44:22----------
like oh hey like so


---------44:23----------
i'm going to use a specific story so


---------44:25----------
someone messaged me and just gave me


---------44:27----------
their


---------44:27----------
life story about how i'm very similar to


---------44:30----------
their


---------44:30----------
ex i remind them of her she she broke


---------44:33----------
his heart and that he's


---------44:34----------
going through a lot mentally through


---------44:36----------
depression and a lot of very serious


---------44:37----------
issues right


---------44:39----------
i've never really talked to him much


---------44:41----------
prior to this so i don't know this man


---------44:43----------
well at all so this was just like his


---------44:44----------
life story suddenly at me so i told him


---------44:46----------
hey i'm really sorry


---------44:48----------
about everything that you went through


---------44:49----------
that sounds horrible i think you should


---------44:51----------
speak


---------44:51----------
about this to someone close to you like


---------44:54----------
a friend


---------44:55----------
and he retaliates saying like oh i'm


---------44:56----------
already going through like so much i


---------44:57----------
guess like people


---------44:58----------
these days on internet just don't want


---------45:00----------
to listen to others that you don't care


---------45:02----------
about


---------45:02----------
anyone and for me that made me very


---------45:05----------
angry right like i didn't show it but


---------45:07----------
it's just a responsibility that you


---------45:09----------
don't put on someone i don't blame him


---------45:11----------
for sharing all that story for me was it


---------45:13----------
weird sure


---------45:14----------
but i'm not here saying like you can't


---------45:16----------
do this you can't say this to me


---------45:17----------
but if i'm telling you like hey like


---------45:20----------
sorry


---------45:21----------
go next you go next you don't then be


---------45:24----------
like


---------45:25----------
no i told you this now you have to


---------45:26----------
respond to me


---------45:28----------
that makes sense so i'm hearing a common


---------45:31----------
theme of so it's interesting right so if


---------45:33----------
we go to


---------45:33----------
a champs case and and you know champ is


---------45:37----------
listening to someone


---------45:38----------
on i presume the the internet champ is


---------45:40----------
that right


---------45:41----------
yeah yeah and then when he says hey i


---------45:43----------
have a crush on you


---------45:45----------
do you guys think that that's a good


---------45:46----------
communication or a bad communication on


---------45:48----------
his part


---------45:50----------
i don't mind that yeah just be okay if i


---------45:53----------
say no


---------45:54----------
yeah yeah but do people disagree because


---------45:56----------
i mean you're allowed to not feel that


---------45:58----------
way right


---------45:58----------
so like i i think the problem is when


---------46:02----------
people don't stop after you tell them


---------46:05----------
um like i've had


---------46:09----------
so so generally whenever someone


---------46:11----------
confesses to me i


---------46:12----------
i sort of try to stay friends with them


---------46:14----------
because they're like good people and


---------46:16----------
i mean i am sort of close with them um


---------46:19----------
but i had for example one um


---------46:22----------
case in real life where this this friend


---------46:25----------
of me


---------46:26----------
um just like kept trying to make


---------46:29----------
make moves of me and kept like touching


---------46:31----------
me inappropriately and stuff like that


---------46:33----------
even though after


---------46:34----------
uh even after i told him multiple times


---------46:37----------
that i wasn't interested in him


---------46:39----------
at all and i didn't like


---------46:42----------
um i would say that i didn't do anything


---------46:46----------
back to him so it should have been


---------46:48----------
in a way obviously from obvious from his


---------46:50----------
side that


---------46:52----------
there was like nothing coming for me um


---------46:55----------
and that just like sort of


---------46:57----------
kept happening and happening to a point


---------46:59----------
where it was like


---------47:01----------
i couldn't bother to deal with it


---------47:03----------
anymore and i just i gave up the


---------47:05----------
friendship


---------47:07----------
even though i would have loved to like


---------47:10----------
wow


---------47:12----------
yeah it's like there's a difference


---------47:13----------
between someone saying like i feel this


---------47:16----------
way about you and someone saying like


---------47:18----------
you're responsible for this happiness or


---------47:21----------
like you owe me this happiness


---------47:23----------
and sometimes it's like like any


---------47:26----------
confession you're not sure which side


---------47:28----------
that it's on


---------47:30----------
yeah like i didn't mind even though i


---------47:33----------
find it kind of weird and i find it it


---------47:35----------
kind of didn't make sense that he


---------47:38----------
just said he has a crush on me after


---------47:40----------
just like hearing his story


---------47:42----------
um and and just me hearing him out


---------47:46----------
um i didn't have a problem with him like


---------47:49----------
saying to me directly that he has a


---------47:51----------
crush on me


---------47:52----------
but when then i told him like


---------47:56----------
look i i already told him like look i


---------47:59----------
appreciate


---------48:00----------
you saying that's this to me so i can


---------48:02----------
give him like that feedback


---------48:04----------
but this is not like uh this was


---------48:07----------
i'm sorry if this was my like if you


---------48:09----------
thought that this was my


---------48:11----------
attention right that i tried to engage


---------48:13----------
any like relationship


---------48:15----------
uh thing so the thing that bothered me


---------48:19----------
was like when he played that guild card


---------48:21----------
like


---------48:21----------
oh like you know exactly that i'm going


---------48:24----------
through things so that i'm really like


---------48:27----------
you know not good with you know taking


---------48:29----------
bad responses so better act the way that


---------48:32----------
i


---------48:32----------
want like this is how i felt um


---------48:36----------
i felt really like off and this is when


---------48:39----------
i was


---------48:39----------
saying to him look i don't deserve this


---------48:42----------
goodbye and this is where i blocked him


---------48:45----------
yeah and i'm actually glad that this was


---------48:48----------
like on the internet and not


---------48:49----------
real life because you know


---------48:53----------
i don't know if yeah with the real life


---------48:56----------
you can block and people


---------48:58----------
yeah block people in real life


---------49:01----------
yeah i


---------49:04----------
okay so a couple of thoughts so i i want


---------49:06----------
to kind of return to this idea so here's


---------49:08----------
the general theme which i'm hearing


---------49:10----------
so first of all there's ambiguity at the


---------49:12----------
beginning of the relationship


---------49:13----------
and then at some point it sounds like


---------49:15----------
for the most part you guys are


---------49:17----------
okay with people sharing their feelings


---------49:20----------
about you even if they're weird and they


---------49:23----------
come from


---------49:23----------
like you know we don't know where they


---------49:24----------
come from that you kind of talk to a


---------49:27----------
stranger on the internet


---------49:28----------
um in reese's case that just sounds so


---------49:30----------
[ __ ] you remind me of my ex-girlfriend


---------49:32----------
like that is the worst


---------49:34----------
just don't even anyway


---------49:38----------
um right because it's like it's not even


---------49:40----------
about and i think this is what i'm


---------49:42----------
hearing from you guys is it's not about


---------49:43----------
you


---------49:44----------
there's like something coming from them


---------49:46----------
that you sort of


---------49:47----------
fit into a mold does that make sense


---------49:51----------
yeah yeah and and so the tricky thing so


---------49:54----------
i


---------49:54----------
the interesting thing is that i actually


---------49:56----------
am hearing even though it can be


---------49:58----------
make you uncomfortable and can be hard


---------50:01----------
in terms of a conversation that it's


---------50:03----------
actually a good thing


---------50:04----------
for them to tell you like hey i have


---------50:06----------
these feelings about you


---------50:08----------
and then comes the key thing which is


---------50:10----------
that like they should respect your


---------50:12----------
response


---------50:13----------
but instead what seems to be happening


---------50:15----------
is when you guys respond


---------50:17----------
they respond in such a way that they


---------50:19----------
kind of make you feel guilty maybe they


---------50:21----------
do a little bit


---------50:21----------
just a touch of that sprinkling of that


---------50:23----------
emotional blackmail


---------50:25----------
or something like that they don't really


---------50:27----------
respect the boundary


---------50:29----------
it's interesting because it's like it's


---------50:30----------
not so much that they're ambiguity or


---------50:32----------
their feelings


---------50:33----------
it's that like the boundary is not


---------50:35----------
respected once it's set


---------50:38----------
um it's a problem with your generation


---------50:41----------
star


---------50:42----------
y'all are just so right i've been


---------50:46----------
inappropriately groping women since i


---------50:48----------
was 20 years old and they didn't have a


---------50:49----------
[ __ ] problem with it i don't know


---------50:51----------
what's wrong with y'all


---------50:54----------
jesus kids nowadays


---------50:56----------
[Music]


---------50:58----------
right so here's here's my next question


---------51:01----------
for you guys


---------51:02----------
and and i want to kind of like tunnel


---------51:04----------
down into this so like


---------51:06----------
you know i don't mean to be let me know


---------51:08----------
if this comes across the wrong way or if


---------51:10----------
you guys feel like i'm asking an


---------51:11----------
inappropriate question or making an


---------51:12----------
appropriate assumption so in a sense we


---------51:15----------
think it's like


---------51:15----------
okay that i mean we sort of acknowledge


---------51:18----------
that they can do certain things to make


---------51:20----------
you feel a certain way


---------51:22----------
the common nature of your experience


---------51:25----------
makes me


---------51:26----------
think that you guys are consistently


---------51:29----------
doing something to make them fall in


---------51:31----------
love with you


---------51:33----------
or have questions


---------51:37----------
i think it's just the image they have of


---------51:40----------
us it's not like we're even doing


---------51:41----------
anything


---------51:42----------
for i feel like oh okay so i'm going to


---------51:45----------
calm down a little bit


---------51:46----------
but simply being a approachable


---------51:49----------
person i've learned makes people assume


---------51:52----------
that we fit like you mentioned a mold of


---------51:54----------
theirs and ideal of theirs


---------51:56----------
that makes it okay to suddenly bear


---------51:58----------
their stories and to be


---------52:00----------
a certain extent a lot of us here as i


---------52:01----------
mentioned but all these ladies have been


---------52:02----------
really supportive and they are


---------52:04----------
all very approachable and it's like


---------52:06----------
welcoming to others


---------52:07----------
but it's about taking advantage of that


---------52:10----------
when we


---------52:11----------
put the boundaries of saying no this is


---------52:13----------
going too far


---------52:15----------
yeah dude like i had i had weird stuff


---------52:18----------
like


---------52:19----------
people just speaking to me for five


---------52:21----------
minutes and they were like doing


---------52:23----------
statements like


---------52:23----------
yeah i know for sure you my dream wife


---------52:25----------
whatever and i'm like you don't even


---------52:27----------
know me


---------52:28----------
you don't know maybe i'm a terrible


---------52:30----------
person like maybe what you heard in


---------52:32----------
those five minutes is not even me like


---------52:34----------
how can you tell me that like i don't


---------52:37----------
want to be


---------52:37----------
like i don't want to have this


---------52:39----------
confirmation of like men


---------52:41----------
[Music]


---------52:42----------
telling me that i am their fantasy after


---------52:45----------
five minutes talking like


---------52:46----------
are you even interested to understand me


---------52:49----------
to know me or is it just like


---------52:51----------
okay she's my fantasy check let's go no


---------52:53----------
don't do that


---------52:55----------
i think that comes down to them having


---------52:57----------
like a very a very small checklist to be


---------52:59----------
fit it's like


---------53:00----------
she plays games you know what she's a


---------53:02----------
woman


---------53:04----------
she's female oh nice okay


---------53:07----------
that's it i need those three things and


---------53:09----------
that's perfect now we're good


---------53:11----------
we can get married now


---------53:14----------
i think a lot of people also confuse


---------53:17----------
this happens with both sides


---------53:18----------
friendliness with flirting a lot of


---------53:20----------
people also confuse that being nice oh


---------53:23----------
i obviously want you because i'm not


---------53:25----------
telling you to [ __ ] off


---------53:26----------
so yeah that's also a problem that


---------53:29----------
happens to a lot of people


---------53:31----------
so so when i trust yeah go ahead melissa


---------53:35----------
there was a point in my life where i had


---------53:37----------
this happen


---------53:38----------
so often that i figured okay the only


---------53:41----------
way to stop this from happening


---------53:43----------
is to be mean and that didn't really


---------53:46----------
fit my narrative as a person so i would


---------53:49----------
always feel a lot of conflict if


---------53:50----------
somebody


---------53:51----------
you know confided in me and you know


---------53:54----------
told me that they had feelings for me


---------53:55----------
and then sort of


---------53:56----------
expected anything more and i didn't feel


---------53:59----------
the same way


---------54:00----------
it was just it sucked that it happened


---------54:03----------
so often


---------54:04----------
in relationships with my friends


---------54:08----------
and um i guess i just wish that


---------54:11----------
there was an easier way to navigate


---------54:13----------
situations like that


---------54:15----------
so that it's not so uncomfortable was


---------54:18----------
that an okay question to ask


---------54:20----------
absolutely so i think here's what i


---------54:23----------
really liked about


---------54:24----------
y'all's answer so i i think so i sort of


---------54:26----------
said if they can make you feel guilty


---------54:28----------
can you make them fall in love and what


---------54:30----------
i heard you guys say is that


---------54:32----------
you know i i do genuinely think


---------54:34----------
something is going on here where there's


---------54:35----------
clearly a common pattern


---------54:37----------
of men feeling this way about you


---------54:41----------
so then the question becomes if there's


---------54:43----------
a common pattern


---------54:46----------
you know where does that come from and


---------54:48----------
what i'm hearing from y'all


---------54:50----------
is that they have some kind of like


---------54:53----------
strange preconceived notion


---------54:56----------
that they're not actually falling in


---------54:58----------
love with you


---------55:00----------
they're falling in love with some like


---------55:04----------
i yeah it's weird right like


---------55:08----------
and you can hear you can hear it with


---------55:10----------
risa like like


---------55:11----------
some guy randomly and he's like you


---------55:13----------
remind me of my ex-girlfriend which


---------55:15----------
signals to me that there are a lot of


---------55:17----------
feelings on his end which have


---------55:19----------
nothing to do with risa


---------55:22----------
and and where do you guys think like


---------55:25----------
where like how does


---------55:26----------
talking to someone for you know five


---------55:28----------
minutes on the internet


---------55:30----------
turn you i mean don't get me wrong champ


---------55:32----------
i've known you for a little while and i


---------55:33----------
think you're an awesome person but


---------55:35----------
i'm still a little bit confused about


---------55:37----------
you know what you're doing that makes


---------55:38----------
random strangers consistently fall in


---------55:40----------
love with you on the internet


---------55:42----------
i i think you're great i don't think


---------55:44----------
you're that great


---------55:46----------
i it confuses us too


---------55:50----------
yeah so what do you guys think like


---------55:52----------
what's up with that uh


---------55:54----------
i think it's an experience right like if


---------55:55----------
you're someone who is not used to


---------55:57----------
someone being responsive to you


---------55:59----------
and then you're talking to champ and


---------56:01----------
she's like so nice it's like yeah i'll


---------56:03----------
listen to you


---------56:03----------
and it's the first time ever someone


---------56:05----------
listens to him i understand where it's


---------56:07----------
coming from where someone's just like oh


---------56:09----------
my gosh this girl's so nice to me she's


---------56:10----------
the only one she must be


---------56:12----------
a nice person she must be someone that


---------56:15----------
could


---------56:15----------
help out with x y and z going forward so


---------56:18----------
i think inner experience does deal a lot


---------56:20----------
with it


---------56:21----------
but as mentioned like once champ was


---------56:23----------
just like oh no i'm sorry


---------56:24----------
and he's just like oh you know what i've


---------56:26----------
already gone through how dare you do


---------56:28----------
that it's just him being


---------56:29----------
upset because you no longer fit that


---------56:30----------
idea


---------56:32----------
yeah yeah like reality check this is not


---------56:35----------
gonna work


---------56:36----------
i oh yeah that's that's interesting


---------56:38----------
right so then like suddenly they have


---------56:40----------
this idea


---------56:41----------
of what champ is and what this


---------56:44----------
relationship is


---------56:45----------
and then you guys come along and i can


---------56:47----------
see where a lot of the toxicity towards


---------56:49----------
towards women comes in because then they


---------56:51----------
sort of blame you for tearing it down


---------56:55----------
how dare you not live up to my fantasy


---------56:59----------
yeah it's like we've denied them


---------57:01----------
something yeah and that's


---------57:03----------
that's interesting right because i i've


---------57:05----------
heard this thread of entitlement or


---------57:07----------
expectation


---------57:09----------
yeah what do y'all think about that


---------57:12----------
what's up with that


---------57:16----------
like i can't i can maybe say something


---------57:18----------
go ahead um because it's kind of like


---------57:20----------
mixing like rl


---------57:21----------
with online relationships um so


---------57:25----------
when i had my first relationship i


---------57:28----------
i don't know i didn't thought that i


---------57:30----------
could like set boundaries or i


---------57:32----------
this was not a thing that i


---------57:35----------
i i don't know i just didn't think that


---------57:38----------
this was a thing that you have to do in


---------57:39----------
a relationship


---------57:40----------
i yeah so like i was just like so happy


---------57:44----------
that this person wanted to be with me


---------57:46----------
and um it felt great to be honest like


---------57:49----------
you you're really overwhelmed if like


---------57:51----------
someone wants to be with you


---------57:53----------
so i was like basically like i i really


---------57:56----------
wanted to like expect


---------57:57----------
like meet his expectations see him happy


---------58:01----------
so i keep doing that for years and then


---------58:04----------
at one point i realized that holy [ __ ]


---------58:06----------
i'm so tired


---------58:07----------
like i am tired and i don't know where


---------58:09----------
this is coming from


---------58:11----------
this was when um it was a phase in my


---------58:13----------
life where i was really


---------58:15----------
you know like i set goals for myself i


---------58:18----------
had to push a bit more than i was used


---------58:20----------
to


---------58:21----------
and then i realized like holy [ __ ] i


---------58:23----------
don't have any energy


---------58:24----------
um and then i communicated that to him


---------58:29----------
and i set boundaries after


---------58:32----------
four years right and then he was so


---------58:34----------
confused he gave he was


---------58:36----------
going mad man he was like what do you


---------58:39----------
mean and you know he


---------58:40----------
and it kind of fell apart from there but


---------58:43----------
i have to say like i'm also the one to


---------58:44----------
blame for because i never communicated


---------58:46----------
those boundaries right so he was used to


---------58:49----------
like


---------58:49----------
me being this person who meets every


---------58:52----------
expectation


---------58:53----------
right so yeah


---------58:56----------
this is a huge learning that i had like


---------58:58----------
it's okay to set boundaries


---------59:00----------
because at the end of the day you want


---------59:02----------
to be loved for who you


---------59:03----------
are and be accepted for who you are and


---------59:06----------
boundaries your boundaries is also a


---------59:09----------
part of you


---------59:10----------
and this person should love you with


---------59:11----------
your boundaries too


---------59:13----------
and this is a huge learning that i had


---------59:16----------
um and i'm actually applying it to my


---------59:19----------
um recent like my actual relationship


---------59:22----------
now


---------59:23----------
and i can see a huge difference so i'm


---------59:26----------
just like


---------59:27----------
really trying to motivate you guys to


---------59:29----------
just set your boundaries in relationship


---------59:32----------
too


---------59:33----------
sounds like someone leveled up


---------59:39----------
yeah that's awesome um


---------59:42----------
yeah so what do you guys think have you


---------59:43----------
guys sort of dealt with the sense of


---------59:44----------
expectation or entitlement


---------59:48----------
from interactions online or


---------59:51----------
professors entitlement for sure okay so


---------59:55----------
i will talk about


---------59:56----------
tinder data that i had three years ago i


---------59:59----------
think


---------60:00----------
never met him i'll explain why um


---------60:02----------
texting wise where you set up a date you


---------60:04----------
meet


---------60:05----------
and then it starts storming like crazy


---------60:07----------
etc and then the person was just like


---------60:09----------
hey we're still meeting i was like hey


---------60:11----------
like


---------60:11----------
trees are falling down storms are awful


---------60:13----------
let's take a rain check and meet up like


---------60:14----------
next week instead


---------60:16----------
it was like oh no no don't worry about


---------60:17----------
it like i'll come pick you up


---------60:19----------
and i was just like oh hey like i'm


---------60:20----------
actually not comfortable with that


---------60:22----------
um so let's just do the rain check and


---------60:24----------
he just kept pushing he's like why are


---------60:26----------
you


---------60:26----------
not okay with this like i'm even


---------60:29----------
offering


---------60:29----------
to pick you up right now and you're


---------60:31----------
still saying no and i was just like hey


---------60:33----------
sorry like


---------60:34----------
it's just something i'm not comfortable


---------60:35----------
with but like i do want to meet with you


---------60:36----------
so like next week


---------60:38----------
and then you reply with c-u-n-t and then


---------60:42----------
i saw that i was just like


---------60:45----------
what just happened what does nt mean


---------60:49----------
y'all are gonna have to educate me


---------60:51----------
i don't know that's true i don't know


---------60:54----------
c-u-n-t


---------60:56----------
oh see you aunty


---------61:02----------
yeah yeah got it gotta go i i thought


---------61:04----------
you said


---------61:05----------
s e e space why are you


---------61:08----------
space


---------61:12----------
[Laughter]


---------61:21----------
yeah i figured it out


---------61:27----------
i thought it was like some you know i'm


---------61:29----------
a boomer and i like


---------61:30----------
see you no time it's like short for


---------61:32----------
c-u-n-t in no time


---------61:38----------
like a case that like this person was i


---------61:40----------
was like really nice and everything


---------61:42----------
and i felt like i was rejecting the


---------61:44----------
nicest way possible while setting that


---------61:45----------
boundary of just not wanting to pick me


---------61:47----------
up


---------61:47----------
but something just didn't live up to


---------61:49----------
that expectation and he just called me


---------61:50----------
that


---------61:52----------
and yeah so i


---------61:55----------
and that's not like the first time not


---------61:57----------
in terms of dating just in general where


---------61:59----------
if i nicely reject someone they will


---------62:00----------
just retaliate or something like


---------62:02----------
curse where like okay bye [ __ ] i didn't


---------62:04----------
know you actually just cruel and it's


---------62:06----------
just like


---------62:06----------
and that's what i am apologizing as


---------62:08----------
nicely as possible hey i'm really sorry


---------62:10----------
about this but i just like can't have


---------62:12----------
this right now


---------62:13----------
so i think those are the worst


---------62:15----------
retaliations i've gotten


---------62:16----------
yeah uh i've had


---------62:20----------
like a very soft case of that i haven't


---------62:22----------
had that experience yet


---------62:24----------
but um i've i was speaking to a guy


---------62:28----------
and then after a while i just realized


---------62:30----------
i'm not vibing with it i don't want to


---------62:32----------
be with him i don't want to speak to


---------62:34----------
him nothing he did personally i was just


---------62:36----------
not feeling


---------62:37----------
the situation and then i told him that


---------62:41----------
once and then i felt bad so i said okay


---------62:44----------
i can give you a chance but don't expect


---------62:46----------
me


---------62:46----------
to after still not have the same idea if


---------62:49----------
i have the same idea i will just stop


---------62:50----------
speaking to you and he was fine with it


---------62:52----------
then that time came and i said i'm still


---------62:55----------
not


---------62:56----------
clicking with you i don't think it's


---------62:57----------
gonna work out and


---------62:59----------
i i said i don't think we're on the same


---------63:01----------
page and


---------63:03----------
he he just told me oh he was


---------63:06----------
like okay fine but he was kind of like


---------63:08----------
passive aggressive where he said


---------63:09----------
since you've decided not to be on the


---------63:11----------
same page since i've decided to be on


---------63:13----------
the same page like i get to decide if


---------63:15----------
i'm not on the same page as you


---------63:17----------
like he he basically said oh you're just


---------63:19----------
basically calling me


---------63:20----------
basically calling me cruel like i've


---------63:24----------
just decided to not


---------63:25----------
that i just didn't want to speak with


---------63:26----------
him for no reason but no i was just


---------63:28----------
feeling that


---------63:29----------
and i get the choice too well i mean


---------63:31----------
that's like because he's also deciding


---------63:33----------
to not be on the same page with you


---------63:35----------
right it goes both ways like that's the


---------63:37----------
whole thing um yeah obviously like he


---------63:38----------
could tell me the same and


---------63:39----------
okay that's fair like but he was just


---------63:42----------
upset i guess


---------63:43----------
or more like passive aggressive about i


---------63:45----------
think he wasn't too bad


---------63:47----------
also always like amazing the length


---------63:50----------
that people will go to to like try to


---------63:53----------
make that noah yes


---------63:54----------
for you because like so for me it was i


---------63:57----------
once um was like


---------63:58----------
really close with this guy um and he


---------64:02----------
so first of all while we were just


---------64:03----------
friends we were just hanging out we were


---------64:05----------
watching movies together sometime


---------64:06----------
um he broke up with his girlfriend


---------64:10----------
later he told me that he broke up with


---------64:12----------
this girlfriend because he had feelings


---------64:13----------
for me


---------64:14----------
um and we even met irl once at an event


---------64:18----------
and then um i mean i told him


---------64:21----------
there's nothing gonna be between us


---------64:22----------
nothing's gonna happen and then after i


---------64:25----------
told him that he told me that he would


---------64:27----------
literally do anything for me


---------64:28----------
he would like pay rent for me i could


---------64:31----------
just live with him i could just play


---------64:33----------
video games all day i could just like


---------64:34----------
chill there um and and i was just like


---------64:39----------
i've i've told you for like two or three


---------64:42----------
days straight that


---------64:43----------
nothing's gonna ever happen between us


---------64:45----------
and now after we met you


---------64:47----------
you're gonna come at me with with that


---------64:49----------
and then i had another instance of


---------64:51----------
a person um that that said that they


---------64:55----------
were in love with me


---------64:56----------
um and i said that i wasn't


---------64:59----------
or whatever and then he like tried to


---------65:02----------
stay friends but he was being like


---------65:04----------
really pushy and he was just really


---------65:06----------
like he needed a lot of attention so i


---------65:08----------
decided to stop talking to him


---------65:10----------
um and then he tried to he literally


---------65:13----------
tried to bait me with anything possible


---------65:15----------
to still talk to him like


---------65:16----------
he he came into my dms at some point and


---------65:18----------
he was like yeah my therapist


---------65:21----------
told me um to ask you


---------65:24----------
what three things were about me that you


---------65:26----------
liked and three


---------65:27----------
things that you didn't like or were the


---------65:29----------
reason for us not being in a


---------65:31----------
relationship and i just sat there like


---------65:33----------
huh what no


---------65:38----------
and it's just like these kind of things


---------65:40----------
it's


---------65:42----------
it's kind of strange


---------65:45----------
i i i'm sorry i kind of missed you on


---------65:48----------
that last part is that what felt


---------65:49----------
inappropriate about that was just


---------65:50----------
because you didn't want i mean the thing


---------65:52----------
is just


---------65:52----------
no the thing is that there was like a


---------65:54----------
clear no


---------65:56----------
from my side like i told both of these


---------65:58----------
people that


---------65:59----------
nothing was gonna happen but they just


---------66:01----------
kept trying to push it and kept trying


---------66:03----------
to like


---------66:04----------
turn that no around um


---------66:07----------
so which just gets tiring linda maybe i


---------66:10----------
i totally understood what you were


---------66:12----------
saying in the first one in terms of like


---------66:13----------
you know someone asking you to pay their


---------66:15----------
rent and


---------66:16----------
i mean sorry that they'll pay your rent


---------66:17----------
and you can play video games and


---------66:19----------
and things like that that sounds really


---------66:20----------
wack what i'm a little bit confused


---------66:22----------
about and maybe


---------66:23----------
somebody your colleagues can enlighten


---------66:25----------
me is like


---------66:26----------
when someone asks you three things that


---------66:28----------
i was good at three things i was bad at


---------66:30----------
and why things


---------66:31----------
i mean wouldn't work out he used the


---------66:34----------
excuse of a


---------66:35----------
therapist first of all but then it was


---------66:38----------
it was just like


---------66:39----------
i hadn't talked to him in like weeks and


---------66:41----------
i had ignored messages over messages


---------66:43----------
over messages and it was just like okay


---------66:46----------
it just wouldn't stop even after months


---------66:48----------
to me to me it feels like also like he's


---------66:52----------
looking like he's requiring you to have


---------66:54----------
a concrete answer


---------66:55----------
when really it should just be like i'm


---------66:57----------
not interested


---------67:00----------
okay yeah to me it sounds like he


---------67:03----------
tries to get like any feedback from you


---------67:05----------
because this is something that he quite


---------67:07----------
don't understand


---------67:08----------
but i totally understand that like you


---------67:10----------
know spamming


---------67:12----------
a person and not reacting to a person is


---------67:14----------
also kind of


---------67:15----------
yeah not comfortable yeah so that i


---------67:19----------
think makes


---------67:19----------
thank you so much for clarifying that


---------67:21----------
because on the one hand i was kind of


---------67:23----------
wondering i was like you know because we


---------67:26----------
were talking earlier about education and


---------67:27----------
whether like that's a good opportunity


---------67:29----------
to educate someone


---------67:31----------
and at the same time it sounds like if


---------67:32----------
that comes after the conte


---------67:35----------
or in the context of weeks of repeatedly


---------67:38----------
trying to get something from you and


---------67:39----------
then they pull the therapist card


---------67:41----------
that paints a pretty different picture


---------67:43----------
right yeah


---------67:44----------
and because on the one hand i was like


---------67:46----------
that sounds great like if someone you


---------67:48----------
know if someone says like hey


---------67:49----------
if they're respecting your boundary and


---------67:51----------
they ask like can you tell me you know


---------67:53----------
if i did something that was


---------67:54----------
inappropriate


---------67:55----------
that sounds to me like a good


---------67:56----------
opportunity to educate but on the other


---------67:58----------
hand it also sounds like


---------68:00----------
my therapist using their therapist


---------68:03----------
as a way to re-engage you yeah like from


---------68:06----------
my perspective it just seemed like he


---------68:08----------
wanted to know three things that i liked


---------68:09----------
about him and then to give him three


---------68:11----------
things that he could like work on to


---------68:12----------
like be a better person in my


---------68:15----------
perspective


---------68:16----------
so then i see he might make the like he


---------68:19----------
turn that note he had something to work


---------68:21----------
on for himself for me i guess but like


---------68:24----------
grind


---------68:24----------
on his like knows that he


---------68:27----------
maybe can get you yeah i'm almost


---------68:31----------
noticing like


---------68:32----------
it's interesting because i i didn't


---------68:33----------
realize this assumption but now i kind


---------68:35----------
of see it


---------68:36----------
there's almost an assumption there that


---------68:38----------
if he grinds on those things


---------68:40----------
then linda won't have an excuse and that


---------68:44----------
kind of goes back to the entitlement and


---------68:46----------
expectation


---------68:47----------
i did everything that you said i was


---------68:51----------
bad at love me now


---------68:54----------
and when you still say no the


---------68:55----------
retaliation gets worse yeah but i did


---------68:58----------
everything


---------68:58----------
lisa i did everything


---------69:02----------
for you yeah right so so this


---------69:06----------
is the other trend that i'm kind of


---------69:07----------
noticing is i i'm getting the sense that


---------69:09----------
they don't


---------69:10----------
really treat you like people


---------69:13----------
yeah does that make sense they treat us


---------69:16----------
like an image


---------69:17----------
like some an addition to their we're


---------69:20----------
something to make their life better


---------69:21----------
they don't come talk to us to because


---------69:24----------
they like who we are and they want to


---------69:26----------
experience moments with us they come to


---------69:28----------
us because they have the idea that when


---------69:30----------
we're in their lives we're going to make


---------69:32----------
everything better


---------69:33----------
i actually think that in a lot of the


---------69:35----------
situations that i've been i was actually


---------69:37----------
like


---------69:38----------
close enough or had close enough often


---------69:40----------
like friendship with them already


---------69:42----------
because i just like


---------69:43----------
i mean when you're friends with someone


---------69:44----------
online you can spend like hours talking


---------69:46----------
and i


---------69:46----------
i would say that you like when you get


---------69:48----------
to know people online you get to know


---------69:49----------
them better than if you would meet them


---------69:51----------
in real life but um so i would actually


---------69:54----------
say that they were there because they


---------69:55----------
like liked who i was


---------69:57----------
yeah and they sort of understood that um


---------69:59----------
but they were just like confused about


---------70:01----------
like


---------70:02----------
themselves because i think that it's


---------70:04----------
more of like the idea that a girlfriend


---------70:07----------
will just solve everything and then also


---------70:09----------
um


---------70:12----------
like it's a distraction almost like


---------70:14----------
having a girlfriend


---------70:16----------
like it's a nice addition like it's a


---------70:18----------
past time


---------70:19----------
kind of like a new car new car it's like


---------70:22----------
i feel like it's a common issue amongst


---------70:24----------
like


---------70:25----------
everyone like guys and girls it's just


---------70:27----------
the idea of when you are talking to


---------70:28----------
someone


---------70:29----------
and i do this stuff like in my past as


---------70:31----------
well like where i'm talking and i'm only


---------70:32----------
thinking


---------70:33----------
from my own perspective right like this


---------70:34----------
conversation's benefiting me i'm like


---------70:36----------
opening it up


---------70:37----------
et cetera and i feel like it took years


---------70:39----------
and a lot of situations for me to


---------70:41----------
realize that sometimes like


---------70:42----------
i am overstepping my boundaries like


---------70:44----------
this person's going through a lot x y


---------70:46----------
and z


---------70:46----------
or i don't know what they're going


---------70:47----------
through so like me doing this right now


---------70:49----------
could honestly be really stressful for


---------70:51----------
them


---------70:51----------
so i think it's something that i


---------70:52----------
actually check now like if i'm going


---------70:54----------
through a really hard time i talk to my


---------70:56----------
friends i'm like hey like are you okay


---------70:58----------
with this and if they ever say no like


---------70:59----------
hey sorry i'm like dealing with a lot


---------71:01----------
be okay with that okay if they


---------71:04----------
i think that's the most crucial part and


---------71:06----------
it's not something to like instantly


---------71:08----------
like learn


---------71:08----------
but try to practice that try a thing on


---------71:10----------
their shoes and if they


---------71:12----------
you get rejection no it's okay and it's


---------71:15----------
not


---------71:15----------
ever on them wow


---------71:18----------
that's i mean that's pretty


---------71:19----------
introspective of you recently really


---------71:21----------
think about you know that sometimes the


---------71:23----------
the roles can be reversed and maybe


---------71:25----------
you're burdening someone


---------71:27----------
inappropriately have you guys run across


---------71:30----------
issues


---------71:30----------
either in your own life or like kind of


---------71:33----------
people that you know in terms of


---------71:35----------
women taking men up on their offers


---------71:38----------
of you know paying rent and and things


---------71:42----------
like that


---------71:42----------
and like i mean is the reverse also true


---------71:45----------
have you guys seen that


---------71:47----------
like where women are not respecting


---------71:49----------
men's boundaries obviously


---------71:51----------
yeah a hundred percent mm-hmm i mean a


---------71:54----------
common one


---------71:55----------
is uh i these days a lot more women pay


---------71:57----------
for themselves but i do have friends and


---------71:59----------
i love to death but they do have the


---------72:00----------
opinion of like men should pay for them


---------72:02----------
for example


---------72:03----------
and then i've been a situation my guy


---------72:04----------
friends was just like that's not fair


---------72:06----------
like i'm at dinner and then they are


---------72:08----------
pushing this expectation over me and


---------72:11----------
crossing that boundary where sometimes


---------72:12----------
they're like i never bring my wallet


---------72:13----------
because i thought this was expected of


---------72:14----------
you


---------72:15----------
and so that's something like on the


---------72:17----------
reverse side that i think is completely


---------72:19----------
unfair that


---------72:20----------
is more common with females than guys


---------72:22----------
that occur


---------72:23----------
and that's that's a friendship or a


---------72:25----------
romantic


---------72:27----------
uh usually romantic for those


---------72:31----------
yeah other situations does that resonate


---------72:34----------
with anyone else


---------72:36----------
yeah i mean i was in a a six-year


---------72:39----------
relationship


---------72:40----------
where um it started off with me


---------72:44----------
um compromise or not compromising um


---------72:47----------
[Music]


---------72:48----------
uh or i guess what i'm trying to say is


---------72:51----------
i


---------72:52----------
didn't allow myself to have boundaries


---------72:53----------
in the relationship so


---------72:55----------
i felt like i was catering to this


---------72:57----------
person and making sure that they were


---------72:59----------
happy


---------73:00----------
and giving them everything that they


---------73:01----------
needed um so


---------73:03----------
eventually i started to feel exhausted


---------73:05----------
kind of like what champ was talking


---------73:06----------
about


---------73:07----------
in her relationship and that led to a


---------73:10----------
lot of


---------73:10----------
resentment later on and so when i did


---------73:13----------
finally


---------73:14----------
find my voice um it almost felt like it


---------73:17----------
was too late


---------73:18----------
and um um that person didn't respect


---------73:22----------
what i was trying to say


---------73:24----------
and what i needed and so it just kind of


---------73:26----------
became a really toxic situation where we


---------73:29----------
were both


---------73:30----------
um crossing boundaries and we never


---------73:32----------
really had a chance to


---------73:34----------
fix that so it just um it made things


---------73:37----------
very toxic


---------73:38----------
between the two of us so i can i can


---------73:40----------
honestly speak for both sides when i say


---------73:42----------
that


---------73:42----------
um it's not good to


---------73:46----------
give in to um i guess the pressure


---------73:50----------
to like um i guess be there for a person


---------73:54----------
and meet their expectations if you feel


---------73:56----------
like it's hurting you


---------73:57----------
or affecting you because later on it's


---------74:00----------
just gonna lead to a lot of


---------74:01----------
anger and frustration and um


---------74:05----------
you know sometimes it just feels like


---------74:06----------
it's it's too late to even salvage


---------74:08----------
the relationship or the friendship at


---------74:10----------
that point because there are no


---------74:11----------
boundaries


---------74:12----------
it's just like anything goes at that


---------74:15----------
point


---------74:16----------
it sounds exhausting to try to be


---------74:18----------
someone that you're not


---------74:21----------
you know sounds tough um


---------74:26----------
anything else that like people i i know


---------74:28----------
we've been been kind of bouncing around


---------74:29----------
a lot does anybody want to share


---------74:31----------
anything that they kind of haven't


---------74:32----------
had a chance to yet otherwise i've got a


---------74:34----------
couple other questions or


---------74:35----------
maybe some direction but does anybody


---------74:37----------
feel like they wanted to share something


---------74:39----------
and didn't get a chance because we moved


---------74:40----------
too quickly or


---------74:44----------
so overall i just want to say and we're


---------74:46----------
not done


---------74:47----------
quite yet or anything but i just want to


---------74:48----------
say like i think it's really really


---------74:50----------
useful to hear


---------74:51----------
especially when i sort of challenge or


---------74:53----------
play devil's advocate


---------74:55----------
it's really useful i think for me to


---------74:57----------
hear y'all's perspective when i do


---------74:59----------
challenge something


---------75:00----------
um and and for i think it's it's really


---------75:03----------
uncovered a lot i hope that people who


---------75:05----------
are watching


---------75:06----------
can get a sense of what your internal


---------75:09----------
environment


---------75:10----------
is when they interact with you in this


---------75:13----------
way


---------75:13----------
because what i'm hearing is a complete


---------75:15----------
absence


---------75:17----------
of appreciation that you have an


---------75:19----------
internal environment


---------75:21----------
right that like you or a person with


---------75:23----------
thoughts and feelings and needs


---------75:25----------
and that you are not this thing that


---------75:27----------
they think you are


---------75:29----------
i think that's a broader question is to


---------75:31----------
like why they form these opinions or


---------75:33----------
where these beliefs come from


---------75:35----------
in the case of the 50 year old professor


---------75:37----------
it sort of makes sense because it's like


---------75:39----------
he's 50 and maybe he believes certain


---------75:41----------
things and


---------75:42----------
was conditioned a certain way and


---------75:43----------
honestly i wouldn't be surprised if when


---------75:45----------
he was 20 that kind of behavior was more


---------75:47----------
acceptable


---------75:48----------
right so like if you look at people who


---------75:49----------
are boomers


---------75:51----------
like disrespect


---------75:54----------
for various reasons including your age


---------75:57----------
or your gender


---------75:58----------
or whatever your race was like more


---------76:00----------
acceptable 50 years ago than it is today


---------76:05----------
um a couple of other things that i kind


---------76:07----------
of was was curious


---------76:08----------
and so i think it's like worthwhile i'm


---------76:10----------
curious about where these impressions


---------76:11----------
from people come from


---------76:13----------
i also wonder a lot about like i get the


---------76:16----------
sense that a lot of people that you guys


---------76:17----------
talk to are really


---------76:19----------
starved and hungry for something that


---------76:21----------
they don't get anywhere else


---------76:23----------
and it's been my observation that like


---------76:25----------
when you treat them like humans


---------76:27----------
they confuse that because that's also


---------76:29----------
some of the way that we're conditioned


---------76:31----------
as men


---------76:32----------
that we don't disclose really personal


---------76:35----------
thoughts or feelings unless it's


---------76:36----------
romantic


---------76:38----------
that talking so weird what's weird about


---------76:41----------
that


---------76:42----------
i don't know like i wouldn't have any


---------76:44----------
problem talking to friends about that


---------76:46----------
like i wouldn't


---------76:47----------
i wouldn't think it was anything more


---------76:48----------
than friends if i like went to someone


---------76:50----------
for advice or to talk about something


---------76:52----------
that i was going through


---------76:53----------
i like wish it was more normal you know


---------76:55----------
like i wish i could just have that


---------76:56----------
conversation


---------76:58----------
with friends that are men without it


---------77:00----------
being weird you know


---------77:03----------
um i guess they hold um speaking to


---------77:06----------
someone about their problems


---------77:08----------
um more special to them than we do


---------77:10----------
because we have


---------77:11----------
no problem sometimes depends on the


---------77:14----------
person but speaking with a friend


---------77:16----------
but they associate speaking with someone


---------77:18----------
to someone who's more special maybe


---------77:19----------
that's where that association comes from


---------77:22----------
but it that that association


---------77:25----------
also comes with a lot of insecurity


---------77:27----------
because they are told sometimes men are


---------77:29----------
told like you cannot cry you cannot


---------77:31----------
speak about your emotions because you're


---------77:32----------
seen as weak so when someone


---------77:35----------
gives them the chance to be themselves


---------77:37----------
they might attach to you


---------77:38----------
because you make them feel good but it's


---------77:41----------
just in fact like


---------77:42----------
they should just be able to speak with


---------77:44----------
everyone normally and


---------77:45----------
have a lot of friendly people treating


---------77:48----------
them like humans


---------77:49----------
yeah and i completely agree with you


---------77:51----------
math and i think that actually is like


---------77:52----------
part of the problem because


---------77:54----------
you know they should be able to speak to


---------77:56----------
other people like that that way


---------77:58----------
but they're not and so if you're


---------78:02----------
yeah i think if i can imagine and based


---------78:05----------
on my conversations with like gamers and


---------78:07----------
even like in cells and stuff


---------78:08----------
we've been trying to get a real incel on


---------78:10----------
stream and we haven't found one


---------78:12----------
mostly what is the real infill i don't


---------78:15----------
know but like i thought it was like


---------78:16----------
like most of the people that we get on


---------78:18----------
stream end up being decent human beings


---------78:19----------
which is


---------78:21----------
you know i feel like once you have


---------78:22----------
one-on-ones with people they are


---------78:24----------
actually decent human beings yeah but


---------78:27----------
then like through


---------78:28----------
i really think so like uh but then like


---------78:30----------
when there's the online persona like


---------78:33----------
all the insult comments come in they


---------78:35----------
don't think before they speak but like i


---------78:36----------
feel like when they go on a show with


---------78:37----------
you dr kayla you start targeting with


---------78:39----------
specific questions


---------78:40----------
and for once they're actually analyzing


---------78:42----------
before they speak they're naturally and


---------78:44----------
so


---------78:44----------
if they put on some thoughts about it a


---------78:47----------
lot of um


---------78:48----------
sorry a lot of the incel um


---------78:51----------
behavior at least i think comes from a


---------78:54----------
lot of bad feelings that they have


---------78:56----------
that they just to cope put out


---------78:59----------
their hate on women but i think it just


---------79:01----------
comes from a lot of bad feelings and


---------79:03----------
that emotions that they have


---------79:04----------
on their daily lives so when you speak


---------79:07----------
to them like face on face


---------79:09----------
i mean i'm saying like a few of them i


---------79:11----------
can say it's all of them but a few of


---------79:13----------
them are just


---------79:13----------
nice people who are going through a hard


---------79:15----------
time and not


---------79:16----------
doing the right things with those those


---------79:18----------
emotions


---------79:20----------
before they've had a couple of bad


---------79:21----------
experiences and these were enough


---------79:23----------
to make them feel so angry at women


---------79:28----------
yeah i i think that i'd agree i mean


---------79:31----------
there's a lot of understanding i i think


---------79:32----------
you guys are speaking


---------79:34----------
a lot of sense to me i mean that's my


---------79:36----------
sense too is that


---------79:37----------
a lot of times what happens and if we


---------79:39----------
even think about your experiences


---------79:41----------
you know when they feel rejected or hurt


---------79:43----------
by you


---------79:44----------
oftentimes like you know hurt turns into


---------79:47----------
anger


---------79:48----------
and when i think about where did where's


---------79:50----------
hatred born it's usually born from one


---------79:52----------
of two places in my experience


---------79:54----------
one is hurt and the second is


---------79:57----------
conditioning


---------79:58----------
and in the case of some of these online


---------80:00----------
communities like


---------80:02----------
you know they feel hurt and then there's


---------80:04----------
a community


---------80:05----------
that embraces them with open arms


---------80:09----------
and at the same time you know kind of


---------80:11----------
thinking about what i'm hearing from


---------80:12----------
y'all's stories i mean i get the sense


---------80:14----------
that


---------80:14----------
you guys are providing something that's


---------80:16----------
rare and valuable and frankly what


---------80:19----------
sounds like it's intoxicating


---------80:21----------
to some people and they don't really


---------80:23----------
know what that means because they've


---------80:24----------
been taught


---------80:25----------
that you know when you talk about


---------80:28----------
feelings like people don't really listen


---------80:29----------
to you and being listened to


---------80:31----------
and respected and treated as a human can


---------80:33----------
really be confusing for them


---------80:36----------
um because they were just taught by a


---------80:38----------
different kind of playbook


---------80:40----------
not saying that you know it excuses


---------80:42----------
their behavior but


---------80:44----------
i can also understand um how hard it is


---------80:47----------
to find somebody to trust


---------80:49----------
because that's something that i've dealt


---------80:51----------
with in my life and


---------80:53----------
so when you finally have an interaction


---------80:54----------
with somebody where you feel like you


---------80:56----------
can


---------80:57----------
you know really open up and be


---------80:58----------
vulnerable it it


---------81:00----------
changes the dynamic of


---------81:04----------
the relationship or the friendship and


---------81:06----------
some people are able to separate


---------81:08----------
themselves


---------81:09----------
and understand that it's not romantic


---------81:11----------
but then there are other situations


---------81:12----------
where


---------81:13----------
people can't and they take it as okay


---------81:15----------
this person


---------81:16----------
is interested in me because i can trust


---------81:19----------
them and they trust me and


---------81:21----------
i can take it further because we have


---------81:23----------
that type of relationship


---------81:24----------
but it may not be the case and


---------81:28----------
yeah go ahead math uh i also see


---------81:31----------
sometimes when


---------81:32----------
you set the boundaries a lot of people


---------81:34----------
are actually respectful like okay i'm


---------81:35----------
sorry i didn't know this i will uh


---------81:37----------
respect your boundaries


---------81:38----------
i lagged i don't know if you heard me


---------81:40----------
yep but um


---------81:42----------
and then the other when people don't


---------81:44----------
react well i think it's because they


---------81:46----------
don't know how to


---------81:47----------
separate um the rejection


---------81:50----------
from their value i think they they take


---------81:52----------
the rejection as


---------81:53----------
immediately like you suck so i don't


---------81:55----------
want to be with you


---------81:56----------
it could be just the thing of we're


---------81:58----------
different people we don't fit together i


---------82:00----------
don't think it would work out but they


---------82:01----------
take it to their ego


---------82:02----------
and that's why and it hurts them that's


---------82:05----------
why it comes off as anger


---------82:07----------
sometimes yeah so i i know we're talking


---------82:10----------
a little bit about


---------82:11----------
you know valuing someone as a person but


---------82:14----------
not necessarily


---------82:16----------
being on the same page about a


---------82:17----------
relationship that's what we call the


---------82:19----------
friend zone


---------82:20----------
i know we've sort of been talking about


---------82:22----------
this does anybody want to share an


---------82:23----------
actual like experience of like friend


---------82:26----------
zoning someone and what happened


---------82:29----------
champion linda um yeah after that


---------82:32----------
everyone


---------82:34----------
okay i will start so um it's a


---------82:38----------
uh real life experience that i had so


---------82:42----------
like some years ago i had


---------82:45----------
really like a lot of friends and most of


---------82:48----------
them they were men


---------82:50----------
and um then i realized why i have so


---------82:54----------
many many


---------82:54----------
male friends um so


---------82:58----------
they tried to have a romantic


---------83:00----------
relationship with me and when


---------83:02----------
you know they were like clear evidence


---------83:04----------
like when they said it because


---------83:06----------
back then i didn't quite understood it


---------83:09----------
like like


---------83:10----------
wait what kind of evidence are they


---------83:12----------
there out


---------83:13----------
like are they out there so i thought


---------83:15----------
like yeah a guy just


---------83:16----------
being nice to me and want to hang out


---------83:18----------
with me this is like


---------83:20----------
this is cool you know this is this is


---------83:22----------
not a relationship like this is not


---------83:24----------
us trying to go to the next level this


---------83:26----------
is just us


---------83:27----------
appreciating each other and just hanging


---------83:29----------
out


---------83:30----------
so you know when they try to make a move


---------83:33----------
like


---------83:34----------
try to hold my hands or something i was


---------83:36----------
like wait


---------83:37----------
um this is not quite what i was going


---------83:40----------
for


---------83:41----------
like can we just like like how do you


---------83:44----------
say


---------83:45----------
can you can we just be friends right um


---------83:48----------
so


---------83:48----------
they were like oh yeah sure but then


---------83:50----------
they ghosted on me


---------83:51----------
we never like hang out anymore so i lost


---------83:54----------
like almost 10 friends like that


---------83:56----------
because after i communicated that look


---------83:59----------
this is the friend zone i never heard


---------84:02----------
for them again


---------84:03----------
so like now this kind of stick with me


---------84:07----------
because now


---------84:08----------
i'm like scared of having like


---------84:11----------
male friendship like or even having like


---------84:15----------
a


---------84:16----------
guy friend that i can be just like that


---------84:18----------
i can just hang around with


---------84:20----------
um because i'm scared of having like


---------84:22----------
this confirmation of


---------84:24----------
again that all they wanted was just like


---------84:27----------
me fulfilling


---------84:28----------
like their fantasies and not actually


---------84:30----------
like me


---------84:31----------
like appreciating my presence and just


---------84:34----------
hang around


---------84:35----------
so yeah this is my friend's own


---------84:37----------
experience


---------84:39----------
so so let me just ask a quick question


---------84:43----------
so


---------84:43----------
they ghosted you so clearly they were


---------84:45----------
not interested in friendship they were


---------84:47----------
more


---------84:48----------
interested in something else um


---------84:51----------
you know what i guess i'm sort of


---------84:54----------
envisioning if they had said no i'm


---------84:56----------
actually like i do have strong feelings


---------84:57----------
for you and i don't think that we can be


---------84:59----------
friends


---------85:00----------
i understand they didn't say that if


---------85:02----------
they had said that do you think that


---------85:03----------
that's


---------85:04----------
okay


---------85:10----------
i'm trying to think back like that's


---------85:13----------
back then how i would


---------85:14----------
um yeah i don't think there's nothing


---------85:16----------
like wrong with them


---------85:18----------
saying it it's just that i can't give


---------85:21----------
them the answer that they want


---------85:23----------
yup you know yeah so


---------85:27----------
and i i'm i'm kind of noticing that like


---------85:29----------
this is one of those situations where


---------85:31----------
they may be on one page and you're on a


---------85:35----------
different page which is totally cool it


---------85:37----------
sounds like you set a good boundary


---------85:39----------
but then also like maybe what would


---------85:41----------
actually be healthier


---------85:42----------
is if they do have feelings and it would


---------85:45----------
be hard for them to be friends


---------85:47----------
instead of ghosting you just being


---------85:49----------
transparent right like


---------85:50----------
respecting your boundary but also sort


---------85:53----------
of


---------85:54----------
sharing their feelings and saying


---------85:57----------
you know hey i don't know if i can do


---------85:58----------
that because i do have feelings for you


---------86:03----------
what do you think about that yeah i


---------86:05----------
would appreciate that because it will


---------86:07----------
give me


---------86:08----------
like clarity and i don't have to guess


---------86:10----------
it on my own


---------86:11----------
and interpret it that oh like my


---------86:13----------
presence


---------86:14----------
as a female friend for male friend


---------86:18----------
is giving hints of me wanting a


---------86:21----------
relationship with them


---------86:22----------
i don't know yeah yeah i think that also


---------86:26----------
kind of goes back to the ambiguity of


---------86:28----------
of like you know when do you know


---------86:30----------
whether


---------86:31----------
you're hanging out or you're dating or


---------86:34----------
what


---------86:35----------
and yeah and it just kind of goes back


---------86:37----------
to like the common theme that i'm sort


---------86:38----------
of hearing because it's not so much


---------86:39----------
about


---------86:40----------
so it sounds like it's important for you


---------86:42----------
to set a boundary right so it's also


---------86:43----------
maybe important for them to try to


---------86:45----------
signal to you


---------86:46----------
that they are interested by trying to


---------86:47----------
grab your hand or hold your hand and


---------86:49----------
then you kind of say hey i'm not really


---------86:50----------
interested in this


---------86:52----------
so i so far based on what you guys have


---------86:55----------
said i'm sort of assuming that it's okay


---------86:57----------
for them to let their


---------86:58----------
intentions be known if they do is feel a


---------87:01----------
certain way about you


---------87:03----------
we on the same page there or yes yeah as


---------87:06----------
long as they're like respectful


---------87:08----------
exactly it's what you want kind of like


---------87:10----------
i i want to know


---------87:12----------
so i know how to like react right


---------87:15----------
and then for you to set the boundary in


---------87:17----------
terms of what you're comfortable with


---------87:20----------
and then they too get to set ideally


---------87:23----------
they would set their own boundary in


---------87:25----------
response to


---------87:26----------
your i mean respect yours but also are


---------87:28----------
allowed to set their own which is that


---------87:30----------
i'm actually not too interested in


---------87:32----------
friendship


---------87:33----------
yeah that's something i feel like


---------87:35----------
sometimes it doesn't have to be so like


---------87:38----------
blunt or straightforward like oh i have


---------87:39----------
feelings for you what are we gonna do


---------87:41----------
it could be as simple as like just


---------87:43----------
checking in with each other and making


---------87:45----------
sure


---------87:46----------
that um what's going on is comfortable


---------87:48----------
for both


---------87:49----------
parties and go from there because it can


---------87:52----------
be a lot of pressure to hear somebody


---------87:53----------
tell you that they have feelings for you


---------87:55----------
and you don't have the same feelings


---------87:57----------
back um


---------87:58----------
it's just it's harder to respond in that


---------88:01----------
situation because you don't want to


---------88:02----------
anger them you don't want to make them


---------88:04----------
feel like


---------88:04----------
bad for being vulnerable so i think just


---------88:07----------
check-ins are nice


---------88:09----------
yeah i think even like if it does


---------88:11----------
progress to a relationship


---------88:12----------
check-ins are nice because like i was in


---------88:14----------
a relationship for like three years


---------88:16----------
where there were things that i was


---------88:17----------
uncomfortable with but it like


---------88:18----------
felt like it was established so early on


---------88:20----------
that it's like too late to set a


---------88:22----------
boundary now


---------88:23----------
or like if i set a boundary now would it


---------88:25----------
be offensive to my partner you know


---------88:28----------
and that's like i i didn't know


---------88:31----------
like when i didn't set those boundaries


---------88:33----------
early on it was because


---------88:34----------
that was confrontation and i didn't want


---------88:37----------
to be like hey you went too far this


---------88:38----------
time


---------88:39----------
but instead of having that conversation


---------88:42----------
then


---------88:43----------
he just thought he didn't go too far and


---------88:45----------
it happened again and again and i wasn't


---------88:47----------
comfortable with it you know and so it's


---------88:48----------
like


---------88:49----------
in hindsight i wish that i knew


---------88:53----------
um so what i'm hearing is that that


---------88:56----------
you know it's easier to set a boundary


---------88:58----------
than it is to change a boundary


---------89:01----------
like or set an expectation than it is to


---------89:04----------
change an expectation


---------89:05----------
and i actually hear a common theme that


---------89:07----------
just in terms of y'all's relationships


---------89:10----------
um you know i don't know how old many of


---------89:12----------
y'all are but i'm


---------89:13----------
in my mind you're young none of y'all


---------89:15----------
are boomers


---------89:16----------
and so you know i think it's normal to


---------89:18----------
not know


---------89:19----------
some of the things that you guys know


---------89:21----------
now right like we we've heard


---------89:23----------
you know champ leveled up like all of


---------89:25----------
you all have leveled up and that's what


---------89:26----------
happens when you're in a relationship


---------89:28----------
for three years four years six years


---------89:30----------
that you level up and you learn and that


---------89:32----------
sometimes you have to kind of adjust


---------89:34----------
expectations you have your own


---------89:35----------
insecurities you're trying to be this


---------89:38----------
person that the other


---------89:39----------
because you care about you want a


---------89:40----------
relationship so you're willing to


---------89:42----------
compromise certain things and that's


---------89:43----------
actually pretty normal


---------89:44----------
in relationships by the way and that


---------89:47----------
healthy relationships are not the ones


---------89:49----------
that


---------89:49----------
start one way and stay that way but that


---------89:53----------
expectations and relationships


---------89:55----------
change over time and that


---------89:58----------
in my experience healthy relationships


---------90:00----------
are the ones that are not the same as


---------90:02----------
when they started


---------90:03----------
and it involves changing your


---------90:06----------
expectations


---------90:07----------
setting new expectations hey it was


---------90:09----------
great that you played video games for 15


---------90:11----------
hours a day when we were 19


---------90:12----------
but now that we're 28 and we have three


---------90:14----------
kids


---------90:16----------
i know it sounds like a joke but it's


---------90:18----------
actually kind of sad man


---------90:20----------
[Music]


---------90:21----------
um and what alyssa was kind of saying


---------90:25----------
about sort of feeling things out and


---------90:27----------
checking in with people like actually


---------90:29----------
reminds me of what risa said in the


---------90:30----------
first five minutes


---------90:32----------
which is if you don't know ask


---------90:35----------
right i can imagine that champ's


---------90:37----------
situation would have been like


---------90:39----------
smoother if people had sort of let her


---------90:41----------
know ahead of time or even that


---------90:42----------
if you would let them know that hey just


---------90:45----------
checking in like


---------90:46----------
how do you see our relationship


---------90:49----------
um yeah so


---------90:52----------
so any i think someone else had a story


---------90:55----------
about the friendzone linda


---------90:56----------
oh yeah i've i just want to say


---------90:58----------
something before it's something that is


---------90:59----------
like sort of interesting to me is that


---------91:02----------
um i every time


---------91:06----------
i meet new people or i engage in a new


---------91:08----------
community


---------91:09----------
i like sort of make it very clear


---------91:12----------
um that i'm not interested in starting a


---------91:15----------
relationship


---------91:16----------
here like and and the thing is like even


---------91:18----------
though people know they will still


---------91:21----------
um develop those feelings for me or


---------91:22----------
still


---------91:24----------
try to make a move whatever um but then


---------91:28----------
okay so it's it's probably one of my


---------91:31----------
favorite or not favorite friend zone


---------91:33----------
stories but my best friend


---------91:34----------
actually confessed to me um like


---------91:38----------
a year ago when we barely met we we'd


---------91:40----------
met each other for like


---------91:41----------
two weeks three weeks um and he said


---------91:44----------
that he thought that he had feelings for


---------91:46----------
me even though he knew that i wasn't


---------91:47----------
interested in anything


---------91:48----------
and stuff like that um


---------91:51----------
but out of that confession a sort of


---------91:53----------
like openness in our relationship


---------91:55----------
developed where


---------91:56----------
where he realized that i was just


---------91:59----------
accepting and i was like okay with him


---------92:01----------
telling me these things


---------92:02----------
um and we sort of like talked about it


---------92:05----------
and stuff like that and he realized that


---------92:08----------
um he didn't like actually fall in love


---------92:11----------
with me or whatever and now we're like


---------92:14----------
he he is definitely the person that i'm


---------92:15----------
closest to in my my life


---------92:17----------
um and i'm like super happy that i have


---------92:19----------
him and i know he's also watching so


---------92:23----------
so i'm gonna troll you a little bit so


---------92:25----------
it sounds like he's playing the long


---------92:27----------
game


---------92:27----------
[Laughter]


---------92:30----------
the thing okay so he he recently moved


---------92:33----------
to the same city as me


---------92:35----------
um and and i thought especially in the


---------92:38----------
beginning when we like met up and stuff


---------92:40----------
i was like a little bit skeptical i was


---------92:42----------
like wait


---------92:44----------
so so i picked this up i picked i picked


---------92:47----------
the discussion up again and i was like


---------92:48----------
just making sure and stuff


---------92:50----------
but that just like again cleared things


---------92:52----------
up and it was nice


---------92:53----------
like okay so linda pardon me for being


---------92:57----------
skeptical


---------92:58----------
but i don't really know your situation


---------93:00----------
i'm gonna actually ask


---------93:01----------
your colleagues what do you guys think


---------93:02----------
about the situation because like they're


---------93:04----------
the experts right


---------93:06----------
i'd be curious if in like a year it's


---------93:08----------
still you're just pals living in the


---------93:10----------
same city


---------93:12----------
oh really i say good for her i like


---------93:14----------
think that's yeah which is great


---------93:17----------
i think he he understood that he had a


---------93:20----------
deep friendship with her in connection


---------93:22----------
and in the beginning he might have


---------93:23----------
confused it with love but i think


---------93:25----------
once like he understood okay so i can


---------93:28----------
have a really good friend that i can


---------93:30----------
talk to and she can


---------93:32----------
can not be my girlfriend she could just


---------93:34----------
be my friend and that's okay


---------93:36----------
like so yeah yeah if anything it shows


---------93:38----------
growth on his part because he was able


---------93:41----------
to


---------93:41----------
express how he felt and understand what


---------93:44----------
your


---------93:45----------
friendship meant to him and whether or


---------93:46----------
not it was important to keep going or to


---------93:48----------
say okay this is not going to work out


---------93:51----------
one thing is you know i actually hate


---------93:53----------
the term friend zone


---------93:55----------
so i think it's a really fun meme term


---------93:57----------
to use like i love it which has to only


---------93:59----------
see something else you're like oh you've


---------94:00----------
been friend zoned it's funny


---------94:01----------
um but in terms of like real life if a


---------94:03----------
guy or a girl and bisexual by the way


---------94:05----------
tells me that like hey like you're a


---------94:06----------
good friend of mine


---------94:07----------
first insane it's like cool they're a


---------94:09----------
friend too let me see them in a friend's


---------94:11----------
like


---------94:11----------
view and even if i did initially find


---------94:13----------
them attractive in a relationship sense


---------94:16----------
that's fine it's just simply change that


---------94:18----------
kind of mentality like all right


---------94:20----------
they told me that they see me as a


---------94:21----------
friend i see them as a friend too great


---------94:23----------
i'm not like oh no i've been in the


---------94:25----------
friend zone now like that's not my first


---------94:27----------
reaction and i think that people who


---------94:29----------
have that first reaction whenever a girl


---------94:31----------
or a guy


---------94:32----------
tells you that they see you as a friend


---------94:33----------
and you're like oh wow


---------94:35----------
i've been zoned i think that's


---------94:38----------
actually a really bad mentality to have


---------94:41----------
yeah i think a counterpoint is like


---------94:44----------
you've been girlfriend zoned


---------94:46----------
right yeah right because that's what


---------94:49----------
happens to you guys you guys get


---------94:51----------
girlfriend-zoned


---------94:52----------
from the get-go oh you listened to me


---------94:54----------
for five minutes about how i lost this


---------94:56----------
game in league of legends


---------94:58----------
and you were sympathetic girlfriend's


---------95:00----------
own time


---------95:02----------
to be honest it isn't even that it's not


---------95:04----------
a lot of the time


---------95:05----------
i think guys don't even confess in the


---------95:07----------
hopes of have of like getting with us


---------95:09----------
for me at least like because because i


---------95:11----------
always make sure that people know that


---------95:12----------
nothing's going to happen they know they


---------95:15----------
just want to get it off their chest


---------95:16----------
um but the the problem that i


---------95:20----------
mainly have with this is like how much


---------95:22----------
it happens and the frequency of it


---------95:24----------
sure like i would almost say


---------95:28----------
like maybe every fifth to seventh person


---------95:33----------
that i become friends with online


---------95:37----------
is like at some point um tells me


---------95:40----------
they're attracted to me


---------95:42----------
and because of that it's just like you


---------95:44----------
lose a very big amount of friends and it


---------95:46----------
also puts you


---------95:47----------
sometimes at a like awkward spot in a


---------95:51----------
community


---------95:53----------
um yeah sounds hard so it kind of puts


---------95:57----------
you out like


---------95:57----------
it just yeah i'm i'm gonna just


---------96:00----------
challenge again


---------96:01----------
because i i sort of heard a lot so linda


---------96:03----------
said


---------96:04----------
hey this happened he moved to the same


---------96:06----------
city i was kind of joking a little bit


---------96:08----------
and and i i do think that you know it


---------96:10----------
sounds like the majority opinion


---------96:12----------
is that this is a sign of growth and


---------96:14----------
it's like healthy and i think everything


---------96:15----------
you guys said makes a lot of sense in


---------96:17----------
terms of


---------96:18----------
sometimes it's important to just get


---------96:19----------
those feelings off of your chest have a


---------96:21----------
mature conversation and that's how the


---------96:23----------
friendship moves forward


---------96:25----------
at the same time star was a little bit


---------96:28----------
curious


---------96:30----------
right i'm just like actually just


---------96:32----------
curious because that seems like a big


---------96:34----------
step


---------96:35----------
i can't think of any friends that i


---------96:36----------
would make that step for


---------96:38----------
but that's just me personally like i'm


---------96:41----------
not saying one way or another


---------96:42----------
i i think if we think a little bit about


---------96:44----------
why we're talking today


---------96:46----------
i think actually the way to be the most


---------96:48----------
supportive is to not


---------96:50----------
necessarily just agree with people what


---------96:52----------
people are saying


---------96:53----------
even though i don't think you guys are


---------96:54----------
just agreeing with linda i think


---------96:55----------
everyone brings up good points


---------96:57----------
sounds like linda's very good at setting


---------96:58----------
boundaries early on


---------97:00----------
and that she's good at like managing


---------97:02----------
things and that they are genuinely very


---------97:04----------
good friends


---------97:05----------
and at the same time i also think what


---------97:06----------
star says you know like


---------97:09----------
something flipped in my mind because


---------97:12----------
just like she said


---------97:13----------
i don't know or let me be


---------97:16----------
clear i have never well


---------97:20----------
maybe even that that's a not a good i


---------97:22----------
was about to say i've never moved cities


---------97:24----------
for a friend


---------97:25----------
but that also assumes for a moment that


---------97:27----------
he moved for her which is like probably


---------97:29----------
not a fair assumption


---------97:30----------
right it just happened he wanted to move


---------97:32----------
out of his country in the first place


---------97:34----------
sorry yeah and and so it sort of makes


---------97:36----------
sense to move to a place if you're


---------97:38----------
planning on moving to like move to a


---------97:39----------
place where you have


---------97:40----------
some kind of connection in some kind of


---------97:42----------
roots


---------97:44----------
but i also do know people that have


---------97:46----------
played the long game


---------97:48----------
and and so just something to think about


---------97:50----------
you know it does sound like it's


---------97:52----------
she set a firm boundary and there are


---------97:53----------
good reasons to move and and things like


---------97:55----------
that


---------97:55----------
linda am i making you feel uncomfortable


---------97:57----------
you look good no okay


---------97:59----------
sorry yeah good and i i think what


---------98:03----------
everyone else said too but i'm also


---------98:04----------
curious and i i wonder what will happen


---------98:06----------
in the year


---------98:09----------
i hope it's not being an [ __ ] to say


---------98:10----------
that no no no no no not at all


---------98:12----------
i mean it's as i said yeah yeah because


---------98:15----------
i i think


---------98:16----------
frankly part of what i where this is


---------98:18----------
coming from is that


---------98:20----------
i also know that some people


---------98:23----------
will do their best to try to be friends


---------98:27----------
and that over time those kinds of


---------98:29----------
feelings can re-emerge


---------98:30----------
or as he sort of figured things out and


---------98:33----------
then


---------98:34----------
you know as as time goes on you can


---------98:36----------
figure out oh i actually like do have


---------98:37----------
feelings right


---------98:38----------
just like relationships change and


---------98:40----------
evolve and you guys have conversations


---------98:43----------
it's possible i can imagine if you take


---------98:45----------
a hundred people


---------98:46----------
in linda's scenario some of those


---------98:48----------
conversations will probably end up being


---------98:50----------
oh i actually do have feelings for you


---------98:52----------
y'all is that fair risa you wanted to


---------98:55----------
say something yeah so i just want to say


---------98:56----------
that has happened to me where i friend


---------98:57----------
zoned someone and then we actually dated


---------98:59----------
like


---------99:00----------
a year later and the concept was that


---------99:02----------
though


---------99:04----------
i'm so sorry i'm so sorry about this


---------99:06----------
i'll make a proper point about this okay


---------99:08----------
so do you realize how many women you


---------99:11----------
just screwed with that statement because


---------99:13----------
now


---------99:13----------
but i will make it clear though


---------99:17----------
let me finish


---------99:20----------
like the thing is is that he was not


---------99:22----------
continuously hitting on me


---------99:24----------
like after i made it clear he became a


---------99:26----------
good friend like honest to god


---------99:28----------
never was just like hey you're cute


---------99:30----------
today or like hey


---------99:31----------
like we should do this together it was a


---------99:33----------
very respectful relationship and then


---------99:35----------
things just ended up that way because


---------99:36----------
eventually i


---------99:38----------
caught feelings and then i reached out


---------99:40----------
to him


---------99:41----------
about it not the other way around with


---------99:44----------
him forcing it


---------99:45----------
on me so much hope to the internet reset


---------99:49----------
i would definitely rare completely it's


---------99:52----------
a rare case it's a rare case for sure


---------99:54----------
like i'm so sorry if i screwed people no


---------99:57----------
it's true though


---------99:59----------
it's true because i wanted to say like


---------100:01----------
relationships do change but the idea is


---------100:03----------
that you're not forceful about it


---------100:05----------
right like so even though you are


---------100:08----------
yeah like if you're a friend your friend


---------100:10----------
act like a friend that's what my ex did


---------100:12----------
right and then uh things just happened


---------100:14----------
with that one and it was a rare case


---------100:16----------
but in general this is not like the long


---------100:18----------
time when you get friend zone and you're


---------100:19----------
like all right


---------100:20----------
let me figure out what is the plan of


---------100:23----------
how i can still hit on her and get each


---------100:25----------
other


---------100:26----------
points and he did not have that


---------100:28----------
expectation if anything like it just was


---------100:30----------
out of nowhere that i confessed to him


---------100:32----------
so i mean the key is just like being


---------100:35----------
open with your communication especially


---------100:36----------
in these like situations and it's also


---------100:38----------
like


---------100:39----------
i have that with my best friend that


---------100:40----------
when he confessed to me


---------100:42----------
it was like when he caught feelings i


---------100:45----------
had feelings for someone else and i was


---------100:46----------
talking to him about those feelings and


---------100:48----------
then like


---------100:48----------
a little while after that he was like


---------100:50----------
the way that you felt about that guy was


---------100:52----------
exactly how i felt about you


---------100:54----------
um but like that sort of established


---------100:57----------
such a like


---------100:58----------
close trust factor that even if he now


---------101:00----------
caught feelings for me i would trust him


---------101:02----------
to


---------101:02----------
say it again and if i developed him i i


---------101:04----------
would like be open about it and be able


---------101:06----------
to talk about it to him as well


---------101:09----------
um so i think that's why i trust him in


---------101:11----------
that way by the way


---------101:12----------
to also save the conversation slightly


---------101:14----------
just because i know that lineman is


---------101:15----------
screwed there are people that has


---------101:16----------
confessed to me that i will cut out of


---------101:18----------
my life instantly because


---------101:19----------
and continue to try to flirt and etc and


---------101:21----------
that's not proper friendship for me


---------101:23----------
so i would be like hey i just goodbye no


---------101:26----------
but i mean i i think it is common right


---------101:28----------
so i think part of the reason that


---------101:30----------
that some people stay in the friend zone


---------101:32----------
is because i have heard a lot of


---------101:34----------
situations


---------101:35----------
where um until my wife explained to me


---------101:37----------
that this wasn't true


---------101:38----------
i thought we were friends first right


---------101:41----------
and


---------101:41----------
that's not unreasonable right that like


---------101:43----------
you can be friends with someone because


---------101:45----------
what we're talking about is people


---------101:46----------
grow and change over time and so like if


---------101:49----------
someone is in your life and they grow


---------101:51----------
and change as a person and you grow and


---------101:53----------
change as a person


---------101:54----------
the nature of a healthy relationship is


---------101:56----------
one that changes over time and sometimes


---------101:58----------
that can start as a friendship


---------101:59----------
and end up as a romance or bizarrely


---------102:02----------
i've also worked with people who are


---------102:03----------
like


---------102:04----------
you know divorced and are on amicable


---------102:06----------
terms and realize


---------102:07----------
oh actually like we make awesome friends


---------102:09----------
and we were just confused and we should


---------102:11----------
have never been in a romantic


---------102:12----------
relationship


---------102:13----------
even gotten married and that's true too


---------102:16----------
right so i was kind of trolling you but


---------102:18----------
i i do think that


---------102:19----------
you know i can understand why some


---------102:21----------
people hope


---------102:23----------
or i can understand why some people


---------102:25----------
would stay in the friend zone


---------102:26----------
with their fingers crossed and what i'm


---------102:29----------
hearing from you guys is what makes that


---------102:31----------
okay or not okay is the openness


---------102:34----------
and the trust with which you do that


---------102:37----------
right it's like in the back of your mind


---------102:39----------
if you're like waiting for her to fall


---------102:41----------
in love with you


---------102:42----------
that just sounds unfair toxic and


---------102:44----------
frankly unhealthy in your life


---------102:47----------
and at the same time if you can value


---------102:49----------
another human being and set aside


---------102:51----------
romantic feelings


---------102:52----------
and at the sa you know things change


---------102:54----------
over time then like so


---------102:56----------
be it


---------102:59----------
yeah because i think there are men that


---------103:00----------
are pretty good about


---------103:02----------
hiding their feelings but we're very


---------103:04----------
good at one or another


---------103:06----------
yeah i think i'm actually i'm actually


---------103:09----------
deeply in love with one of you right now


---------103:11----------
can you guess who


---------103:15----------
that was a joke maybe


---------103:21----------
i think like if you have this hope


---------103:24----------
that you might um be able to get into a


---------103:27----------
relationship with somebody


---------103:29----------
um it'll show and it will make things


---------103:32----------
uncomfortable


---------103:33----------
so it's not like you can just play the


---------103:36----------
long game and


---------103:36----------
never show it i think sooner or later


---------103:39----------
the other person is going to feel that


---------103:40----------
something's


---------103:41----------
going on or something's happening


---------103:44----------
absolutely right i think it does blend


---------103:47----------
in and you guys can tell


---------103:49----------
right that's what i'm hearing from


---------103:50----------
melissa


---------103:53----------
how do you know yeah oh it's just


---------103:56----------
i've been in situations too where it's


---------103:58----------
just like you trust them as a friend and


---------103:59----------
then


---------104:00----------
it's just like a parties when alcohol is


---------104:02----------
involved people take advantage and


---------104:04----------
that's not okay


---------104:05----------
and it's just the idea that if you're a


---------104:06----------
truly good friend if you see a drunk


---------104:08----------
friend like that or such a your first


---------104:10----------
instinct should be to just help them


---------104:11----------
not like this is the girl that i have


---------104:12----------
had a crush on i've been playing this


---------104:14----------
long con


---------104:15----------
let me think of the intuition like that


---------104:16----------
i just want to put that out there that


---------104:17----------
is just


---------104:18----------
never ever okay and so even if you do


---------104:22----------
still have a crush on someone


---------104:24----------
please just if they tell you that they


---------104:26----------
see you as a friend and


---------104:27----------
vice versa like just keep with that


---------104:29----------
mentality


---------104:30----------
and if things happen sure but yeah be a


---------104:32----------
friend first


---------104:35----------
just wanted to put that out there yeah


---------104:36----------
so i i think you guys are kind of


---------104:38----------
transitioning to something which i've


---------104:39----------
been sort of thinking a lot about which


---------104:41----------
is like


---------104:41----------
i'm almost hearing a playbook come out


---------104:44----------
of this


---------104:46----------
in terms of y'all are sharing a lot of


---------104:48----------
important stuff from your perspective


---------104:49----------
about what's acceptable behavior and


---------104:51----------
what's not acceptable behavior


---------104:53----------
and i wonder if actually you know we


---------104:55----------
were talking a little bit about


---------104:56----------
repercussions versus education


---------104:58----------
i wonder how do you guys feel about like


---------105:00----------
can we just go from start to finish


---------105:02----------
about you know how what's an appropriate


---------105:07----------
way to interact with women whether it be


---------105:09----------
on or not i mean people


---------105:11----------
um but i'm sort of thinking a little bit


---------105:13----------
about you know this group of people who


---------105:14----------
like


---------105:15----------
approaches you guys online it sounds


---------105:17----------
like it's relatively frequent


---------105:18----------
right up to like 20 of people in linda's


---------105:21----------
case


---------105:22----------
um and and to kind of think a little bit


---------105:25----------
i mean it doesn't sound


---------105:26----------
unreasonable to me it's probably true


---------105:27----------
for all of you guys but um


---------105:31----------
and for us to like think a little bit


---------105:32----------
about you know how should they speak


---------105:34----------
what should they say when should they


---------105:35----------
say it how should they respond to what


---------105:38----------
you say


---------105:39----------
um and like how can we sort of like


---------105:41----------
maybe actually concretely educate people


---------105:44----------
about like how to deal with women how to


---------105:46----------
deal with romantic feelings


---------105:48----------
how do we know when we're friends versus


---------105:51----------
flirting like


---------105:52----------
you know what happens because sometimes


---------105:54----------
people flirt with their friends


---------105:56----------
right and and so how do you navigate


---------105:59----------
that like what do you guys think are


---------106:00----------
there kind of take-home points that we


---------106:02----------
can kind of


---------106:03----------
put together from our conversation today


---------106:07----------
i think i guess go ahead oh no


---------106:12----------
i guess if i had like one point it would


---------106:15----------
be


---------106:15----------
like asking if something you did was


---------106:18----------
okay


---------106:18----------
after the fact in like as neutral a way


---------106:22----------
possible like hey


---------106:24----------
just wanted to make sure like i made


---------106:25----------
this joke just wanted to make sure you


---------106:27----------
know it was just a joke and it didn't


---------106:28----------
make you uncomfortable


---------106:29----------
like there are friends that i've had and


---------106:31----------
even like relationships that i've been


---------106:33----------
in where if someone had said like


---------106:35----------
hey i just want to double check that


---------106:36----------
you're okay with this like that would


---------106:38----------
have meant so much to me and like could


---------106:39----------
have opened


---------106:40----------
a conversation if i wasn't okay with it


---------106:42----------
versus like


---------106:43----------
oh is it worth starting a fight by


---------106:45----------
bringing this up and like putting me in


---------106:47----------
a situation where


---------106:49----------
i have to like you know like confront


---------106:52----------
them


---------106:52----------
to have that conversation and i know


---------106:55----------
that's like hard like i don't normally


---------106:57----------
do it in my relationships but i'm trying


---------106:58----------
to now and i think it'd be


---------107:00----------
like really good for most friend groups


---------107:03----------
if


---------107:04----------
that was a conversation everyone was


---------107:05----------
willing to have


---------107:08----------
so what i'm hearing from you just i want


---------107:09----------
to recap each point as we go through it


---------107:11----------
is that okay


---------107:12----------
guys okay so what i'm hearing is like


---------107:14----------
sometimes in the past


---------107:15----------
you're gonna feel like avoiding a


---------107:17----------
conversation


---------107:19----------
because of the conversation could be


---------107:21----------
difficult


---------107:22----------
or could cause waves but really when we


---------107:24----------
think about healthy relationships they


---------107:26----------
involve having difficult conversations


---------107:30----------
exactly


---------107:33----------
risa champ sure so in addition to that i


---------107:37----------
just want to say try to do it beforehand


---------107:39----------
this one's a lot harder to do


---------107:41----------
but if there are something you are


---------107:42----------
uncertain like for example if i am


---------107:44----------
someone made a lot of provocative jokes


---------107:46----------
first thing i would do before this call


---------107:47----------
is ask these ladies like hey like


---------107:49----------
i make these provocative jokes i


---------107:50----------
actually asked them about my cursing is


---------107:52----------
cursing okay


---------107:52----------
like just because i do curse on a normal


---------107:55----------
basis and just to make sure of that on


---------107:57----------
just little things that you know from


---------107:59----------
history but then my most important point


---------108:01----------
though is to observe


---------108:03----------
observing is a skill set that takes a


---------108:05----------
while to build but try to when you do


---------108:07----------
something


---------108:08----------
look at the person's reaction or if


---------108:09----------
you're sending messages even you can't


---------108:11----------
see reactions


---------108:12----------
if you send 50 messages and this person


---------108:14----------
replies with k


---------108:15----------
or like not much response chances are


---------108:17----------
you're not very close to the person


---------108:19----------
okay or you can just be like hey like


---------108:21----------
are you going through something awful if


---------108:23----------
you guys are a really close


---------108:24----------
friendship just check in gauge reactions


---------108:28----------
and then respond accordingly through


---------108:30----------
that so


---------108:32----------
let me ask actually quick follow-up so


---------108:34----------
that was really useful risa because you


---------108:35----------
said


---------108:36----------
if someone's sends 50 messages and they


---------108:38----------
respond with hey


---------108:39----------
what i'm getting the sense of is


---------108:40----------
especially a lot of people don't know


---------108:42----------
how to interpret


---------108:43----------
communications online and especially


---------108:47----------
that sometimes it sounds like you guys


---------108:48----------
are trying to be like


---------108:50----------
tactful and not mean


---------108:53----------
and that there's ambiguity like so you


---------108:55----------
guys have a choice between


---------108:57----------
on a scale of like zero or like on two


---------108:59----------
ends of the spectrum one is like being


---------109:01----------
nice and being mean


---------109:02----------
and you're trying to set a boundary and


---------109:04----------
i i thought maybe i heard alyssa say


---------109:06----------
that


---------109:07----------
what she's had to learn how to do is to


---------109:09----------
be mean


---------109:10----------
because sometimes when she i i may have


---------109:12----------
it may have been someone else but that


---------109:14----------
sometimes when you guys are trying to


---------109:15----------
like let people down gently


---------109:17----------
or like not hurt their feelings or you


---------109:20----------
know you know


---------109:20----------
not like you recognize it could be


---------109:22----------
insecure and so you try to be nice


---------109:24----------
so what are some signs that you're like


---------109:26----------
not interested in someone


---------109:28----------
in that way like what i also i guess i


---------109:32----------
want to clarify that


---------109:33----------
um i haven't been


---------109:36----------
mean in the way that like i was cussing


---------109:38----------
at somebody or saying like


---------109:40----------
things that were hurtful it's more so i


---------109:43----------
had the


---------109:43----------
mentality that maybe i might have to be


---------109:45----------
a little bit more aggressive


---------109:48----------
and um i think what i do more now is


---------109:50----------
i'll just ignore it yeah


---------109:52----------
firm i'll just ignore it or i will send


---------109:56----------
a message that's really short and um


---------109:59----------
i guess to try to let them know i'm not


---------110:01----------
interested anymore instead of


---------110:03----------
having that conversation because i don't


---------110:06----------
always feel the need to talk about


---------110:08----------
you know boundaries with a stranger or


---------110:10----------
you know to


---------110:11----------
sort of like open the floor up for that


---------110:14----------
because


---------110:15----------
at the end of the day i don't really


---------110:17----------
know you so i don't owe you any


---------110:19----------
explanation as to why i'm rejecting you


---------110:21----------
or why i'm not responding


---------110:23----------
and i think that's what's important for


---------110:25----------
me is being respected


---------110:26----------
as a person and as a woman to just be


---------110:29----------
able to say no and


---------110:30----------
have that be enough for me so


---------110:34----------
yeah so what i'm hearing alyssa says


---------110:36----------
that you should


---------110:37----------
you know just because someone says no


---------110:40----------
doesn't mean that you deserve an


---------110:42----------
explanation


---------110:43----------
even if you want one so that's kind of


---------110:45----------
an important take-home point


---------110:48----------
um math yeah i was answering


---------110:52----------
to the what are some signs a woman is


---------110:54----------
not interested


---------110:55----------
um you usually have to start


---------110:58----------
conversations or you start the action of


---------111:00----------
interaction between both of you


---------111:02----------
if in those actions she's not very


---------111:04----------
interactive as well like the


---------111:06----------
the spamming and the k and the third one


---------111:09----------
sometimes if they just say i don't want


---------111:11----------
to speak with you i think that's a


---------111:12----------
pretty


---------111:14----------
big sign and yeah is that they don't


---------111:18----------
understand that


---------111:20----------
some stuff yeah most i'm not


---------111:23----------
like sometimes most of the times they


---------111:24----------
are they kind of back away but


---------111:26----------
sometimes they don't like i had one


---------111:30----------
severe case


---------111:31----------
where this guy he spammed me on discord


---------111:34----------
and then i'm like okay easy thing to do


---------111:36----------
i'm just gonna block him on discord then


---------111:39----------
he found a way


---------111:40----------
to message me on another platform he


---------111:42----------
messaged me on facebook spammed me on


---------111:44----------
facebook blocked him on facebook i


---------111:45----------
thought i was done


---------111:47----------
then then he spammed me on steam


---------111:50----------
blocked him on steam then he messaged


---------111:53----------
like somehow he got my number


---------111:55----------
then he messaged me on whatsapp had to


---------111:57----------
block him on whatsapp


---------111:58----------
four platforms already and then


---------112:02----------
he used another person's account to


---------112:04----------
contact me and i'm like


---------112:05----------
what should i do i can't only react


---------112:08----------
you know like with the block


---------112:12----------
because i i i when he was spamming i


---------112:15----------
said stop


---------112:16----------
stop please stop and then i had to send


---------112:19----------
it to him on facebook that


---------112:21----------
and then block him then on steam please


---------112:23----------
stop this is not gonna


---------112:24----------
i'm not gonna read those messages


---------112:28----------
yeah i would say


---------112:31----------
go to the police but i've i've had


---------112:33----------
stories where the police haven't been so


---------112:35----------
nice


---------112:36----------
so i don't know


---------112:40----------
yeah i met a guy at a dog park


---------112:45----------
and um i gave him my number just because


---------112:47----------
i was being nice


---------112:49----------
and he ended up finding me on instagram


---------112:51----------
finding me on snapchat


---------112:52----------
adding me everywhere and um at first the


---------112:55----------
conversation was pretty


---------112:57----------
casual but it turned into him messaging


---------112:59----------
me every morning


---------113:01----------
every afternoon like pretty much any


---------113:03----------
time he could it seemed like


---------113:05----------
and it got to the point where i told him


---------113:07----------
like hey i'm not interested i don't want


---------113:08----------
to


---------113:09----------
talk to you anymore and um he got mad at


---------113:12----------
me


---------113:12----------
one time and kept messaging me um and


---------113:15----------
another time i had blocked him on


---------113:17----------
everything and i guess he found my


---------113:19----------
whatsapp somehow


---------113:20----------
and he started um acting like nothing


---------113:23----------
had happened basically and was like hey


---------113:25----------
how are you doing what's going on


---------113:26----------
i was like i thought i told you you know


---------113:29----------
we're not talking i'm not interested


---------113:31----------
and then he called me a bunch of really


---------113:33----------
terrible words and


---------113:35----------
um i decided to just you know leave it


---------113:38----------
there and block him i didn't even


---------113:39----------
respond to the things that he was saying


---------113:41----------
because they were so


---------113:42----------
terrible


---------113:51----------
i think one final advice that i could


---------113:53----------
give


---------113:54----------
is that do it this is something i do


---------113:56----------
it's like a final message


---------113:57----------
basically if i don't know this person


---------113:59----------
likes me or like


---------114:00----------
maybe i'm getting mixed signals and


---------114:02----------
stuff like that i will send one message


---------114:04----------
that's just like


---------114:04----------
hey like i'm sorry if i'm disturbing


---------114:07----------
because i sent like this is my third


---------114:08----------
message to them or something like that


---------114:10----------
um just when i know my doors are open if


---------114:12----------
you ever want to talk


---------114:14----------
and if i ever bought you anyways i


---------114:15----------
apologize and i just kind of leave it at


---------114:17----------
that


---------114:18----------
if at least for me when i see a message


---------114:20----------
like that if i truly


---------114:22----------
like the person and i see them as close


---------114:23----------
or a friend i will 100 reach out to


---------114:25----------
clear out that misunderstanding


---------114:27----------
but if i don't like you or then i would


---------114:30----------
just leave it ignored


---------114:31----------
and i for me at least i like the final


---------114:34----------
message policy send one last one make


---------114:36----------
your points clear


---------114:37----------
and give them an out yeah give them a


---------114:40----------
now if they want to respond they will


---------114:42----------
if not you leave it at that what does


---------114:44----------
that mean star give them an


---------114:45----------
out so like give them an opportunity


---------114:48----------
to end things there like like oh like no


---------114:51----------
worries if you're not interested but if


---------114:53----------
you are


---------114:53----------
blah blah and then if they're not


---------114:55----------
interested they can just leave it at


---------114:56----------
that without any hard feelings because


---------114:58----------
you've said no worries


---------115:00----------
okay so anything else that people want


---------115:03----------
to add in terms of


---------115:05----------
you know what yeah we'll do champ and


---------115:07----------
then linda


---------115:09----------
okay so um when you when you see


---------115:12----------
someone communicating their boundaries


---------115:15----------
please respect them


---------115:16----------
don't deflate them don't try to put them


---------115:20----------
on your standard like oh i'm actually


---------115:22----------
okay with that why is that person not


---------115:24----------
okay with doing that that is not normal


---------115:26----------
so i can like no like these are two


---------115:29----------
different boundaries like


---------115:30----------
your boundary doesn't have to be the


---------115:32----------
other person's boundary


---------115:34----------
and there's no likes over like an


---------115:36----------
universal like standard that can be


---------115:38----------
applied for anyone like


---------115:40----------
uh we are all individuals and we have


---------115:42----------
different boundaries


---------115:43----------
and we should respect them especially


---------115:46----------
like


---------115:46----------
for me like boundaries is first you


---------115:49----------
communicate


---------115:50----------
then you can respect the boundaries


---------115:53----------
right because you have like legit no


---------115:54----------
evidence what this


---------115:55----------
person is okay with because i sometimes


---------115:58----------
also had like interactions where i


---------115:59----------
crossed someone's boundaries and i was


---------116:01----------
like oh wait


---------116:02----------
like how did this happen right like i


---------116:04----------
thought this was perfectly fine


---------116:06----------
um but when this other person like


---------116:08----------
communicates their boundaries


---------116:09----------
just don't be like oh yeah like


---------116:12----------
this is you acting weird this is norm


---------116:15----------
not normal


---------116:16----------
you know don't deflate them those things


---------116:19----------
because i heard also from


---------116:21----------
um other girls that um they got like


---------116:24----------
their boundaries got


---------116:25----------
also deflated from like close friends


---------116:27----------
and families which i think


---------116:29----------
it's not great and if you want to have


---------116:31----------
like a


---------116:32----------
safe place you sh this is this should be


---------116:35----------
like a criteria where people can like


---------116:37----------
communicate their boundaries


---------116:39----------
and that you know that those people will


---------116:42----------
respect those


---------116:45----------
fantastic linda


---------116:49----------
oh um yeah i'm okay


---------116:52----------
so for me it's like when i guess the


---------116:55----------
advice


---------116:56----------
that i wish a couple of people would


---------116:58----------
like think about is that


---------117:00----------
when you feel like you're in love with


---------117:02----------
someone maybe ask yourself if you're


---------117:03----------
like in love with


---------117:04----------
the idea and not the actual girl and


---------117:07----------
like


---------117:07----------
maybe maybe think about like how your


---------117:09----------
relationship would work because like


---------117:11----------
i know for myself that i'm like a sort


---------117:14----------
of really confident person


---------117:16----------
and i know that just with the amount of


---------117:18----------
like people that don't have


---------117:21----------
that confidence there would be like a


---------117:23----------
sort of power dynamic between us if


---------117:25----------
anything great to happen


---------117:26----------
just thinking about it it would just


---------117:29----------
like wouldn't work because we're like


---------117:32----------
not compatible i guess um


---------117:35----------
so just like think about


---------117:38----------
what like this does this even make like


---------117:41----------
any sense


---------117:43----------
sure so let me let me hear yeah


---------117:46----------
go ahead i also have something to add um


---------117:49----------
nowadays people are more open to speak


---------117:52----------
about these


---------117:53----------
issues but what i feel like what happens


---------117:55----------
after is that


---------117:56----------
is that the idea of that if you if you


---------118:00----------
do this if you do the right thing


---------118:01----------
you're better than other people no it's


---------118:03----------
just a normal thing that should be


---------118:05----------
respected in


---------118:06----------
the first place you should not feel more


---------118:08----------
special because you respect women or


---------118:11----------
respect their boundaries is a thing that


---------118:12----------
should exist


---------118:13----------
already math i'm a bit confused and


---------118:16----------
and maybe you'll help me out you're


---------118:17----------
telling me that if i don't respect


---------118:20----------
your if i you're telling me that if i do


---------118:22----------
a good job of respecting your boundaries


---------118:25----------
and treat you like a human i'm not


---------118:28----------
entitled to date you no no


---------118:29----------
you're talking about nice guys right now


---------118:32----------
no what


---------118:34----------
[Music]


---------118:35----------
i'm confused but i i did everything that


---------118:37----------
you guys said why


---------118:39----------
aren't you yeah but sometimes this is


---------118:40----------
the thing like we just don't click


---------118:42----------
you're respectful thank you very much


---------118:44----------
for being respectful but sometimes this


---------118:46----------
just doesn't work out


---------118:48----------
and what i've yeah basically i thought


---------118:51----------
was dr hey i think he'd be a great


---------118:52----------
friend


---------118:54----------
but i thought that being the great


---------118:56----------
friend is the way that i become your


---------118:57----------
boyfriend that's what reese said


---------119:00----------
i'm just at the boy to the friend and


---------119:02----------
then you become the boyfriend


---------119:04----------
yeah right


---------119:08----------
so like i think i think maybe what was


---------119:10----------
missing is that like you guys didn't


---------119:11----------
understand what my gender was so i can


---------119:13----------
send you a particular picture proving it


---------119:15----------
and isn't that


---------119:16----------
isn't that what i'm supposed to do oh


---------119:18----------
thank you


---------119:20----------
yeah so so it's what i'm hearing from


---------119:22----------
math in all seriousness and you guys


---------119:24----------
have to let me know if i overstep


---------119:25----------
okay so you know all right


---------119:28----------
uh but that's funny so but i i think


---------119:32----------
what i'm really hearing is that like


---------119:33----------
you know basic respect and talking about


---------119:36----------
boundaries and treating someone like a


---------119:37----------
human being


---------119:39----------
is what is just like that's just being


---------119:42----------
human it's not


---------119:43----------
like making you boyfriend material like


---------119:45----------
sure a boyfriend should do all those


---------119:47----------
things


---------119:48----------
yes but it's not sufficient


---------119:52----------
to enter a romantic relationship and


---------119:55----------
that what we're talking about here is a


---------119:57----------
playbook of interaction


---------119:59----------
not a playbook to like get a girlfriend


---------120:02----------
exactly although i do think i do think


---------120:05----------
it is


---------120:05----------
necessary although not sufficient to to


---------120:08----------
be


---------120:08----------
boyfriend material to like treat someone


---------120:10----------
like a human it's the base


---------120:12----------
yeah it's a business okay so let me see


---------120:15----------
if i can recap


---------120:17----------
all right so the first thing is that you


---------120:19----------
know like when you interact with people


---------120:20----------
online the first thing to understand is


---------120:22----------
that you are a stranger


---------120:24----------
and they are a stranger if you talk to


---------120:27----------
someone for five minutes you guys


---------120:29----------
are not even friends y'all are strangers


---------120:32----------
also that like certain things while they


---------120:35----------
may


---------120:36----------
be on the path to boyfriend don't


---------120:39----------
necessarily


---------120:40----------
mean that they're on the path to


---------120:41----------
boyfriend like if alyssa meets you at a


---------120:43----------
dark part and gives you her number


---------120:45----------
it does not necessarily mean that she's


---------120:47----------
romantically interested in you


---------120:49----------
right that there are lots of gestures


---------120:50----------
like maybe a a good thing to do would be


---------120:53----------
to like


---------120:54----------
you know reverse the person's gender to


---------120:57----------
like


---------120:58----------
something else in your mind like if i


---------120:59----------
met a dude at a boy at a


---------121:01----------
dog park and i'm a heterosexual male and


---------121:03----------
i'm gonna assume that he's a


---------121:04----------
heterosexual male and we exchange phone


---------121:06----------
numbers


---------121:07----------
that's fine right that like just because


---------121:10----------
someone is a man or a woman doesn't


---------121:11----------
necessarily indicate romantic interest


---------121:14----------
so the first thing is that when you


---------121:15----------
interact with a woman online that


---------121:17----------
they're like


---------121:17----------
y'all are still strangers and you guys


---------121:19----------
can maybe get to know each other a


---------121:21----------
little bit


---------121:22----------
um if someone does respond to you if


---------121:25----------
you're interacting with a woman


---------121:27----------
um that you know it's fine to interact


---------121:29----------
and for you guys to connect but that


---------121:31----------
actually like unless there's something


---------121:33----------
like flirtation going on


---------121:35----------
that the presumption is that you guys


---------121:37----------
are friends


---------121:39----------
and that if you're interested in being


---------121:41----------
more than friends you should signal that


---------121:43----------
in some way and probably do that


---------121:47----------
early before you invest a lot of the


---------121:50----------
into the relationship


---------121:51----------
and that because the further i one thing


---------121:53----------
that i've noticed is that you know when


---------121:55----------
people invest a lot in the relationship


---------121:57----------
they expect a lot out of the


---------121:58----------
relationship


---------121:59----------
right i've done so many things for you


---------122:03----------
why won't you date me and that's why


---------122:04----------
they feel kind of like


---------122:06----------
let down because they've given a lot oh


---------122:08----------
yeah i like moved across the world for


---------122:10----------
you


---------122:10----------
and i'm paying your rent and like we're


---------122:12----------
great friends but like why won't you


---------122:14----------
love me


---------122:15----------
and and from y'all's perspective i would


---------122:18----------
really think it's


---------122:18----------
it's like healthy if someone does seem


---------122:20----------
to be investing a lot in


---------122:22----------
into the relationship that that you


---------122:24----------
really kind of stop and think about like


---------122:26----------
you know what is the assumption here


---------122:28----------
even though you think you guys are


---------122:29----------
friends


---------122:30----------
that that you know boundary setting


---------122:31----------
conversation or like trying to figure


---------122:33----------
out what your relationship is


---------122:35----------
actually goes two ways and i think a lot


---------122:38----------
about what star said and that sometimes


---------122:40----------
as human beings we like to avoid


---------122:42----------
difficult conversations


---------122:44----------
but that it may actually hurt more in


---------122:46----------
the long run to avoid those difficult


---------122:48----------
conversations


---------122:49----------
so probably relatively early on you


---------122:52----------
don't have to be like


---------122:54----------
you know overly expressive or


---------122:57----------
or go too far but probably men who are


---------123:00----------
interested in you and once again i'm


---------123:02----------
assuming a heteronormative standpoint


---------123:04----------
should indicate to you somewhat early on


---------123:07----------
but not too early on right like not


---------123:09----------
after five minutes of dms


---------123:11----------
but they should try to get to know you


---------123:13----------
as a person move past a stranger point


---------123:16----------
and then i think someone i forgot


---------123:17----------
exactly who said this but maybe it was


---------123:19----------
linda who was kind of saying that like


---------123:20----------
if you feel like you're in love with


---------123:22----------
someone like ask yourself what are you


---------123:24----------
in love with


---------123:25----------
because what do you actually know about


---------123:27----------
this person


---------123:29----------
and so far all you know is that they


---------123:32----------
warded well when you were playing league


---------123:33----------
of legends and like wow


---------123:35----------
that's amazing right


---------123:38----------
ending all of my standards yeah and and


---------123:41----------
so


---------123:42----------
so to really think about okay what do


---------123:44----------
you know about this person as you guys


---------123:45----------
start to interact a couple of warning


---------123:47----------
signs one is like an


---------123:48----------
uneven communication and oddly enough i


---------123:51----------
know this is going to be kind of a weird


---------123:52----------
analogy i don't know if any of y'all


---------123:53----------
play tennis


---------123:55----------
but you know with with tennis i


---------123:56----------
sometimes think about there's a ball and


---------123:58----------
then you hit the ball from one side to


---------123:59----------
the other side


---------124:00----------
and then the ball has to get hit back


---------124:02----------
before you hit it again


---------124:04----------
so it goes back and forth and sometimes


---------124:06----------
what i'm getting the sense of is people


---------124:07----------
that you interact with on


---------124:09----------
on discord or through dms or like those


---------124:11----------
tennis ball machines you guys know those


---------124:13----------
machines


---------124:14----------
where it's just like they're just


---------124:15----------
shooting bubble after ball after ball


---------124:17----------
so ask yourself am i playing a game of


---------124:19----------
tennis with this person


---------124:21----------
or am i a tennis ball machine blocked me


---------124:23----------
on instagram


---------124:24----------
challenge accepted i'm gonna find your


---------124:26----------
your phone number block me on whatsapp


---------124:28----------
challenge accepted i'm gonna find out


---------124:31----------
where you live


---------124:32----------
so don't be a tennis ball machine


---------124:35----------
right and and so to try to reciprocate


---------124:38----------
the level of interaction and this is


---------124:40----------
where what risa says i think is really


---------124:42----------
important


---------124:43----------
observe which i really just am shocked


---------124:45----------
by


---------124:46----------
the lack of observation i don't know how


---------124:48----------
you can expect people to observe if


---------124:50----------
they're like you're blocking them on


---------124:51----------
multiple platforms


---------124:52----------
and they're hunting you down on others


---------124:53----------
like you know observation


---------124:56----------
that just sounds so on a different level


---------124:58----------
i don't even know


---------124:59----------
where to start there um and i think part


---------125:02----------
of


---------125:02----------
you know i think i feel like ultimately


---------125:03----------
what we're having is half of the


---------125:05----------
conversation and what we need to do is


---------125:07----------
talk to the tennis ball machines talk to


---------125:09----------
the people who have been friend zoned


---------125:11----------
and get their perspective


---------125:12----------
because i i do sort of think like i can


---------125:14----------
sort of understand that if i


---------125:16----------
you know meet a cute girl at the dog


---------125:17----------
park and she gives me her number


---------125:20----------
like hey can i call you sometime um and


---------125:23----------
i can understand how there's ambiguity


---------125:25----------
there so there's also like that's why


---------125:26----------
and it's not that you guys should and we


---------125:28----------
sort of acknowledge this at the


---------125:29----------
beginning right it's not like you can


---------125:31----------
say


---------125:31----------
i'm giving you my number but i'm not


---------125:33----------
interested in you romantically but i'd


---------125:34----------
love to hang out as friends like that


---------125:35----------
seems like a bit much


---------125:37----------
right so there's ambiguity at the


---------125:39----------
beginning and that's actually kind of


---------125:40----------
comforting but then as as someone


---------125:42----------
graduates past stranger if you find


---------125:45----------
yourself feeling in love with them


---------125:47----------
ask yourself why and recognize that


---------125:49----------
that's probably not


---------125:50----------
um appropriate full disclosure though i


---------125:54----------
fell in love with my wife the first time


---------125:56----------
i saw her


---------125:56----------
and you know i just don't


---------126:00----------
so i struggle sometimes with that and


---------126:02----------
then everyone doesn't say like


---------126:03----------
reese is like oh no one says [ __ ]


---------126:05----------
creep right


---------126:06----------
but that's like that's how we treat the


---------126:08----------
people who fall in love with us


---------126:09----------
it could have been right so that's like


---------126:11----------
there's something more here


---------126:13----------
like i absolutely just you know i saw


---------126:15----------
her like i remember i like


---------126:16----------
literally remember the first time i saw


---------126:18----------
her and it like it like it was like i


---------126:20----------
got


---------126:21----------
hit in the chest with something and then


---------126:23----------
for years i didn't even understand what


---------126:25----------
that what the [ __ ] that was


---------126:27----------
um but so i was playing long game too uh


---------126:30----------
i would love a room half and half by the


---------126:32----------
way where like guys can talk about like


---------126:34----------
things that we might be doing that are


---------126:35----------
misleading them and yeah because


---------126:36----------
my point of view and they can explain


---------126:38----------
their side as well so i would love that


---------126:40----------
interaction


---------126:41----------
cool yeah i think that's a great idea


---------126:43----------
recently um


---------126:44----------
so then to think a little bit about you


---------126:46----------
know reciprocating in terms of


---------126:48----------
conversations and a couple of


---------126:50----------
you know things to watch out for because


---------126:52----------
rece i don't think observe is enough i


---------126:54----------
think people need more direction than


---------126:55----------
that


---------126:56----------
um so you know first of all obviously if


---------126:58----------
someone is well


---------126:59----------
i guess not obviously if someone is


---------127:02----------
blocking you on a platform


---------127:03----------
don't assume it's a mistake within this


---------127:07----------
clip


---------127:08----------
right so so if someone is trying to set


---------127:10----------
a boundary respect that boundary


---------127:12----------
and then also recognize that if someone


---------127:14----------
sets a boundary with you and you


---------127:16----------
feel hurt you feeling hurt does not


---------127:20----------
entitle you to anything from the other


---------127:22----------
person


---------127:24----------
so that seems to be a big one that we


---------127:26----------
haven't really said explicitly


---------127:28----------
and then also i would encourage people


---------127:30----------
if you're expecting a lot out of the


---------127:31----------
relationship


---------127:32----------
figure out why you're expecting a lot


---------127:34----------
out of that relationship


---------127:36----------
and then ultimately have conversations


---------127:38----------
with people


---------127:39----------
so the first conversation is like hey


---------127:41----------
like let's hang out and then if you have


---------127:42----------
feelings maybe have a conversation about


---------127:44----------
that


---------127:46----------
and then you know down the road even if


---------127:48----------
you guys do end up as friends


---------127:50----------
that it's okay i think to have


---------127:52----------
conversations


---------127:53----------
about developing feelings or if you guys


---------127:56----------
are in a relationship it's okay to have


---------127:58----------
conversations


---------127:59----------
about hey i actually don't feel this way


---------128:01----------
about you anymore


---------128:04----------
um even if it sucks even if it sucks


---------128:07----------
right so to have a lot of hard


---------128:09----------
conversations


---------128:11----------
um but not too early because they don't


---------128:13----------
owe you that after five minutes of dms


---------128:16----------
okay and and the last thing is like it's


---------128:20----------
not


---------128:21----------
your job to get on their page and it's


---------128:23----------
also not


---------128:24----------
their job to get on your page which also


---------128:28----------
means that if they girlfriend zoned


---------128:30----------
you and you say i'm not interested in


---------128:33----------
that


---------128:34----------
they're allowed to walk away even if it


---------128:36----------
hurts your feelings


---------128:38----------
and also if you friend-zoned them


---------128:41----------
you're allowed to walk away even if it


---------128:43----------
hurts their feelings


---------128:45----------
right until while there's ambiguity


---------128:47----------
there's going to be mixed expectations


---------128:49----------
and like that's just why we have


---------128:51----------
conversations


---------128:53----------
um yeah


---------128:56----------
and then i guess kind of the last point


---------128:58----------
that i just want to acknowledge is that


---------129:00----------
i think that a lot of the people that


---------129:01----------
maybe y'all are interacting with


---------129:03----------
are hungry and even starved for some


---------129:06----------
amount of basic humanity


---------129:08----------
which math was talking about about


---------129:11----------
listening to someone when they've had a


---------129:12----------
bad day about supporting them


---------129:14----------
emotionally and that that doesn't mean


---------129:17----------
just because a woman


---------129:18----------
or a man is supporting you emotionally


---------129:20----------
doesn't mean that they're romantically


---------129:21----------
interested in you


---------129:25----------
did i miss anything


---------129:28----------
you think so no that was well summarized


---------129:31----------
actually i left one or two out


---------129:33----------
if you are someone's professor don't


---------129:35----------
touch them


---------129:39----------
if you're a policeman please do not take


---------129:42----------
advantage of already


---------129:44----------
disturbed victims thank you


---------129:49----------
yeah true okay


---------129:53----------
any last thoughts or questions


---------129:57----------
thank you for having us yeah very much


---------130:00----------
sure


---------130:00----------
we're a little bit over time are you


---------130:02----------
guys okay with not meditating today or


---------130:04----------
is that something that you guys really


---------130:06----------
were looking forward to


---------130:08----------
i was actually looking forward to it


---------130:11----------
yeah i was like


---------130:12----------
okay let's do it


---------130:19----------
can i can i confess something to y'all


---------130:21----------
by the way


---------130:22----------
the word confess was used a lot you guys


---------130:25----------
noticed that it's like


---------130:26----------
what's that i'm curious about that


---------130:30----------
but so so part of it is that i feel like


---------130:33----------
i owe you guys a better meditation


---------130:35----------
than what i can give you today so that


---------130:37----------
was actually part of my hesitation


---------130:40----------
so i i do some meditations that are


---------130:42----------
shakti oriented meditations


---------130:44----------
shakthi is the sanskrit word for energy


---------130:49----------
um and it's also like by definition


---------130:52----------
principle i mean feminine so like


---------130:55----------
shakthi


---------130:56----------
also it me is literally the translated


---------130:58----------
as energy so like


---------130:59----------
you know any kind of energy and it also


---------131:01----------
is translated as goddess


---------131:04----------
so it's kind of weird s-h-a-k-t-i


---------131:11----------
um and and the challenge is that like


---------131:13----------
just after even after like five or ten


---------131:15----------
minutes


---------131:15----------
of talking to you guys i was like you


---------131:16----------
guys should really learn to shakthi


---------131:18----------
meditation


---------131:19----------
because i think there's just something


---------131:20----------
about that that's resonating with me the


---------131:22----------
problem is first of all i don't know


---------131:23----------
those meditations very well because


---------131:25----------
they're


---------131:26----------
uh traditionally they're


---------131:29----------
they actually are taught by female


---------131:30----------
teachers and so


---------131:32----------
part of my hesitation to teach you guys


---------131:34----------
that i think you guys deserve something


---------131:35----------
that i don't know that i'm the best to


---------131:37----------
teach


---------131:38----------
so i'm going to teach you guys something


---------131:39----------
and if you all are okay i'm going to


---------131:40----------
think for 60 seconds about how i can


---------131:42----------
access


---------131:43----------
any kind of shakti


---------131:46----------
but the other thing that i ask you all


---------131:48----------
for is a rain check


---------131:50----------
that one day i'm gonna learn how to do


---------131:52----------
these properly and teach them over the


---------131:54----------
internet


---------131:55----------
and i just don't know when that's gonna


---------131:57----------
be but i hope that you guys check that


---------131:59----------
out when it happens um


---------132:06----------
so can i think for a second of course


---------132:08----------
for sure thank you very much


---------132:33----------
okay is everything okay yeah


---------132:37----------
yeah okay okay so i'll try something


---------132:42----------
i don't know if it's gonna work but


---------132:43----------
we'll try something okay


---------132:45----------
so i want you all to sit up straight


---------132:49----------
all our gamer posture


---------132:52----------
oh my god you're a gamer check all my


---------132:55----------
boxes


---------132:59----------
she said gamer posture i'm in love


---------133:03----------
we have the same posture man i met this


---------133:05----------
girl you'll never do that


---------133:08----------
okay you're joking but yeah


---------133:16----------
okay so let's sit up straight so close


---------133:18----------
your eyes and what i want you guys to do


---------133:22----------
actually open your eyes sorry put your


---------133:25----------
right hand


---------133:25----------
in your left like this right and then


---------133:29----------
put your thumbs together


---------133:33----------
okay okay and then


---------133:37----------
put this in your lap


---------133:41----------
okay and i want you guys to sit up


---------133:43----------
straight and i want you to close your


---------133:45----------
eyes


---------133:47----------
and the first thing that i want you to


---------133:48----------
do is feel your spine


---------133:53----------
and as you feel your spine


---------133:57----------
notice that it's straight keep your neck


---------134:00----------
erect


---------134:02----------
you know make sure your neck is straight


---------134:05----------
that you're not leaning forward


---------134:07----------
keep your chin sort of level to the


---------134:10----------
ground


---------134:11----------
like parallel to the ground


---------134:15----------
and what i want you to do is imagine


---------134:17----------
that the rest of your body


---------134:20----------
are like clothes on the hanger


---------134:23----------
of your spine so relax your shoulders


---------134:28----------
let your arms relax let your legs relax


---------134:31----------
that you have a pillar a core of


---------134:34----------
yourself


---------134:35----------
that is your spine and let everything


---------134:38----------
else


---------134:39----------
drape across it


---------134:49----------
and now what i want you to do is feel


---------134:51----------
the weight of your body


---------134:56----------
feel it resting on your spine and almost


---------134:59----------
as if


---------135:00----------
it's traveling through your spine into


---------135:02----------
the ground


---------135:05----------
that your spine supports who you are as


---------135:08----------
a person


---------135:25----------
and now what i want you guys to do is


---------135:28----------
feel


---------135:28----------
the circuit of your arms


---------135:32----------
so i want you to imagine for a moment


---------135:34----------
that there's


---------135:35----------
almost light or energy


---------135:40----------
that is coming in from the top of your


---------135:41----------
head


---------135:45----------
and that it's kind of passing through


---------135:47----------
your arms and down to your palms


---------135:54----------
and now for a moment i want you to pull


---------135:57----------
your thumbs apart


---------135:59----------
and feel how unnatural that is


---------136:05----------
and let them come back together and it's


---------136:08----------
almost as if there's like


---------136:10----------
a circuit that you're closing


---------136:15----------
and with your eyes closed i want you to


---------136:16----------
either nod or shake your head if that


---------136:18----------
makes any sense or not


---------136:21----------
okay okay i see mostly nods but some


---------136:25----------
shakes at the head which is okay


---------136:28----------
so now what i want you to do is feel the


---------136:30----------
warmth


---------136:31----------
so if you feel the closed circuit kind


---------136:33----------
of focus on your fingertips


---------136:35----------
or what you can do is focus on the


---------136:38----------
sensation of your palms


---------136:42----------
and feel the heat of your left palm


---------136:47----------
on the back of your right hand


---------136:55----------
now what i want you to do is focus


---------136:59----------
on your right palm and how there seems


---------137:02----------
to be


---------137:02----------
heat almost emanating from it or above


---------137:05----------
it


---------137:08----------
not if that makes sense or shake your


---------137:10----------
head if you don't feel okay


---------137:12----------
now for a moment i'm just going to


---------137:14----------
invite you to look at something a little


---------137:15----------
bit strange which is that


---------137:17----------
it almost feels like you can feel the


---------137:18----------
heat coming off of your hand


---------137:23----------
which is weird because you can't feel


---------137:24----------
anything off of your hand


---------137:27----------
but just notice that sensation and focus


---------137:30----------
on the area above the palm where you


---------137:33----------
feel the heat


---------137:46----------
and now kind of notice that you have


---------137:48----------
this circuit this warmth


---------137:50----------
this energy and feel the person that you


---------137:54----------
are there's something just


---------137:57----------
warm and pure untainted


---------138:01----------
we've been talking a lot about


---------138:02----------
expectations and feelings and


---------138:05----------
fear powerlessness


---------138:09----------
but in this moment none of that is you


---------138:16----------
those things may apply to alissa


---------138:19----------
or linda or star or resa


---------138:23----------
or champ or math but in this moment


---------138:29----------
there's the pillar of your spine


---------138:32----------
there's the weight of all of your being


---------138:35----------
hanging on it


---------138:36----------
and the spine can easily handle that way


---------138:40----------
and there is warmth and energy


---------138:45----------
and now what i want you all to notice is


---------138:48----------
that there's something like


---------138:49----------
perfect and even divine


---------138:52----------
about the person that you are right now


---------138:57----------
and is it is it any surprise that people


---------139:00----------
are drawn to you


---------139:06----------
and that you are able to give them


---------139:07----------
something wonderful


---------139:10----------
even though it causes you problems


---------139:18----------
and that that's okay


---------139:23----------
that sure we're going to do all the


---------139:24----------
things about setting boundaries and


---------139:26----------
limits and things like that


---------139:29----------
but at the end of the day no matter how


---------139:30----------
they make you feel


---------139:32----------
or who they are you can always come back


---------139:35----------
to this place


---------139:38----------
that no one can ever take this away from


---------139:46----------
you


---------139:48----------
and that this thing that you can feel


---------139:52----------
will support you throughout your entire


---------139:54----------
life


---------139:56----------
throughout any challenges


---------140:00----------
through any trials and in your


---------140:03----------
relationships


---------140:14----------
now sit with that feeling


---------140:18----------
for the next 60 seconds or so


---------140:22----------
pick your choice of sensation


---------140:25----------
whether it be the weight of your spine


---------140:29----------
the tips of your fingers the warmth


---------140:32----------
above your palm


---------140:35----------
or light coming in through the top of


---------140:36----------
your head


---------140:38----------
and focus on that


---------141:46----------
now we're going to take a deep breath


---------141:49----------
in for three seconds and out for three


---------141:53----------
through your nose


---------142:01----------
and now in for three and out for five


---------142:14----------
and then in for three and out for seven


---------142:26----------
and when you're ready


---------142:29----------
come back


---------142:52----------
i'm so glad that i asked for that


---------142:54----------
meditation


---------142:58----------
it's like more emotional than i was


---------142:59----------
expecting


---------143:01----------
i almost cried at some point


---------143:04----------
honestly


---------143:08----------
what were y'all feeling


---------143:11----------
nice to me it was not like strong


---------143:15----------
oh yeah like i was like oh i have a


---------143:18----------
strong spine


---------143:21----------
i felt very light


---------143:24----------
me too and um i could feel the warmth it


---------143:28----------
was so intense


---------143:30----------
um and also um when you said that we


---------143:33----------
should like


---------143:33----------
focus on like a light in your our head


---------143:36----------
i could see like the color yellow and i


---------143:39----------
could see blue


---------143:42----------
yeah so i'm


---------143:46----------
happy that some of y'all had some really


---------143:47----------
positive experiences


---------143:50----------
um i'm relieved


---------143:54----------
so this kind of meditation is actually


---------143:56----------
not my forte


---------143:58----------
so i've learned some of these techniques


---------144:00----------
before and i try to do my best but


---------144:02----------
i'm i'm really glad and this is kind of


---------144:04----------
a lesson to me too


---------144:06----------
it was really good i'm glad um


---------144:09----------
so a couple of things just to think


---------144:11----------
about so first of all you guys can do


---------144:12----------
this technique


---------144:15----------
uh you know and you can pick on whatever


---------144:18----------
sensation


---------144:19----------
you kind of feel but your shakti


---------144:22----------
rests in your spine there are also a


---------144:26----------
couple of other


---------144:26----------
advanced techniques which i can teach


---------144:28----------
you down the road but


---------144:30----------
um you know to elevate and generate that


---------144:33----------
energy


---------144:34----------
the last thing that i kind of want to


---------144:35----------
say and i sort of hinted at this but i


---------144:37----------
want you guys to really understand this


---------144:39----------
i do genuinely believe that you guys


---------144:42----------
each have a spark of divinity within you


---------144:44----------
and i know this is not egalitarian or


---------144:46----------
equality or anything like that


---------144:48----------
but i tend to find that women are


---------144:50----------
actually closer to that spark than men


---------144:52----------
are


---------144:54----------
and and i'm not trying to make it's just


---------144:56----------
my observation


---------144:57----------
and i i'm not kidding when i when i say


---------145:00----------
that


---------145:01----------
i think that you guys are able to give


---------145:04----------
people on the internet like something


---------145:05----------
that they really don't have in their


---------145:07----------
life


---------145:09----------
and as best as you can and as


---------145:10----------
frustrating or unfair as it is to you


---------145:13----------
i'd encourage you to like try to have


---------145:16----------
some compassion towards them i'm not


---------145:17----------
saying that you guys don't


---------145:20----------
but really that these people are


---------145:21----------
approaching you from like a place of


---------145:23----------
hurt and loneliness


---------145:24----------
and then you do the wonderful gift of


---------145:26----------
like giving them


---------145:28----------
support and you listen to them and you


---------145:30----------
try to be their friend


---------145:32----------
and sure they respond to you with


---------145:33----------
toxicity which really isn't fair to you


---------145:35----------
i'm not


---------145:36----------
trying to excuse all of that but i think


---------145:37----------
that like it's kind of sad that you guys


---------145:39----------
are in the situation and they're in this


---------145:41----------
situation


---------145:43----------
and as best as you can try to forgive


---------145:45----------
them


---------145:46----------
because there is something really


---------145:48----------
amazing and divine within


---------145:50----------
each and every one of you and and it


---------145:52----------
really is kind of like


---------145:55----------
you know you're like you're giving


---------145:57----------
emotional support to like a human whose


---------145:59----------
life is a desert


---------146:01----------
and it's like water and they're drinking


---------146:03----------
it up and they just don't know


---------146:05----------
how to not ask for more and they get


---------146:07----------
confused


---------146:08----------
because everything we've taught them is


---------146:10----------
like you know it's love


---------146:13----------
that's when everything is gonna be okay


---------146:15----------
and you guys know that right like you


---------146:16----------
know that they look at you and they're


---------146:17----------
like


---------146:18----------
there's some fantasy in their mind but


---------146:19----------
it's because there's something real that


---------146:21----------
you are giving them


---------146:23----------
and it's something as simple as


---------146:25----------
compassion not saying it excuses it


---------146:28----------
i'm not saying you can't tell them to go


---------146:29----------
[ __ ] themselves


---------146:32----------
but as best as you can don't become


---------146:35----------
bitter


---------146:37----------
and and as best as you can forgive and


---------146:40----------
if you can't


---------146:41----------
that's okay too and it's an


---------146:44----------
unfair burden that i'm placing upon you


---------146:47----------
by asking you to do this


---------146:48----------
it's more than you or it's more than you


---------146:51----------
should do


---------146:52----------
and yet i see something like absolutely


---------146:56----------
amazing and divine within each and every


---------146:58----------
one of you


---------146:58----------
and i think that that's like what we've


---------146:59----------
got to


---------147:01----------
even if it's unfair


---------147:04----------
risa you wanted to say something i feel


---------147:07----------
a little bad since like


---------147:08----------
has all hearts and everything right now


---------147:10----------
that's the only part of meditation that


---------147:11----------
i couldn't


---------147:12----------
continue afterwards is when you mention


---------147:14----------
the divine and pure


---------147:15----------
and untamed part i i don't think what we


---------147:19----------
do


---------147:19----------
is or at least what i do is that great


---------147:22----------
of a gift to people i do agree with


---------147:25----------
everything you said to not find bitter


---------147:27----------
when to be on the receiving side of


---------147:28----------
things like this but


---------147:30----------
i don't think what we're doing are godly


---------147:32----------
i think is simply being supportive of


---------147:34----------
another person


---------147:35----------
and if someone retaliates or responds


---------147:38----------
negatively yeah don't feel better but


---------147:39----------
that was the one part of the meditation


---------147:41----------
that sure


---------147:42----------
i couldn't yeah that that's that's


---------147:44----------
totally fine so like let me just explain


---------147:46----------
just one quick thing so there are three


---------147:51----------
steps to meditation or understanding


---------147:53----------
meditation


---------147:54----------
the firs and we're going to talk about


---------147:56----------
two today so the first is to listen


---------147:59----------
and the second is actually to doubt in


---------148:02----------
the hindu tradition


---------148:04----------
there are actually texts designed


---------148:07----------
to train an aspirant to doubt


---------148:12----------
and so i want you all to understand this


---------148:14----------
very clearly


---------148:16----------
i don't know the answers what i'm giving


---------148:19----------
you guys is hopefully a tool for you to


---------148:22----------
figure out what's right for you


---------148:24----------
it may be this technique it may not be


---------148:27----------
divinity that you feel risa which is


---------148:29----------
completely fine


---------148:31----------
so use whatever parts of this kind of


---------148:33----------
resonate with you and if you disagree


---------148:34----------
with the rest so be it


---------148:37----------
you know it ultimately the truth is not


---------148:39----------
going to be determined by


---------148:40----------
what i tell you it's going to be


---------148:42----------
determined by your own experience


---------148:49----------
cool yeah thank you last questions or


---------148:52----------
thoughts


---------148:55----------
just thank you honestly like i've been


---------148:58----------
watching this dream


---------148:59----------
since before my breakup and i don't know


---------149:01----------
if i would have broken up with my


---------149:02----------
boyfriend if i hadn't been


---------149:04----------
and i'm just like in a period of growth


---------149:06----------
that i think your channel started


---------149:08----------
honestly ruining relationships


---------149:12----------
yes no seriously the bad ones


---------149:16----------
yeah i mean i think it's hard right i


---------149:18----------
think one of the worst things that we


---------149:20----------
can do


---------149:20----------
is live life on autopilot


---------149:23----------
and sometimes not living on autopilot


---------149:26----------
looks rocky when you first start to do


---------149:27----------
it


---------149:29----------
but all the more power to you because


---------149:31----------
that's how you actually take control of


---------149:33----------
your life


---------149:35----------
is by doing the hard things so props to


---------149:37----------
you


---------149:38----------
my condolences to your boyfriend


---------149:41----------
or ex-boyfriend's heart


---------149:45----------
