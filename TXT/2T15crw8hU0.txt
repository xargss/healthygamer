---------00:00----------
i want to talk to y'all today a little


---------00:01----------
bit about something that i call


---------00:02----------
reintegration anxiety which is kind of


---------00:04----------
weird okay


---------00:05----------
so this is what i noticed something


---------00:07----------
weird happened chat


---------00:10----------
so back at the start of the the pandemic


---------00:13----------
there were you know everyone was like oh


---------00:15----------
i'm stuck at home


---------00:16----------
like the journal of the american medical


---------00:18----------
association did a study that showed that


---------00:21----------
depressive symptoms are 300 percent


---------00:23----------
worse than they used to be


---------00:24----------
anxiety was getting worse people didn't


---------00:26----------
know if they were going to be able to


---------00:27----------
pay their bills they didn't know what


---------00:28----------
was going to happen to the economy


---------00:30----------
they didn't know if they were going to


---------00:31----------
be able to pay their rent and so


---------00:32----------
everyone was like oh my god the mental


---------00:34----------
impacts of kovitt are so bad man they


---------00:37----------
suck so hard


---------00:39----------
and now that things are starting to open


---------00:41----------
up it's kind of like


---------00:42----------
weird because everyone was like i can't


---------00:45----------
wait for covey to end i can't wait for


---------00:46----------
kovid to end but now that covet is maybe


---------00:49----------
starting to end i know that delta


---------00:51----------
variant is bad but people are getting


---------00:52----------
vaccinated people are starting to open


---------00:54----------
and


---------00:54----------
open things up people are sort of like


---------00:57----------
okay so are you thrilled that you're


---------00:58----------
gonna be back in school and like hanging


---------01:00----------
out with people socially


---------01:02----------
something weird has happened especially


---------01:03----------
with a lot of the students that i work


---------01:05----------
with


---------01:05----------
where they're kind of like actually i


---------01:08----------
feel really anxious about reintegrating


---------01:10----------
into society


---------01:11----------
like what i hear from students that i


---------01:13----------
work with is i'm not sure i'm gonna be


---------01:15----------
able to like


---------01:16----------
do school anymore like i don't know if i


---------01:18----------
can do school


---------01:19----------
and now that i can socialize with people


---------01:21----------
it's like oh my god i can't wait to


---------01:22----------
socialize with people and it's like now


---------01:24----------
when you think about socializing with


---------01:25----------
people


---------01:26----------
you want to do it but you feel like


---------01:28----------
really really anxious about it


---------01:30----------
and it's really weird but the best term


---------01:32----------
that i can kind of come up with


---------01:34----------
is something that i'd call reintegration


---------01:35----------
anxiety and so it's it's kind of weird


---------01:38----------
but there seems to be a new kind of


---------01:40----------
anxiety where everyone's been waiting to


---------01:42----------
get back into society


---------01:43----------
but at the same time like now that we're


---------01:46----------
able to do it it seems actually really


---------01:48----------
hard to reintegrate into society


---------01:50----------
so i'd like to do today is talk to you


---------01:52----------
guys a little bit about this


---------01:53----------
and sort of try to explain a little bit


---------01:56----------
about how i understand it


---------01:57----------
okay so to begin with you know when


---------02:00----------
covet hit everyone was sort of like


---------02:03----------
kind of positive about it like people


---------02:05----------
felt isolated people


---------02:06----------
felt depressed people felt anxious about


---------02:09----------
the future


---------02:10----------
um they had difficulty maintaining


---------02:12----------
social connections and they actually


---------02:13----------
turned to online communities to start to


---------02:15----------
socialize with people


---------02:17----------
and the cool thing is that if you if you


---------02:19----------
kind of look at you know data or not not


---------02:21----------
data because there aren't really a whole


---------02:22----------
lot of studies about this but if you


---------02:23----------
look at people from our community what


---------02:25----------
we found is that


---------02:26----------
people who have robust online


---------02:29----------
connections


---------02:30----------
were actually a little bit resilient to


---------02:33----------
the negative


---------02:33----------
impacts of covet and what we did as a


---------02:36----------
society is we turn to like more online


---------02:38----------
interactions


---------02:39----------
and that's sort of a double-edged sword


---------02:41----------
because research does show that spending


---------02:43----------
a lot of time on social media


---------02:45----------
um actually is has negative impacts on


---------02:47----------
your mental health


---------02:48----------
and at the same time we were kind of


---------02:50----------
stuck because we couldn't spend time


---------02:52----------
with people


---------02:53----------
in the real world so like it was nice to


---------02:55----------
have like discord and twitch and things


---------02:57----------
like that


---------02:59----------
gaming and so it's sort of like a little


---------03:00----------
bit of a double-edged sword where like


---------03:02----------
gamers were somewhat resilient but we're


---------03:04----------
engaging in more social anxiety i mean


---------03:06----------
social media so sometimes that can make


---------03:08----------
mental health stuff worse


---------03:09----------
so it's kind of a wash the interesting


---------03:12----------
thing is that


---------03:13----------
if you talk to people who engage a lot


---------03:15----------
in in


---------03:16----------
online communities and like engage with


---------03:19----------
people social uh


---------03:20----------
socially online as opposed to the real


---------03:23----------
world what you find is when when they go


---------03:25----------
back


---------03:25----------
out into the real world you can form a


---------03:27----------
real connection online but when you go


---------03:28----------
back out into the real world


---------03:30----------
it seems to be hard for people and so


---------03:33----------
what i found is that especially now like


---------03:34----------
working with a lot of students that


---------03:36----------
you know they've been hanging out on


---------03:38----------
discord for the last year they've been


---------03:40----------
doing


---------03:40----------
online school and like zoom classes and


---------03:43----------
all this kind of stuff


---------03:44----------
and they've like hated it in some ways


---------03:46----------
but at the same time


---------03:47----------
it's been sort of like comforting in


---------03:49----------
some ways


---------03:50----------
oh no so when kobit started everyone was


---------03:53----------
like


---------03:54----------
there was there were huge impacts to our


---------03:56----------
negative health people felt isolated


---------03:58----------
they felt depressed they felt anxious


---------04:00----------
you know um


---------04:02----------
studies showed that like depression and


---------04:04----------
anxiety was like three times worse


---------04:07----------
than prior to covid the isolation was


---------04:09----------
really really messing with people


---------04:11----------
the gaming community was somewhat


---------04:13----------
resilient to these effects especially at


---------04:15----------
the beginning because we already had


---------04:16----------
good online support systems


---------04:18----------
and the rest of the world shockingly


---------04:20----------
switched over to like this online world


---------04:22----------
where


---------04:23----------
this is how we socialize it was zoom


---------04:25----------
birthday parties


---------04:26----------
and and you know like hanging out with


---------04:29----------
people


---------04:30----------
over like discord and whatsapp and and


---------04:33----------
stuff like that


---------04:34----------
and so this was okay for a while right


---------04:36----------
so people like


---------04:37----------
especially in the gaming community we


---------04:39----------
did okay for a while but then as the


---------04:41----------
pandemic wore on people were like i


---------04:43----------
can't wait to get back in school i can't


---------04:45----------
wait to like see my friends again


---------04:46----------
this sucks i'm trapped in my house and


---------04:49----------
so then something weird happened like


---------04:50----------
now that things are opening up and we're


---------04:52----------
like hey you can go socialize again and


---------04:54----------
like you're gonna be back in school like


---------04:55----------
the people that i work with are like


---------04:57----------
wait a minute i actually feel really


---------05:00----------
really uncomfortable with that stuff


---------05:02----------
and now they would they come to my


---------05:04----------
office and they say things like


---------05:06----------
you know i'm not sure i can actually do


---------05:08----------
school anymore


---------05:09----------
i'm not sure like like i got invited to


---------05:11----------
a party but like i don't know if i


---------05:13----------
even want to go and people are really


---------05:16----------
confused by this because


---------05:17----------
they're like you know at the beginning


---------05:18----------
of the pandemic it's like okay we're


---------05:20----------
gonna be trapped for a couple weeks like


---------05:21----------
i'ma learn how to break


---------05:22----------
bake bread i'm gonna learn how a new


---------05:24----------
language i'm gonna like learn all this


---------05:26----------
stuff i'm gonna take this as an


---------05:27----------
opportunity


---------05:29----------
and then the isolation sets in the


---------05:30----------
depression sets in i'ma work on a


---------05:32----------
project


---------05:33----------
and now that the world is opening up


---------05:35----------
again everyone's like oh god thank god


---------05:37----------
like that oh i can start doing things


---------05:39----------
again and now when you try to do things


---------05:41----------
like


---------05:41----------
it seems actually really really hard to


---------05:43----------
go out and like get back into school and


---------05:45----------
i have students that come to me and are


---------05:47----------
saying i'm not sure i can do school


---------05:49----------
anymore like i hate


---------05:50----------
zoom school but i don't know if i can


---------05:51----------
actually cut it in real school


---------05:53----------
i people are like i'm so isolated i'm so


---------05:55----------
lonely i'm so depressed do you want to


---------05:56----------
go to this party no i feel super anxious


---------05:58----------
going to the party


---------05:59----------
so what's going on here why is this


---------06:02----------
happening


---------06:02----------
and what can we do about it so this is


---------06:04----------
something that for lack of a better term


---------06:06----------
i call


---------06:07----------
reintegration anxiety which is sort of


---------06:09----------
like this


---------06:10----------
tendency to not be able to like go back


---------06:13----------
into the world


---------06:14----------
and what i actually have found is that i


---------06:16----------
think that it correlates with some


---------06:18----------
interesting principles of neuroscience


---------06:20----------
why is there a


---------06:21----------
there's a blanket in my door


---------06:25----------
okay so going back to where things are


---------06:28----------
so here's how


---------06:28----------
here's my understanding of like how


---------06:31----------
reintegration anxiety works okay so when


---------06:34----------
we start socializing with people online


---------06:37----------
what tends to happen is that our brain


---------06:39----------
has certain like social


---------06:41----------
circuits which sometimes don't get used


---------06:45----------
and so


---------06:45----------
start to rust a little bit so if we


---------06:47----------
think about how our brain works what we


---------06:49----------
discover


---------06:50----------
is that you know if you don't use a part


---------06:53----------
of your brain it kind of like starts to


---------06:55----------
rust so if i speak two languages and


---------06:56----------
then i don't speak one of those


---------06:58----------
languages for a few years


---------07:00----------
what happens is that part of my brain is


---------07:02----------
sort of like oh we don't need this


---------07:03----------
anymore so let's get rid of it


---------07:05----------
and what i found in people who interact


---------07:07----------
a lot online


---------07:09----------
is that there are so there are social


---------07:11----------
circuits that start to go like


---------07:13----------
dormant or rust so there are parts of


---------07:15----------
our brain that will look at


---------07:17----------
body language facial expression tone


---------07:20----------
other things like even like physical


---------07:22----------
touch and use those


---------07:24----------
as means to kind of socially reassure us


---------07:27----------
so when i when i interact with people a


---------07:29----------
lot there are circuits of my


---------07:31----------
in my brain that are very active that


---------07:32----------
are telling me hey these people like you


---------07:34----------
like


---------07:35----------
they're sort of interpreting all of this


---------07:37----------
information


---------07:39----------
about people's body language and the way


---------07:41----------
that they interact with me and their


---------07:42----------
facial expressions and things like that


---------07:44----------
and it uses that information to reassure


---------07:46----------
me


---------07:47----------
and what happens when we interact with


---------07:48----------
people a lot online


---------07:50----------
is those circuits of our brain kind of


---------07:52----------
like don't get used right because if i'm


---------07:53----------
talking to people on a discord call like


---------07:55----------
sure it may be a video chat


---------07:57----------
but especially if i'm playing games and


---------07:58----------
stuff like i'm not going to be


---------07:59----------
interpreting their body language and


---------08:01----------
their facial expressions


---------08:02----------
and if we think about the way that our


---------08:04----------
mind looks at a social situation


---------08:06----------
and tells us whether to be anxious or


---------08:08----------
not anxious


---------08:10----------
what it'll do is include a lot of like


---------08:13----------
information about stuff like facial


---------08:15----------
expressions and body language


---------08:17----------
so when these circuits in our mind go


---------08:19----------
dormant what happens is we're left with


---------08:21----------
a big question mark


---------08:23----------
and if you think about what anxiety is


---------08:25----------
the bigger the question mark is the


---------08:27----------
bigger your anxiety is going to be


---------08:29----------
because anxiety is all about uncertainty


---------08:31----------
right so if i think about i'm anxious


---------08:33----------
about going to the party


---------08:34----------
and i ask people like you know if i ask


---------08:37----------
someone why are you anxious about the


---------08:39----------
party they'll say things like i don't


---------08:40----------
know who's going to be there i don't


---------08:42----------
know if i'm going to say something


---------08:43----------
stupid i don't know if people are going


---------08:44----------
to like me


---------08:45----------
so a lot of anxieties have to do with i


---------08:47----------
don't knows you don't know what's going


---------08:49----------
to happen it's uncertain


---------08:51----------
and so as we sort of turn to online


---------08:53----------
interaction and some of these other


---------08:55----------
circuits of our brain go dormant


---------08:57----------
what we're left with is more and more


---------08:59----------
question marks and the more


---------09:00----------
we're left with question marks the more


---------09:03----------
likely we are


---------09:04----------
to feel anxious so now what's happened


---------09:07----------
is we have these


---------09:08----------
reassuring parts of our brain which


---------09:10----------
normally will help us feel comfortable


---------09:11----------
in social situations


---------09:13----------
that have basically been dormant for a


---------09:15----------
year to a year and a half


---------09:17----------
and so i think this is part of the


---------09:18----------
reason that we're experiencing what i


---------09:20----------
call reintegration anxiety


---------09:22----------
we also sort of see this when it comes


---------09:24----------
to online schooling so like


---------09:26----------
you know in school it requires like


---------09:28----------
particular faculties


---------09:30----------
like i have to wake up at a particular


---------09:32----------
time i have to like you know show up i


---------09:34----------
have to shower i have to do these


---------09:36----------
kinds of things which online school


---------09:39----------
sort of insulates me from and i don't


---------09:41----------
have to do those things


---------09:42----------
so as those parts of our brain get rusty


---------09:45----------
we start to understandably


---------09:47----------
start to feel somewhat concerned about


---------09:50----------
being able to kind of re-integrate


---------09:52----------
into regular school and so


---------09:55----------
what we kind of end up with is um


---------09:59----------
this situation where like we're we're


---------10:01----------
basically like out of practice


---------10:03----------
integrating into the real world again


---------10:05----------
and since we're out of practice this


---------10:06----------
sort of results in anxiety


---------10:08----------
and so people sort of ask me okay what


---------10:10----------
should i do about this


---------10:11----------
right and so this is the kind of tricky


---------10:14----------
part but like there's no way to


---------10:17----------
artificially turn on those circuits


---------10:19----------
again and there's no way that i've been


---------10:21----------
able to discover to sort of make it


---------10:22----------
painless


---------10:23----------
in terms of reintegrating into society


---------10:26----------
but what i have found is that people


---------10:28----------
tend to do


---------10:29----------
far better than they think they're gonna


---------10:31----------
do and what i mean by that is that like


---------10:33----------
you know if i'm working with let's say


---------10:34----------
like


---------10:35----------
a college undergraduate who's like oh


---------10:37----------
i'm not sure


---------10:38----------
about like starting up a study group


---------10:40----------
because i don't know if the people are


---------10:41----------
gonna like me and stuff


---------10:42----------
and they're sort of envisioning all of


---------10:44----------
these negative things and what my


---------10:46----------
experience has been is that if you can


---------10:47----------
actually


---------10:48----------
get yourself to go there right if you


---------10:50----------
can show up there you may have a lot of


---------10:52----------
anxieties that are very hard to


---------10:54----------
alleviate


---------10:55----------
ahead of time but the cool thing is it's


---------10:58----------
almost like magic but once you


---------11:00----------
show up there and your brain starts to


---------11:03----------
like


---------11:03----------
dust off these old circuits like facial


---------11:06----------
expression and body language


---------11:08----------
what happens is the anxiety kind of


---------11:09----------
starts to melt away


---------11:11----------
it's almost like you know if i if i've


---------11:12----------
gotten rusty in terms of speaking a


---------11:14----------
language if i


---------11:15----------
show up in the country it's going to be


---------11:16----------
a little bit uncomfortable because i


---------11:18----------
don't really remember how to speak the


---------11:19----------
language


---------11:20----------
but my brain will sort of start working


---------11:23----------
for me and will start to activate and it


---------11:25----------
actually gets really really easy


---------11:27----------
for me to relearn language and so i it


---------11:30----------
may i may think that it'll take me three


---------11:32----------
months to learn the language but it


---------11:33----------
actually turns out that after about a


---------11:35----------
week like my anxiety is way better i've


---------11:37----------
learned a lot


---------11:38----------
a lot i may not be 100 back to 100 after


---------11:41----------
a week but it actually gets


---------11:43----------
it gets far easier and is far better


---------11:46----------
than i expected it to be


---------11:48----------
so this is basically what i found in


---------11:50----------
terms of reintegration anxiety


---------11:51----------
um you know just to kind of summarize


---------11:54----------
when we started covid people were really


---------11:56----------
isolated and depressed and


---------11:58----------
really wanted to get back and socialize


---------12:00----------
and like go back to school and live a


---------12:01----------
normal life


---------12:02----------
and now something really weird is


---------12:04----------
happening which is that like as we're on


---------12:06----------
the cusp of hopefully starting to


---------12:08----------
live a normal life again delta variant


---------12:10----------
aside


---------12:12----------
what we actually find is that people


---------12:14----------
have a lot of difficulty reintegrating


---------12:15----------
into society


---------12:17----------
they're concerned about being able to


---------12:18----------
cut it in school they're concerned about


---------12:20----------
like


---------12:20----------
you know socializing and feeling dumb


---------12:22----------
and feeling out of practice


---------12:24----------
and things like that and the good news


---------12:26----------
is that it's actually seems to be


---------12:28----------
somewhat solvable


---------12:29----------
the other thing that i want to let


---------12:30----------
people know is that this appears to be a


---------12:32----------
relatively normal and shared experience


---------12:35----------
for most of society


---------12:37----------
so it seems like you know most of the


---------12:38----------
university students that i work with are


---------12:40----------
experiencing something about


---------12:42----------
something like this and the good news is


---------12:45----------
that you know


---------12:46----------
you may be kind of anxious


---------12:49----------
in terms of like socially integrating


---------12:51----------
with people


---------12:53----------
and it it turns out that they're anxious


---------12:55----------
too so one of the tips that i'll give


---------12:56----------
the you know like my university students


---------12:59----------
is actually to tell people be like hey


---------13:01----------
i've been cooped up for a year


---------13:03----------
and i'm actually looking forward to like


---------13:05----------
making new friends


---------13:06----------
like if you meet like a group of people


---------13:08----------
right you can say hey i'm looking


---------13:09----------
forward to making new friends


---------13:10----------
i'm curious like how other people feel


---------13:13----------
about that


---------13:13----------
and what i actually find is it's like


---------13:15----------
incredibly relieving to everyone in the


---------13:18----------
group when one person says that because


---------13:20----------
we're all in the same boat and all it


---------13:21----------
takes is like one person


---------13:23----------
to like you know crack the damn a little


---------13:25----------
bit and then everyone's super relieved


---------13:26----------
they're like yeah man like absolutely


---------13:28----------
let's hang out


---------13:29----------
and all you have to do is kind of take


---------13:31----------
that first step and then like


---------13:33----------
it's actually really easy to kind of get


---------13:35----------
everyone on the same page and people


---------13:36----------
seem to be excited


---------13:38----------
they're anxious they don't know if you


---------13:39----------
want to be friends with them right like


---------13:41----------
no one knows everyone's like oh my god i


---------13:43----------
want friends but i don't know if this


---------13:44----------
person wants to be friends with me


---------13:46----------
am i too weird have i been like enclosed


---------13:48----------
in my room too long is it like awkward


---------13:50----------
do people not like me anymore


---------13:52----------
this is what reintegration anxiety is


---------13:54----------
and as you kind of bring awareness to it


---------13:57----------
it turns out that actually like it gets


---------13:59----------
better like way faster than


---------14:01----------
you may have thought so the first thing


---------14:02----------
is you know as covet is ending if you if


---------14:05----------
you guys have been like


---------14:06----------
isolated and like wanting to get back


---------14:07----------
into society


---------14:09----------
it's completely normal to feel a little


---------14:11----------
bit confused about that


---------14:13----------
and like be surprised by oh i really


---------14:15----------
want to make friends but i feel like


---------14:17----------
really anxious and i feel like people


---------14:18----------
may think i'm stupid or i've gotten


---------14:20----------
rusty


---------14:21----------
there's probably a neuroscience reason


---------14:23----------
for that it's probably because you have


---------14:24----------
circuits in your brain that


---------14:25----------
normally are able to reassure you and


---------14:27----------
sort of can't right now because they've


---------14:29----------
gotten kind of like they've turned off


---------14:32----------
they'll turn back on but it may be a


---------14:34----------
little bit


---------14:35----------
painful for you to tolerate that anxiety


---------14:38----------
and it does seem to get better


---------14:41----------
school is sort of also seems to be kind


---------14:43----------
of that way


---------14:44----------
but jury's a little bit out there


---------14:46----------
because now we're into the summer so


---------14:47----------
most people aren't in active school


---------14:49----------
but for the people who have reintegrated


---------14:51----------
and like sort of started school back in


---------14:53----------
march or april some places started


---------14:55----------
in person classes then i noticed that


---------14:57----------
people also had reintegration anxiety


---------14:59----------
and it kind of got better


---------15:00----------
yeah so someone's asking what if you had


---------15:02----------
social anxiety before


---------15:04----------
and it's worse now during covid i think


---------15:06----------
i've seen the same thing


---------15:07----------
so the reason it's worse as far as i can


---------15:09----------
tell is because like we've gotten rusty


---------15:11----------
socially


---------15:12----------
so what i've seen in in my patients with


---------15:14----------
social anxiety


---------15:15----------
is that they've gone back to their


---------15:17----------
pre-covered state and actually like i'd


---------15:19----------
say


---------15:20----------
maybe a third of them have actually


---------15:21----------
gotten better like


---------15:23----------
post covet it's kind of weird i don't


---------15:24----------
understand that myself but like a third


---------15:26----------
people seem to be


---------15:27----------
better than their baseline what about


---------15:29----------
overall confidence i don't feel like


---------15:31----------
i've lost social skills as much as


---------15:33----------
confidence so this is a great


---------15:35----------
question because that's exactly how it


---------15:37----------
manifests


---------15:38----------
so you don't if you think about what is


---------15:40----------
the nature


---------15:41----------
of confidence in your mind what circuits


---------15:44----------
in your brain


---------15:46----------
lead you to confidence and so what what


---------15:48----------
i found is actually that like


---------15:50----------
a lot of our confidence comes from sort


---------15:53----------
of


---------15:53----------
mirroring from the outside world right


---------15:55----------
so when i walk into a room and


---------15:57----------
everyone's like


---------15:58----------
yay dr k is here


---------16:01----------
that's gonna help me feel a little bit


---------16:03----------
more confident so those are the kinds of


---------16:05----------
signals that we haven't gotten right we


---------16:07----------
haven't gotten reinforcement


---------16:10----------
in our ability to feel confident about


---------16:12----------
ourselves and so in the absence of that


---------16:14----------
reinforcement


---------16:15----------
this reintegration anxiety manifests as


---------16:18----------
a lack of subjectively feeling confident


---------16:21----------
the good news is that for people who


---------16:23----------
seem to lack that confidence


---------16:24----------
as they integrate just they kind of have


---------16:27----------
to understand that you're going to feel


---------16:28----------
pretty anxious but just show up


---------16:30----------
and it seems to get better relatively


---------16:32----------
quickly


---------16:33----------
so this is when someone says so it will


---------16:35----------
just get better i know it sounds


---------16:37----------
shocking


---------16:38----------
but that has largely been our experience


---------16:40----------
so when it'll just get better


---------16:42----------
if you expose yourself to social


---------16:45----------
situations


---------16:46----------
right if you go into situations and you


---------16:48----------
start talking to people


---------16:50----------
you start hanging out with people if you


---------16:51----------
see facial expressions in body language


---------16:54----------
then chances are this will start to go


---------16:56----------
away or will be at like a pre-covered


---------16:59----------
bass line


---------16:59----------
so someone's asking aspiring lawn lawn


---------17:03----------
clippings is asking


---------17:04----------
i quit my study how will it not spiral


---------17:06----------
in a gap year


---------17:07----------
so if you have a gap year and you quit


---------17:09----------
studying there's a decent chance it will


---------17:11----------
spiral


---------17:12----------
unless you have like a good amount of


---------17:13----------
structure or something to kind of


---------17:15----------
replace it with


---------17:17----------
so you got to be careful about taking


---------17:18----------
gap years because sometimes people do


---------17:20----------
spiral right like when it comes to a gap


---------17:22----------
year


---------17:23----------
some people like really flounder in the


---------17:26----------
lack of structure and some people can


---------17:27----------
really like


---------17:28----------
some people take a break and really


---------17:30----------
enjoy it and they sort of view it as a


---------17:31----------
vacation


---------17:32----------
other people will use it as like uh you


---------17:35----------
know an opportunity to like learn skills


---------17:37----------
or projects and just like


---------17:38----------
grow in a space outside of school


---------17:42----------
other people will actually spiral and


---------17:44----------
gap years so it's absolutely something


---------17:45----------
you need to be


---------17:46----------
careful about um


---------17:49----------
someone's asking how fast do you unrust


---------17:52----------
honestly i say it gets like 50


---------17:53----------
better in a week that's what i've seen


---------17:55----------
and like in two weeks you're like 80


---------17:57----------
there and then maybe in a month you're


---------17:59----------
like back to normal


---------18:01----------
so oxymoron indeed asks what if it


---------18:03----------
doesn't go away even after trying to


---------18:05----------
reintegrate


---------18:06----------
that is the anxiety you guys see that


---------18:08----------
what if


---------18:09----------
what if it doesn't get better oh my god


---------18:13----------
but like what if it does then it's a


---------18:14----------
non-issue so this is the nature of


---------18:16----------
anxiety so people are like what if it


---------18:18----------
doesn't get better


---------18:19----------
that is a product of the anxiety


---------18:22----------
you guys see that like it's a completely


---------18:25----------
normal thought


---------18:26----------
but i can answer that question then i'll


---------18:29----------
say well then there's a decent chance


---------18:31----------
that you


---------18:31----------
this will happen and then your anxiety


---------18:33----------
will say but what if that doesn't work


---------18:35----------
and what if that doesn't work and what


---------18:37----------
if that doesn't work your anxiety will


---------18:39----------
any reassurance that i give you your


---------18:41----------
anxiety will find


---------18:42----------
something else to be anxious about right


---------18:45----------
because reassurance doesn't actually


---------18:47----------
help that much with anxiety


---------18:48----------
so as long as the root of the anxiety is


---------18:50----------
there you're gonna


---------18:51----------
find some way to be concerned about a


---------18:54----------
what-if in the future


---------18:56----------
and this is the really tricky thing


---------18:57----------
about anxiety because anxiety says


---------18:59----------
what if that doesn't work and then as


---------19:02----------
long as that thought is there


---------19:03----------
do you actually take that first step so


---------19:06----------
this person is asking what if it


---------19:07----------
what if my anxiety doesn't go away after


---------19:10----------
reintegrating


---------19:11----------
and so as long as that that thought is


---------19:13----------
there will you try to reintegrate


---------19:15----------
and this is why anxiety controls your


---------19:18----------
life this is why anxiety can be so


---------19:19----------
crippling


---------19:20----------
because it's so worried it wants a


---------19:22----------
complete solution


---------19:24----------
before you take the first step and so


---------19:26----------
this is why you're stuck because there's


---------19:28----------
like there's no way


---------19:29----------
i can give you a hundred percent


---------19:30----------
guarantee that everything will work out


---------19:34----------
and if you're waiting for that one


---------19:35----------
hundred percent guarantee for the last


---------19:37----------
thing


---------19:38----------
to happen before you take the first step


---------19:40----------
then your


---------19:41----------
life will be controlled by anxiety
