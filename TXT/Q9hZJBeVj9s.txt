---------00:00----------
the funny thing is that we were gonna


---------00:01----------
start fundraising today but it turns out


---------00:03----------
that we have actually I mean so we had a


---------00:05----------
couple of goals so let me just see what


---------00:07----------
they are real quick so we we had a


---------00:10----------
couple of why milestones for fundraising


---------00:13----------
and the milestone so this is what we


---------00:15----------
kind of decide is that for all of our


---------00:17----------
fundraising milestones we want them to


---------00:18----------
be like fun things right so I and they


---------00:21----------
shouldn't be things that I'm gonna do


---------00:23----------
anyway so it's not like


---------00:24----------
so we're thinking about teaching about


---------00:26----------
particular topics we may add those if


---------00:28----------
you guys want but like the the goal is


---------00:30----------
to do things that are kind of fun and


---------00:32----------
engaging and that we don't normally do


---------00:34----------
and so we had a couple of goals like


---------00:38----------
like an AMA so not really Q&A I mean it


---------00:42----------
can be whatever you guys want so if you


---------00:43----------
guys want to ask me personal questions


---------00:44----------
if you guys want to do like sort of a


---------00:46----------
marathon Q&A kind of stream if it want


---------00:49----------
like it can be whatever you guys want so


---------00:51----------
just you know anything is kind of fair


---------00:53----------
game there's an LSF react a livestream


---------00:57----------
fail react stream and I don't understand


---------00:59----------
what that means exactly like I don't


---------01:01----------
know if I'm gonna be reacting to a clip


---------01:04----------
or I'm just browsing LSF I don't


---------01:06----------
understand if it's like me or other


---------01:07----------
people or what I'm confused about that


---------01:09----------
but anyway I don't have to know what it


---------01:11----------
is I just apparently have to do it and


---------01:14----------
so that is so that so we had a couple of


---------01:19----------
goals right so like we were thinking at


---------01:21----------
five hundred dollars and fifteen hundred


---------01:22----------
dollars or whatever and it turns out


---------01:24----------
that Lilly Pichu awesomely gave us like


---------01:29----------
three grand so she has single-handedly


---------01:31----------
like funded you know just a gigantic


---------01:34----------
amount of stuff and has gotten our first


---------01:36----------
few milestones met so a huge thank you


---------01:40----------
to Lilly you know we all think that


---------01:42----------
Lilly is awesome and we really support


---------01:44----------
her and we hope that Lilly one is is


---------01:46----------
really taking care of Lilly too and I


---------01:48----------
think that that whole revelation from


---------01:50----------
that stream I think has been really


---------01:52----------
helpful for me to to really


---------01:53----------
conceptualize people is like virgin air


---------01:55----------
version B and so gigantic thank you to


---------02:01----------
Lilly for being so supportive and then


---------02:02----------
like funding us our coaching program


---------02:04----------
because then we can coach people and


---------02:06----------
hopefully help other people so


---------02:10----------
gigantic thank you to lily Pichu


---------02:12----------
gigantic thank you to her community for


---------02:15----------
being such an awesome community and like


---------02:17----------
getting along with us and supporting us


---------02:19----------
there like wholesome and positive so


---------02:23----------
like I think that it's really


---------02:26----------
interesting because watching Lily's


---------02:28----------
community and interacting with Lily's


---------02:29----------
community you can kind of see how like


---------02:31----------
particular people grow particular


---------02:34----------
communities right so like and it's


---------02:40----------
really amazing to be able to see what


---------02:41----------
Lily can create for her community and


---------02:43----------
what her community can create for her


---------02:45----------
and like how twitch is not about


---------02:47----------
individuals it's about like a symbiotic


---------02:49----------
relationship and so we're very very


---------02:51----------
grateful and yeah Lily's awesome and I


---------02:55----------
hope that she's happy and that she finds


---------02:57----------
true love and maybe one day we'll check


---------02:58----------
in with her about that and yeah so thank


---------03:02----------
you guys very much for the gifted subs


---------03:04----------
we greatly appreciate it and we are


---------03:08----------
trying to raise money for this so today


---------03:12----------
so yeah so like just to kind of recap


---------03:19----------
we're raising money for our coaching


---------03:21----------
program which is set to hopefully launch


---------03:24----------
actually in May so we want to start


---------03:26----------
helping you know our people with actual


---------03:28----------
coaches these are all coaches that I've


---------03:30----------
trained and we've been running our beta


---------03:32----------
so our beta is basically finished now


---------03:34----------
and our beta looks really good so we


---------03:36----------
collected a bunch of data and we're


---------03:37----------
optimistic which is why we're gonna move


---------03:38----------
forward with the coaching program and


---------03:41----------
we're also gonna try to you know we know


---------03:43----------
that people aren't may not necessarily


---------03:45----------
have money to even pay for coaching


---------03:48----------
coaching is gonna be like relatively


---------03:49----------
cheap but we're trying to pay all of our


---------03:52----------
coaches sort of a living wage and we're


---------03:54----------
also trying to you know make it


---------03:56----------
accessible and so it really helps to


---------03:58----------
have some funding support for people who


---------04:00----------
can't afford coaching so we're trying to


---------04:01----------
you know it's nice to be able to raise


---------04:03----------
money so a couple of things so thank you


---------04:08----------
guys very much for all of your donations


---------04:09----------
and subs and all that kind of good stuff


---------04:13----------
so we're gonna be doing I guess we're


---------04:16----------
gonna be releasing my crying in the


---------04:18----------
shower playlists but I think I've to


---------04:20----------
tell you guys a story about this okay


---------04:22----------
for a few minutes so last year in August


---------04:26----------
so in August of 2019 why is everyone


---------04:31----------
saying easy dodge what am i dodging am i


---------04:33----------
dodging something


---------04:37----------
okay


---------04:40----------
so anyway so last August we had our


---------04:43----------
first retreat and this was back when


---------04:45----------
like healthy gamer was like smaller and


---------04:47----------
so we were all like you know we were all


---------04:49----------
hanging out in Yosemite National Park at


---------04:51----------
a cabin and we would go like hiking and


---------04:54----------
stuff and we talked about our minds that


---------04:55----------
we talked about how to communicate with


---------04:57----------
people and all the stuff that we


---------04:58----------
normally do on so we're just doing it in


---------05:00----------
person


---------05:00----------
and we were like cooking together and


---------05:02----------
like hiking together and like we would


---------05:04----------
tell ghost stories and look at stars and


---------05:06----------
watch bats and things like that


---------05:09----------
other cool thing about our retreat is we


---------05:11----------
all brought our gaming stuff so like we


---------05:13----------
brought gaming laptops and things like


---------05:15----------
that and so you know the goal is not to


---------05:18----------
like pull you guys away from technology


---------05:20----------
the goal of the retreat was actually to


---------05:22----------
have everyone bring their technology and


---------05:26----------
for us to be able to explore okay do we


---------05:29----------
want to spend time gaming or do we want


---------05:30----------
to spend time doing other stuff and


---------05:32----------
let's not try to restrict gaming let's


---------05:34----------
try to figure out can we find something


---------05:36----------
that is enjoyable and fun to do that we


---------05:39----------
feel naturally motivated to do so that


---------05:41----------
our our gaming equipment gathers dust it


---------05:45----------
turns out that it did and we actually


---------05:46----------
had a couple of people who for example


---------05:48----------
we're like playing mobile games


---------05:50----------
throughout the day and we kind of talked


---------05:51----------
about that and how other people felt and


---------05:53----------
it was like one of these mobile games


---------05:54----------
where you're kind of like grindy so like


---------05:56----------
you have to tap a few buttons every 15


---------05:58----------
minutes and then a lot of it's on


---------06:00----------
autopilot and it was fascinating anyway


---------06:02----------
so we were at the retreat and we started


---------06:04----------
talking about things that normal people


---------06:05----------
talk about like what kind of music do


---------06:06----------
you like and I guess some people were


---------06:08----------
were surprised to discover that I really


---------06:10----------
like super super sad music and like yeah


---------06:16----------
so like I had this what I call crying in


---------06:18----------
the shower playlist and so then we were


---------06:20----------
talking about feelings and how it's good


---------06:22----------
to feel feelings and how I like to


---------06:24----------
listen to sad music because it makes me


---------06:26----------
feel sad because deep deep deep down I


---------06:28----------
know I'm positive and wholesome and all


---------06:29----------
that [ __ ] but deep deep down I have this


---------06:32----------
very deep and profound sadness which I


---------06:35----------
kind of like so I think that when I was


---------06:38----------
like struggling in life I felt that kind


---------06:39----------
of like you know I don't people I don't


---------06:41----------
think people use this term very much and


---------06:42----------
anymore but I was super emo and it was


---------06:46----------
never really quite a goth but look like


---------06:48----------
was definitely moving in that direction


---------06:49----------
and so was super emo and super sad and


---------06:52----------
so


---------06:54----------
you know a lot of people were listening


---------06:55----------
to upbeat music and when it was like my


---------06:57----------
turn I would play like super super sad


---------06:58----------
songs and I still like satin songs like


---------07:01----------
even to this day you know when I when I


---------07:02----------
listen to them I enjoy feeling sad which


---------07:05----------
is a strange feeling but yeah so we're


---------07:09----------
gonna release our my crying in the


---------07:11----------
shower playlist and so the joke from the


---------07:13----------
retreat it was kind of an inside joke


---------07:15----------
which was like yeah I really enjoy


---------07:17----------
crying in the shower and listening to


---------07:18----------
music and I spend a few minutes every


---------07:20----------
morning just like being in the shower


---------07:22----------
and being sad by myself dodged what am I


---------07:25----------
dodged what what's dodged the Oh should


---------07:30----------
I be thanking people for subbing thank


---------07:32----------
you guys very much okay let's do that so


---------07:36----------
thank you skaros for gifting all the


---------07:39----------
subs man we're very grateful and I'm


---------07:42----------
sorry that we're dodging we're not


---------07:44----------
meaning to dodge


---------07:48----------
okay Oh dodging the so you guys didn't


---------07:51----------
get the gifted son got it got it got it


---------07:54----------
got it so that means that I'm always


---------07:57----------
dodging right I have a 100% dodge rate


---------07:59----------
because I don't receive any and as the


---------08:05----------
person who runs the channel so I case oh


---------08:09----------
we're gonna do the crying in the shower


---------08:10----------
playlist we're gonna do the LSF react


---------08:12----------
stream and then I guess we're doing the


---------08:14----------
drinking it we're not going to do the


---------08:15----------
regular when we go straight to the


---------08:16----------
drinking am a stream okay so I so this


---------08:23----------
is the other thing that my team has told


---------08:25----------
me apparently and if you guys are happy


---------08:27----------
with this let me know we're gonna do


---------08:31----------
text-to-speech which I've been told that


---------08:33----------
like I guess we've been avoiding that


---------08:34----------
this entire time because it's true take


---------08:41----------
know so so I I think what we're gonna


---------08:43----------
we're not gonna do a heroin am a stream


---------08:46----------
that is dangerous and you guys should


---------08:48----------
not do heroin and this may be a good


---------08:52----------
time to do our disclaimers so just to


---------08:53----------
remind you that my name is dr. Alec Noah


---------08:55----------
I'm a psychiatrist practicing in Boston


---------08:57----------
Massachusetts and a reminder that not


---------09:00----------
you know everything that is shared on


---------09:02----------
the stream is intended to be for


---------09:03----------
educational purposes and nothing should


---------09:06----------
be taken as medical advice but if you


---------09:09----------
guys do have a problem or concern that's


---------09:11----------
medical or psychiatric or psychological


---------09:13----------
the nature please see a licensed


---------09:15----------
practitioner and address your concern


---------09:17----------
with them nothing on the stream is


---------09:20----------
intended to be sort of medical advice


---------09:21----------
that's supposed to be taken it's just


---------09:23----------
all for educational purposes so I think


---------09:27----------
our next goal is actually I don't know


---------09:29----------
we we need just seven hundred dollars to


---------09:32----------
do okay yeah so learn law with backs


---------09:35----------
okay that's a little off stream right


---------09:37----------
this is we're gonna do so a lot of our


---------09:39----------
goals are actually about me playing


---------09:42----------
video games because apparently you guys


---------09:43----------
want to see that [ __ ] and that's gonna


---------09:45----------
be the most disappointing thing in the


---------09:47----------
universe but we're gonna I'm gonna learn


---------09:49----------
how to play League of Legends with


---------09:51----------
text-to-speech enabled so this is gonna


---------09:53----------
be a longer stream I think will probably


---------09:55----------
do it you know we'll have to figure out


---------09:57----------
when we're gonna do this stuff but we


---------09:58----------
may do the


---------09:59----------
may on Friday so we may do a regular


---------10:02----------
stream and then you know we'll start


---------10:04----------
drinking and then we'll just kind of


---------10:05----------
keep going Friday yeah we'll see I think


---------10:11----------
that's that's how we're gonna have to do


---------10:13----------
it because I'm you know working during


---------10:15----------
the week and


---------10:18----------
yeah so I think oh so and then the last


---------10:21----------
thing is like today we're gonna hmm so I


---------10:24----------
tell you guys about other ones do you


---------10:25----------
guys can you all see the goals you can


---------10:27----------
you guys see that somewhere we haven't


---------10:30----------
mapped out LS or lily coaching call LS


---------10:40----------
for coaching sure so we're reaching out


---------10:43----------
to people right so the only thing about


---------10:44----------
our goals is that we we don't want to


---------10:46----------
sign people up for stuff that they're


---------10:48----------
not willing to do or don't have time to


---------10:50----------
do or don't feel comfortable doing


---------10:51----------
although we'd love to do a lot of


---------10:53----------
collabs this month with people yes so if


---------10:58----------
you guys want to see my twin brother so


---------11:00----------
like there's their stretch goals right


---------11:02----------
so like as we raise more money we're


---------11:04----------
gonna play you guys are gonna get to see


---------11:06----------
a GUI damage so I think it like 30 K or


---------11:09----------
50 K instead of AoE healing we're gonna


---------11:12----------
do a oe damage which means that we're


---------11:13----------
gonna log on to dota we're gonna turn on


---------11:16----------
our [ __ ] Indian accent and we're


---------11:18----------
gonna be toxic as all hell to everyone


---------11:20----------
in the chat and we're just gonna flame


---------11:22----------
and flame and flame and use our power


---------11:25----------
for evil instead of good you know like


---------11:27----------
back when we all have we all have within


---------11:29----------
us the capacity to build people up or


---------11:32----------
break people's about and we're gonna


---------11:34----------
we're gonna break people that we're


---------11:36----------
gonna tear them apart and then they're


---------11:38----------
also like we're gonna play dota and


---------11:39----------
trying to be positive and and we're


---------11:41----------
gonna and then there's things with and


---------11:43----------
without Indian accents things with it


---------11:45----------
without alcohol and then if you guys


---------11:47----------
really want we'll do all of the above


---------11:51----------
anyway and we'll try not to get banned


---------11:53----------
so you guys have to tell me if I do


---------11:55----------
anything that is is you know ban worthy


---------11:59----------
because we don't want to get banned this


---------12:01----------
is just one time yeah darkside Sith Lord
