---------00:00----------
so it's victimizing yourself a coping


---------00:01----------
mechanism victimizing yourself is a


---------00:04----------
habit right it's something that you


---------00:07----------
learn to do it it's something that you


---------00:08----------
become comfortable with and the mind has


---------00:11----------
a really really bizarre like it has a


---------00:14----------
really bizarre truth which is that it


---------00:18----------
prefers the comfortable to the good so


---------00:22----------
if your mind has a choice between


---------00:25----------
picking something that it's familiar


---------00:27----------
with and picking something that's good


---------00:28----------
it's actually gonna pick something


---------00:30----------
that's familiar with and what I want you


---------00:32----------
guys to understand about victimizing


---------00:34----------
yourself is that someone who victimizes


---------00:36----------
themself is in an abusive relationship


---------00:38----------
with themselves and we have to remember


---------00:42----------
that people stay in abusive


---------00:43----------
relationships human beings saying


---------00:44----------
abusive relationships all the time and


---------00:46----------
then the question becomes why do people


---------00:49----------
stay in abusive relationships like let's


---------00:51----------
be scientific about it right let's not


---------00:53----------
judge and say that oh that's stupid


---------00:54----------
let's ask ourselves as scientists why


---------00:57----------
does the human mind do what it does why


---------01:00----------
on earth does someone stay with someone


---------01:02----------
who like hits them like what the is


---------01:04----------
going on in their mind and we have to


---------01:06----------
accept that there's a damn good reason


---------01:08----------
that they are in that relationship


---------01:11----------
because there's got to be a damn good


---------01:12----------
reason if they're in a relationship


---------01:14----------
where someone treats them like do


---------01:16----------
you have to think about scales being


---------01:18----------
weighed and if someone's treating you


---------01:19----------
like like that's really heavy so in


---------01:22----------
order to stay in that relationship


---------01:24----------
you've got to have something really


---------01:25----------
powerful to balance it and that's that


---------01:28----------
the mind prefers the familiar to the


---------01:30----------
good and the reason that people


---------01:33----------
victimize themselves is because they're


---------01:35----------
familiar with it right like why does


---------01:37----------
Jessica tell her so in her mind the part


---------01:41----------
of herself that beats herself up is


---------01:42----------
basically like a copy-paste


---------01:44----------
it's a copypasta of her dad it's her


---------01:48----------
dad's voice that lives in her mind it's


---------01:51----------
exactly what her dad would be saying in


---------01:53----------
those moments that's what she tells


---------01:54----------
herself she learned that and why on


---------01:58----------
earth does she continue to victimize


---------01:59----------
herself it's because her mind prefers


---------02:02----------
the known to the unknown and that makes


---------02:05----------
sense right like why do people stay in


---------02:07----------
abusive relationships it's because they


---------02:09----------
don't know what else is down there they


---------02:10----------
don't know if loneliness is next they


---------02:12----------
don't know if they're ever gonna


---------02:13----------
find someone down the road and think


---------02:16----------
about that for a second is someone in an


---------02:18----------
abusive relationship feels like they're


---------02:19----------
a piece of and if you really


---------02:21----------
believe that you're a piece of then


---------02:23----------
why do you think that you like the grass


---------02:25----------
would be greener on the other side you


---------02:28----------
believe that the grass is greener on the


---------02:29----------
other side if you have faith in yourself


---------02:30----------
as a human being to make it greener but


---------02:33----------
if you're in an abusive relationship you


---------02:34----------
don't think that you're a good person


---------02:36----------
and you don't think that you're gonna


---------02:37----------
find someone better you don't believe


---------02:39----------
that you're worthy of someone better so


---------02:41----------
you're gonna stay in the abusive


---------02:42----------
relationship and victimizing yourself is


---------02:44----------
an abusive relationship with yourself


---------02:46----------
right that's what it really is and we


---------02:50----------
stay in those because we don't think


---------02:52----------
that we can find a better way she


---------02:53----------
doesn't think that there's a part of


---------02:55----------
Jessica that doesn't understand that


---------02:56----------
there is a better way out there because


---------02:58----------
her dad taught her this since she was


---------03:00----------
like one-year-old or even younger


---------03:03----------
there were times honestly where she was


---------03:06----------
probably crying when she was six months


---------03:08----------
old and her dad did not pick her up and


---------03:10----------
comfort her and that left its mark


---------03:13----------
that's trauma what we're dealing with


---------03:15----------
here is not like anxiety or depression


---------03:18----------
it's trauma and the reason that people


---------03:21----------
victimize themselves is because that's


---------03:24----------
what they were taught to do monkey see


---------03:27----------
monkey do
