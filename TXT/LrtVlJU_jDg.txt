---------00:00----------
I want you guys to think about how


---------00:03----------
people become successful and generally


---------00:06----------
we have this idea that success has a


---------00:13----------
formula has a formula what


---------00:27----------
right and following dr. K is a Boomer is


---------00:30----------
not the success or the formula for


---------00:32----------
success so success has a formula and it


---------00:34----------
tends to involve things like


---------00:37----------
follow-through discipline a certain


---------00:47----------
amount of just do it miss right just do


---------00:53----------
it


---------00:53----------
pogg it involves intelligence


---------01:00----------
connections networking and most recently


---------01:09----------
brain hacking body hacking life hacking


---------01:20----------
like oh my god OMG if you do all these


---------01:24----------
things you will be successful right so


---------01:26----------
like the fundamental thing like you can


---------01:27----------
take whatever you want to you like any


---------01:29----------
sort of perspective on success in the


---------01:33----------
biggest problem with perspectives on


---------01:35----------
successes that like in the West we


---------01:37----------
believe that there is one way to do it


---------01:38----------
so I know that sounds kind of simple but


---------01:41----------
like you know everyone says kind of like


---------01:45----------
you know like obviously there isn't one


---------01:47----------
way to do it but if you'd pick up if you


---------01:49----------
go to the self-help section or you go to


---------01:51----------
the business section of like a bookstore


---------01:54----------
which those are you know going out of


---------01:56----------
business and whatnot which you can't do


---------01:57----------
right now because of coca quarantines


---------01:58----------
like no book says by the way this is


---------02:01----------
only gonna work for like 20% of people


---------02:03----------
like no book says that right if you look


---------02:06----------
at any article no one says like some


---------02:08----------
some may say like this may not work for


---------02:10----------
everyone with the presumption is that


---------02:12----------
this is gonna work for like most people


---------02:13----------
and we have this idea that success has


---------02:16----------
like a particular formula and if you


---------02:18----------
read enough books or you do enough


---------02:20----------
things then you'll then you'll you'll do


---------02:26----------
a good job so I Irv a the starts from a


---------02:29----------
fundamentally different place okay I


---------02:31----------
rather starts from this idea that


---------02:33----------
success is based


---------02:38----------
on aligning individual cognitive


---------02:48----------
personality with external strategy and a


---------02:57----------
good example of like someone who sort of


---------02:59----------
does this is like myers-briggs right so


---------03:01----------
myers-briggs is a good example of


---------03:02----------
someone who believes that there isn't a


---------03:04----------
formula for success they say that if you


---------03:06----------
understand your personality type and


---------03:08----------
there are lots of different personality


---------03:10----------
types then you'll be better suited to


---------03:13----------
like be successful because you're not


---------03:15----------
playing the same game as everyone else


---------03:16----------
like you're a different character and


---------03:18----------
different characters have different


---------03:19----------
strategies for success that concept


---------03:21----------
fundamentally comes from iron either


---------03:23----------
because myers-briggs is based on Carl


---------03:25----------
Jung and Carl you of most of Carl Jung's


---------03:28----------
like coroner quote novel theories are


---------03:30----------
based on a study of like Eastern like


---------03:32----------
theory and consciousness so I Rea that


---------03:35----------
basically says like you don't


---------03:36----------
necessarily need this stuff to be


---------03:39----------
successful like you actually don't


---------03:42----------
really need this like this is not the


---------03:43----------
way to do it right and I fully believe


---------03:46----------
this because I am still lazy


---------03:49----------
I suck at follow-through I don't have


---------03:51----------
discipline I don't like to just do it


---------03:53----------
debatable whether I'm smart or not


---------03:55----------
debatable whether I have connections or


---------03:57----------
not I don't really do a whole lot of


---------03:59----------
brain hacking body hacking or life


---------04:00----------
hacking I do do a lot of that stuff sort


---------04:02----------
of but in an ir by that perspective so


---------04:05----------
the the Ayurvedic strategy for success


---------04:06----------
is to understand who you are and instead


---------04:09----------
so it has kind of three steps right


---------04:13----------
understand who you are and some of y'all


---------04:18----------
are pretty good at this and this is


---------04:20----------
where you guys mess up step number two


---------04:22----------
is don't try to be someone else see this


---------04:30----------
is where you guys screw up because when


---------04:32----------
you say I'm lazy your answer your once


---------04:35----------
you make that diagnosis of laziness your


---------04:38----------
answer becomes how do I become unlace II


---------04:41----------
your answer becomes if I'm undisciplined


---------04:43----------
how do I gain discipline you are


---------04:46----------
fundamentally trying to be something


---------04:47----------
that you're not and then


---------04:50----------
this is where step number three is like


---------04:54----------
play the hand you're dealt so what you


---------05:00----------
need is not a method to like overcome


---------05:04----------
procrastination or like a method to be


---------05:07----------
less lazy what you need to do is figure


---------05:09----------
out how can you be successful and use


---------05:12----------
your laziness as like fuel to move you


---------05:17----------
forward instead of like a hurdle to like


---------05:19----------
hold you back or like weight to hold you


---------05:21----------
back and that may sound like super super


---------05:23----------
bizarre right like how can you use


---------05:24----------
laziness for you but I still maintain


---------05:26----------
that a lack of follow-through can


---------05:29----------
actually be an advantageous attribute


---------05:31----------
and you can will kind of get to that so


---------05:36----------
now we get to the second thing okay so


---------05:38----------
like how we're are by than allopathic


---------05:42----------
medicine different okay so


---------05:57----------
so how are our brother in allopathic


---------06:00----------
medicine different so allopathic


---------06:01----------
medicine is Western medicine so let's


---------06:03----------
just compare and contrast them so higher


---------06:04----------
Viva and now we'll Pathak medicine


---------06:12----------
okay so what allopathic medicine does is


---------06:16----------
takes one thing right so let's say


---------06:20----------
sickness and then what it does is divide


---------06:22----------
it into other things physical sickness


---------06:26----------
mental sickness then what it does is


---------06:29----------
divide further let's say like cardiology


---------06:35----------
nephrology so that's like kidneys heart


---------06:39----------
kidneys and then like let's say like


---------06:42----------
orthopedic surgery right so bones and


---------06:45----------
muscles and then it takes mental health


---------06:48----------
and it divides it into addictions


---------06:51----------
depression and then it takes addictions


---------06:54----------
and it divides it further into


---------06:56----------
behavioral addictions and substance used


---------07:00----------
addictions right so like what allopathic


---------07:03----------
medicine does is it tries to like take


---------07:07----------
something big and break it apart so


---------07:09----------
you're gonna have like so for example


---------07:11----------
I'm sick and then allopathic medicine


---------07:14----------
asks okay in what way are you sick are


---------07:16----------
you sick like do you have an infection


---------07:17----------
or is this like a chronic health problem


---------07:19----------
and then if you have an infection like


---------07:21----------
what's infected or your lungs infected


---------07:23----------
is your nose infected is your stomach


---------07:25----------
infected is your is your skin infected


---------07:28----------
is your brain infected do you have


---------07:30----------
meningitis like where is the infection


---------07:32----------
okay like depending on the infection


---------07:34----------
what is the organism is that this


---------07:36----------
organism is a bad organism is that this


---------07:38----------
organism and then based on that we get


---------07:40----------
smaller and smaller and smaller so we


---------07:41----------
break things apart and we zoom in and as


---------07:44----------
we break things apart and zoom in we


---------07:45----------
sort of end up with like a discrete


---------07:47----------
disease entity we try to make disease to


---------07:50----------
be the tiniest most perfect resolution


---------07:52----------
thing that you have so you have a strap


---------07:55----------
meningitis or you have a pneumococcal


---------07:58----------
meningitis in a certain that has a


---------08:01----------
certain antibacterial scent I mean


---------08:04----------
antibacterial agent sensitivity right so


---------08:07----------
an antibiotic sensitivity and so this is


---------08:09----------
the infection this is the treatment so


---------08:11----------
in a person is not involved in that


---------08:13----------
right so like the the goal of an


---------08:15----------
allopathic of alka Pathak medicine so


---------08:17----------
the person is up here and the goal is to


---------08:21----------
get to the disease down here and that a


---------08:23----------
disease has a treatment so it doesn't


---------08:26----------
it doesn't matter whether you're like


---------08:27----------
you're you or you're me like the thing


---------08:29----------
is if you're treating a bacterial


---------08:31----------
meningitis you're treating a bacterial


---------08:32----------
meningitis the unit of treatment is not


---------08:35----------
a human it's a disease and so that's


---------08:38----------
what we mean when we say that like


---------08:39----------
allopathic medicine is not about


---------08:40----------
treating people it's about treating


---------08:42----------
diseases so our vet actually is it kind


---------08:45----------
of says like completely different things


---------08:47----------
so what I Rebecca says is that okay so


---------08:49----------
we have let's say the approach of our


---------08:53----------
event is different so let's say that we


---------08:56----------
have memory we have skin and we have


---------09:06----------
weight so we're gonna take these three


---------09:11----------
like really different things and we're


---------09:13----------
gonna see is there any system to


---------09:16----------
correlate them into something bigger and


---------09:19----------
then we're gonna take this fecal oops


---------09:21----------
we're gonna take this big thing and then


---------09:24----------
we're gonna take another thing over here


---------09:26----------
like ah


---------09:30----------
diet preferences okay and we're gonna


---------09:35----------
combine those two and see if we can come


---------09:37----------
up with something even bigger so this is


---------09:39----------
how our in other words I Rebecca says is


---------09:41----------
there any correlation between someone's


---------09:44----------
memory and the type of skin that they


---------09:47----------
have is there any correlation between


---------09:48----------
their mental like cognitive fingerprint


---------09:51----------
like and their weight is there any


---------09:53----------
correlation between how constipated


---------09:56----------
their they are and how their heart


---------09:58----------
functions so what Ayurvedic tries to do


---------10:00----------
is is it takes individual pieces and


---------10:03----------
then it tries to construct patterns and


---------10:05----------
Western medicine does the opposite it


---------10:07----------
takes a whole thing like when someone is


---------10:10----------
sick and it tries to divide them into


---------10:12----------
its component pieces so if you have an


---------10:14----------
infection you've got coffee and you've


---------10:15----------
got fever and you've got this and you've


---------10:17----------
got this let's treat coughed with this


---------10:19----------
let's treat fever with this let's treat


---------10:21----------
this with you know the third symptom


---------10:23----------
with the third thing and so what happens


---------10:25----------
is like over time you know as people


---------10:28----------
become sick in western medicine they


---------10:30----------
have a lot of targeted treatments for


---------10:32----------
each of their problems so you've got two


---------10:34----------
medications for your blood pressure


---------10:36----------
you've got one medication for your


---------10:37----------
diabetes you've got an asthma


---------10:39----------
hailer and then you've got like physical


---------10:42----------
therapy for your knees and then you also


---------10:44----------
take like tylenol because you have


---------10:45----------
arthritis so over time like the like


---------10:48----------
what we do is we treat individual things


---------10:50----------
so we've got like a treatment here a


---------10:52----------
treatment here a treatment here and a


---------10:56----------
treatment here and so people end up with


---------10:58----------
four treatments right this is how


---------11:00----------
Western medicine works what I rather


---------11:02----------
says is is there any correlation between


---------11:04----------
this is there a broad pattern that we


---------11:07----------
can observe and if there is that pattern


---------11:09----------
can we treat this and thereby improve


---------11:12----------
this improve this and improve this if we


---------11:16----------
treat sort of the overarching pattern


---------11:18----------
can we sort of address all of the


---------11:21----------
components at the same time and so what


---------11:24----------
our vet that comes up with over here is


---------11:27----------
something called doshas so these are


---------11:30----------
elemental balances so what I rather says


---------11:38----------
is that people who are prone to ulcers


---------11:42----------
are also prone to anger and irritability


---------11:44----------
and are also a medium build and also


---------11:49----------
tend to like lose their hair earlier


---------11:51----------
than people who like so so this is


---------11:54----------
something called bitthe okay so like


---------11:56----------
anyway so--but that has some some


---------12:00----------
correlated physical and mental


---------12:02----------
characteristics umm Vata has some


---------12:04----------
correlated physical and mental


---------12:06----------
characteristics and kapha has some


---------12:08----------
correlated physical and mental


---------12:09----------
characteristics and by improving the


---------12:11----------
three doshas in and of themselves you


---------12:14----------
actually treat all of this like the


---------12:16----------
component symptoms and there's actually


---------12:18----------
data that supports this okay so now what


---------12:21----------
we got to do okay I gotta fix this


---------12:29----------
okay so this is what I did so I got to


---------12:32----------
fix my thing


---------12:33----------
I need more space let's do this


---------12:41----------
so let's move these down


---------12:52----------
[Music]


---------12:55----------
get that out of the way


---------12:58----------
erase this let's fix this okay now comes


---------13:03----------
the tricky part


---------13:04----------
what is can dr. K do this


---------13:10----------
[Music]


---------13:14----------
we


---------13:17----------
we missed a why


---------13:21----------
so


---------13:25----------
okay so IRA better I rather believes


---------13:28----------
that we all have a door shake or


---------13:30----------
elemental balance and what that means is


---------13:33----------
that we've got these three forces called


---------13:35----------
Vata Pitta and kapha and that Vata Pitta


---------13:37----------
kapha have each like a certain level and


---------13:40----------
that their levels sort of determine what


---------13:45----------
attributes we have that are physical and


---------13:47----------
mental


---------13:48----------
okay so let's talk for a second about so


---------13:54----------
Vava is like characterized by air v is


---------13:56----------
characterized by fire and Gotha is


---------13:58----------
characterized by earth they each also


---------14:00----------
have second elements but we won't get


---------14:02----------
into that so the first thing to


---------14:03----------
understand is like what what Ayurvedic


---------14:06----------
physicians observed is they notice like


---------14:07----------
some people are kind of like air or kind


---------14:09----------
of like the wind and what that means is


---------14:11----------
that their mental thinking is what I'd


---------14:13----------
call dynamic so if we think about the


---------14:16----------
wind like how does the what what is it


---------14:18----------
what are the properties of wind so it


---------14:20----------
blows really hard and then it stops it


---------14:23----------
blows in a different direction and then


---------14:25----------
stops and then it blows over here and it


---------14:26----------
blows over there it can blow hard or it


---------14:30----------
can blow light it can just it's it's


---------14:32----------
just very variable right if we compare


---------14:34----------
that to something like fire despite urn


---------14:37----------
in one direction then randomly turn


---------14:39----------
around and burn in different direction


---------14:40----------
and then randomly turn around and burn


---------14:42----------
into third and then it stops and starts


---------14:45----------
up again no so fire is sort of driven


---------14:48----------
focused unidirectional


---------14:54----------
right these are like fundamentally


---------14:56----------
different like properties like their


---------14:59----------
dynamic ways of kind of thinking and


---------15:02----------
they looked at gafas which is earth and


---------15:04----------
they noticed like okay there's a third


---------15:05----------
kind of person who doesn't like move in


---------15:09----------
a particular direction in sort of a


---------15:10----------
driven and focused way they're actually


---------15:12----------
like very stable and constant so they


---------15:18----------
can also move like earth can move too


---------15:20----------
like you I mean you can think about you


---------15:22----------
know I mean I guess we don't really


---------15:24----------
think about earth moving but they sort


---------15:26----------
of noticed that there were kind of three


---------15:27----------
mental types and they what they tried to


---------15:29----------
do is like assign them certain kinds of


---------15:31----------
elemental values because that's what


---------15:33----------
they saw so the other thing with gafas


---------15:37----------
is they're also water so the other way


---------15:38----------
you can think about like you know water


---------15:40----------
sort of always finds away so like I


---------15:43----------
think about guffaws is kind of being


---------15:44----------
earth in water so water is gonna like


---------15:47----------
move slowly and surely so if you think


---------15:50----------
about the way that like a riverbed


---------15:52----------
changes over time like a river is going


---------15:55----------
to like cut into the ground beneath it


---------15:57----------
it's gonna be slow and steady so maybe


---------15:59----------
that's a better way to put it slow and


---------16:02----------
steady


---------16:03----------
right so we actually have like three


---------16:06----------
sort of mental qualities so there are


---------16:08----------
those people that are super dynamic and


---------16:10----------
they kind of get excited about things


---------16:12----------
and then they forget about things and


---------16:14----------
then they lose they buy a guitar and


---------16:16----------
then they they don't play the guitar and


---------16:18----------
they're bit those who sort of buy a


---------16:19----------
guitar and then kind of like play it for


---------16:21----------
a while and are sort of driven and


---------16:23----------
focused and then they're coffins that


---------16:24----------
are slow and steady so the decision to


---------16:27----------
buy a guitar happens after months of


---------16:29----------
deliberation but once you get a guitar


---------16:31----------
you're gonna like practice like oh like


---------16:33----------
every day for years and years and years


---------16:35----------
so the three basic like mental


---------16:38----------
approaches okay so the other thing about


---------16:41----------
Ayurveda is that each person has a


---------16:44----------
general like a natural stat in each of


---------16:49----------
these so your Vaught does a certain


---------16:50----------
number your Guf has a certain number


---------16:52----------
your bit does a certain number and then


---------16:53----------
your diet your environment and other


---------16:55----------
factors can actually alter those levels


---------16:58----------
so you can get bata buffs and Botha


---------17:00----------
debuffs and bit the buffs and fit the D


---------17:02----------
puffs and cuff up puffs and buffs and


---------17:04----------
debuffs so the second thing that they


---------17:06----------
noticed is that like


---------17:07----------
Vata people tend to be slim in angular


---------17:12----------
right so they noticed like certain


---------17:14----------
physical court correlations like most


---------17:17----------
people who have dynamic minds also tend


---------17:20----------
to have like a lot of unnecessary body


---------17:22----------
bodily movement so even if you guys like


---------17:25----------
look at me like I move my hands a lot


---------17:27----------
when I talk like even if you look at my


---------17:29----------
handwriting my handwriting is erratic


---------17:31----------
right like so dynamic and erratic like


---------17:36----------
even if you look at this II like this


---------17:38----------
little thing goes beyond the left like


---------17:41----------
guffaws are not gonna write like that my


---------17:42----------
handwriting is about that my movement


---------17:45----------
serve I thought my mind is about that


---------17:46----------
and so like even there are certain


---------17:49----------
characteristics like my nose is like


---------17:51----------
very angular and curved and sharp so I


---------17:54----------
also tend to be slim like if you look at


---------17:56----------
my arm it's like thin right and so


---------18:00----------
Rafa's tend to be slim and angular


---------18:02----------
bit.this tend to be a medium build and


---------18:06----------
then guffaws or what we call big boned


---------18:10----------
right and if you just look at people on


---------18:12----------
the street you'll see that there are


---------18:14----------
like three kinds of people there are


---------18:16----------
people who are sort of heavyset and


---------18:18----------
big-boned there are people who are slim


---------18:20----------
and like they can kind of eat whatever


---------18:22----------
they want to and they may get a little


---------18:23----------
dad got but they're not gonna like get


---------18:26----------
fat right and then there are people who


---------18:28----------
like even if they eat super healthy are


---------18:30----------
still gonna be like pretty like heavyset


---------18:33----------
and it doesn't mean that they're fat or


---------18:35----------
skinny


---------18:35----------
it's like slim or sort of like you know


---------18:39----------
big big boned I mean that's kind of what


---------18:41----------
we call it right there colloquial terms


---------18:42----------
and the problem here is that much like


---------18:45----------
success our society tends to think that


---------18:49----------
one is better than the other so we place


---------18:52----------
value judgments on the pit to build we


---------18:54----------
say that the most attractive people is a


---------18:56----------
society we place a value judgment and we


---------18:58----------
say that people who are like kind of a


---------19:00----------
medium build not too skinny and not too


---------19:03----------
big bone or actually like the most


---------19:05----------
attractive we also have a bit the bias


---------19:07----------
when we think about success so when we


---------19:10----------
think about the way to be successful we


---------19:12----------
think about being a bit tough so we


---------19:13----------
think like okay you should be like you


---------19:15----------
should study hard and you should like


---------19:17----------
learn fast and you should be focused and


---------19:19----------
driven and be like a fire


---------19:21----------
that's just like you know burning


---------19:22----------
constantly for a long period of time and


---------19:25----------
then eventually you'll become successful


---------19:27----------
it's like focus so let's talk a little


---------19:30----------
bit about how these different doses


---------19:32----------
respond to stress because I think this


---------19:34----------
is a good way to kind of understand like


---------19:37----------
which one you fall into so vodkas


---------19:41----------
respond to stress by getting worried


---------19:44----------
bit.this respond to stress by kid


---------19:47----------
getting irritable and got fussed


---------19:49----------
spond respond to distress by getting


---------19:53----------
isolated let's say and the other thing


---------19:56----------
if we're talking about mental health


---------19:57----------
stuff so this is anxiety anger


---------20:01----------
depression okay so if we think about


---------20:06----------
like people they respond to stress in


---------20:08----------
different ways okay yeah so everyone has


---------20:11----------
all three that's the other thing so it's


---------20:13----------
just different levels so like what why


---------20:15----------
do you respond to the most so some


---------20:18----------
people like let's say you know kovat is


---------20:20----------
happening and so some people are gonna


---------20:23----------
like think in different ways so like


---------20:25----------
people who are quarantined some of them


---------20:27----------
are going crazy because they're worried


---------20:28----------
about what's gonna happen in the future


---------20:29----------
like they're thinking like oh my god


---------20:32----------
like this is this is awful like I'm


---------20:34----------
gonna lose my job this is gonna happen


---------20:36----------
that is gonna happen I'm gonna do this


---------20:37----------
I'm gonna do that like they're thinking


---------20:39----------
they're worrying about this they're


---------20:40----------
worrying about that this person is gonna


---------20:42----------
do this this person is gonna do this so


---------20:44----------
they worry about all kinds of things bit


---------20:46----------
this start to get pissed they're like


---------20:47----------
man this sucks like screw this guy screw


---------20:49----------
this guy screw the quarantine screw


---------20:52----------
trump screw this screw the world screw


---------20:54----------
kovat like a screw all about you guys


---------20:57----------
see how those are like fundamentally


---------20:58----------
different like some people just get


---------21:00----------
pissed at everything and some people


---------21:02----------
start panicking about all kinds of


---------21:04----------
random stuff and those people like


---------21:06----------
fundamentally respond to the same


---------21:08----------
stressor in like very different ways


---------21:11----------
right and then guffaws get sort of


---------21:14----------
isolated and depressed and they're like


---------21:16----------
oh my god this is terrible I sucked


---------21:18----------
everyone sucks everything sucks it's not


---------21:21----------
worry it's sort of like this sentiment


---------21:23----------
of being like depressed and isolated


---------21:26----------
they beat themselves up a lot they're


---------21:28----------
not like worried about the outside in


---------21:31----------
the future they're worried about like


---------21:32----------
this here and now


---------21:34----------
so I suck at lie


---------21:35----------
I'm not gonna be able to handle Co vid


---------21:37----------
you know look at all these other people


---------21:39----------
who are applying for loans and like


---------21:41----------
government programs and I'm not gonna


---------21:42----------
take advantage of those like do you guys


---------21:44----------
see how these are like fundamentally


---------21:46----------
different ways to look at stress the


---------21:50----------
last thing that we'll look at is memory


---------21:53----------
so vodkas tend to learn quick and forget


---------21:58----------
quick bit does sort of have a medium


---------22:04----------
memory in terms of how look quickly


---------22:06----------
they've learned and how quickly favor


---------22:08----------
dad and gafas learn slow and never


---------22:12----------
forget okay so this is like you know


---------22:17----------
when some people say oh this person has


---------22:18----------
a memory like an elephant and and so


---------22:21----------
that's sort of the cuff of memory and


---------22:23----------
then the Vata memory is like super easy


---------22:25----------
like they're super dynamic they kind of


---------22:27----------
savate those are oftentimes perceived as


---------22:29----------
what we call quote unquote smart so when


---------22:31----------
I was in med school like I would you


---------22:32----------
know show up so what you do in med


---------22:34----------
school in the US as you change rotations


---------22:37----------
like every couple of months so you'll do


---------22:41----------
like psychiatry for like six weeks and


---------22:43----------
then you'll do surgery for like three


---------22:45----------
months and then you'll do you know like


---------22:47----------
family medicine for a month and then


---------22:48----------
you'll like deliver babies for two


---------22:50----------
months so you're kind of like moving in


---------22:51----------
different fields of medicine so you can


---------22:53----------
figure out what you like and so you can


---------22:54----------
also learn basics of each of those


---------22:55----------
things and so people like I people were


---------22:58----------
always impressed because I seem to learn


---------23:00----------
things very quickly and so people


---------23:02----------
thought I was quote-unquote smart it's


---------23:04----------
not that I'm smart it's just that I


---------23:05----------
learned things quickly but then also


---------23:07----------
like two months after I left the


---------23:09----------
rotation I would forget everything I


---------23:10----------
learned like I wouldn't remember any of


---------23:12----------
it whereas my Kaufer colleagues they


---------23:14----------
sort of took some time to kind of get


---------23:16----------
going right so they sort of had a slow


---------23:19----------
acceleration in high top speed vodkas


---------23:22----------
have a fast acceleration in a low top


---------23:25----------
speed and bit those are sort of in the


---------23:26----------
middle and and you can kind of see that


---------23:30----------
in terms of their mental qualities as


---------23:31----------
well okay so it's not that like a Vata


---------23:35----------
is better than cough ah our cough is


---------23:37----------
better than bit or bitna is better than


---------23:39----------
cough ah although we do perceive it that


---------23:41----------
way when we think about this we think


---------23:45----------
that like bit de is essentially the way


---------23:47----------
to be successful


---------23:48----------
and so the problem that a lot of people


---------23:50----------
run into is that they try to be bit


---------23:52----------
though when they should be like you


---------23:54----------
shouldn't build your strategy to be bit


---------23:56----------
though like you're not a bita so if you


---------23:58----------
have trouble sort of like picking up a


---------24:00----------
task and getting sort of semi excited


---------24:02----------
about it relatively quickly and then


---------24:04----------
pounding it out day after day after day


---------24:06----------
after day after day like you're not


---------24:07----------
gonna be successful so let's look at


---------24:12----------
what I call the curve of work so how


---------24:14----------
should you structure your life so the


---------24:16----------
first thing is you figure out and I


---------24:19----------
think there are some resources on our


---------24:20----------
discord like Ayurvedic tests that you


---------24:22----------
can sort of take to to do some


---------24:23----------
personality analysis and figure out


---------24:25----------
which one you are so you kind of figure


---------24:28----------
out okay am i wrought that person am i


---------24:30----------
bit the person or am i cuff a person you


---------24:32----------
try to figure out okay which one likes


---------24:33----------
describes me the best and then depending


---------24:36----------
on which one you are you should set up a


---------24:38----------
different strategy to become successful


---------24:39----------
in life so what are those strategies


---------24:44----------
let's just think through these okay


---------24:52----------
so the first thing is I'm gonna describe


---------24:55----------
something that I call the curve of work


---------24:56----------
okay so the vatta's work curve looks


---------24:59----------
like this nothing a bit this work curve


---------25:05----------
looks like this oh crap looks kinda bad


---------25:11----------
but let me try to read you that


---------25:12----------
[Music]


---------25:15----------
maybe that was a bit the curve and a


---------25:17----------
cough a curve looks like this okay so if


---------25:22----------
you think about like how should these


---------25:29----------
people become successful what we we look


---------25:32----------
at this person we say this person lacks


---------25:34----------
follow-through they become bored easily


---------25:41----------
and if you guys are wondering like you


---------25:45----------
know if a large percentage of y'all are


---------25:47----------
vodka as opposed to fit the ricotta


---------25:48----------
that's not a coincidence


---------25:50----------
so electronics actually raise your bata


---------25:53----------
so if we think about like the function


---------25:55----------
of mind since we started using things


---------25:58----------
like Twitter and reddit our mind has


---------26:00----------
become more dynamic literally the amount


---------26:03----------
of time it spends on a particular


---------26:05----------
thought or focus before it moves to the


---------26:08----------
next thought or focus is decreasing


---------26:10----------
right so like a hundred years ago like


---------26:13----------
when people used to live in cabins and


---------26:15----------
like read books and you know like the


---------26:18----------
pace of society was slower and so their


---------26:20----------
mind like was relatively more focused on


---------26:23----------
a particular thing because you didn't


---------26:24----------
you know there weren't like that many


---------26:26----------
dynamic things going on now what happens


---------26:29----------
is our mind is like moving faster and


---------26:31----------
faster and faster because there's


---------26:32----------
Twitter there's reddit


---------26:33----------
okay this post is boring oh my god like


---------26:35----------
this post is like 6,000 words like I'm


---------26:37----------
not gonna read that wall of text let me


---------26:39----------
find something that's like 200 words or


---------26:41----------
even something that's like six words let


---------26:42----------
me go to Twitter and find like 15 words


---------26:44----------
and an image let me find a meme that has


---------26:46----------
three words and an image and then let me


---------26:48----------
move to the next one let me move to the


---------26:49----------
next one let me move to the next one so


---------26:50----------
where our mind is becoming more Vata


---------26:53----------
which is why most of the problems that


---------26:54----------
we see that are increasing tend to be


---------26:57----------
Vardhan related so a good example of


---------26:59----------
this is like ADHD is a very like BOTS


---------27:01----------
the diagnosis it's a mind that


---------27:04----------
fluctuates very very quickly so the fit


---------27:07----------
the curve tends to like build up slow


---------27:09----------
and then they also like do a good job


---------27:11----------
for a while and then eventually they'll


---------27:13----------
want elect transition careers so if you


---------27:15----------
think about like very successful people


---------27:17----------
you know there's there's a growing


---------27:20----------
sentiment that if you stay in one job


---------27:22----------
for 10 years you're not gonna advanced


---------27:24----------
as much as if you stay for like two or


---------27:26----------
three years and then move to a different


---------27:28----------
job and


---------27:29----------
stay for two or three years and then


---------27:30----------
move to a different job and that climate


---------27:32----------
perfectly suits the pizza so if it that


---------27:35----------
doesn't stay in one job for 20 years


---------27:37----------
they're like okay what's next


---------27:38----------
so there's a strong sense of what's next


---------27:40----------
and that can be good and that can be bad


---------27:43----------
like we may think so on average that


---------27:45----------
seems to work pretty well in our current


---------27:47----------
society but it's very possible that bit


---------27:49----------
does you know move jobs where if they


---------27:51----------
had stayed with that company that


---------27:52----------
company would have continued to grown


---------27:53----------
and become successful and they would


---------27:55----------
have like done a good job and then gafas


---------27:57----------
tend to you know ramp up pretty slowly


---------27:59----------
but once they ramped up they can hit


---------28:01----------
like a really high top speed and they


---------28:03----------
can they should really kind of stick


---------28:06----------
with it so the problem is that like


---------28:08----------
guffaws are gonna think that oh I should


---------28:10----------
move jobs and really they should stick


---------28:11----------
with it so the people that I work with


---------28:13----------
that are cough is like it takes them a


---------28:15----------
year or two to sort of figure out how


---------28:16----------
the place works and then they start to


---------28:18----------
like really advance and it's really hard


---------28:20----------
to stop them once they get going so the


---------28:25----------
other way to think about this is a Vata


---------28:27----------
is a monkey app it does Tiger and the


---------28:32----------
kava is an elephant right and this isn't


---------28:38----------
like it's not like Tigers or better than


---------28:40----------
monkeys or elephants it's just each of


---------28:42----------
these animals has different strengths


---------28:44----------
and weaknesses and if you want to be


---------28:46----------
like successful you just need to


---------28:48----------
understand what your your what your


---------28:52----------
strategy for success is monkey brain


---------28:54----------
absolutely tigers are better than


---------28:57----------
Lucky's interesting so would you guys


---------28:59----------
say that so let's think about how you


---------29:05----------
should so so how can you structure a


---------29:07----------
strategy for your own success that suits


---------29:10----------
each of these throw shots so the biggest


---------29:12----------
one with Vata is do lots of things okay


---------29:19----------
so what I'd say about this is juggle


---------29:22----------
lots of balls


---------29:26----------
so understand that as a Vata you're


---------29:28----------
naturally going to get bored and when


---------29:30----------
you get bored you should have another


---------29:32----------
task ready for you that you can engage


---------29:35----------
in so the biggest problem that vodkas


---------29:37----------
have is they're like okay I'm gonna


---------29:38----------
let's say I'm gonna learn how to program


---------29:40----------
and then once they start like for like a


---------29:42----------
day or two they're programmed very very


---------29:44----------
intensively and they're super


---------29:45----------
enthusiastic and they actually make a


---------29:47----------
lot of progress right so like I talked


---------29:49----------
to people who will say that like I do


---------29:52----------
90% of my work in 10% of my time like


---------29:56----------
I'll procrastinate till the last minute


---------29:57----------
and then in 24 hours I'll write like a


---------30:00----------
really like a pretty good paper like I


---------30:02----------
may get a B but like I'll write a paper


---------30:04----------
in 24 hours that takes other people like


---------30:06----------
three months to write I'll just bang it


---------30:08----------
out so if you think about that that's


---------30:09----------
actually like really amazing right it's


---------30:12----------
people think about that as


---------30:13----------
procrastination and is that like it's a


---------30:15----------
bad way to work but if you really stop


---------30:18----------
and pause and think about it if you can


---------30:19----------
do three months of work within 24 hours


---------30:21----------
that's actually an amazing skill just


---------30:24----------
pause and think about that what that


---------30:25----------
means is that theoretically you could do


---------30:28----------
like one semester in one week and if you


---------30:31----------
figure out how to harness that energy


---------30:32----------
properly instead of college taking eight


---------30:35----------
semesters in four years you could be


---------30:38----------
done in eight weeks like that's what


---------30:40----------
vodkas are capable of it's bizarre but


---------30:43----------
the problem is that we don't try to play


---------30:46----------
to our strengths we don't try to


---------30:48----------
structure a life that involves intense


---------30:50----------
periods of work


---------30:57----------
followed by rest so this is the way that


---------31:03----------
you should structure your life if you're


---------31:05----------
about that so I know some authors for


---------31:07----------
example that have like very successful


---------31:09----------
Vaught that kind of lives where they'll


---------31:11----------
like go to a like they'll go get an air


---------31:14----------
B&B in the wilderness for two weeks and


---------31:17----------
they'll write like a hundred thousand


---------31:18----------
words and then they'll come back and


---------31:20----------
they'll spend the next four months


---------31:22----------
trying to write five thousand words and


---------31:23----------
that's / - that's that's fine like you


---------31:26----------
just understand how you work and then


---------31:28----------
build a strategy that sort of basis your


---------31:31----------
strategy should be based on what your


---------31:33----------
cognitive style is so let's look at


---------31:35----------
their curve for success so the curve for


---------31:39----------
success of a Vata involves still looks


---------31:43----------
like this but this is where what Matt


---------31:45----------
doesn't need to do is have three


---------31:47----------
activities that they do right and then


---------31:52----------
what happens is by the time you get


---------31:54----------
bored of the third one you're gonna get


---------31:58----------
interested in the first one again and


---------32:00----------
then by the time you get bored of the


---------32:02----------
second one I mean the first one again


---------32:05----------
then you're gonna go back to this one


---------32:06----------
and if you think about it like but over


---------32:09----------
time this is what you guys try to do and


---------32:12----------
instead your productivity could look


---------32:14----------
like this so this is about the


---------32:16----------
productivity and this is what I do so


---------32:19----------
just think about like me for a second


---------32:21----------
like I still maintain I'm telling you


---------32:23----------
guys I'm super lazy like so lazy and the


---------32:28----------
way that I function is I have enough


---------32:30----------
random stuff in my day to keep me


---------32:32----------
stimulated and excited so I do research


---------32:35----------
I do clinical work with patients I


---------32:38----------
started streaming like why do you guys


---------32:41----------
think I did a webinar instead of like


---------32:43----------
just continuing to stream or like why


---------32:45----------
did I start why am i doing like


---------32:47----------
different random things like more


---------32:49----------
longitudinal stuff instead of interviews


---------32:51----------
like why do you guys think I'd do that


---------32:52----------
why don't I just do like 15 hours of


---------32:54----------
interviews a day like every day it's


---------32:56----------
because I find it boring it's like I'm


---------32:58----------
getting tired of streaming streaming is


---------32:59----------
boring I want to do something else so


---------33:01----------
let me try this webinar thing and the


---------33:03----------
key thing for Vata is that when you get


---------33:05----------
bored of something you want to suit your


---------33:08----------
mind one wants to switch to something


---------33:09----------
else but you don't


---------33:10----------
actually have to switch to something fun


---------33:12----------
this is the really key thing that you


---------33:13----------
have to understand you don't have to


---------33:15----------
switch to something fun to make your


---------33:17----------
mind feel relieved you just need to


---------33:19----------
switch to something else that you find


---------33:21----------
somewhat interesting and that can


---------33:23----------
actually still be a productive thing so


---------33:25----------
I'd say that like a good example for


---------33:26----------
Ibaka's not to get a big guitar but get


---------33:29----------
a guitar buy a book about like poetry if


---------33:32----------
you're interested in that and then like


---------33:35----------
get a video game console and then like


---------33:37----------
sign up for like a programming seminar


---------33:39----------
and the cool thing about that is like


---------33:41----------
when you're tired of programming you'll


---------33:43----------
get like all you need to do is not like


---------33:44----------
force yourself to not play a video game


---------33:46----------
it's like okay instead of playing a


---------33:48----------
video game let me at least pick up the


---------33:49----------
guitar or am I ready to pick up guitar


---------33:51----------
yet and for some people three may not be


---------33:53----------
the magic number there may be a fourth


---------33:55----------
one in here right like you don't know


---------33:58----------
like you have to figure out what your


---------34:00----------
magic number is my magic number is like


---------34:02----------
four or five things if I do more than


---------34:04----------
four or five things I tend to like I


---------34:06----------
can't do them all properly and if I do


---------34:09----------
like less than three things it's like


---------34:12----------
awful I'm bored all the time and I suck


---------34:14----------
at all of them and so is about that what


---------34:16----------
you want to do is like maintain a high


---------34:18----------
level of success and interest in lots of


---------34:20----------
different things and the cool thing is


---------34:22----------
that like over time if you do this for


---------34:25----------
like two years you're actually gonna


---------34:27----------
have a lot of different projects that


---------34:29----------
are going well it's bizarre so let's


---------34:32----------
think about fitness strategies for say


---------34:33----------
so this is like pretty standard okay


---------34:35----------
this is like discipline so kind of focus


---------34:38----------
on one thing and then you know I mean I


---------34:43----------
feel like people sort of understand the


---------34:45----------
bitthe strategy so focus so don't get


---------34:48----------
like so like for business it's important


---------34:50----------
to somewhat learn how to say no


---------34:56----------
so this is important for bid those right


---------34:59----------
because you don't want to take on too


---------35:00----------
much and like if you're doing too many


---------35:03----------
things like bit those are actually gonna


---------35:04----------
struggle so you have like your variety


---------35:07----------
streamers on Twitch and then you have


---------35:08----------
your streamers on Twitch who play like


---------35:10----------
the same game every single day and they


---------35:13----------
play it for hours and hours and hours


---------35:15----------
some of them may baby cuff actually so


---------35:17----------
we can we can look at that we can


---------35:18----------
analyze streamers if you guys want to


---------35:20----------
and then yeah okay so what is their


---------35:26----------
cargoes success look like it basically


---------35:27----------
looks like this right so like over time


---------35:32----------
span it's gonna be like that so you're


---------35:34----------
gonna have basically like two things and


---------35:36----------
then you're gonna continue and then


---------35:38----------
there's gonna be you know that then the


---------35:42----------
green curve is gonna start here and then


---------35:44----------
like sometimes like bit this will never


---------35:46----------
come back to the black curve so another


---------35:48----------
important thing about the the Navotas is


---------35:54----------
that like they come back to the same


---------35:57----------
thing so like what VAT does if you want


---------35:58----------
to grow in a particular direction


---------36:00----------
instead of digging like a thousand Wells


---------36:03----------
one foot deep what you want to do is


---------36:06----------
like pick five wells and big dig one


---------36:08----------
foot down in your first well dig one


---------36:10----------
foot down in the second well third


---------36:12----------
fourth fifth and after you do the fifth


---------36:14----------
when you get bored of the fifth thing


---------36:16----------
you may come back to being interested in


---------36:18----------
the first thing and dig your second foot


---------36:20----------
down there right so rotate your


---------36:22----------
attention because your mind is dynamic


---------36:25----------
between different projects with with bit


---------36:27----------
those what you want to do is like keep


---------36:28----------
your attention on one thing and then


---------36:30----------
like gradually transition to something


---------36:32----------
else because you're gonna want to move


---------36:33----------
up and out eventually so good examples


---------36:36----------
of fit those are like you know I'm


---------36:38----------
working with someone right now who's an


---------36:39----------
engineer and like he's been working like


---------36:42----------
as a as an electrical engineer for a


---------36:44----------
couple of years and like now he's moving


---------36:46----------
into like finance and management so he's


---------36:49----------
like okay that was fun for a while I


---------36:50----------
really enjoyed it but now I want to like


---------36:52----------
do something different and it's not like


---------36:54----------
he's a Vata where like after six months


---------36:56----------
the bot does like I want to quit my job


---------36:57----------
he's like okay now I'm ready for


---------36:59----------
something different so if you're a pizza


---------37:01----------
you want to like move you know every


---------37:03----------
couple of years and then let's talk


---------37:08----------
about guffaws so guffaws are


---------37:11----------
slow and steady and the main thing here


---------37:15----------
is don't get distracted by the success


---------37:24----------
of others understand that you're a late


---------37:29----------
bloomer if you're a cuppa okay you're a


---------37:32----------
late bloomer


---------37:33----------
and so understand that like it's just


---------37:36----------
gonna take you more time it doesn't mean


---------37:38----------
you're bad it doesn't mean you're not as


---------37:41----------
smart it's just gonna take you more time


---------37:43----------
your mindset is just like it takes you


---------37:45----------
more time and it doesn't mean that


---------37:48----------
you're bad or worse but the problem that


---------37:50----------
cop is the most common problem that I


---------37:51----------
see cop has run into is they compare


---------37:53----------
themselves to either vadas orb it does


---------37:55----------
and they say like oh man these people


---------37:57----------
are learning this so quickly like I


---------37:59----------
don't know why I'm not like I'm just


---------38:00----------
must be dumb and guffaws what they


---------38:05----------
really need to learn how to do is


---------38:06----------
understand that it's gonna take them a


---------38:08----------
while to get up to speed and once you


---------38:10----------
get up to speed you're gonna be an


---------38:11----------
unstoppable force but like that's your


---------38:13----------
path to success


---------38:14----------
so if oddly enough you know the guff a


---------38:16----------
path to success isn't actually that


---------38:17----------
different it's really just ramping up


---------38:20----------
and then the key thing is that like over


---------38:22----------
here so I want you guys to like imagine


---------38:25----------
that you're a toughie and then over here


---------38:28----------
you compare yourself to fit those and


---------38:36----------
vodkas and what cuff us see as they look


---------38:38----------
over here and they're like oh look at


---------38:39----------
the Vata hit their peak over here and


---------38:42----------
the bit they hit their peak over here


---------38:44----------
and like I have like so what they do is


---------38:47----------
they're like oh these two people are


---------38:48----------
better than I am but they're not better


---------38:51----------
than you are they just have different


---------38:52----------
accelerations and velocities so as a


---------38:55----------
couple what you need to do is find


---------38:56----------
something that you like and then stick


---------38:58----------
with it and then like don't get


---------39:00----------
distracted by other people who are


---------39:02----------
moving on to bigger and better things


---------39:03----------
because you'll do great as long as you


---------39:06----------
just stick with what you're doing and


---------39:08----------
you know this idea of like bigger and


---------39:11----------
badder is like just steer clear of that


---------39:12----------
that's the biggest problem
