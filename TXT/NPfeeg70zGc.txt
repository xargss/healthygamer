---------00:00----------
everyone in the history of humanity has


---------00:01----------
had a different set of circumstances a


---------00:03----------
different psyche different stats


---------00:05----------
different circumstances they're playing


---------00:08----------
their own like every other human being


---------00:10----------
is playing their own unique campaign and


---------00:12----------
your campaign is different your villain


---------00:15----------
at the end of it is different your stats


---------00:17----------
are different your skills are different


---------00:18----------
your class is different so play your RPG


---------00:22----------
instead of trying to play someone else's


---------00:30----------
helen has has reached what most people


---------00:33----------
in the last century would call call


---------00:34----------
successful a family and children doesn't


---------00:36----------
that ease her burden my own situation so


---------00:39----------
let's start with that question doesn't


---------00:40----------
that ease her burden no right so like


---------00:43----------
the whole thing like the whole point


---------00:44----------
behind helen is on paper she's very


---------00:46----------
successful but she still feels like a


---------00:48----------
failure


---------00:49----------
and that's like that's the whole point


---------00:52----------
like our emotions and parts of our being


---------00:55----------
don't respond to logic right they just


---------00:59----------
that's not how it works you have people


---------01:01----------
who like Devin for example who's like


---------01:04----------
plagued with inadequacy even though as I


---------01:06----------
understand he's very successful I see


---------01:08----------
that all the time


---------01:09----------
I see like invent investment bankers in


---------01:11----------
my office that make you know over a


---------01:13----------
million dollars a year and they still


---------01:14----------
feel like failures like it's bizarre


---------01:16----------
that human beings don't respond to logic


---------01:19----------
if you guys responded to logic then like


---------01:20----------
you would like you're able to figure out


---------01:22----------
what you're supposed to do and then


---------01:24----------
you're logically you know what you


---------01:25----------
should do and then like you would do it


---------01:27----------
but that's not I human beings work so


---------01:30----------
being successful doesn't actually do


---------01:32----------
anything to assuage our feel at fear of


---------01:34----------
failure or feeling of failure


---------01:36----------
and my own situation is how to become


---------01:38----------
successful or face failure without the


---------01:40----------
traditional route a family career is


---------01:42----------
that possible


---------01:42----------
absolutely absolutely it's possible the


---------01:46----------
first thing you need to understand is


---------01:47----------
that you're not walking a traditional


---------01:49----------
route which is fine so then you've got


---------01:51----------
to figure out your untraditional route


---------01:53----------
so let me be really clear on this like


---------01:55----------
when I said it was my karma to fail like


---------01:58----------
that was my untraditional route I'm a


---------02:01----------
psychiatrist and I'm streaming on Twitch


---------02:03----------
instead of talking to patients in my


---------02:05----------
office


---------02:06----------
that's untraditional but that's what the


---------02:08----------
world needs the world doesn't need an


---------02:11----------
additional psychiatrist who's gonna talk


---------02:13----------
to like you know 20 patients a week and


---------02:15----------
talk to them about depression or anxiety


---------02:17----------
what the world needs right now is


---------02:19----------
someone to talk to people on Twitch


---------02:21----------
because you guys are so and it's not


---------02:24----------
your fault but like so much of the world


---------02:27----------
is divorced from mental health resources


---------02:29----------
and the old model of mental health is


---------02:31----------
just not working like Helen has been


---------02:33----------
looking for a therapist for weeks or


---------02:35----------
months and she can't find what like


---------02:38----------
something needs to change and so what I


---------02:40----------
want you guys to recognize is that


---------02:42----------
you're untraditional path is like is is


---------02:45----------
exactly where you need to be


---------02:48----------
if I had not failed like let's say I had


---------02:50----------
a 4.0 GPA and I applied to medical


---------02:52----------
school and I got in I would not have


---------02:54----------
been a psychiatrist I probably would


---------02:56----------
have done internal medicine in oncology


---------02:59----------
like the reason I became a psychiatrist


---------03:01----------
is because I dealt with all my own


---------03:03----------
and then that makes me the person that I


---------03:05----------
am today and allows me to help gamers


---------03:08----------
what you guys need to understand is cut


---------03:10----------
yourself a break and recognize that this


---------03:13----------
is part of your path and the more that


---------03:16----------
you accept that your path is like is


---------03:18----------
gonna be your own like what is a


---------03:20----------
traditional path that's just a


---------03:22----------
comparison to other people but that's


---------03:23----------
stupid because everyone in the history


---------03:27----------
of humanity has had a different set of


---------03:28----------
circumstances a different psyche


---------03:30----------
different stats different circumstances


---------03:32----------
they're playing their own like every


---------03:35----------
other human being is playing their own


---------03:37----------
unique campaign and your campaign is


---------03:40----------
different your villain at the end of it


---------03:42----------
is different your stats are different


---------03:44----------
your skills are different your class is


---------03:45----------
different so play your RPG instead of


---------03:49----------
trying to play someone else's and that


---------03:51----------
starts by like understanding that okay


---------03:53----------
I'm not on a traditional path fine


---------03:57----------
then start from where you are instead of


---------03:59----------
where you should be or where other


---------04:01----------
people have been


---------04:03----------
that's the first step and it's


---------04:05----------
absolutely possible I'd say the reason


---------04:07----------
that you feel like it's impossible is


---------04:09----------
because you're trying to live someone


---------04:10----------
else's life you're looking at a system


---------04:13----------
of success you're looking at a script


---------04:15----------
for success and you're saying that's not


---------04:16----------
working for me I can't achieve that well


---------04:19----------
damn right because that's not your life


---------04:20----------
that's someone else's life


---------04:21----------
so start playing your own RPG


---------04:23----------
and see where you get you'd be surprised


---------04:28----------
[Music]


---------04:31----------
yes Oh someone's asking is real life a


---------04:34----------
roguelike absolutely it's some


---------04:36----------
procedurally generated crap that wasn't


---------04:39----------
scripted by anyone and it's ugly it's


---------04:42----------
not like you know level 1 to level 2


---------04:44----------
level 3 it's like random crap that gets


---------04:46----------
thrown your way and you have to learn


---------04:47----------
how to deal with it


---------04:51----------
you


---------04:51----------
[Music]


---------04:53----------
okay


---------04:58----------
yeah so like dr. Joe Bree says I believe


---------05:00----------
people who never felt like they belong


---------05:02----------
to anywhere come to twitch hoping that


---------05:04----------
they would belong absolutely right so


---------05:06----------
you live in a day and time where there


---------05:09----------
is a community for rejects like think


---------05:12----------
about that that's awesome there is a


---------05:14----------
place you can go where everyone else is


---------05:18----------
a reject those are your people and then


---------05:21----------
the other cool thing for me is that


---------05:23----------
there is there's literally a platform


---------05:26----------
that causes all you to coalesce


---------05:29----------
in one place that I can talk to I don't


---------05:32----------
have to go and hunt you all down you'll


---------05:33----------
come here like that's amazing it makes


---------05:36----------
my job so much easier like it's amazing


---------05:39----------
the circumstances that we live with in


---------05:41----------
my roguelike magically this platform


---------05:46----------
appears where you guys all show up and I


---------05:49----------
just get to talk to my computer screen


---------05:51----------
and I hit every single one of you like


---------05:53----------
how awesome is that now you could look


---------05:56----------
at me and you could say that this is


---------05:57----------
this isn't like this is a


---------06:00----------
non-traditional road to success like


---------06:02----------
absolutely like thank God because if I


---------06:04----------
had to sit in my office and just talk to


---------06:05----------
like individual people talking about


---------06:07----------
their individual problems all day long


---------06:10----------
like I would I just couldn't do it


---------06:13----------
so my personality is also something that


---------06:15----------
I get bored easily so I can't just be a


---------06:18----------
regular therapist I have to do something


---------06:20----------
else so I could have looked at this and


---------06:22----------
I could have said oh I can't work for 40


---------06:23----------
hours a week I can only work for 20


---------06:25----------
hours a week before I start pulling my


---------06:27----------
hair out and I could say that I'm less


---------06:29----------
I'm less successful because my


---------06:32----------
colleagues can sit in an office all day


---------06:33----------
and I just can't do it I need to be


---------06:35----------
better I need to be more patient I need


---------06:37----------
to be able to like sit in the same


---------06:39----------
 chair this chair I can only sit


---------06:45----------
in that chair for 20 hours a week it's


---------06:46----------
all I can do and I could have said that


---------06:48----------
I'm a failure by using someone else's


---------06:51----------
standard but God gave me twitch right so


---------06:55----------
that I can come on here and I can talk


---------06:57----------
to myself I don't even know if you guys


---------07:00----------
are real or Elle BOTS like I don't even


---------07:02----------
know


---------07:04----------
but this works and so take a look at


---------07:07----------
your life and realize that if you're a


---------07:09----------
failure it's because you're playing the


---------07:10----------
wrong game


---------07:13----------
like you're going onto the golf course


---------07:15----------
and you're saying like I can't hit a


---------07:16----------
three-pointer well yeah that's because


---------07:18----------
you're not playing basketball


---------07:22----------
like play your own game don't play


---------07:24----------
someone else's game play your own game


---------07:28----------
and then like see how far you can go if


---------07:30----------
you just play your own game accept


---------07:32----------
yourself for who you are


---------07:33----------
accept where you are


---------07:37----------
and then like play that game right with


---------07:40----------
your stats with your busted-ass main


---------07:43----------
character who's got like those like like


---------07:46----------
you picked a lot of perk flaws right


---------07:48----------
like you know that that gives you


---------07:49----------
like extra points like you picked a lot


---------07:52----------
of those you pick like lazy and you


---------07:54----------
picked like addicted to video games and


---------07:56----------
you picked like body odor


---------07:59----------
but the cool thing is somewhere in there


---------08:01----------
you've got you've got some positive


---------08:03----------
parts the problem is you're just not


---------08:05----------
like you've got like plus 30 skill two


---------08:08----------
like guns but the problem is like you


---------08:10----------
never use a gun so you're not


---------08:12----------
recognizing that you're actually amazing


---------08:15----------
at something but the problem is that


---------08:16----------
you're trying to live a scripted life so


---------08:19----------
pick up a gun well don't pick up a gun


---------08:22----------
that's stupid


---------08:22----------
I mean don't not literally a gun like I


---------08:24----------
don't want this to be misinterpreted


---------08:27----------
but you know like there's something that


---------08:28----------
you're good at you're just too busy


---------08:30----------
blaming yourself for not being good at


---------08:32----------
what other people are good at to even


---------08:34----------
stop and figure that out


---------08:37----------
so like think about what you like and


---------08:39----------
now we're gonna get to another question


---------08:41----------
so some people have been asking me how


---------08:43----------
do you find your Dharma your Dharma


---------08:48----------
means duty or responsibility how do you


---------08:50----------
find your Dharma by looking by stopping


---------08:54----------
and thinking like what is it that you


---------08:57----------
what is it that you like to start there


---------09:02----------
start start there right like what is it


---------09:05----------
that you like what is it that you're


---------09:06----------
interested in


---------09:08----------
but I want you guys to think about this


---------09:10----------
for a second


---------09:12----------
so ten years ago someone I like let's


---------09:16----------
say hypothetically I was around ten


---------09:18----------
years ago and I asked someone what do


---------09:19----------
you what do you like and they said uh


---------09:22----------
doc I don't like anything except for


---------09:24----------
video games and like I would say okay


---------09:28----------
well sucks for you because what you like


---------09:31----------
which is just playing video


---------09:33----------
games all day is a non marketable skill


---------09:39----------
what do you think about that now


---------09:43----------
right like holy


---------09:46----------
prize pools in dota 2 are larger than


---------09:50----------
any professional physical sport


---------09:54----------
thirty million dollars playing a


---------09:57----------
video game


---------09:59----------
the world is changing


---------10:02----------
and just because the the patterns of old


---------10:05----------
aren't working like let's even go back


---------10:08----------
like 10 years okay doc I want to make a


---------10:10----------
videogame well that's tough because in


---------10:12----------
order to make a videogame you need to


---------10:14----------
apply for a job at a major publishing


---------10:18----------
company and there's this whole pipeline


---------10:19----------
and it's really hard to like break into


---------10:21----------
the industry


---------10:24----------
you guys know like this game axiom verge


---------10:26----------
have you guys heard of axiom verge or


---------10:28----------
undertale like think about the world


---------10:31----------
that you live in axiom verge was made by


---------10:34----------
one guy game is amazing


---------10:36----------
undertale made by one dude


---------10:39----------
right you guys live in a world where


---------10:42----------
like you don't have to break into an


---------10:43----------
industry


---------10:45----------
you don't have to break into anything


---------10:47----------
the barrier to publication is so low


---------10:50----------
that you can just make something


---------10:55----------
you could just make it you can just


---------10:56----------
write a book and you don't even have to


---------10:58----------
get a contract from a publisher anymore


---------11:00----------
you just self publish on Amazon you can


---------11:03----------
make a video game and just Steam


---------11:04----------
greenlight


---------11:07----------
you could just buy a camp like this is


---------11:10----------
what I did six weeks ago I was like I


---------11:12----------
want to start streaming on Twitch I'm


---------11:14----------
tired of seeing people in my office


---------11:16----------
bought a couple of cameras checked out


---------11:18----------
Tom's like he's got this great guide on


---------11:20----------
his website


---------11:22----------
and then I started streaming so big


---------11:25----------
dudas asks does it have to be good


---------11:27----------
you're damn right it has to be good so


---------11:30----------
you've got to work at it I'm not saying


---------11:31----------
that you're gonna be successful if you


---------11:32----------
just half-ass a video game but that's


---------11:35----------
something that you've got to like that's


---------11:37----------
something that you've got to do right


---------11:38----------
that's something you can work at success


---------11:41----------
isn't easy but you don't have to follow


---------11:43----------
the traditional model and you can follow


---------11:46----------
the traditional model too this is where


---------11:47----------
you start thinking about your career in


---------11:49----------
terms of okay this is what I really love


---------11:50----------
to do this is what I care about and then


---------11:53----------
you look at the array of options for


---------11:55----------
careers and you pick one that sort of


---------11:57----------
fits so you could say like so yeah I


---------12:00----------
don't know if you guys know there's a


---------12:01----------
there's an author named Brandon


---------12:02----------
Sanderson so I loved his books he wrote


---------12:04----------
like Miss Bourne and things like that


---------12:05----------
and so Brandon Sanderson you guys know


---------12:08----------
what his job was he was the night


---------12:10----------
manager at a hotel which is brilliant


---------12:12----------
because he got paid for being there and


---------12:14----------
like everyone is asleep at night over


---------12:17----------
the hotel so he could just write for


---------12:20----------
like eight hours a day while collecting


---------12:22----------
a paycheck to pay his bills


---------12:26----------
and so like that's what I want you guys


---------12:29----------
to rethink right so you're a failure


---------12:31----------
fine like how can you make this work


---------12:36----------
think about it and be yeah thanks for


---------12:40----------
linking to Tom Tom scream I mean uh


---------12:43----------
twitch and think about like think about


---------12:46----------
really what your situation is and like


---------12:48----------
think about the circumstances of your


---------12:49----------
life think about the hand that you were


---------12:51----------
dealt and it takes time and effort to


---------12:53----------
stop and think about this think about


---------12:55----------
what's getting in the way think about


---------12:56----------
the emotions that keep you from saying


---------12:59----------
like keep you from pursuing your dream


---------13:01----------
like if you want to write a fiction


---------13:02----------
novel start writing forget no


---------13:05----------
not November this is like NaNoWriMo you


---------13:09----------
guys don't know what the National Novel


---------13:10----------
Writing Month so a group of people all


---------13:13----------
over the world sit down and over the


---------13:14----------
course of 30 days they just write a


---------13:16----------
novel and they like meet at like


---------13:18----------
different coffee shops and people's


---------13:19----------
houses and they just start writing it's


---------13:21----------
amazing


---------13:24----------
anyway my rant is complete
