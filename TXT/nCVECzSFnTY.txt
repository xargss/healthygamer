---------00:00----------
so this i think was was the context


---------00:02----------
right so i think it came back to this


---------00:03----------
um donation that we got from hiromobific


---------00:07----------
which is


---------00:08----------
why do you do it why get up why keep


---------00:10----------
fighting do you believe you're fighting


---------00:12----------
for something


---------00:12----------
for more than your survival can you tell


---------00:14----------
me what it is do you even know is it


---------00:16----------
freedom or truth


---------00:17----------
perhaps peace illusions or temporary


---------00:20----------
constructs


---------00:21----------
okay so here's the thing so then i asked


---------00:23----------
you guys the question


---------00:26----------
why does rain fall down and then


---------00:29----------
everyone was like


---------00:30----------
gravity and then i asked the question


---------00:33----------
why does fire go


---------00:34----------
up and then everyone was like we don't


---------00:37----------
know


---------00:38----------
anti-gravity science physics


---------00:42----------
you know it just does you know


---------00:46----------
density someone said i don't know


---------00:49----------
so i was in india and and i was


---------00:52----------
basically asking my teachers


---------00:54----------
some of these questions and it's like


---------00:57----------
why do


---------00:58----------
why does this happen to us why do we do


---------01:01----------
this like why are human beings like


---------01:03----------
fundamentally like why are we


---------01:04----------
not content right why do we come up with


---------01:07----------
these magic pills


---------01:09----------
for the problems that we have like


---------01:10----------
fundamentally like why are we not


---------01:12----------
content like why can't we just be happy


---------01:14----------
like if you look at a rock


---------01:15----------
that's outside the rock is just happy is


---------01:17----------
it is this just a consequence of


---------01:19----------
consciousness


---------01:21----------
and so what my teacher said and this is


---------01:23----------
the funny thing about you know


---------01:24----------
meditation teachers and ashrams is like


---------01:26----------
some of them really don't know science


---------01:27----------
but they like kind of talk like they


---------01:28----------
know science so then he was like


---------01:30----------
he has to be why does where does all


---------01:34----------
water end up and where does all fire


---------01:38----------
end up someone so so eventually it was


---------01:41----------
sort of like all water winds up in the


---------01:43----------
ocean and the scientist in me was like


---------01:45----------
not really because like you know


---------01:46----------
the like it also ends up in the clouds


---------01:48----------
like the whole point is that it's a


---------01:49----------
cycle and it's like


---------01:51----------
you get evaporation then you get clouds


---------01:52----------
and you get rainfall rainfall ends up in


---------01:54----------
rivers and rivers


---------01:55----------
ends up in the ocean then he's like


---------01:58----------
where does all fire end up


---------02:00----------
it's like i don't know it just like kind


---------02:02----------
of burns right like it like


---------02:04----------
there's combustion and then you like


---------02:06----------
produce like carbon dioxide and carbon


---------02:08----------
monoxide and


---------02:09----------
things like that and he was like


---------02:12----------
it ends up in the sun and i was like so


---------02:15----------
i was like okay


---------02:16----------
whatever and so then his point was this


---------02:19----------
that all fire points towards the sun


---------02:21----------
and all all water goes towards the ocean


---------02:24----------
i was like sure i mean i guess from sort


---------02:26----------
of like a you know like


---------02:28----------
i mean i guess sort of in a weird way


---------02:30----------
it's like kind of true because fire goes


---------02:31----------
up and the sun is generally up there so


---------02:33----------
i'm with you kind of


---------02:35----------
and so i mean i think the dude was


---------02:36----------
trying to make a point so i was like let


---------02:38----------
that slide okay so this is the problem


---------02:39----------
is that if you're a skeptic


---------02:41----------
in an ashram sometimes you get into


---------02:43----------
these sorts of situations where


---------02:44----------
if you contest him on those points you


---------02:46----------
never get to the end of the story


---------02:47----------
just like you guys are gonna never get


---------02:49----------
to the end of the story and so what what


---------02:51----------
he was saying


---------02:52----------
what came next and i was glad i kind of


---------02:53----------
held my piece because he was saying that


---------02:54----------
all things strive for their source


---------02:57----------
and sure his analogies weren't great and


---------02:59----------
so i think like you know when people ask


---------03:01----------
me like why do we do this like why


---------03:03----------
bother getting better and the one thing


---------03:06----------
that i


---------03:06----------
i will say is that if you look at human


---------03:08----------
beings we definitely have a particular


---------03:11----------
gravity


---------03:12----------
to us right i don't mean like gravitas i


---------03:14----------
mean like


---------03:15----------
there are things that pull us in a


---------03:17----------
direction


---------03:19----------
like we get pulled like if we're


---------03:21----------
discontent


---------03:22----------
we get pulled towards peace


---------03:26----------
you know we heard today about how unit


---------03:28----------
gets pulled towards like


---------03:30----------
quieting those calm feelings so why do


---------03:33----------
we do it because that's the direction


---------03:35----------
that we're pulled


---------03:36----------
i could call this thing dharma or duty


---------03:40----------
i could say that it's my duty to help


---------03:42----------
people but like


---------03:43----------
that too is like it's not dude it's just


---------03:45----------
a word that we wrap around


---------03:47----------
like being pulled and so what i want you


---------03:50----------
guys to really stop and think about is


---------03:52----------
like


---------03:52----------
what is pulling you in a particular


---------03:55----------
direction


---------03:56----------
and earlier we had you know we had a


---------03:58----------
someone


---------03:59----------
kind of offer a pretty big donation and


---------04:01----------
we're grateful for that he was also


---------04:03----------
talking about how they


---------04:04----------
um you know how they're struggling and


---------04:07----------
they're treading water and i want what i


---------04:08----------
want


---------04:09----------
all of y'all to realize if you guys are


---------04:11----------
trying water or you yearn


---------04:12----------
for something or you want something is


---------04:15----------
like that is actually really really


---------04:17----------
important


---------04:18----------
you have this gravitational pull to


---------04:20----------
become happy and peaceful and content


---------04:24----------
and so it's not so much about why i mean


---------04:27----------
like i could offer whatever theories i


---------04:29----------
can that'll be just as pseudo-scientific


---------04:31----------
as


---------04:32----------
all fires seeks to return home to the


---------04:34----------
sun


---------04:36----------
the point of the matter is that all fire


---------04:38----------
points up and the point of the matter is


---------04:40----------
that there is a gravitational pull


---------04:42----------
that is pulling you towards like


---------04:44----------
becoming content


---------04:46----------
and happy and wanting to change your


---------04:48----------
life


---------04:50----------
and so this is where i'd say use that


---------04:52----------
gravitational potential energy


---------04:54----------
don't get caught up in your mind to like


---------04:57----------
think like oh this is the particular


---------05:00----------
thing


---------05:00----------
that i need what you should focus on is


---------05:03----------
the direction


---------05:04----------
not like the precise point right so you


---------05:08----------
may think that a particular thing will


---------05:09----------
make you happy


---------05:10----------
but it's not that thing that's going to


---------05:12----------
make you happy and this is what people


---------05:14----------
discover


---------05:15----------
is they get things and things and things


---------05:17----------
this is what some people call


---------05:18----------
the hedonistic treadmill if you seek one


---------05:21----------
pleasure then you seek another pleasure


---------05:23----------
and another pleasure and another


---------05:25----------
pleasure i see this a lot with my


---------05:26----------
clients who work at investment banks


---------05:28----------
where they're like okay once i make vp


---------05:30----------
then i'll be happy and then they wind up


---------05:32----------
as vps and they're like once i make


---------05:34----------
junior partner i'll be happy and then


---------05:37----------
they're not happy you're director in


---------05:39----------
banks and then once i become a managing


---------05:41----------
director


---------05:43----------
then i'll be happy and then like what


---------05:45----------
these people don't realize is that


---------05:47----------
there's like one person from each of


---------05:48----------
these positions who comes to my office


---------05:50----------
every week


---------05:50----------
including the managing directors they're


---------05:53----------
at the top of the food chain


---------05:55----------
and they look around at their life and


---------05:56----------
they've got two divorces behind them


---------05:58----------
and they're like not happy


---------06:01----------
and so like there is no particular thing


---------06:05----------
that if you get that thing it's gonna


---------06:07----------
make you happy


---------06:08----------
there's certainly a lot of happiness to


---------06:10----------
be found


---------06:11----------
through achievement through


---------06:13----------
relationships through gaming even


---------06:16----------
but at the end of the day what you guys


---------06:17----------
really need to move towards is like just


---------06:19----------
move in the direction that you want to


---------06:21----------
go


---------06:22----------
and don't get particularly caught up


---------06:26----------
in in like a particular magical pill or


---------06:29----------
solution


---------06:30----------
if i do this then my entire life will


---------06:32----------
change


---------06:34----------
and i've seen this too it's in like


---------06:36----------
there's certainly progress to be made


---------06:40----------
but i see it in all kinds of clients and


---------06:42----------
all kinds of people because at the end


---------06:43----------
of the day if you listen to buddha


---------06:45----------
buddha you know he says that happiness


---------06:47----------
comes from within and that's not like i


---------06:49----------
know it's become like a new age yoga


---------06:51----------
calendar like


---------06:52----------
instagram kind of like thing that people


---------06:54----------
like posting like uh


---------06:56----------
happiness comes from within men so


---------06:58----------
that's why you should buy these


---------06:59----------
120 lululemon pants because happiness


---------07:02----------
comes from within


---------07:04----------
yeah subscribe like follow us


---------07:08----------
on twitter if you want happiness from


---------07:10----------
within


---------07:11----------
use more social media bro yeah give us


---------07:14----------
donations man


---------07:15----------
come to my retreat bro order my merch


---------07:17----------
bro because happiness comes from within


---------07:19----------
we have this really great t-shirt that


---------07:21----------
says happiness comes from within


---------07:23----------
yeah and so what we recommend people do


---------07:25----------
is they chop it up into little pieces


---------07:27----------
with scissors and make it into a stew


---------07:28----------
and then eat it because then happiness


---------07:30----------
is on the inside


---------07:32----------
right like like we say that so much but


---------07:36----------
we don't


---------07:36----------
recognize what it means what it


---------07:40----------
actually means is that like it is your


---------07:42----------
the way that you view the world


---------07:45----------
that matters the most and so if you're


---------07:48----------
getting caught up like move in the


---------07:50----------
direction that you need to go in


---------07:51----------
and don't get particularly attached to


---------07:54----------
some


---------07:55----------
thing that is in that direction so if


---------07:58----------
i'm hungry like i need to eat


---------08:00----------
something not eat precisely the food


---------08:03----------
that i'm craving


---------08:05----------
and so you guys should do that for


---------08:06----------
yourselves as well in terms of taking


---------08:08----------
care of yourself


---------08:09----------
if you if you're if there's if there's a


---------08:12----------
part of you that wakes up in the morning


---------08:13----------
and is like i need to be in more shape


---------08:15----------
than i


---------08:15----------
am i want to look better and then what


---------08:18----------
happens is you attach yourself to a


---------08:20----------
particular fantasy


---------08:21----------
i want to look like that don't follow


---------08:23----------
the fantasy


---------08:24----------
move in the direction so it's not about


---------08:27----------
having like


---------08:28----------
you know being one of these these


---------08:29----------
generic


---------08:31----------
dudes who's on the bachelor it's like


---------08:33----------
about


---------08:34----------
being a little bit better than you were


---------08:36----------
the day before


---------08:38----------
and so exercise a little bit eat a


---------08:40----------
little bit healthier eat a piece of


---------08:41----------
fruit


---------08:42----------
drink water instead of soda like take


---------08:44----------
one little thing


---------08:45----------
and do that thing move in the direction


---------08:46----------
that you're going but don't get caught


---------08:48----------
up in a particular


---------08:49----------
goal i'm only going to go to college if


---------08:53----------
i can go to harvard and nothing else is


---------08:55----------
is worth it right i'm only gonna go to


---------08:58----------
the gym like i'm gonna start going to


---------09:00----------
the gym once i'm in shape so i don't


---------09:01----------
embarrass myself it's like


---------09:04----------
i know exactly how those people feel


---------09:06----------
because that's how i feel i have those


---------09:08----------
thoughts


---------09:09----------
but it's like completely missing the


---------09:10----------
point just like think about that thought


---------09:12----------
process for a second


---------09:16----------
you know it's like i'm gonna go to the


---------09:17----------
gym once i'm in shape look what


---------09:20----------
you know like this is the only thing


---------09:21----------
that's going to work for me like you


---------09:22----------
attach yourselves to this particular


---------09:24----------
hope


---------09:25----------
and you go towards it but just get help


---------09:27----------
move in the direction that your


---------09:29----------
gravitation is pulling you


---------09:31----------
head towards the source do something


---------09:33----------
anything in the right direction


---------09:35----------
and that is how you wind up in the right


---------09:37----------
place


---------09:39----------
you don't start from you know the


---------09:41----------
beginning


---------09:42----------
and see a particular point because you


---------09:44----------
don't know what's going to work from you


---------09:45----------
at the very beginning of the journey


---------09:47----------
this is something that is called the


---------09:49----------
planning fallacy which is that we make


---------09:51----------
plans at the beginning which is when we


---------09:52----------
have the least information


---------09:54----------
and therefore our plans are actually


---------09:56----------
objectively the worst plans that they'll


---------09:57----------
ever be


---------09:58----------
is at the very beginning but this is


---------10:00----------
what we do we attach ourselves to a goal


---------10:02----------
and we say oh this is what i need to be


---------10:04----------
happy but what do you know like you're


---------10:06----------
not like


---------10:06----------
you haven't started that journey move in


---------10:09----------
the right direction


---------10:10----------
take one step forward and let go of


---------10:12----------
what's going to happen


---------10:14----------
i was psyched today because i had a


---------10:16----------
great meditation for yuna i was like


---------10:18----------
this is going to be perfect this is what


---------10:20----------
i studied meditation for


---------10:21----------
because she has this problem and i have


---------10:23----------
the perfect meditation for her


---------10:26----------
and then life taught me the same lesson


---------10:28----------
over and over and over again because


---------10:29----------
this is what i've noticed happens to me


---------10:31----------
the more perfect of an answer i have i


---------10:33----------
even said her i said i have an answer


---------10:35----------
for you


---------10:36----------
you guys notice that i don't usually say


---------10:37----------
that


---------10:39----------
so i've noticed that when i feel like


---------10:41----------
i've just noticed this weird pattern in


---------10:42----------
my own life that when i think i know


---------10:44----------
something and i'm like


---------10:45----------
ah now the wisdom of dr k will transform


---------10:47----------
you


---------10:48----------
life comes and just [ __ ] slaps me


---------10:51----------
it's like uh dr k get back in your place


---------10:54----------
listen to what they're saying because


---------10:55----------
they don't seem to be ready for it yet


---------10:56----------
and it's like okay fine


---------10:58----------
i'll take it let me just follow her


---------11:01----------
where she wants to go and the perfect


---------11:03----------
meditation is for another day


---------11:05----------
you guys notice that like how bizarre it


---------11:07----------
is that i don't usually say that


---------11:10----------
usually i'm struggling to find something


---------11:12----------
and today i have the perfect one


---------11:14----------
and jabaided is absolutely right


---------11:17----------
and so we learn these lessons like i get


---------11:19----------
taught these lessons continuously and


---------11:20----------
you guys should take away this lesson


---------11:22----------
too


---------11:22----------
which is that if you're attached to a


---------11:24----------
particular thing that is the answer to


---------11:26----------
all of your problems


---------11:27----------
chances are it's not the answer to all


---------11:28----------
your problems the answer to all of your


---------11:30----------
problems is to take


---------11:32----------
second best get the silver medal every


---------11:34----------
single time or even the bronze like


---------11:36----------
who's complaining just go for it


---------11:42----------
right okay so that was the story
