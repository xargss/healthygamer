---------00:00----------
okay so I'm gonna read a couple of


---------00:01----------
questions okay and then we're gonna try


---------00:03----------
to talk about all of them together so


---------00:06----------
the first thing is can we talk about


---------00:08----------
fear how does it work I noticed fear


---------00:10----------
might be related to the subject


---------00:11----------
absolutely next question is I've dealt


---------00:15----------
with a feeling of apathy towards new


---------00:17----------
things and I want to do or try and when


---------00:20----------
I do start something I quickly lose


---------00:22----------
interest how do i combat this how do I


---------00:26----------
tell if I'm truly unhappy or just bored


---------00:29----------
or used to the way things being the way


---------00:31----------
they are and then this is kind of the


---------00:36----------
last question I'll kind of lump together


---------00:38----------
how do you get past coming up short with


---------00:41----------
everything in your life I'm 26


---------00:44----------
dropped out of college at a good


---------00:46----------
university with one semester left we


---------00:48----------
decided to start a successful business


---------00:49----------
and I'm now debating on selling my


---------00:51----------
shares to my friend and business partner


---------00:53----------
with nothing lined up after one year


---------00:55----------
it's the slow season I haven't left my


---------00:57----------
house in two weeks video games bla bla


---------00:59----------
bla bla okay so how do you get past


---------01:01----------
coming up short in life how do you deal


---------01:03----------
with fear how do you function if you've


---------01:05----------
developed apathy towards something how


---------01:09----------
do you tell if you're unhappy or just


---------01:10----------
bored or used to the way things are so


---------01:14----------
these are all great questions and


---------01:15----------
there's just like a common theme here


---------01:17----------
and I'm gonna have to think about how to


---------01:19----------
piece this stuff together okay so what


---------01:29----------
what gets us to do stuff in life like


---------01:33----------
that's the common question right you


---------01:35----------
have this like idea of something that


---------01:37----------
you want to do and like how do you


---------01:39----------
actually do that thing like you say that


---------01:43----------
okay like I'm I'm enjoyment doesn't move


---------01:46----------
me forward I've gotten used to things


---------01:48----------
I've become apathetic about stuff


---------01:51----------
I don't want to move forward because I'm


---------01:54----------
afraid I don't want to move forward


---------01:56----------
because I regret and the answer is like


---------02:01----------
yes


---------02:02----------
yes all of that is true so the first


---------02:05----------
thing to understand is that moving


---------02:08----------
forward in life is like going to be an


---------02:10----------
individual exploration


---------02:12----------
right that like you guys can come on


---------02:14----------
stream and like I can try to answer


---------02:15----------
these questions and I do answer these


---------02:17----------
questions but that at the end of the day


---------02:20----------
like you're gonna have to do actual


---------02:22----------
reflection to figure out what is getting


---------02:25----------
in your way


---------02:27----------
so generally speaking so I'm gonna just


---------02:31----------
address one part of this right because


---------02:33----------
there are a couple of questions about


---------02:35----------
you know feeling apathy towards a new


---------02:37----------
stuff getting bored or getting used to


---------02:39----------
things so I want you guys to understand


---------02:43----------
that one of the things that motivates


---------02:45----------
human beings is the satisfaction of


---------02:47----------
desires okay so like if I want to eat


---------02:51----------
like let's say I'm hungry and I want to


---------02:53----------
eat a hamburger I have a desire


---------02:57----------
I eat the hamburger and then the desire


---------03:00----------
from the for the hamburger is satisfied


---------03:02----------
and once the desire for the hamburger is


---------03:05----------
satisfied


---------03:06----------
there's nothing motivating me to like


---------03:08----------
continue eating like sort of makes like


---------03:10----------
it sounds kind of simple and duh but


---------03:12----------
like just think about that for a second


---------03:14----------
so anytime you're motivated by the


---------03:21----------
satisfaction of a particular desire that


---------03:23----------
motivation is not going to last you'll


---------03:25----------
end up in apathy you'll end up being


---------03:27----------
bored you'll end up being used to things


---------03:29----------
if you're looking for like the


---------03:31----------
satisfaction of a particular desire then


---------03:35----------
you're gonna end up being bored or


---------03:37----------
apathetic and it's not a sustainable way


---------03:39----------
to build your life but the interesting


---------03:41----------
thing is that's how we do structure our


---------03:43----------
lives right we tend to think that like


---------03:46----------
the way for me to move forward is by


---------03:48----------
like satisfying my desires by striving


---------03:50----------
for things whether it be a hamburger or


---------03:52----------
graduating from college or like to get


---------03:54----------
something external


---------03:57----------
so there's another kind of motivation


---------03:59----------
which doesn't come from the external


---------04:00----------
world so desires come from the external


---------04:03----------
world the roots of desires are actually


---------04:05----------
the indriyas or the sense organs and we


---------04:08----------
can debate about this if you guys want


---------04:10----------
to but if you think about basically


---------04:12----------
anything in there I've talked about this


---------04:14----------
before on streams but if your source of


---------04:17----------
motivation is the external world once


---------04:19----------
the external world is satisfied or


---------04:22----------
unsatisfied your motivation is going to


---------04:24----------
go away because it's dependent on


---------04:26----------
something external so fundamentally you


---------04:29----------
don't get the option to control like


---------04:32----------
what you're doing because your


---------04:33----------
motivation comes from the outside so the


---------04:36----------
key here is to understand that like


---------04:38----------
motivation can come from the inside as


---------04:40----------
well not just from the satisfaction of


---------04:42----------
an like a desire by an external thing


---------04:44----------
and there are even a lot of things that


---------04:47----------
we think are going to be like that we


---------04:49----------
think of as internal like let's say I'm


---------04:51----------
attracted to someone and I like want


---------04:53----------
them to be in in my life in some


---------04:57----------
substantial way like I want them to be


---------04:58----------
my girlfriend or a boyfriend or whatever


---------05:00----------
and so I like I'm drawn to that external


---------05:02----------
thing and


---------05:04----------
let's say that I asked them out and they


---------05:06----------
say yes and we enter a relationship and


---------05:08----------
it's like going great for a while and


---------05:09----------
like sometimes you get bored of it right


---------05:11----------
like you become apathetic and that's


---------05:14----------
because the thing that is going to


---------05:16----------
sustain a relationship is not the


---------05:18----------
original desire for the relationship


---------05:20----------
it's like if I think someone is hot and


---------05:22----------
I like I want to get with them like once


---------05:24----------
I get with them then I'm going to get


---------05:26----------
bored because the satisfy it's the


---------05:28----------
satisfaction of an external desire the


---------05:30----------
things that sustain relationships are


---------05:32----------
different right it's sort of like this


---------05:34----------
sense of like it's not a specific


---------05:37----------
external thing it's I mean so I think


---------05:39----------
the best thing about being in a


---------05:40----------
committed relationship is that you've


---------05:41----------
got someone in your corner


---------05:43----------
that's not like an external thing you


---------05:46----------
don't like look at someone on the street


---------05:47----------
and you say like oh man like I want that


---------05:49----------
person to be in my corner like that's


---------05:52----------
not how a desire works that's not really


---------05:53----------
a desire you can say I want to sleep


---------05:55----------
with that person I want to make out with


---------05:57----------
that person I want to walk into my


---------06:00----------
office Christmas party with that person


---------06:01----------
on my arm those are all desires


---------06:05----------
but if you want to create sustained


---------06:08----------
enjoyment or motivation in life it has


---------06:10----------
to come from within and I don't mean


---------06:12----------
that in like a yoga hippy kind of like


---------06:14----------
Oprah sort of way like you have to find


---------06:16----------
the answer within I mean like literally


---------06:18----------
there are things that that pull you


---------06:20----------
forward in life and some of those things


---------06:22----------
are external and some of those things


---------06:23----------
are internal because when it comes to


---------06:26----------
creating something meaningful in life it


---------06:28----------
requires sacrifice and the problem is


---------06:31----------
that most desires are not enough to


---------06:34----------
garner sacrifice


---------06:36----------
if we talk if we think about Derek and


---------06:38----------
other people on stream like the reason


---------06:40----------
that they grow is because they go within


---------06:42----------
and they do the hard thing they talk


---------06:45----------
about the hard thing they deal with the


---------06:46----------
hard feelings and if you guys were


---------06:49----------
watching today like you'd see Derek do


---------06:50----------
it like go back and watch the vaad and


---------06:52----------
you'll see there are lots of moments


---------06:54----------
where he's at the fork in the road and I


---------06:55----------
tell him hey man we can go there or we


---------06:57----------
can not go there


---------06:58----------
and he chooses to go there so he chooses


---------07:02----------
to dive in word and so if you're getting


---------07:06----------
bored in life if you're feeling


---------07:08----------
apathetic chances are it's because


---------07:09----------
you're you're living a life of


---------07:10----------
satisfaction of desires and once you


---------07:13----------
satisfy a desire it goes away for a


---------07:15----------
while and then it returns again it


---------07:17----------
doesn't leave you satisfied forever and


---------07:19----------
so if you want to find a way to like


---------07:22----------
move forward in a sustainable way to


---------07:23----------
find like real motivation that causes


---------07:26----------
you to - you know sacrifice things and


---------07:29----------
give up things and do make the harder


---------07:31----------
choice to close out of the video game


---------07:33----------
when it's time to go to bed you have to


---------07:35----------
have a good [ __ ] reason it's not a


---------07:37----------
desire it's like an internal driver


---------07:40----------
so in my case like you know I you know


---------07:42----------
I'm lazy like I've I keep on saying this


---------07:45----------
on stream I don't think people like


---------07:46----------
believe me but I'm lazy like I'm really


---------07:47----------
lazy but I get out of bed every morning


---------07:51----------
I get out of bed every morning at the


---------07:52----------
latest possible minute like I should


---------07:55----------
wake up an hour earlier and work out but


---------07:57----------
I just I'm [ __ ] lazy so why do I get


---------08:00----------
out of bed it's because I have an


---------08:01----------
appointment and someone's gonna show up


---------08:02----------
at my office and I care about that


---------08:04----------
person and like because I care about


---------08:07----------
that person and like Jack I'm genuinely


---------08:09----------
invested in them I have to get my ass


---------08:11----------
out of bed I don't care about my son


---------08:14----------
myself


---------08:16----------
so I don't wake up and like work out and


---------08:19----------
stuff because those are the things that


---------08:20----------
I kind of want for myself but I actually


---------08:21----------
do care about that person


---------08:23----------
right so that can motivate so what I


---------08:28----------
want you guys to understand is like


---------08:29----------
start by thinking a little bit about you


---------08:32----------
know what are the things that


---------08:38----------
okay


---------08:50----------
okay so start by understanding like what


---------08:54----------
about you is being motivated by


---------08:55----------
something external and what about you is


---------08:58----------
being motivated by something internal


---------08:59----------
and chances are


---------09:02----------
for those of you who are apathetic and


---------09:05----------
bored your motivation is an internal


---------09:07----------
it's something it's coming from the


---------09:08----------
external world
