---------00:00----------
so the first thing is that I think the


---------00:02----------
biggest problem is that we were led to


---------00:04----------
believe something that is actually


---------00:05----------
incorrect and so I think the real


---------00:08----------
challenge here is that we've had to


---------00:09----------
figure out and I don't think anyone has


---------00:11----------
really I mean we're doing this but I


---------00:14----------
don't think anyone has I don't think


---------00:16----------
many people stop and really think a


---------00:18----------
little bit about the fact that we have


---------00:20----------
to find our own way forward in this


---------00:22----------
we're not going to find an answer from


---------00:24----------
somewhere else because those answers


---------00:26----------
just don't work anymore


---------00:35----------
why don't we start to somebody want to


---------00:38----------
just tell us a little bit about who you


---------00:40----------
are and and what we can help you with


---------00:42----------
today on stream like what you go by who


---------00:48----------
wants to start okay I'll start


---------00:51----------
I basically volunteer okay I'm straight


---------00:56----------
cut okay I'm very nervous because I have


---------01:00----------
social anxiety so this is rough for me


---------01:04----------
to say the least


---------01:05----------
yeah well props for you for being here


---------01:08----------
and in social anxiety can be crippling


---------01:09----------
and terrifying yeah definitely so we'll


---------01:13----------
we'll see if we can sort of think about


---------01:17----------
that as we kind of continue and just pay


---------01:20----------
attention to what your social anxiety is


---------01:21----------
doing we'll see if we can help so


---------01:24----------

---------01:29----------

---------01:55----------
keep going with introductions okay I


---------01:58----------
guess I can go so mimes ill so like I


---------02:04----------
think I'm like a tumor because when I


---------02:06----------
did like read about read up about


---------02:08----------
Buddhism I learned about mu within Zen


---------02:11----------
Buddhism and talks about like nothing


---------02:13----------
and like that kind of sort of like


---------02:16----------
changed my perspective on things and so


---------02:18----------
like nothing is there I always say like


---------02:20----------
nothing is everything everything is


---------02:21----------
nothing okay and I always have like


---------02:23----------
other problems like sort of like bubble


---------02:26----------
up as a as it relates to being a Doomer


---------02:29----------
so okay I'm interested just to like


---------02:32----------
learn about things today okay awesome


---------02:34----------
and welcome Zil can you tell us a little


---------02:37----------
bit okay I'm just a little bit curious


---------02:38----------
what kind of other bobble Bobble


---------02:40----------
problems do you think bubble up from mu


---------02:45----------
yeah so like my my relation to friends


---------02:48----------
like I I don't I don't see myself as


---------02:53----------
having like a best friend okay and like


---------02:56----------
saw relationships I always like I I feel


---------03:00----------
like as if because I don't need to have


---------03:03----------
like a special someone I treat everyone


---------03:05----------
sort of like as special like everyone is


---------03:08----------
special to me it's type of deal right


---------03:10----------
okay and it's like a certain way it's a


---------03:13----------
it's a weird thing that like that I have


---------03:15----------
to like think about but yeah and that


---------03:17----------
ice you that makes you a du mer well


---------03:21----------
it's like I can't have like a special


---------03:23----------
someone right like like though like the


---------03:25----------
one I feel like you know because I'm a


---------03:28----------

---------03:30----------
everyone as special no no one person can


---------03:33----------
be special yeah okay okay that's helpful


---------03:37----------
thank you very much for explaining that


---------03:39----------
let's get the other the remaining two


---------03:43----------
people can you please introduce yourself


---------03:44----------
yeah I'm an SE at sama do me because


---------03:48----------
many aspects in life I feel like I'm


---------03:51----------
doomed to fail like education


---------03:53----------
relationship I'm isolated quite alone


---------03:57----------
most of the time stuff like that I'll


---------03:59----------
say okay social anxiety and depression a


---------04:01----------
lot of the time so yeah it all feeds


---------04:05----------
into a feeling of isolation and


---------04:07----------
hopelessness okay a lot of thinking that


---------04:10----------
in the near future I'll probably be just


---------04:13----------
the lone sort of in the near future just


---------04:19----------
in the future in general okay I I may


---------04:27----------
ask a little bit more about why I use


---------04:29----------
the word near there for a second but we


---------04:31----------
can you know thanks for introducing


---------04:32----------
yourself in Aussie and I think we have


---------04:35----------
one more introduction hi so I go by


---------04:39----------
Lotus I was also monitored as a Doomer


---------04:44----------
so that's why I've been invited onto the


---------04:46----------
stream today okay um I guess my main


---------04:49----------
thing and why I would actually kind of


---------04:51----------
associate with being a dimmer and it's


---------04:52----------
that


---------04:53----------
I've I'm still fairly young I'm 21 but


---------04:57----------
I've a seemingly failed over and over


---------04:59----------
again


---------04:59----------
ever since my senior years in high


---------05:02----------
school where it's just kind of I stopped


---------05:05----------
giving a [ __ ] about a lot of things in


---------05:07----------
life and I even told myself that over


---------05:09----------
and over again until it clearly became


---------05:11----------
apparent that that I can't live with


---------05:13----------
that attitude as a cook or going into


---------05:17----------
higher education which I actually fully


---------05:19----------
was drew from last term okay okay so


---------05:23----------
thanks a lot for sharing that intro


---------05:26----------
Lotus so let's just start with with this


---------05:29----------
because I'm you know I'm behind the


---------05:31----------
times so what's a Doomer mmm Zil what


---------05:38----------
you got okay your time out this earlier


---------05:41----------
we're trying to pin this one down with


---------05:42----------
Moses and it was tough it's a tough one


---------05:44----------
yeah so I guess like my like there's a


---------05:48----------
video on a Doomer and like I resonate


---------05:51----------
with it and in the video it said like


---------05:53----------
for adieu Marie right they believe like


---------05:55----------
all the external [ __ ] like like their


---------05:57----------
walls gonna [ __ ] and so therefore it's


---------05:59----------
like why like we're gonna suffer no


---------06:03----------
matter what because like the world is


---------06:04----------
[ __ ] and like we have to contrast and do


---------06:07----------
it with like the Boomer it's like the


---------06:08----------
Boomers like oh like if the world's


---------06:11----------
gonna [ __ ] right pull yourself up by the


---------06:12----------
bootstraps whereas the doom would be


---------06:14----------
like no you [ __ ] y'all [ __ ] it up for


---------06:17----------
us like what can we do now so like


---------06:19----------
that's sort of like there's like


---------06:21----------
external factors that sort of like


---------06:23----------
influence the way that we sort of like


---------06:25----------
be in the world I think there's like I


---------06:29----------
think there's a dichotomy between like


---------06:30----------
the way that boomers a boomers are


---------06:33----------
basically just modernism and then do


---------06:35----------
Murs are post-modernism I think is the


---------06:37----------
best way to look at it what does that


---------06:39----------
mean


---------06:39----------
meaning like this idea of truth with


---------06:43----------
like boomers saw you have to work for


---------06:47----------
truth and you have to you have to sort


---------06:49----------
of find your own variant of that and


---------06:51----------
then I think do Murs basically


---------06:53----------
acknowledge that there really isn't any


---------06:55----------
and your everything is kind of


---------06:57----------
meaningless and


---------06:59----------
that affects a lot of people in our


---------07:01----------
generation I think it affects most of


---------07:02----------
our generation like my generation being


---------07:05----------
like I don't know like 18 but like 25


---------07:07----------
kind of in that span but it affects some


---------07:11----------
people I think negatively because they


---------07:12----------
have other [ __ ] and their past or they


---------07:14----------
have things are dealing with


---------07:15----------
psychologically that make that lack of


---------07:18----------
meaning really oppressive to them


---------07:21----------
okay so man so you guys know I touch my


---------07:27----------
face a lot when I'm streaming because I


---------07:29----------
think and I have to stop touching my


---------07:31----------
face because of kovat it's a very hard


---------07:35----------
okay so so I'm just trying to understand


---------07:38----------
is so first of all like anyone else on


---------07:40----------
the call I want to add what they believe


---------07:43----------
a Doomer is or do you guys think we've


---------07:45----------
sort of captured it no I think it's


---------07:49----------
about right okay


---------07:52----------
stray cat do you sort of identify with


---------07:54----------
certain features of what people have


---------07:55----------
been talking about definitely like just


---------07:59----------
lack of direction and just lack of


---------08:03----------
meaning really okay all right so let me


---------08:09----------
I understand this okay so the world so


---------08:14----------
and then we're gonna start to like


---------08:16----------
understand a little bit about how this


---------08:18----------
stuff works so let's just try to


---------08:19----------
understand the relationship between


---------08:20----------
different pieces the first is that the


---------08:23----------
assumption that the world is [ __ ]


---------08:24----------
right that's like where this starts from


---------08:27----------
and and so what I'm hearing is that like


---------08:31----------
since the world is [ __ ] that's what


---------08:33----------
leads to suffering or the stuff like


---------08:36----------
where does how does suffering relate to


---------08:38----------
the status of the world for you guys


---------08:42----------
like when you think about your life


---------08:44----------
where does your suffering come from does


---------08:46----------
it come from


---------08:47----------
your circumstances and that your


---------08:50----------
circumstances are unchangeable that's a


---------08:56----------
tough question I think I tend to put a


---------08:58----------
lot of my suffering on myself like they


---------09:01----------
were it was my responsibility I'm not


---------09:04----------
sure if that's a Doomer thing or a me


---------09:07----------
thing you know so let's think about that


---------09:09----------
right so I'm gonna just point out what I


---------09:11----------
heard from you guys that the world is


---------09:12----------
[ __ ] and therefore they're suffering or


---------09:15----------
there's some tie between you know when


---------09:18----------
you guys were talking about a boom or a


---------09:19----------
Boomer believes that in spite of


---------09:21----------
circumstances it is possible to continue


---------09:24----------
to achieve by lifting yourself up


---------09:27----------
through your bootstraps right so like


---------09:28----------
what you're capable of as an individual


---------09:31----------
outweighs what the world the challenges


---------09:35----------
the world offers so you can overcome


---------09:37----------
challenges


---------09:38----------
whereas what I'm hearing is different


---------09:40----------
about a Doomer is that you don't like


---------09:43----------
it's kind of assumed that like there's


---------09:44----------
gonna be like you're you're kind of


---------09:46----------
hopeless and there's nothing you can do


---------09:47----------
because the world is going to hell in a


---------09:49----------
handbasket and and so I'm still a little


---------09:52----------
bit confused does that mean that the


---------09:53----------
suffering comes from the world because


---------09:55----------
it's so bleak that no matter what you do


---------09:58----------
the world is like you're just not going


---------10:00----------
to be successful


---------10:02----------
so in roons case he sort of places a lot


---------10:05----------
of the blame on himself but I think that


---------10:08----------
lack of success is inevitable just the


---------10:10----------
same way but okay fine


---------10:13----------
inevitable sure but why is it inevitable


---------10:15----------
I'm curious what other people say who


---------10:17----------
think like or do you guys think that


---------10:19----------
your failures because the world basic


---------10:23----------
is screwed or do you blame yourselves


---------10:26----------
definitely play myself more than the


---------10:28----------
world okay so if I think I was another


---------10:35----------
person


---------10:36----------
I think I'd succeed in a lot of


---------10:39----------
different aspects better than I


---------10:40----------
currently do okay with like being on


---------10:46----------
myself but I think a lot of that is the


---------10:49----------
social anxiety like I know I shouldn't


---------10:52----------
blame myself for social anxiety but I


---------10:55----------
feel like people like me


---------10:57----------
aren't treated well like stigma is a


---------11:00----------
huge thing with people with mental


---------11:02----------
illness and I feel like if I went out


---------11:05----------
and tried a lot of people wouldn't look


---------11:08----------
at it very fairly okay um this may sound


---------11:13----------
like a silly question stray cat but why


---------11:15----------
shouldn't you blame yourself for having


---------11:16----------
social anxiety uh because it's not


---------11:20----------
really part of who I am or what I am


---------11:23----------
doing to myself maybe okay so it's


---------11:26----------
something that's outside of your control


---------11:28----------
it's not a choice yeah okay and and zil


---------11:33----------
what do you think do you blame yourself


---------11:34----------
for your situation in life or do you


---------11:36----------
blame the outside world it's complicated


---------11:40----------
because it's like yeah I recognize that


---------11:42----------
it's the outside world that's so it's


---------11:45----------
like there are these variables that you


---------11:48----------
can't they're like independent that you


---------11:50----------
can't influence but I can't influence


---------11:53----------
the relation to those variables but


---------11:55----------
despite of that relationship is always


---------11:57----------
feel as if there's always like something


---------11:59----------
pushing me down so that's why I feel as


---------12:01----------
if it's like kind of both external but


---------12:05----------
also like I could have done something


---------12:06----------
but something just pushes me down so I


---------12:08----------
can't okay I'm really curious to how


---------12:12----------
many people feel like like Zil they can


---------12:14----------
relate to Zil saying like when you try


---------12:16----------
something pushes you down yeah


---------12:21----------
definitely yeah yeah I agree that I feel


---------12:25----------
like I'm just pushing myself down and


---------12:27----------
that's why I kept feeling okay yeah I


---------12:30----------
mean I think


---------12:30----------
out of everything that you guys have


---------12:32----------
said I think the image of you trying and


---------12:35----------
being knocked down again and again and


---------12:38----------
again is sort of like what I'm feeling


---------12:39----------
the most from is is that how you feel


---------12:44----------
yeah and so what what is it that knocks


---------12:48----------
you down usually it's different every


---------12:52----------
time


---------12:54----------
it's complicated pretty quickly okay


---------12:57----------
does somebody want to share an example


---------12:59----------
of you know when they tried to do


---------13:02----------
something and how life cut yeah actually


---------13:09----------
I'm gonna go I tried doing therapy


---------13:13----------
multiple times like different therapists


---------13:16----------
I don't know if you know Sara P works in


---------13:18----------
Canada it's free like but it's not the


---------13:21----------
best if you're not paying you basically


---------13:24----------
just get chosen someone and you have to


---------13:30----------
wait like months between and yeah I


---------13:34----------
tried like I think with almost ten


---------13:37----------
different therapists oh my god and yeah


---------13:40----------
I kept trying and trying and I don't


---------13:43----------
know like no one really helped or like a


---------13:47----------
lot of them didn't even do anything for


---------13:49----------
me they just told me to go on drugs


---------13:52----------
interesting


---------13:55----------
so I think that's a great example of you


---------13:57----------
like really gave it you know ten chances


---------14:00----------
like ten tries salata tries right that's


---------14:05----------
that's not like giving up after like you


---------14:07----------
know something doesn't go your way once


---------14:09----------
like ten is a lot and and for all ten of


---------14:11----------
those experiences it sounds like all of


---------14:14----------
them were were not really helpful uh I


---------14:17----------
did find one and she was a good


---------14:19----------
therapist but she stopped practicing


---------14:22----------
so that's Doomer right there okay you


---------14:27----------
find the one person that can help you


---------14:29----------
and they're like yeah I'm quitting okay


---------14:32----------
yeah I mean that makes sense right so


---------14:34----------
it's like when when you I think it like


---------14:37----------
Zil was saying like when you try to make


---------14:38----------
a change in your life life sort of says


---------14:41----------
[ __ ] you


---------14:43----------
and then no yeah and then pushes you


---------14:47----------
back down okay that was very helpful


---------14:48----------
does anybody else want to share like an


---------14:51----------
experience where they tried to you know


---------14:53----------
move forward in life and in life kind of


---------14:56----------
didn't let that happen I think mine a


---------15:01----------
big one for me is like education okay


---------15:05----------
I ever since school it's always been 40


---------15:09----------
percent 50 percents no matter how hard I


---------15:11----------
try study and stuff like that and I just


---------15:15----------
keep failing really and when I go sit


---------15:18----------
down to study I struggle to study


---------15:20----------
because just for many reasons really and


---------15:24----------
I just feel hopeless and sometimes it


---------15:26----------
just results in may not trying in some


---------15:29----------
cases okay cuz what the outcomes gonna


---------15:33----------
be already I just don't ever do well you


---------15:36----------
know what the outcome is gonna be


---------15:37----------
already yeah how many of you feel like


---------15:41----------
when you when you think about trying


---------15:43----------
something you know what the outcome is


---------15:45----------
gonna be


---------15:46----------
yeah what do you mean by rehearse it in


---------15:54----------
your head like I feel like I go through


---------15:58----------
scenarios like of what's gonna happen


---------16:00----------
before it actually happens okay you guys


---------16:06----------
do that yeah


---------16:08----------
yeah I like running simulations China's


---------16:11----------
like like models right in your head yeah


---------16:13----------
like your brains like a computer so you


---------16:14----------
run models and try figure out what's


---------16:16----------
gonna happen


---------16:17----------
okay


---------16:25----------
effect if any does running those


---------16:28----------
computer simulation models have in your


---------16:30----------
mind it's never a good one what what


---------16:37----------
effect is it what's something I'm trying


---------16:40----------
to prepare for whatever is gonna happen


---------16:42----------
but I end up just making myself anxious


---------16:46----------
and nervous and not wanting to do it


---------16:50----------
okay


---------16:51----------
so it sounds like the more simulations


---------16:53----------
you run you've noticed a correlation


---------16:56----------
between the more simulations you run the


---------16:58----------
worse you perform yeah what do you guys


---------17:02----------
think yeah I think it just justifies it


---------17:09----------
makes you scared of what you're gonna do


---------17:11----------
before it happens and then it sort of


---------17:14----------
becomes true because of that it becomes


---------17:17----------
a self-fulfilling prophecy yeah you know


---------17:20----------
okay so you're you're telling me and I


---------17:25----------
see that the that the more you kind of


---------17:28----------
think about things it's sort of full it


---------17:30----------
becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy so


---------17:32----------
it's almost like your failure is


---------17:34----------
inevitable like the more you worry about


---------17:36----------
it yeah guys agree or disagree I agree


---------17:43----------
yeah yeah okay yeah like that that


---------17:48----------
framing like I can agree with and like I


---------17:51----------
resonate a lot with the with a nasty is


---------17:54----------
like trying like I'm always sort of like


---------17:57----------
trying right I like and I tried it sort


---------18:00----------
of like don't have an expectations just


---------18:01----------
try and see if it works or not but it's


---------18:04----------
always like life [ __ ] slaps me in the


---------18:06----------
face whenever I try it's like nope


---------18:09----------
like there's this variable that you


---------18:10----------
didn't count for even though you tried


---------18:12----------
you're [ __ ] out of luck


---------18:14----------
does life feel abusive to you guys it


---------18:20----------
can like I'm empty like do you guys does


---------18:28----------
it feel to you like life is almost like


---------18:30----------
a malicious force specifically I think


---------18:35----------
it feels like there's a certain


---------18:36----------
idealistic version of what I would


---------18:39----------
really like and then there's a like a


---------18:42----------
huge difference between what I would


---------18:45----------
like and what I want to achieve versus


---------18:46----------
what I'm actually living and in a way


---------18:48----------
that can kind of feel abusive as like


---------18:50----------
it's more extreme okay so a gap between


---------18:54----------
truth and fantasy a bit okay Anna sees a


---------18:59----------
has implications I don't like but maybe


---------19:01----------
that's kind of the point


---------19:03----------
the life that you want to achieve yeah


---------19:06----------
what would you call that


---------19:10----------
yeah fantasy I mean would you it sounds


---------19:13----------
like fantasy is not the right word no I


---------19:16----------
think I just said that so slightly


---------19:18----------
uncomfortable with the conversation but


---------19:19----------
that doesn't mean it's not the right


---------19:20----------
what connotation were you uncomfortable


---------19:22----------
the person kind of just living and some


---------19:29----------
conjured Disney World of theirs is that


---------19:32----------
make sense yeah sure is that what you do


---------19:34----------
no I don't think I do that completely


---------19:37----------
okay so it's not going to I think


---------19:38----------
everyone does it a little bit sure so it


---------19:40----------
sounds like fantasy is not the right


---------19:41----------
word so what is the right word rune


---------19:45----------
hmm I can't think of a better one huh so


---------19:51----------
let's let's help let's help roon out


---------19:53----------
like when you guys think about the life


---------19:55----------
that you could live do you do you think


---------19:58----------
fantasy is the right word or do you


---------20:00----------
think it's something else that's or to


---------20:03----------
call it a dream okay what do you mean by


---------20:07----------
dream is like a dream something that you


---------20:09----------
strive to achieve our dream is like the


---------20:11----------
state of consciousness when you go to


---------20:12----------
sleep and you can fly and you have the


---------20:15----------
head of a horse sawing I strive to


---------20:18----------
achieve but I feel in my case sewing


---------20:20----------
that I'll never have at the same time


---------20:23----------
okay so let's talk a little bit about


---------20:25----------
what is it that you guys want to achieve


---------20:28----------
what is that what is the world that you


---------20:31----------
want look like just living comfortably


---------20:36----------
with a comfortable job and people that


---------20:39----------
you know around you okay what is living


---------20:43----------
comfortably me mean you know worry about


---------20:47----------
stuff like finances or so financials get


---------20:52----------
ya rid yourself of worries in general


---------20:55----------
rid yourself of worries what other


---------20:59----------
worries are there just like anxiety


---------21:04----------
going to places stuff like that anxiety


---------21:07----------
going to places what else I'd say


---------21:11----------
depression is part of that what does


---------21:15----------
that mean depression can you help us


---------21:17----------
understand that and I see just feeling


---------21:20----------
down a little the time and I guess


---------21:24----------
isolated in my case as well okay I enjoy


---------21:27----------
being with others a lot of the time but


---------21:30----------
I don't really get that opportunity what


---------21:32----------
keeps you from having that opportunity


---------21:34----------
oh I would probably say other people


---------21:39----------
have left me but I know for sure it's


---------21:41----------
just me not going out of my own way to


---------21:44----------
meet people and stuff like that


---------21:50----------
can anybody help me understand what an


---------21:52----------
Aussie just said he said I I would say


---------21:56----------
that it's other people leaving me but I


---------21:59----------
know for sure it's it's me not going out


---------22:02----------
of my way


---------22:02----------
so like I'm confused about who's


---------22:04----------
responsible for his situation what do


---------22:09----------
you guys think so fear of putting


---------22:11----------
yourself out and being vulnerable with


---------22:15----------
other people okay what do you guys think


---------22:19----------
about other people leaving him does that


---------22:26----------
happen to you


---------22:27----------
okay confused on what the thing about


---------22:30----------
that because in high school I had to


---------22:32----------
leave one of my best friends to then


---------22:35----------
sort of join my other best friend I was


---------22:38----------
sort of like in a group of friends and I


---------22:40----------
was the kid in the middle and I had to


---------22:42----------
choose one or the other


---------22:42----------
hmm and how did you choose well the


---------22:49----------
reason they split up in the first place


---------22:50----------
was that one of them was kind of being


---------22:54----------
an [ __ ] so then I had a friend just


---------22:58----------
stopped hanging out with both of us


---------22:59----------
right so I had to figure out why that


---------23:01----------
happened in the first place okay and


---------23:03----------
then when he told me that I thought


---------23:08----------
about it for a weekend didn't I really


---------23:10----------
tell anyone I don't really tell either


---------23:11----------
of them like what the what to do about


---------23:14----------
this but um I ended up sticking with the


---------23:18----------
other friends he felt like he was being


---------23:21----------
treated poorly okay and then a few years


---------23:24----------
later he ended up ditching me in return


---------23:26----------
so a few years later he ended up


---------23:30----------
ditching you yeah he was dealing with a


---------23:35----------
lot of health issues of his own huh


---------23:39----------
okay so so what do you think is the


---------23:43----------
reason he ditched you


---------23:49----------
he mentioned loyalty which felt like a


---------23:52----------
very sort of fabricated Astra to me at


---------23:55----------
the time I feel like it wasn't the


---------23:56----------
complete truth okay do you feel like you


---------24:01----------
made the wrong choice in terms of who


---------24:02----------
you went with in terms of friendship I


---------24:05----------
don't but I feel like you ended up being


---------24:10----------
something that was slightly out of my


---------24:12----------
control


---------24:12----------
and I could have known like at the time


---------24:19----------
I don't think I could have done anything


---------24:20----------
to sort of change the circumstances sure


---------24:26----------
so I have a couple of questions for you


---------24:28----------
guys okay this is gonna sound kind of


---------24:30----------
weird so the first question is how much


---------24:31----------
sense do you think the other people in


---------24:35----------
this chat or making I think a lot


---------24:41----------
because I've had similar situations too


---------24:44----------
and so like I I think I can understand


---------24:49----------
where they're coming from I don't know


---------24:51----------
for sure but like a lot of the things


---------24:53----------
that they're describing has happened to


---------24:54----------
me so I say it like the moving from one


---------24:57----------
friend group to another because the one


---------24:59----------
friend was being an [ __ ] yeah what do


---------25:05----------
other people think do you think the


---------25:07----------
other people miss chatter kind of like


---------25:08----------
if you don't I mean if you think they're


---------25:10----------
not making sense please say so it's like


---------25:11----------
I'm not trying to frame the question for


---------25:13----------
a particular answer I'm just curious


---------25:15----------
about what y'all's


---------25:16----------
senses of whether other people are


---------25:18----------
making sense I feel like there's a lot


---------25:21----------
more that is not being said to whatever


---------25:24----------
they're saying like there's a lot of


---------25:26----------
underneath that is being kind of like


---------25:29----------
broached on through subtext and that's


---------25:30----------
it can you help me understand what the


---------25:33----------
subtext is root


---------25:38----------
I mean enough for other people for


---------25:40----------
yourself like what you're reading so


---------25:43----------
you're feeling something you're reading


---------25:44----------
something right so let's let's bring it


---------25:46----------
from subtext to like text hmm I think I


---------25:52----------
think it's just there's like this


---------25:54----------
unanimous feeling of isolation between


---------25:57----------
all of us okay


---------26:02----------
well set what do you guys think yeah


---------26:05----------
100% 100% okay so this is kind of


---------26:13----------
interesting right so my can I just share


---------26:15----------
a couple of thoughts and like you guys


---------26:17----------
have to you know guide me from here so


---------26:20----------
my first thought is that I was expecting


---------26:22----------
a bunch of people who were like I don't


---------26:25----------
know like do MERS like you guys don't


---------26:27----------
seem like do mercy like I had this idea


---------26:29----------
of a tumor as someone who is like you


---------26:31----------
know just full of cognitive bias and


---------26:34----------
like just has a view of the world that


---------26:36----------
is really really like miss shapen right


---------26:40----------
who just like thinks like like I was


---------26:41----------
expecting someone who's not gonna make


---------26:44----------
sense basically so I have this


---------26:47----------
particular view of the world and you


---------26:49----------
know I'm confident in my view of the


---------26:50----------
world and I understand it's not everyone


---------26:52----------
else's view of the world but the first


---------26:54----------
thing that I was shocked by is like how


---------26:56----------
actually like legitimate all of your


---------26:58----------
perspectives are and and I think that


---------27:02----------
you know even in as we start to like


---------27:05----------
pick things apart a little bit


---------27:07----------
I'm also very surprised and frankly


---------27:09----------
impressed by how much you guys are


---------27:11----------
willing to question some assumptions or


---------27:13----------
even Express confusion about something


---------27:17----------
that I think is actually really really


---------27:18----------
hopeful so I'll give you guys just an


---------27:21----------
example like so you know it started out


---------27:23----------
with the definition of a tumor which is


---------27:25----------
like anytime you try something the world


---------27:28----------
is a [ __ ] place so you're you're


---------27:30----------
destined to suffer but when I asked you


---------27:33----------
guys where is the origin of suffer


---------27:34----------
suffering is it because the world is


---------27:36----------
going to [ __ ] or is it your fault like


---------27:38----------
each of you is giving me sort of nuanced


---------27:40----------
and complex answers right like it's


---------27:44----------
actually kind of I mean it sort of makes


---------27:46----------
sense like if we just take what stray


---------27:48----------
cat said about therapy for example like


---------27:50----------
if you've


---------27:51----------
tried to see ten therapists and only one


---------27:54----------
of them has been helpful and the one


---------27:56----------
that was helpful


---------27:57----------
quit like it's reasonable to think that


---------28:00----------
the world is kind of a [ __ ] place and


---------28:02----------
isn't gonna help you out does that make


---------28:04----------
sense like that's not it's not that's


---------28:07----------
not depression like sometimes I work


---------28:09----------
with people who are depressed and people


---------28:11----------
who are depressed don't see the world in


---------28:13----------
a correct way


---------28:14----------
right so they think like they think


---------28:16----------
thoughts like you know my family would


---------28:19----------
be better off like my kids would be


---------28:20----------
better off without me so I should kill


---------28:22----------
myself they think thoughts like that but


---------28:24----------
what I'm really surprised by and maybe


---------28:26----------
that's a little bit of what I was


---------28:27----------
expecting what I'm surprised by is


---------28:29----------
actually how rational all of your


---------28:31----------
thoughts are you know like it's a little


---------28:37----------
bit surprising and also that when I when


---------28:39----------
I challenge some of your thoughts that


---------28:40----------
you guys are able to kind of like look


---------28:42----------
at them as in kind of a new way and then


---------28:46----------
I also think it's really awesome that


---------28:48----------
that you know you guys have kind of the


---------28:50----------
subtext here is isolation so what would


---------28:54----------
you guys say that the core of your


---------28:55----------
problem is that you're isolated for me


---------28:58----------
yes yeah definitely feels that way yeah


---------29:03----------
so okay so so great so like have you


---------29:08----------
guys thought the core of your problem is


---------29:10----------
isolation like before today


---------29:15----------
it sort of fades into my I'll be home


---------29:19----------
alone in the future sort of doomed


---------29:22----------
mentality so what is the doomed


---------29:25----------
mentality and I see mine is just the I'm


---------29:30----------
set up to fill in a lot of aspects in


---------29:33----------
life and that in years to come I'll just


---------29:36----------
be in the same spot and won't achieve


---------29:37----------
anything okay so I want to I want you


---------29:41----------
guys to just think about that for a


---------29:42----------
second and notice what he's saying right


---------29:44----------
so this is exactly what I'm hearing from


---------29:45----------
y'all is that the problems are in every


---------29:48----------
dimension of your life that's the


---------29:50----------
initial frame that you're doomed in


---------29:52----------
everything and you guys we're talking


---------29:53----------
about I think in aa see you men should


---------29:55----------
like giving forty or fifty percent at


---------29:56----------
your best in terms of Education


---------29:59----------
yeah and that other people are sort of


---------30:02----------
like we're thinking about therapy we're


---------30:03----------
thinking about isolation we're thinking


---------30:05----------
about social anxiety we're thinking


---------30:07----------
about education we're thinking about


---------30:08----------
failure we're thinking about financial


---------30:10----------
security it's like every dimension of


---------30:12----------
your life is screwed yeah that's the way


---------30:15----------
you guys pitch it at the beginning


---------30:16----------
because I think that's the way that it


---------30:18----------
feels to you in your head that


---------30:20----------
everywhere you look around it's like the


---------30:22----------
world is a bleak place and that's what a


---------30:24----------
Doomer is everywhere you look there's


---------30:27----------
darkness but what I'm actually hearing


---------30:30----------
from you guys is that this isn't


---------30:32----------
actually like sixteen problems and part


---------30:35----------
of the reason that it can feel


---------30:36----------
overwhelming is because when you look


---------30:40----------
around and you see thirty problems that


---------30:42----------
is like literally overwhelming you can't


---------30:44----------
fix thirty things you can't get a job


---------30:47----------
and get an A and get a girlfriend and


---------30:49----------
make $100,000 a year you can't do all of


---------30:52----------
those things and so the other bizarre


---------30:54----------
thing about being a Doomer apparently is


---------30:56----------
that I think your feeling of over being


---------30:58----------
overwhelmed is not like an illness I


---------31:01----------
think it's just you look around and


---------31:03----------
every part of your life seems to be like


---------31:05----------
sort of empty and bleak so you're like


---------31:07----------
well [ __ ] where do I even start


---------31:10----------
that actually is logical it's not yeah


---------31:15----------
but the interesting go ahead so like I


---------31:19----------
think so when we were looking at like


---------31:22----------
what a dimmer is just like this video


---------31:24----------
that explains it and like that's very


---------31:26----------
much what the video said it's like it's


---------31:28----------
all logical things sort of like the


---------31:31----------
house essentially like we are today or


---------31:34----------
like how today was set up from the past


---------31:36----------
right so like everything like it's not I


---------31:40----------
agree that's like a lot of things it's


---------31:42----------
not necessarily like something else but


---------31:44----------
other things like kind of like the


---------31:47----------
perfect storm when you say it was a


---------31:49----------
perfect storm


---------31:49----------
it's like these sets of such like


---------31:52----------
circumstances created this right if this


---------31:55----------
is the external world yeah yeah so that


---------32:00----------
also like I I'm a little bit confused


---------32:02----------
about because when I asked you guys like


---------32:04----------
who is ultimately responsible so I


---------32:06----------
understand the framework that you all


---------32:08----------
have laid out


---------32:09----------
I understand everything that you guys


---------32:11----------
have I mean I think I do that


---------32:13----------
the external world is problematic and


---------32:14----------
stuff like that the problem is that when


---------32:16----------
I actually ask you guys about your life


---------32:19----------
what I hear is not that the rest of the


---------32:21----------
world is a complete mess and things like


---------32:23----------
that what I hear is that I'm


---------32:25----------
fundamentally isolated like that's


---------32:30----------
that's what I'm hearing first and


---------32:31----------
foremost and also I'm hearing that it's


---------32:33----------
not that the outside world's fault it's


---------32:35----------
like my fault


---------32:37----------
I'm gonna throw an idea here and


---------32:40----------
Rosario's everyone else here agrees but


---------32:42----------
it's not so much that like all the


---------32:45----------
previous events of my life have created


---------32:47----------
this moment where now the world's going


---------32:50----------
to [ __ ] me it's more like the previous


---------32:52----------
invent my life created me which can't


---------32:54----------
succeed a version of me that can't


---------32:56----------
succeed it was isolated yeah okay so


---------33:04----------
this is excellent right so this is good


---------33:05----------
now we're getting somewhere


---------33:06----------
so so the world has turned you into the


---------33:09----------
person that you are and the person that


---------33:11----------
you are is [ __ ] yeah basically is that


---------33:16----------
a du mer huh


---------33:22----------
in a way it is okay well so help me


---------33:27----------
understand stray cat in what way are we


---------33:29----------
what are we missing I think a lot of the


---------33:31----------
time people when they say boomer they


---------33:34----------
mean someone who like looks at society


---------33:36----------
is the issue and what we said but we


---------33:40----------
kind of flip that around didn't we yes


---------33:42----------
we did


---------33:44----------
that's my point right so if we can flip


---------33:49----------
this around I wonder what else we can


---------33:51----------
flip around that's very exciting


---------33:57----------
that's a very bloomer statement no I


---------34:02----------
mean like seriously that's not I'm not


---------34:04----------
trying to so you guys know I tend to be


---------34:06----------
positive right


---------34:07----------
like I'm a positive guy but like I


---------34:10----------
didn't come in here and say like oh you


---------34:12----------
guys could turn your life around cuz I


---------34:13----------
don't actually know that I don't know


---------34:15----------
that you can maybe you guys are [ __ ]


---------34:18----------
right but but what


---------34:22----------
I think stray cat put it beautifully and


---------34:24----------
this is this is what this is actually


---------34:26----------
what's giving me hope is that by talking


---------34:29----------
about this you guys are getting a new


---------34:31----------
perspective like that's what I mean


---------34:35----------
because what y'all are describing is


---------34:36----------
fundamentally different from the picture


---------34:38----------
of a tumor and that's what stray cat is


---------34:40----------
saying is that is that it's not


---------34:42----------
necessarily the outside world and I


---------34:44----------
think what rune said makes a lot of


---------34:45----------
sense that the outside world has turned


---------34:47----------
you into the person that you are today


---------34:49----------
and the chances of the person that you


---------34:51----------
are today or bleak I'll accept that but


---------34:56----------
I still think that if you guys have been


---------34:59----------
trying from a Doomer mindset and you've


---------35:01----------
been failing from a Doomer mindset and


---------35:03----------
you change the way that you look at the


---------35:06----------
world and you change where agency and


---------35:09----------
power lie then I think that there's a


---------35:12----------
chance for you to change and it's not


---------35:15----------
about like just putting on a new mindset


---------35:18----------
like yeah like I can do it believe in


---------35:21----------
yourself like ah that does that's not


---------35:24----------
what I'm talking about I'm not saying


---------35:25----------
like adopt a new mindset just because


---------35:27----------
that's what the power of positive


---------35:29----------
thinking is I think that that's dumb I


---------35:31----------
think the question is can you


---------35:33----------
authentically look at your life


---------35:36----------
understand how you got to be this way


---------35:38----------
understand why you can't move forward


---------35:41----------
and then figure out a new strategy that


---------35:44----------
is actually authentic for you I think


---------35:48----------
that's the crux of my problem


---------35:50----------
specifically and I talked about this was


---------35:52----------
bed with rune so it's like I put


---------35:55----------
essentially like I I acknowledge all


---------35:57----------
these things and I was like okay how can


---------36:00----------
I move forward


---------36:01----------
so when we talking about like financial


---------36:03----------
security and like education right and


---------36:06----------
then like coming from and so look at the


---------36:09----------
first friction first generation


---------36:11----------
background I had my parents tell me that


---------36:14----------
like oh go to college


---------36:16----------
Oh be an engineer oh do all these things


---------36:19----------
so you have a you have a path forward so


---------36:22----------
essentially what happened was I couldn't


---------36:24----------
do what you're suggesting of like the


---------36:26----------
authentic self and put myself on


---------36:28----------
autopilot and I feel as if and this is


---------36:30----------
what the duma comes in is like if i ever


---------36:32----------
try to take control or turn autopilot


---------36:36----------
and take control everything like I'm


---------36:38----------
just gonna turn everything the [ __ ]


---------36:39----------
where's my autopilot like has sort of


---------36:43----------
paved the way for me so I don't want to


---------36:45----------
lose that kind of weight is the


---------36:48----------
autopilot a good thing or a bad thing


---------36:50----------
not for me for me chill hold on hold on


---------36:53----------
I'm asking other people what do you guys


---------36:55----------
talk about so being or Zil being on


---------36:57----------
autopilot I feel very much that I'm on


---------37:02----------
autopilot in my education as well I


---------37:06----------
think I can relate when I'm out in


---------37:09----------
public I think it's what gets me through


---------37:12----------
like that moment in time so what do you


---------37:18----------
guys think about zil's fear of going off


---------37:21----------
of autopilot


---------37:22----------
I think he's sorry go ahead go Fortran


---------37:29----------
oh okay I'm just gonna say I think he's


---------37:32----------
probably because I don't I'm never on


---------37:34----------
autopilot I really am very I mean I say


---------37:37----------
that everyone because I'm not on point


---------37:38----------
sometimes but often times I try not to


---------37:40----------
be and I think it has given me a lot of


---------37:42----------
opportunities through virtue of like


---------37:44----------
effort that being another poet wouldn't


---------37:47----------
have given me what do you think about


---------37:50----------
and I'm sorry somebody else wanted to


---------37:51----------
say something yeah my autopilot sort of


---------37:55----------
just doing what I've always been doing


---------37:59----------
in uni and not really straying from that


---------38:01----------
and being pushed by my parents to do the


---------38:03----------
same sort of stuff like an education I


---------38:05----------
just sort of follow that I I don't know


---------38:10----------
if I always give my all but that's sort


---------38:13----------
of why it just sounds like you never


---------38:14----------
give your all


---------38:16----------
possibly you're the one who said like at


---------38:20----------
best I give 50% your words on uh


---------38:23----------
sometimes I try but let's like all I get


---------38:26----------
out of it in okay salts okay important


---------38:30----------
distinction okay what do you guys think


---------38:33----------
about zil's being afraid to turn off


---------38:35----------
autopilot that's the reason I'm still


---------38:40----------
doing my uni course and stuff otherwise


---------38:44----------
I might have ventured off and tried


---------38:46----------
other thing Lotus I haven't heard you


---------38:53----------
speak up in a little bit anything that


---------38:55----------
you want to add you don't have to I'm


---------38:56----------
just I would like to give you a chance


---------38:58----------
to talk if I can I can really kind of


---------39:01----------
because um I grew up with four


---------39:05----------
generation parents as well and then I


---------39:08----------
was actually born in Canada but they


---------39:11----------
never really put me into autopilot


---------39:14----------
I can't just went with the flow


---------39:16----------
throughout all my life and then I became


---------39:19----------
sort of either heavily attached or


---------39:22----------
addicted to gaming or just being on my


---------39:24----------
computer and for me that's my autopilot


---------39:27----------
right actually taking time to cook or to


---------39:30----------
exercise or so just even in like walk


---------39:33----------
outside is already a challenge sometimes


---------39:36----------
depending on how I feel okay can I just


---------39:45----------
think for a second yep how do you guys


---------39:55----------
think this is going by the way it's a


---------40:00----------
little over the place yep anyone else


---------40:05----------
feel that way


---------40:10----------
we can still tie it all together though


---------40:13----------
yeah yeah like like yeah like we can all


---------40:18----------
tie


---------40:18----------
yeah you can always like loop it back


---------40:19----------
you know because like I think we because


---------40:22----------
you said that like it feels as if like


---------40:25----------
everything like everything is sort of


---------40:27----------
like feels overwhelming so like because


---------40:30----------
of if we feel like it's everything then


---------40:32----------
somehow it will all tie back together


---------40:34----------
yeah so I mean would you guys say that


---------40:36----------
this conversation is almost like a


---------40:38----------
reflection of what your life feels like


---------40:41----------
yeah yeah yeah neat how that happens huh


---------40:47----------
right so like IIIi think stray cat


---------40:49----------
that's an excellent observation so I too


---------40:51----------
feel like it's kind of all over the


---------40:53----------
place I feel like we're talking about a


---------40:54----------
lot of different things I'm not quite


---------40:57----------
sure if we've made progress so that's


---------41:00----------
why I'm asking for a few minutes to kind


---------41:02----------
of stop and think and and try to figure


---------41:04----------
out like how can we put some of this


---------41:06----------
together in a meaningful way okay yeah


---------41:27----------
one more minute yeah I'm just not sure


---------41:33----------
how to answer that


---------41:34----------
because I feel like I'm probably the


---------41:35----------
least dimmer person here I feel like a


---------41:37----------
dimmer hat the time yeah they like the


---------41:44----------
immersing that mostly people have called


---------41:46----------
me I don't call it myself myself at very


---------41:48----------
much oh man there's so much here okay


---------41:52----------
what did you say earlier about you said


---------41:55----------
or something earlier about the whole


---------41:59----------
mindset of like embracing positivity for


---------42:02----------
the sake of that will make you feel


---------42:03----------
better on its own accord that that's


---------42:05----------
kind of you said something like that's


---------42:08----------
why I want you to react tick you ate it


---------42:09----------
because I'm not I didn't run breathing I


---------42:10----------
think the power positive thinking is bad


---------42:12----------
yeah so so I I think that there are a


---------42:17----------
lot of people who try to be relentlessly


---------42:20----------
positive and that's actually incredibly


---------42:22----------
toxic


---------42:23----------
so I think that when you when you ignore


---------42:26----------
what's bad in your life and you just


---------42:28----------
focus on the positive like you know if I


---------42:31----------
if I have like a broken arm and I'm like


---------42:33----------
oh but I still have one arm that works


---------42:35----------
and I'm like oh but like look this arm


---------42:37----------
works great like let's just focus on the


---------42:39----------
fact let me be thankful for this arm


---------42:41----------
being functional and it's like if you if


---------42:43----------
that's your strategy in life you're


---------42:44----------
gonna go through life with one arm


---------42:45----------
you're not gonna try to fix with a


---------42:46----------
broken right so I and I think it's just


---------42:51----------
I I think the the my foundation is not


---------42:55----------
to try to be positive it's not to try to


---------42:58----------
be negative it's try to be where you are


---------43:00----------
like be where you are start where you


---------43:02----------
are and move from there and whenever you


---------43:06----------
try to like be in a place that you're


---------43:08----------
not which by the way I think is like


---------43:10----------
half of like some of y'all's problems


---------43:14----------
right I mean III think like of anyway


---------43:17----------
I'll get there but I think I think I see


---------43:20----------
couple people smiling so I think you


---------43:22----------
guys know what I'm talking about so I


---------43:24----------
think I want to start with this like so


---------43:26----------
the promise of a generation so I'm also


---------43:28----------
like a you know my parents were


---------43:29----------
immigrants from South Asian country


---------43:31----------
India and and so I kind of also feel the


---------43:34----------
you know for those I mean I don't know


---------43:36----------
where Lotus is from but you know when I


---------43:41----------
was growing up I had a couple of options


---------43:43----------
so my dad once told me that like I have


---------43:44----------
an older brother he's like one of y'all


---------43:46----------
is gonna be a lawyer and one y'all is


---------43:48----------
gonna be a doctor and my brother is


---------43:51----------
older and he went to law school so in my


---------43:53----------
med school interviews they're like why


---------43:54----------
do you want to be a doctor and then I'd


---------43:56----------
say well my dad said that what he all


---------43:58----------
has to be a lawyer one a all has to be a


---------44:00----------
doctor and my brother was older and he


---------44:01----------
got to choose first so here I him and


---------44:04----------
then you know they would laugh because


---------44:06----------
that's obviously funny and what they


---------44:08----------
didn't understand is that you know that


---------44:10----------
was actually half the reason I was there


---------44:13----------
but but I I think you know we're so what


---------44:15----------
I want to start with is that like our


---------44:17----------
generation was given a promise right


---------44:20----------
that we were given a promise of like


---------44:21----------
success and happiness and we were told


---------44:24----------
that if you follow this formula this is


---------44:26----------
how you will be successful secure and


---------44:29----------
happy in your life and we were told this


---------44:32----------
formula with with such finality that you


---------44:34----------
work hard you go to college you get a


---------44:36----------
job


---------44:37----------
you leave yeah you you graduate with a


---------44:41----------
one of these like very specific degrees


---------44:43----------
like you don't major in liberal arts


---------44:44----------
you don't major in art history


---------44:48----------
you know you get yourself like a real


---------44:50----------
job like engineering or like CS like CS


---------44:55----------
was sort of like the forefront of like


---------44:57----------
people are like we don't really know if


---------44:58----------
this is gonna work out and then you know


---------45:00----------
the dot-com boom happened in 2000 and


---------45:02----------
it's like OCS became oh don't be done


---------45:04----------
it's like completely acceptable along


---------45:07----------
with doctor engineer wonderful wonderful


---------45:10----------
that's the good one right so that was


---------45:13----------
that was what happened like we were


---------45:15----------
given that we were given this path and


---------45:17----------
we were told by our elders that if you


---------45:20----------
follow this path you will be happy in


---------45:21----------
life and it turned out that that's like


---------45:24----------
the biggest scam of that's the biggest


---------45:27----------
scam and it's not really their fault and


---------45:30----------
then they get really [ __ ] confused


---------45:32----------
because they're like I don't understand


---------45:34----------
why you just don't do what I tell you to


---------45:35----------
do like this is the way to be happy and


---------45:37----------
then you have conflict with them right


---------45:38----------
you're like no but this doesn't make me


---------45:40----------
happy they're like you're dumb you'll be


---------45:42----------
happy when you're 40 just do what I'm


---------45:44----------
telling you to do happiness comes later


---------45:46----------
like you [ __ ] kids trying to be happy


---------45:49----------
it's not about happiness you'll be happy


---------45:52----------
when you're 40 trust me and and that's


---------45:55----------
what we were told so we were given the


---------45:56----------
promise of a generation promise of a


---------45:58----------
generation turned out to be a lie and I


---------46:01----------
don't really blame them for it I mean I


---------46:03----------
used to but I think like that was that


---------46:05----------
was the formula that worked for their


---------46:07----------
generation like if you wanted to leave


---------46:10----------
India so my parent my dad grew up in an


---------46:13----------
8 by 10 room that had eight people


---------46:18----------
living in it eight people lived in an 8


---------46:21----------
by 10 room at nighttime they would pack


---------46:24----------
up the kitchen and they would like lay


---------46:27----------
out sleeping bags but not sleeping bags


---------46:29----------
to put like mats and then one person


---------46:31----------
would sleep outside the door in like the


---------46:34----------
doorway like in the entryway right


---------46:36----------
that's where they grew up


---------46:38----------
their life was different meaning and


---------46:40----------
happiness were irrelevant it was like


---------46:41----------
we've got to survive because there was


---------46:44----------
like rationing and like you had to stand


---------46:45----------
in line for an hour to get like a pound


---------46:47----------
of sugar and you could get another pound


---------46:49----------
of sugar like a month later


---------46:50----------
it's just a different world that they


---------46:52----------
grew up in and so all of these feelings


---------46:55----------
became very irrelevant because it was


---------46:58----------
about survival and they saw opportunity


---------47:00----------
to like come to the United States and


---------47:02----------
like they saw a particular way to do


---------47:04----------
that and they did that and then they


---------47:06----------
could do things like afford cars and


---------47:08----------
then they could do things like buy like


---------47:09----------
a thousand pounds of sugar for people


---------47:11----------
back home and so that was that was what


---------47:14----------
they grew up with I mean I think


---------47:15----------
immigrants is probably a little bit more


---------47:16----------
extreme but I think if you look at even


---------47:18----------
like Caucasian people or like Americans


---------47:20----------
or Canadians from like 60 years ago is


---------47:23----------
the same way you could support a family


---------47:25----------
with like one income and a bachelor's


---------47:27----------
degree bachelor's degree doesn't get you


---------47:29----------
[ __ ] now so the first thing is that I


---------47:32----------
think the biggest problem is that we


---------47:33----------
were led to believe something that is


---------47:35----------
actually incorrect and so I think the


---------47:38----------
real challenge here is that we've had to


---------47:40----------
figure out and I don't think anyone has


---------47:42----------
really I mean we're doing this but I


---------47:45----------
don't think anyone has I don't think


---------47:47----------
many people stop and really think a


---------47:48----------
little bit about the fact that we have


---------47:50----------
to find our own way forward in this


---------47:53----------
we're not gonna find an answer from


---------47:55----------
somewhere else because those answers


---------47:56----------
just don't work anymore it's like the


---------48:00----------
test has changed so the answer key from


---------48:02----------
like 50 years ago doesn't work anymore


---------48:04----------
and what I'm hearing from you guys is


---------48:08----------
like autopilot so what is autopilot it


---------48:10----------
can be a couple of different things


---------48:11----------
right like so gaming to manage your


---------48:13----------
emotions and things like that but


---------48:14----------
essentially like I mean it doesn't


---------48:16----------
surprise me that the best result that an


---------48:18----------
Aussie has ever gotten is 50% because I


---------48:20----------
think he's doing something something


---------48:22----------
that he gives no shits about and when


---------48:25----------
you take a human being and you make them


---------48:27----------
like give a hundred percent effort for


---------48:29----------
something that they give no shits about


---------48:30----------
50 percent is pretty good right and I I


---------48:34----------
hear it from stray cat to that like


---------48:36----------
there is an assumption about how human


---------48:39----------
beings interact and relate to each other


---------48:41----------
and she has social anxiety so those


---------48:44----------
assumptions don't apply to her she's


---------48:45----------
playing a different game she was also


---------48:48----------
taught like a particular way to socially


---------48:50----------
behave with other people and what what


---------48:52----------
you're supposed to do she was also given


---------48:54----------
a formula go out make friends say hi to


---------48:57----------
people be more active just get out of


---------48:59----------
the house just get out of the house just


---------49:02----------
be more active


---------49:04----------
just get out of it but stray cat just


---------49:06----------
get out of the house you'll make friends


---------49:08----------
it's the promise of a generation that's


---------49:10----------
[ __ ] wrong right the world that we


---------49:15----------
live in is fundamentally different and


---------49:18----------
so I think the biggest problem that all


---------49:20----------
you guys have is autopilot you know so I


---------49:24----------
mean I'm gonna say biggest like several


---------49:26----------
times because I think there are several


---------49:27----------
biggest problems so you guys I just so


---------49:29----------
the first thing is that I think you guys


---------49:31----------
have to stop living on autopilot and I


---------49:33----------
that's hard right so when Zil stopped


---------49:35----------
talks about not living on autopilot like


---------49:38----------
what is the emotion that arises Zil you


---------49:40----------
can't answer by the way okay what is the


---------49:44----------
emotion that arises for Zil when you


---------49:46----------
stop living on autopilot panic


---------49:51----------
absolutely yeah right that's what's


---------49:55----------
holding you back I mean so so stray cat


---------50:01----------
was saying that she has a lack of


---------50:02----------
direction and lacks meaning in her life


---------50:04----------
well let me tell you guys something


---------50:06----------
if you major in something that you don't


---------50:07----------
care about and you have a life of thirty


---------50:12----------
five years of a successful career


---------50:13----------
spending eight hours a day doing


---------50:15----------
something that you don't care about your


---------50:17----------
life is gonna be meaningless just how it


---------50:21----------
works


---------50:21----------
right you guys are looking for meaning


---------50:23----------
in something that you fundamentally give


---------50:25----------
two shits about so you're not gonna find


---------50:27----------
it there now the challenge is like what


---------50:29----------
keeps you guys from moving forward I


---------50:31----------
think it's fear and panic absolutely and


---------50:33----------
this is where we kind of get to this


---------50:35----------
whole conundrum of like is the world the


---------50:37----------
problem or you the problem and I think


---------50:39----------
rune put it beautifully that the world


---------50:41----------
makes you into the person that you are


---------50:43----------
today but now this is where it gets


---------50:47----------
really tricky right because who


---------50:49----------
determines who you are tomorrow


---------50:59----------
I mean that sounds like a feel-good kind


---------51:03----------
of answer do you guys actually believe


---------51:04----------
that more half right cuz my response to


---------51:11----------
you I mean I get and I get Lotus that


---------51:13----------
this is dr. K stream and we're supposed


---------51:15----------
to be like positive and wholesome and


---------51:16----------
have breakthroughs but like if you


---------51:18----------
determine who you are tomorrow like why


---------51:20----------
did you end up where you are today right


---------51:25----------
does that make sense like who determines


---------51:33----------
who you are today if you're saying that


---------51:35----------
you control who you are tomorrow who was


---------51:38----------
in control yesterday and how did you end


---------51:41----------
up where you are today that doesn't make


---------51:44----------
sense to me it's like putting the blame


---------51:52----------
right so so hold on a second so now


---------51:55----------
stray cat like now we got to be we got


---------51:56----------
to be we got to be careful with


---------51:58----------
ourselves if we have blame then we have


---------52:01----------
power you can't have one without the


---------52:04----------
other so which is it does that make


---------52:09----------
sense to you guys


---------52:13----------
can't have it was it good your turn to


---------52:19----------
think I think that's


---------52:27----------
the blame hurt though is because it's


---------52:30----------
like oh I was in charge if I was I was


---------52:32----------
responsible of the situation and I


---------52:34----------
[ __ ] it up okay so then we come back


---------52:39----------
to control right so like did you really


---------52:42----------
[ __ ] it up usually feels like I do


---------52:49----------
uh-uh hold on you do or you did big


---------52:54----------
difference


---------52:59----------
are you referencing like


---------53:01----------
today versus yesterday what do you mean


---------53:03----------
yes the distinction absolutely that's


---------53:05----------
exactly what I'm referencing I think it


---------53:11----------
depends on I guess how much resilience I


---------53:16----------
have when I wake up in the morning if I


---------53:18----------
can continue to fight that fight you


---------53:20----------
know okay so if you don't have enough


---------53:25----------
resilience in the morning whose fault is


---------53:27----------
that I see what do you see help the rest


---------53:35----------
of us see room well I think I've I think


---------53:40----------
you're just basically our to Hue


---------53:41----------
anything how complicated these kids


---------53:43----------
because it feels complicated it's like I


---------53:46----------
it's it's still my responsibility I


---------53:48----------
still see it like that but that's at the


---------53:50----------
same time maybe give yourself a break


---------53:51----------
every now and then what are the rest


---------53:55----------
you'll think about that I think well


---------54:00----------
like give yourself a break


---------54:02----------
like for me that that feels as if like


---------54:05----------
oh if I'm giving myself a break


---------54:07----------
then like where the where am i


---------54:10----------
displacing all that feelings to that's


---------54:14----------
sort of like my my internalization of


---------54:16----------
like giving myself a break almost like I


---------54:18----------
feel like when you said like surviving I


---------54:20----------
feel as if in like autopilot like it's


---------54:22----------
all connects like I autopilot so I can


---------54:24----------
survive and so therefore I can't give


---------54:26----------
myself a break it's like I have to like


---------54:28----------
do these things yeah right so that's the


---------54:34----------
panic in the fear because unless you


---------54:37----------
continue living your life like you can


---------54:41----------
only like if you stop going on autopilot


---------54:44----------
and you give yourself a break then like


---------54:47----------
you're afraid that the world is gonna


---------54:48----------
come crashing down stray cat said panic


---------54:51----------
like stray cat what do you think what do


---------54:54----------
you think the panic is like can you


---------54:56----------
describe that for us


---------54:58----------
um well for me it's like literally a


---------55:03----------
panic attack but uh and like a more I'm


---------55:08----------
not charlie it's really just uncertainty


---------55:12----------
and like the unknown yeah so what do you


---------55:17----------
guys think about like just think about


---------55:20----------
that for a second I mean with the doom


---------55:23----------
er this is very different okay


---------55:26----------
the Doomer knows what's happening on the


---------55:29----------
outside world the outside world is known


---------55:32----------
it's fixed it's given that's why there's


---------55:34----------
no hope does that make sense the outside


---------55:39----------
world has been solved for but what you


---------55:43----------
guys are describing to me is very


---------55:44----------
different it's actually like the unknown


---------55:48----------
that there's there in a sense it's not I


---------55:51----------
think what this means is that there's an


---------55:54----------
autopilot you and the autopilot you is


---------55:57----------
the Doomer and the autopilot you like


---------55:59----------
looks into the future and knows that


---------56:01----------
there is no hope for you and then


---------56:03----------
there's another part of you that


---------56:05----------
understands that there is another


---------56:07----------
outside world there that is uncertain


---------56:09----------
and unknown but you guys are all


---------56:13----------
actively choosing to go on autopilot and


---------56:16----------
pick the dimers world what do you think


---------56:22----------
about that


---------56:26----------
yeah I think it relates to one part of


---------56:29----------
my life especially like in my education


---------56:33----------
I've always just listened to what my


---------56:36----------
parents say when I ask for help like I'm


---------56:39----------
always uncertain if I should keep going


---------56:41----------
but then I think of or if I stop doing


---------56:44----------
this course and go to something else


---------56:45----------
I've never done this sort of I've always


---------56:49----------
been sort of doing IT my whole life so


---------56:51----------
that's what I'm going into but if I'm


---------56:53----------
being completely honest I feel like


---------56:55----------
something else would be better but the


---------56:58----------
uncertainty stops me from trying of


---------57:01----------
doing anything other than what I'm


---------57:03----------
currently going down yeah so how much


---------57:07----------
like who here is living with unser is


---------57:09----------
living with Dakshina is afraid of living


---------57:12----------
with uncertainty right or like other


---------57:15----------
people do you guys feel similar to an


---------57:18----------
Aussie in the sense that there's another


---------57:21----------
path that you could walk but you're


---------57:23----------
terrified of what'll well like what's at


---------57:25----------
the end of that path because you don't


---------57:26----------
know how so


---------57:36----------
Lotus let's say even if I did you know


---------57:45----------
pursue your culinary arts or whatever


---------57:47----------
else in post-secondary even if it did


---------57:49----------
complete all of that I don't know what I


---------57:53----------
would do is that afterwards I don't know


---------57:54----------
like I don't know out of all the paths


---------57:56----------
that I can take I don't know where any


---------57:58----------
of it will lead me to how do you live


---------58:03----------
with that how do you live with


---------58:06----------
uncertainty strike at what do you think


---------58:17----------
how do you deal with your panic I kind


---------58:21----------
of don't it it feels like it takes


---------58:26----------
control of me instead mm-hmm so I tend


---------58:30----------
to just avoid things that cause that


---------58:32----------
panic in the first place yeah so it's


---------58:37----------
kind of living without really doing


---------58:39----------
anything yeah so I avoid things that


---------58:44----------
cause the panic in the first place that


---------58:46----------
is the [ __ ] definition of autopilot


---------58:50----------
becoming an engineer right what your


---------58:54----------
whole lives guys are built around the


---------58:56----------
avoidance of uncertainty of the road


---------58:58----------
that you have not locked and the problem


---------59:04----------
here is that when you look at the road


---------59:05----------
that you are walking you see doom and


---------59:07----------
gloom at the end of it and the thing is


---------59:10----------
that's not a cognitive bias it's not


---------59:11----------
because you guys are [ __ ] depressed


---------59:13----------
it's because you guys are smart it's


---------59:15----------
because every step along that road has


---------59:17----------
been doom and gloom and then you're like


---------59:21----------
I've been getting 50% like you know


---------59:24----------
going back to annecy he's been given


---------59:26----------
trying really hard and the best he can


---------59:28----------
do is 50% and he's like if I continue


---------59:31----------
studying an IT the most I'm ever gonna


---------59:33----------
be able to get is 50% and so you look at


---------59:36----------
a life and it's it's a Doomer because


---------59:39----------
the best you could if you give a hundred


---------59:41----------
all you're gonna get is 50 that is a bad


---------59:45----------
world to live in


---------59:48----------
but then we kind of circle back and we


---------59:50----------
like we think about this for a little


---------59:52----------
bit and we see that there are a couple


---------59:54----------
of core things the first is the


---------59:56----------
avoidance of uncertainty the fear of


---------59:59----------
like what is the world gonna look like


---------60:01----------
and that's a reasonable fear - we can


---------60:03----------
kind of get into how that is how that


---------60:05----------
works and then there's also like a


---------60:08----------
couple of other things which I can't


---------60:10----------
haven't been able to quite tie together


---------60:11----------
one is like what the sense of isolation


---------60:13----------
is and the third is yeah a sense of how


---------60:24----------
did you get to be here and who's


---------60:26----------
responsible for be like where you are


---------60:28----------
now and who's responsible for what


---------60:30----------
happens in the future and you guys want


---------60:33----------
to say that you're responsible but the


---------60:36----------
more I kind of like chip away at that it


---------60:37----------
seems like you guys aren't actually so


---------60:39----------
sure right and this goes back to like


---------60:41----------
what rune was saying about being


---------60:42----------
resilient he's like depends on how I


---------60:44----------
resilient I am that day and I was like


---------60:45----------
okay well what determines how resilient


---------60:47----------
you are like whose fault is that right


---------60:51----------
so the first thing so let's like think


---------60:53----------
about so are those are those like three


---------60:55----------
topics that we can try to dig into does


---------61:00----------
that sound reasonable do you guys think


---------61:02----------
those are like worthwhile things to talk


---------61:04----------
about


---------61:04----------
yeah cuz like if I see it as like sort


---------61:07----------
of like a like a mom bro like those all


---------61:10----------
those three things fall under the


---------61:12----------
umbrella like the doom are kind of yeah


---------61:14----------
yeah but I think it's more than one


---------61:16----------
thing so I think there's uncertainty


---------61:17----------
about the road not taken' there's the


---------61:21----------
security of being on autopilot that's


---------61:23----------
one thing second thing is like what's


---------61:25----------
going on with isolation and the third


---------61:27----------
thing is like who is responsible for


---------61:29----------
your life


---------61:30----------
now the next thing I'm going to ask you


---------61:32----------
guys is I see I sense a subtle change in


---------61:37----------
this group how do you guys feel right


---------61:40----------
now


---------61:47----------
in a different way from the beginning


---------61:49----------
you know I'm actually a little less


---------61:51----------
nervous to me events so what do you feel


---------61:54----------
nervous about stray cat um just being on


---------62:00----------
stream really okay so you feel a little


---------62:03----------
less nervous but essentially the same


---------62:04----------
quality of nervousness yeah and I see


---------62:09----------
how do you feel you don't know what are


---------62:17----------
you doing right now smiling why right so


---------62:28----------
you were smiling before I asked you how


---------62:30----------
you're feeling did you notice that no


---------62:34----------
okay


---------62:35----------
you've been smiling for a little while


---------62:37----------
now any idea why that is I mean now


---------62:44----------
you're smiling coz maybe you feel


---------62:45----------
embarrassed and you just noticed you're


---------62:47----------
smiling but yeah maybe because we're


---------62:50----------
getting somewhere


---------62:51----------
is that what you think actually that's


---------62:55----------
not the right question is that how you


---------62:57----------
feel


---------62:59----------
yeah I think with the three topics it


---------63:02----------
sort of hits right well the things I


---------63:06----------
don't do you do you know how to describe


---------63:10----------
what you're feeling right now really


---------63:14----------
does anybody else have a sense of when


---------63:16----------
they look at when you guys look at an


---------63:18----------
Aussies face what do you think he's


---------63:19----------
feeling I think you've having a good


---------63:25----------
time yeah and I see how many


---------63:32----------
I told you that maybe school is not


---------63:36----------
where you should be


---------63:38----------
I've brought that into because I feel


---------63:40----------
like a lot of people figure a lot of


---------63:41----------
people tell you oh so I know and now see


---------63:43----------
and stray so I'm familiar with the stuff


---------63:45----------
they talk about so fight if I'm like if


---------63:48----------
I'm asserting some things that's why is


---------63:49----------
because we talked about it before but it


---------63:51----------
was like I know kind of feels like an


---------63:54----------
Aussie is told a lot of times just just


---------63:56----------
work harder at school just do school


---------63:58----------
more oh god that sounds like a terrible


---------64:01----------
idea to me yeah just work harder is like


---------64:10----------
the worst strategy in the universe like


---------64:14----------
it's like telling stray cat and just


---------64:15----------
leave the house more just get on it like


---------64:18----------
de precios not that bad just get out of


---------64:21----------
bed jump out of bed I once had someone


---------64:23----------
tell me that their solution to


---------64:25----------
depression was to jump out of bed not


---------64:28----------
get out of bed leap out of bed and they


---------64:31----------
said that if I can leap out of bed that


---------64:32----------
my depression is cured you should tell


---------64:34----------
your patients to jump out of bed


---------64:36----------
that's like alright man I'll do that


---------64:38----------
it's [ __ ] dumb advice it's not how it


---------64:41----------
works trying harder so if at first you


---------64:43----------
don't succeed don't try try again if at


---------64:45----------
first you don't succeed try it a


---------64:46----------
different way like you know I mean


---------64:50----------
anyway that don't get me started on


---------64:52----------
ranting on another topic so let's let's


---------64:53----------
talk about uncertainty isolation and


---------64:57----------
agency okay these are our three topics


---------65:00----------
so let's kind of bang them out so we're


---------65:02----------
gonna be a little bit more quick about


---------65:06----------
them so when you guys think about


---------65:08----------
uncertainty like what do you think would


---------65:11----------
happen to your life if you started


---------65:13----------
taking the road that you're uncertain


---------65:16----------
where it leads it's scary to think


---------65:23----------
what's scary fulfilling


---------65:28----------
scary about it we'll get to in


---------65:30----------
relentless positivity in a second so


---------65:33----------
like okay if I can't provide like a


---------65:35----------
gamer analogy so it's like I put a


---------65:37----------
little bit of dota so it's like who


---------65:38----------
makes like the guys for dota I forgot


---------65:41----------
who but like it's like if I play DotA


---------65:43----------
it's like okay I know that I want to do


---------65:45----------
well so dota life right I'll make those


---------65:48----------
analogies right okay so I'll follow this


---------65:50----------
guide


---------65:50----------
hence the guy is sort of like the


---------65:52----------
boomers talking down it's like hey just


---------65:54----------
get these items and then get do this


---------65:57----------
item path you'll be fine right and so


---------65:59----------
it's like okay I'll just follow this


---------66:00----------
guide and see if I can win the dota


---------66:02----------
match but and then like to think too


---------66:05----------
like veer away like sure this other guys


---------66:06----------
like to think that's like I can choose


---------66:09----------
my own items and play how I want I don't


---------66:11----------
know if it's gonna give me the same


---------66:12----------
results and so like that I have


---------66:15----------
experienced already the autopilot so I'm


---------66:19----------
gonna I'm gonna give you sort of like


---------66:20----------
I'm gonna modify your analogy a little


---------66:22----------
bit okay so let's say you're playing


---------66:24----------
dota so like what position do you play


---------66:26----------
and donut so I always played support


---------66:29----------
okay so I like playing support too so


---------66:32----------
like let's say that someone says like if


---------66:34----------
you want to win games like someone says


---------66:36----------
like here's how you win game a game of


---------66:37----------
dota you play anti-mage you farm for 45


---------66:40----------
minutes and then you go 27 oh and 15 and


---------66:43----------
they say this is the way to play yeah


---------66:46----------
and then what happens is is you play


---------66:48----------
anti-mage right there guy like you look


---------66:50----------
at their guide and their guide is


---------66:51----------
spot-on


---------66:52----------
they're like you're like wow and they're


---------66:53----------
like look if you want to just if you


---------66:55----------
want to see it happen you don't have to


---------66:56----------
look at my guide like just look at like


---------66:58----------
look at our TZ streaming and just watch


---------67:01----------
him do it like look at all these hard


---------67:02----------
carries like they [ __ ] own the games


---------67:03----------
they win like millions of dollars using


---------67:07----------
this strategy so you should use it too


---------67:08----------
and then what happens when you play


---------67:11----------
anti-mage though I tell my teammates so


---------67:15----------
much yeah you know why you tilt your


---------67:17----------
teammates cuz I'm probably bad at it


---------67:20----------
absolutely I'm like not doing what our


---------67:22----------
T's is doing absolutely so I follow the


---------67:26----------
guide I play a team agent I [ __ ] get


---------67:28----------
owned


---------67:28----------
I'm oh eight and fifteen at the end of


---------67:31----------
the game and then the the guy comes back


---------67:34----------
and he's like dude you just got to


---------67:35----------
follow the guide man just follow the


---------67:37----------
guide but your experience is causing you


---------67:40----------
to like lose


---------67:41----------
mm our Alec game after game after game


---------67:44----------
you're getting crushed what happens when


---------67:47----------
you play support he goes back up or like


---------67:51----------
it's like it's more like one more


---------67:53----------
enjoyable because I know I'm doing I


---------67:55----------
guess so like following guys I think


---------67:56----------
it's like I'm used to it but those are


---------67:58----------
all like different also things too but


---------68:00----------
generally the feeling is that I find


---------68:02----------
that hey I play better the feeling is


---------68:06----------
that you fit played bad when oh sorry


---------68:09----------
phew if I play support I play better


---------68:12----------
yeah you play better yeah


---------68:15----------
and it's more fun yeah so so this is


---------68:18----------
what you guys have to understand about


---------68:19----------
like the promise of a generation which


---------68:21----------
is that it's it's a lie right like it's


---------68:24----------
not that it's like a pure lie it's just


---------68:26----------
that like I think your analogy was


---------68:28----------
beautiful though because it's like


---------68:29----------
they're giving you a guide for like a


---------68:31----------
strategy and a character that you do not


---------68:33----------
want to play and when you try to play


---------68:36----------
that character you find that you suck at


---------68:38----------
it and and then the problem here is that


---------68:42----------
your whole life you've been playing so


---------68:43----------
like imagine you're playing dota and


---------68:45----------
you've never played before and like


---------68:46----------
you've never played support all you've


---------68:48----------
been doing is like following anti-mage


---------68:50----------
guides and you think that good dota is a


---------68:53----------
shitty game because all you ever do is


---------68:55----------
first pick anti-mage that's what your


---------68:59----------
life is like because all you've been


---------69:01----------
doing is picking antimage you've never


---------69:03----------
given yourself the chance to like pick a


---------69:06----------
dazzle or a lion or like an Oracle or


---------69:08----------
whatever like you haven't actually tried


---------69:11----------
like it because you're like butBut how


---------69:13----------
am I supposed to carry a game with


---------69:14----------
Oracle like the guide says I have to go


---------69:17----------
27 and no I've watched our TZ stream but


---------69:22----------
like how am I supposed to like win a


---------69:23----------
game with the support like I can't I


---------69:25----------
can't build like how does that even work


---------69:27----------
and so your your your minds ability to


---------69:30----------
even consider what is down the road of


---------69:33----------
uncertainty like you can't even think


---------69:35----------
about you can't calculate it but it


---------69:39----------
doesn't mean that there isn't like lots


---------69:41----------
of success possible that's just you have


---------69:43----------
no idea how to predict it which is


---------69:44----------
because you've never played a game as a


---------69:46----------
support so then the next question is so


---------69:49----------
for Zil and sorry if this is a little


---------69:51----------
bit dota specific will get more general


---------69:53----------
but so still like what do you


---------69:55----------
like what do you think about uncertainty


---------69:56----------
now like what's the solution to fearing


---------69:58----------
the uncertainty of your life oh I've


---------70:04----------
been a lot introspection and like I had


---------70:06----------
actually have not been able to answer


---------70:08----------
that or asked myself that question so


---------70:10----------
it's like like a wall up for me first of


---------70:12----------
all well I'll give you a quick answer a


---------70:16----------
quick hint you're not gonna find the


---------70:18----------
answer through introspection right like


---------70:24----------
if I'm a dota player so I'll ask you in


---------70:26----------
another way if I'm a dota player and I


---------70:28----------
keep on losing playing antimage and I


---------70:30----------
suck at it and I'm like losing and


---------70:32----------
losing and losing and losing and losing


---------70:34----------
you guys understand what I'm talking


---------70:35----------
about like even if you don't know who


---------70:37----------
anti-mage's clear League yeah okay so


---------70:41----------
like you know so it's like ADC it's like


---------70:44----------
the way you win a game League as you


---------70:46----------
pick an ADC and then you just go 27 and


---------70:49----------
oh and then you pick an ADC and then you


---------70:52----------
go oh and it so what do you do like if


---------70:56----------
like so let's steer clear of suicide


---------71:07----------
okay boys and girls so I'm asking you so


---------71:10----------
practically Zil if I was playing dota


---------71:12----------
for the first time and I played 50 games


---------71:14----------
of anti-mage and I won two of them and I


---------71:16----------
say this game sucks what is the


---------71:18----------
practical advice you would tell me try a


---------71:22----------
different hero absolutely but then I


---------71:25----------
come to you and I say is but Zil like I


---------71:26----------
don't know how to win a game with that


---------71:28----------
other hero my yes like but the Accademia


---------71:36----------
is like I could deem assign means like


---------71:38----------
well just play the rest of the games and


---------71:39----------
see and compare the the win rates


---------71:41----------
between the 250 game samples is that


---------71:45----------
what you would tell me you tell me to


---------71:46----------
play another 50 games as an T major or


---------71:48----------
as a support as like the the new role


---------71:51----------
and but I say but but I may not win I


---------71:53----------
could lose dil what would you say


---------72:03----------
my gut reactions like just try and like


---------72:07----------
that's sort of like I don't know like


---------72:09----------
that's like disingenuous I feel like


---------72:11----------
it's like I know that they want to win


---------72:14----------
the game but it's like you got try what


---------72:18----------
what what is trying do gives you more


---------72:25----------
information to see if you're good at the


---------72:28----------
new role that you're playing that's it


---------72:32----------
man that's it


---------72:36----------
right that's exactly what you need to do


---------72:40----------
you need more information about the road


---------72:43----------
that you have not taken because you're


---------72:47----------
like I don't remember if you're studying


---------72:48----------
engineering or what but like I don't


---------72:50----------
know what you're studying or what career


---------72:52----------
path you're on but like the basic


---------72:54----------
problem is that you've been following


---------72:56----------
the anti-mage guide and what you need to


---------72:58----------
do is play a few games is other things


---------73:01----------
to see if you like it or see if it


---------73:03----------
offers any chance of success and


---------73:05----------
understand that when you play a new game


---------73:07----------
you're actually gonna be worse at it


---------73:08----------
than what you're doing now I guess like


---------73:13----------
from a professional career like


---------73:15----------
following the anti-mage guide kind of


---------73:17----------
did work so like sure but I have other


---------73:20----------
problems or I have like other facets


---------73:22----------
that that analogy can definitely apply


---------73:25----------
to you so yeah yeah what do you guys


---------73:28----------
think about like I don't know how much


---------73:30----------
of this conversation y'all have been


---------73:32----------
able to follow but all of it I'm on the


---------73:36----------
same page rune can you explain to me


---------73:38----------
what we just talked about yeah basically


---------73:42----------
if something is if you're unhappy with


---------73:45----------
you want it say it with the analogy or


---------73:47----------
you want without the analogy please okay


---------73:50----------
do you so basically if you are unhappy


---------73:53----------
with the way the strategy that you're


---------73:55----------
applying to your own life or whatever


---------73:57----------
you're doing in your daily life if


---------73:58----------
you're unhappy with that you have to be


---------73:59----------
willing to go out on a limb [ __ ] up and


---------74:02----------
get dominated which is the league


---------74:04----------
analogy you have to we want to fail and


---------74:06----------
learn how to do something that you will


---------74:08----------
enjoy more


---------74:11----------
what do you think about that it's worked


---------74:15----------
for me I do music so I spent a lot of


---------74:21----------
time like writing and producing music


---------74:23----------
I've been doing it for like three years


---------74:24----------
now and in the past like three months


---------74:27----------
I've decided to put more effort and more


---------74:28----------
energy into it and a little bit less


---------74:30----------
effort into like school and it has its


---------74:35----------
own like hardships but it's way more


---------74:38----------
fulfilling what do other people think


---------74:44----------
about what rune just said sounds pretty


---------74:49----------
good what sounds good about it Lotus


---------74:54----------
that's you're finding something that's


---------74:56----------
new and fulfilling and that sounds like


---------75:00----------
you want to keep pursuing it so I want


---------75:04----------
to just be a little bit clearer I don't


---------75:06----------
think that it was new and fulfilling so


---------75:09----------
this is an important distinction okay


---------75:10----------
this is part of the problem that gets us


---------75:12----------
stuck we think something is new and


---------75:15----------
fulfilling rune when you started music


---------75:19----------
was it new and fulfilling no I was


---------75:23----------
confusing and weird so would you say


---------75:27----------
that the less new it got the more


---------75:29----------
fulfilling it became absolutely not


---------75:32----------
in fact I think the more I stuck with it


---------75:35----------
the more fulfilling it's gotten okay I


---------75:37----------
think that's what I asked you but that's


---------75:39----------
okay so basically is when it's new it's


---------75:42----------
not fulfilling and the more that you


---------75:44----------
explore it at the beginning gets [ __ ]


---------75:47----------
confusing and weird and you don't know


---------75:48----------
what you're doing but fulfillment


---------75:50----------
doesn't come at the beginning it comes


---------75:52----------
at the end yeah and there's a period of


---------75:55----------
time that has confusion and weirdness


---------76:00----------
yeah right so like let's just think


---------76:03----------
about that when we're thinking about


---------76:04----------
alternatives so this is where we kind of


---------76:07----------
get into expectations and and fantasies


---------76:10----------
and stuff like that there's this other


---------76:12----------
idea that the Boomers give us that if


---------76:14----------
you try something you'll like it


---------76:17----------
right they say like oh just go out and


---------76:19----------
like meet new people everything will be


---------76:20----------
fine no it's gonna be [ __ ] awkward


---------76:22----------
and awful that's not what they tell you


---------76:24----------
they tell you they say exactly what


---------76:26----------
Lotus said oh I should try something


---------76:28----------
that's new and fulfilling nobody you


---------76:29----------
should try something that's new and


---------76:31----------
difficult and awkward and overtime if


---------76:34----------
you're lucky it will become fulfilling


---------76:35----------
and if you're unlucky then what do you


---------76:40----------
do now let me ask you guys something


---------76:48----------
is what I'm was what we're talking about


---------76:50----------
now just try no it's about experiencing


---------76:57----------
and learning right so like how is what


---------77:02----------
I'm what we're talking about different


---------77:04----------
from just go out and try something new


---------77:07----------
or is it the same no there's more


---------77:13----------
lenient in it and more like you don't


---------77:16----------
have to stick to it and keep trying you


---------77:19----------
can just find what fits I I think like


---------77:24----------
the like the education part right cuz


---------77:28----------
like you can try something but not have


---------77:30----------
any sort of like wanting of education


---------77:33----------
but when you told me it's like you


---------77:35----------
should try something else to figure it


---------77:37----------
out or like to learn something to me


---------77:39----------
that's like educating myself on this


---------77:41----------
topic so I can try and educate and I


---------77:44----------
think there's also a difference between


---------77:45----------
just trying like I think that's how you


---------77:47----------
how you explain it right like I'm asking


---------77:50----------
you guys it's I don't care what I


---------77:54----------
believe the question is what do you guys


---------77:57----------
think if I were to if I had started this


---------77:58----------
and you guys were saying oh yeah I don't


---------78:00----------
like what I'm doing and I said just try


---------78:02----------
something else is that the same as where


---------78:04----------
we are now right so what are the key


---------78:10----------
things so stray cat and and Zillah


---------78:11----------
mentioned a couple of things right it


---------78:12----------
changes the perception around why you're


---------78:15----------
trying the just try is try for the goal


---------78:18----------
of success


---------78:20----------
but now what what I think stray cat said


---------78:23----------
it really well there's leniency in this


---------78:25----------
there's a presumption of failure there's


---------78:28----------
a presumption of [ __ ] up and there's


---------78:30----------
a presumption that the goal here is a


---------78:31----------
this is enough is own the goal is


---------78:33----------
actually not to succeed what is the goal


---------78:40----------
to learn absolutely so I think the


---------78:45----------
problem is that nasi wants to get a


---------78:47----------
hundred on something that he loved


---------78:49----------
relating to school I think it's got to


---------78:51----------
be something that he gives a [ __ ] about


---------78:55----------
right like that's like there's no way


---------78:59----------
you're gonna get a hundred if you don't


---------79:01----------
care about what you do and this is where


---------79:05----------
you know we were there that we've


---------79:07----------
touched on meaning and fulfilment and it


---------79:10----------
sounds like rune has found some degree


---------79:12----------
of fulfillment in music and that's also


---------79:14----------
how it works it's like you find


---------79:16----------
fulfillment in playing the position of


---------79:18----------
the game that you enjoy and the problem


---------79:20----------
is that we have all these guides telling


---------79:23----------
us that if we want to win you should


---------79:24----------
play this position and that too is kind


---------79:28----------
of interesting because if you look at


---------79:29----------
the game of life there are some


---------79:31----------
successes that are so much more


---------79:33----------
noticeable that people can point to them


---------79:37----------
right and like for like the MOBA players


---------79:40----------
like think about this for a second the


---------79:42----------
reason that the anti-mage is 27 and or


---------79:45----------
the reason that your ADC is having a


---------79:47----------
wonderful game is because of like a


---------79:49----------
supports warding a supports position but


---------79:51----------
none of that no boomer can point to that


---------79:54----------
and tell you that that's the reason that


---------79:55----------
that like that's not what you see right


---------79:57----------
does that make sense that some paths to


---------80:00----------
success or subtle and difficult to


---------80:02----------
detect but the problem is that we get


---------80:04----------
biased by the overnight success stories


---------80:07----------
we get biased by like the so-and-so who


---------80:10----------
like became an investment banker and was


---------80:13----------
your colleague and you guys were you


---------80:14----------
guys were neighbors and now he's so


---------80:16----------
successful and now you're a piece of


---------80:18----------
[ __ ] and he's married and he's going on


---------80:21----------
a hunting like we look at some successes


---------80:23----------
and we try it but we don't realize that


---------80:25----------
there are equally good successes that


---------80:27----------
are just hard to detect and subtle and


---------80:31----------
that your path in life isn't going to


---------80:33----------
look like the fantasy that you come up


---------80:35----------
with in your mind so it's my fastest


---------80:41----------
success basically and trying something


---------80:44----------
new until I find the right thing for me


---------80:48----------
for example ask these guys I don't know


---------80:53----------
the answer that question what do you


---------80:57----------
guys think he keeps mentioning : arey


---------81:02----------
you said that a few times I mainly


---------81:08----------
switch out of that because even course


---------81:12----------
are telling me that maybe it's not a


---------81:15----------
maybe it's not something that suits me


---------81:17----------
or maybe I'm not like cut out for it is


---------81:19----------
it something that you're proud of or


---------81:22----------
just something you actually enjoy it was


---------81:27----------
a little bit of both until I realized


---------81:28----------
how stressful it became and at the end


---------81:36----------
of the day it's like it doesn't pay as


---------81:41----------
much as I would like it to so what do


---------81:45----------
you guys do


---------81:45----------
Lotus should do he's 21 right


---------81:53----------
are you America I'm I kinda in Canada I


---------82:00----------
worked as a chef for a little bit and I


---------82:02----------
hated it made the decision to stop but I


---------82:05----------
also was really bad at it and didn't


---------82:07----------
care about it so I think it kind of


---------82:09----------
matters how much do you care about it


---------82:10----------
and how much do you want money so my


---------82:19----------
plan right now


---------82:19----------
she just go back to school for trades


---------82:22----------
program was just like completely


---------82:24----------
different right and the idea is to


---------82:27----------
actually you just try it out see how it


---------82:29----------
worked


---------82:29----------
see how I like it if I don't like it so


---------82:35----------
I want to offer just a little bit of


---------82:36----------
advice here so the other thing that I


---------82:38----------
want you guys to understand is that so I


---------82:40----------
think going back and getting a trade


---------82:42----------
getting trained in a trade is like a


---------82:44----------
good idea but I want you guys to


---------82:46----------
understand that getting trained in a


---------82:47----------
trade or going back to school is not the


---------82:49----------
career that you're gonna do for the rest


---------82:50----------
of your life like do you guys know what


---------82:54----------
my job is kind of funny question what's


---------82:58----------
my job what do I do you like a couple


---------83:04----------
things right it's like hi 'try faculty


---------83:07----------
what is this


---------83:10----------
this is what I'm passionate about


---------83:13----------
yeah is this what I trained to do


---------83:19----------
exactly so understand that what what you


---------83:24----------
so fulfilling a certain financial


---------83:26----------
security is one thing finding work that


---------83:30----------
you find fulfilling is something else


---------83:32----------
so Lotus I think if you want to get a


---------83:34----------
trade degree and like get a job that


---------83:37----------
pays pretty well like an HVAC or


---------83:39----------
something like that like by all means go


---------83:40----------
for it but don't stop there and


---------83:42----------
understand what you're getting into is


---------83:44----------
not necessarily a fulfilling career that


---------83:47----------
you have some financial needs and that


---------83:49----------
like you should continue looking for the


---------83:52----------
things that make you happy I mean that


---------83:54----------
over time so I do believe that the world


---------83:58----------
rewards just from a Darwinian or


---------84:00----------
evolutionary perspective people who


---------84:02----------
really really care about stuff because I


---------84:05----------
think the world is filled with people


---------84:07----------
like an Aussie who give two shits about


---------84:10----------
their job and produce 50% quality work


---------84:12----------
and so it's up every now and then


---------84:15----------
someone comes along who genuinely cares


---------84:18----------
about what they do and there's like


---------84:19----------
financial reward in that that's my


---------84:22----------
general belief in observation


---------84:24----------
so I'd say for lotus-like you guys also


---------84:26----------
have to understand that fixing your life


---------84:28----------
is gonna be a series of like missteps


---------84:32----------
right but you have to take the step that


---------84:34----------
like you gotta take now so if you want


---------84:36----------
to get like a a trade degree by all


---------84:38----------
means go for it but don't assume for a


---------84:40----------
second that the fulfillment that rune


---------84:42----------
gets for making music is going to come


---------84:45----------
from that it may come from that you


---------84:47----------
could end up being lucky but your


---------84:49----------
journey does not stop there that's the


---------84:51----------
other big lie that the boomers taught us


---------84:53----------
which is that your education is your


---------84:56----------
career and your career should be


---------84:58----------
enjoyable and fulfilling like I don't


---------85:02----------
accept that for a second


---------85:03----------
like I think careers can change wildly


---------85:06----------
and that what you find fulfillment from


---------85:10----------
is something that you should work on and


---------85:11----------
then like the other good thing that


---------85:13----------
boomers like I don't agree with it all


---------85:15----------
is that like boomers think that you


---------85:17----------
should have like a job and then you


---------85:19----------
should have hobbies no I think the world


---------85:21----------
is quickly becoming a place where your


---------85:24----------
hobbies are worth just as much as a job


---------85:26----------
and what I mean by that is the barriers


---------85:30----------
to publication or lower so like you have


---------85:32----------
solo dudes who will like create video


---------85:35----------
games and put them on Steam and will


---------85:36----------
make tons of money from it because


---------85:38----------
that's what they care about and they


---------85:39----------
have a job that whole time you have


---------85:41----------
people who work like you know overnight


---------85:43----------
shifts at hotels and like write books


---------85:46----------
because that's what they care about


---------85:47----------
that's what I think you guys should do


---------85:49----------
if you need to do some kind of work in


---------85:52----------
the meantime like the reason I'm a


---------85:54----------
psychiatrist is because I have to


---------85:55----------
support a family I love talking to


---------85:57----------
gamers that's what I love doing and this


---------86:00----------
is also where right now I think the real


---------86:02----------
problem is that you guys gravitate and


---------86:04----------
I'm sorry if I'm not getting to the


---------86:05----------
other topics but I feel like preaching


---------86:08----------
is that okay is that that's fine go for


---------86:12----------
my dude okay so I think the other thing


---------86:14----------
is that you guys really have to think a


---------86:16----------
little bit about you know right now


---------86:20----------
you're avoiding pain and seeking


---------86:23----------
pleasure but the way for you guys to


---------86:27----------
like study hard and even if it sucks is


---------86:31----------
for you to have studying be in service


---------86:33----------
to another goal so like if an Aussie


---------86:38----------
says okay I want to like write you know


---------86:41----------
a fantasy fiction novel


---------86:44----------
and in order to do that I have to


---------86:46----------
support myself for some time I think


---------86:47----------
then his ability to study is gonna be


---------86:49----------
way better does that make sense like


---------86:54----------
I've got to support myself for some way


---------86:56----------
while I like figure out what I want to


---------86:59----------
do but the problem is that right now


---------87:02----------
school is the goal for you guys it's not


---------87:05----------
a means your job is the goal it's not a


---------87:08----------
means and it's a goal that you guys


---------87:09----------
don't care about so you're not gonna


---------87:11----------
give your best so I think you could get


---------87:13----------
a job by all means be financially


---------87:15----------
independent but understand that the the


---------87:17----------
financial independence is just money so


---------87:19----------
that you can actually get on to living


---------87:21----------
the life that you want does that make


---------87:26----------
sense


---------87:26----------
questions yes like the question I have


---------87:31----------
it's like if we acknowledged I like the


---------87:33----------
the fulfilling the fulfillment and then


---------87:36----------
like the money like the financial


---------87:37----------
securities are two different things then


---------87:40----------
like we're like the boomers isn't like


---------87:42----------
reaction like remembers reaction to each


---------87:44----------
individual thing right


---------87:46----------
or is it like do they just lump them


---------87:48----------
together the boomers don't care about


---------87:50----------
fulfillment like that's the basic


---------87:54----------
problem so I think like they lived in a


---------87:56----------
day in time where like the stress on our


---------87:59----------
mind and what we care about and stuff


---------88:01----------
like that it's changed something has


---------88:02----------
changed within humanity like over the


---------88:04----------
last 20 or 30 years I don't quite know


---------88:06----------
what it is but fulfillment has become


---------88:08----------
way more important I think there's a


---------88:10----------
reason why there's been an explosion of


---------88:12----------
yoga across the world and it's I think


---------88:14----------
because people are looking for more


---------88:16----------
peace and harmony and fulfillment and I


---------88:18----------
think part of that is probably because


---------88:20----------
like the clothes so what's actually I


---------88:23----------
just maybe figured it out you guys know


---------88:25----------
what Maslow's hierarchy of needs is


---------88:26----------
mmm-hmm so like fifty years ago or a


---------88:29----------
hundred years ago where were we on


---------88:31----------
Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a society


---------88:34----------
survive absolutely right so that's at


---------88:37----------
the bottom where are we now


---------88:44----------
is the factorization absolutely right so


---------88:47----------
automation lab-grown food the universal


---------88:52----------
basic income belonging huh see all love


---------88:56----------
and belonging you know what you guys


---------88:57----------
talk about so but my point is that like


---------89:00----------
I think the stresses on humanity are


---------89:01----------
changing we're like we're not the things


---------89:04----------
that you we used to worry about her and


---------89:06----------
like we're closer to the top like


---------89:08----------
shelter and stuff is like you know


---------89:10----------
you're for the most part isn't like as


---------89:12----------
big of a problem infant mortality a


---------89:14----------
hundred years ago was like twenty


---------89:15----------
percent just think about that you know


---------89:20----------
like not many kids died now and that's


---------89:25----------
what they used to worry about and like


---------89:26----------
now the closer we are towards the top


---------89:28----------
the more like the things that we have to


---------89:30----------
worry about become mental so the boomers


---------89:32----------
just don't understand that and it's not


---------89:34----------
their fault it's just we're living in a


---------89:35----------
different world so I got a run in about


---------89:40----------
fifteen minutes so I'm gonna give you


---------89:41----------
guys a choice do you guys want to talk


---------89:44----------
about isolation or agency I say


---------89:48----------
isolation isolation so let's talk about


---------89:52----------
it what what makes you feel isolated its


---------89:59----------
loneliness having no friends okay so


---------90:06----------
let's think about this for a second okay


---------90:09----------
so if you have no friends let me just


---------90:14----------
think for a second about how to try to


---------90:17----------
do something substantive in 15 minutes


---------90:19----------
about this I have two friends they're in


---------90:22----------
here yeah so do you feel I so let's just


---------90:27----------
think about that for a second how how


---------90:29----------
much do online relationships matter um


---------90:34----------
to me like it means a lot but for like


---------90:38----------
your average person who goes outside has


---------90:42----------
real friends I don't know do you think


---------90:44----------
that you don't have real friends no like


---------90:48----------
no okay so buy real friends you don't


---------90:52----------
mean like authentic friends you mean


---------90:54----------
like physical friends yeah


---------91:03----------
I'm just thinking for a second what do


---------91:06----------
you think it is that makes you feel


---------91:07----------
isolated for the other folks I spend


---------91:13----------
like all my time home alone okay


---------91:17----------
whenever a lot of unis it's I don't have


---------91:20----------
a job and even throughout school I'd


---------91:23----------
premature always just come home play


---------91:25----------
games by myself just in my room it's


---------91:27----------
pretty much where well hold on are you


---------91:29----------
playing single-player games no normally


---------91:33----------
multiplayer but alone okay hmm I think


---------91:43----------
this may take more than 15 minutes


---------91:45----------
unfortunately are - yeah I guess so


---------91:49----------
I mean I I think I want to do this


---------91:51----------
justice and I'm just not seeing I think


---------91:53----------
this is a whole different issue you know


---------91:55----------
like I don't think this is actually


---------91:57----------
related to the like what we've been


---------91:58----------
talking about for an hour and a half I


---------92:01----------
mean it's may be related but I think


---------92:03----------
it's it's it's own thing like how I tied


---------92:06----------
ins like for me le it's like the


---------92:08----------
autopilot also drove into the isolation


---------92:11----------
where it's like okay in the autopilot


---------92:13----------
like algorithm it's like being alone is


---------92:16----------
fine but like that's how I programmed my


---------92:18----------
autopilot right mm-hmm


---------92:22----------
certainty of like Oh what if I let if I


---------92:25----------
open myself up right like what happens


---------92:27----------
so it's like that's how I tie it yeah so


---------92:31----------
I think we have to you guys know like


---------92:33----------
how you know going out and trying new


---------92:36----------
things as sort of a conclusion we came


---------92:38----------
to but we didn't just say just try new


---------92:42----------
stuff right there's like a different way


---------92:43----------
of understanding like walking the road


---------92:46----------
of uncertainty I think we have to do the


---------92:48----------
same thing with isolation it's not it's


---------92:50----------
not as simple as saying just go out and


---------92:52----------
make friends I think it's understanding


---------92:54----------
and I just don't I don't I don't


---------92:56----------
understand it so I don't understand what


---------92:59----------
it is that makes you guys feel isolated


---------93:00----------
and you guys are giving me some really


---------93:02----------
good answers but I think actually


---------93:04----------
there's more to it so I I think that the


---------93:07----------
problem isn't just that you know don't


---------93:09----------
know people I think the problem is that


---------93:11----------
when you meet or a problem is that when


---------93:13----------
you meet people you can't show them who


---------93:15----------
you are and there's no point in like


---------93:21----------
going out and being fake like that's not


---------93:24----------
like even if you guys have friends or


---------93:27----------
hanging out with people I think if you


---------93:28----------
can't show them who you are it's still


---------93:30----------
isolating so that their their different


---------93:33----------
perspective their different layers to


---------93:35----------
this that I'm picking up right now I


---------93:38----------
just I want to do it justice and I just


---------93:40----------
don't think we can do that in like


---------93:41----------
another five to ten minutes but so


---------93:46----------
apologies for that guys I've noticed


---------93:49----------
something on the server i lurk around


---------93:52----------
the healthy gamer discord sometimes and


---------93:55----------
this seems like a really common theme on


---------93:58----------
the server actually just people who


---------93:59----------
don't have a whole lot of like real life


---------94:01----------
connections and you asked earlier


---------94:03----------
whether or not like online friends and


---------94:05----------
real life friends can be you know if


---------94:08----------
they're the same value I think they can


---------94:10----------
be but I think often times there's


---------94:11----------
something about being in a room with


---------94:12----------
someone that really isn't fully


---------94:14----------
replaceable


---------94:15----------
I completely agree


---------94:17----------
so I'll give you guys so in the last


---------94:19----------
five to ten minutes I'll give you guys a


---------94:20----------
chance to ask questions or anyone have


---------94:23----------
like kind of closing thoughts or let's


---------94:28----------
start with actions so I had a question


---------94:30----------
about Lake back to like like the dota


---------94:34----------
stuff where it's like like say it's like


---------94:37----------
oh I can't


---------94:39----------
it's like my thing right it was like oh


---------94:41----------
they were winning because an item is


---------94:44----------
broken like like their success like the


---------94:48----------
Doomer mentality where it's like oh


---------94:49----------
they're doing well not because they'd


---------94:51----------
fall on the guy but it's like oh that


---------94:52----------
items broken or like that characters


---------94:54----------
broken like would that follow under the


---------94:57----------
noumic mentality kind of because it's


---------94:59----------
like it's not putting anything on you


---------95:02----------
but like something else something


---------95:03----------
external I don't I don't quite follow


---------95:07----------
your analogy but my instinct isn't not


---------95:10----------
really I don't know that that's the


---------95:11----------
Boomer mentality or you saying do I do


---------95:14----------
me do me do me


---------95:16----------
yeah so I think that that is so here's


---------95:21----------
what I'm hearing you saying so I think


---------95:23----------
this kind of actually goes back to


---------95:24----------
agency and like who's responsible and I


---------95:28----------
think a lot of times people attribute


---------95:30----------
other people's successes to


---------95:33----------
circumstances and and I think that


---------95:38----------
that's not I mean some some of that's


---------95:40----------
true right so some people have more


---------95:42----------
advantages than you do in life and so


---------95:45----------
they have a leg up and that's true is


---------95:47----------
that fair no is it equal no but I think


---------95:51----------
generally speaking when someone talks


---------95:54----------
about something being dopey that's ego


---------95:57----------
more than anything else right that's


---------96:00----------
like you don't want to it like you don't


---------96:03----------
want to look at your own shortcomings


---------96:04----------
and you want to just simplify and


---------96:09----------
protect yourself from where you fall


---------96:12----------
short so you call something dopey but


---------96:15----------
you know if you just think about it in a


---------96:17----------
video game when someone calls something


---------96:18----------
Opie what they really mean is this


---------96:20----------
person is beating me and I can't accept


---------96:24----------
that the reason that they're beating me


---------96:25----------
is because they're playing better so


---------96:27----------
instead what I'm gonna say is that


---------96:28----------
they're ropey right that item is Opie


---------96:33----------
and I mean sometimes things are Opie but


---------96:37----------
you know I think for the most part like


---------96:39----------
if you're thinking in the mentality of


---------96:42----------
you know someone else has like an


---------96:43----------
advantage over you and that's the reason


---------96:45----------
they're successful like I think that


---------96:47----------
that's not really a it's not a


---------96:49----------
productive way of thinking whether it's


---------96:50----------
right or whether it's wrong it just


---------96:51----------
doesn't help you because the issue is


---------96:53----------
like what do you have right and how do


---------96:55----------
you get to where you want to go


---------96:57----------
and and sometimes you have to come up


---------96:59----------
with an unorthodox strategy to like move


---------97:01----------
forward in your own life which i think


---------97:04----------
is unfortunate because the boomers had a


---------97:06----------
formula like that's the other big thing


---------97:07----------
no one gave us like there's no formula


---------97:10----------
for us because this is new like the the


---------97:14----------
epidemic of loneliness is like new like


---------97:19----------
human beings used to hang out because we


---------97:20----------
didn't have technology to separate us


---------97:22----------
like we just you know now it's like


---------97:24----------
between ubereats and like grocery


---------97:26----------
delivery and all kinds of other stuff


---------97:28----------
like I never have to leave my I can live


---------97:30----------
in the middle of it a million people and


---------97:32----------
never see any of them and so I think


---------97:35----------
part of the challenge is that we have to


---------97:37----------
figure out how we're gonna move forward


---------97:39----------
and that's gonna happen from hopefully


---------97:41----------
conversations like this cuz I don't have


---------97:43----------
all the answers guys like you guys know


---------97:45----------
I mean you guys know what it's like to


---------97:48----------
be in your shoes and and you guys have


---------97:51----------
to help each other out because I don't


---------97:52----------
know I mean I'm in a different stage of


---------97:54----------
my life and you all need to help each


---------97:58----------
other out in terms of figuring out like


---------98:00----------
how do you deal with isolation I'm not


---------98:01----------
sure but I think we should continue to


---------98:02----------
talk about it I'm happy to play referee


---------98:04----------
but you all have to be the ones that


---------98:05----------
play the game other questions and we're


---------98:17----------
talking about the whole guy going out on


---------98:19----------
a limb and trying to new things and


---------98:21----------
failing and learning I feel like like


---------98:24----------
over my I've been doing music since I


---------98:27----------
was like eight but I had took I've been


---------98:29----------
taking it more seriously for the past


---------98:30----------
few years and over that time it there's


---------98:33----------
a lot of moments or like I almost quit


---------98:35----------
or almost gave ups and like this is I'm


---------98:37----------
awful at this I'm just terrible at this


---------98:38----------
I just hate everything I make go make a


---------98:40----------
song and then the next day I'll be like


---------98:41----------
this is the worst thing I've ever heard


---------98:42----------
in my life and I think that comes on


---------98:45----------
down to a lot of like just


---------98:47----------
disproportionate self-love it


---------98:49----------
self-loathing and it's something I still


---------98:51----------
struggle with and I don't I haven't


---------98:53----------
really found like a good way to deal


---------98:55----------
with it other than just to stop thinking


---------98:57----------
about that and go to the next song make


---------98:59----------
Celine do you have any you like no


---------99:04----------
insight yes and no so I think you've


---------99:08----------
figured out the most important solution


---------99:11----------
so I don't know if you guys I mean so


---------99:14----------
people think that I'm good at what I do


---------99:16----------
on stream and like I was a really bad


---------99:19----------
therapist for like three years and I


---------99:23----------
really started to become a better there


---------99:26----------
it's not even therapy I started become a


---------99:28----------
better therapist when I stopped doing


---------99:29----------
therapy so literally what happened is


---------99:31----------
like I would I got taught a certain way


---------99:33----------
to do therapy and then I was bad at it


---------99:36----------
and and I think that what you said is


---------99:39----------
actually the most important thing which


---------99:40----------
is to like don't let the way that you


---------99:43----------
feel about your performance affect


---------99:46----------
whether you try again right whether you


---------99:54----------
try again shouldn't be determined by


---------99:56----------
your performance it should be determined


---------99:58----------
by your passion towards the subject like


---------100:03----------
don't just keep trying I mean it's fine


---------100:05----------
to quit I think it's it's good to quit


---------100:07----------
but quit for the right reasons quit


---------100:11----------
because you actually don't care about it


---------100:12----------
don't quit it's something because you're


---------100:13----------
bad


---------100:14----------
this cycle every single time for me is


---------100:17----------
like I'll make something I like it for


---------100:19----------
like two hours and then and then I hate


---------100:21----------
it I don't do any music for like 24


---------100:24----------
hours and then I hear something that I'm


---------100:25----------
like holy [ __ ] that's beautiful and I


---------100:27----------
have to go do that oh he likes a new


---------100:29----------
artist and like a new song out or


---------100:30----------
something so it's like this like that


---------100:32----------
inspiration that passion comes back and


---------100:34----------
drives me to do it again yeah so so what


---------100:36----------
I hear there is that there's something


---------100:37----------
inside you that longs to create music


---------100:39----------
and like you said there's a some scar or


---------100:42----------
like you know ball of self-loathing that


---------100:46----------
comes out and likes to play from time to


---------100:48----------
time


---------100:48----------
and understand that that ball of


---------100:51----------
loathing is not actually you it's just a


---------100:54----------
ball of self-loathing that has built up


---------100:56----------
over years and years and years as you've


---------100:58----------
become like a Doomer you know some of


---------101:01----------
the time and and that's how it works so


---------101:03----------
I want you guys to understand that the


---------101:05----------
self-loathing that you have for yourself


---------101:06----------
is not really the real you it's just


---------101:09----------
like up later than a cognitive pattern


---------101:11----------
in your mind you know like when you get


---------101:14----------
a song stuck in your head and the song


---------101:15----------
just kind of randomly pops up and like


---------101:17----------
plays on autopilot for a while and then


---------101:18----------
randomly goes away


---------101:20----------
that's like a feeling of like


---------101:21----------
self-loathing literally functions like


---------101:23----------
that


---------101:23----------
it pops up there are times where you're


---------101:26----------
feeling okay and then the self-loathing


---------101:28----------
just pops up and it's like hey you


---------101:29----------
[ __ ] suck at life uh and then you


---------101:33----------
feel that way for a while and for some


---------101:35----------
people it's longer and for some people


---------101:36----------
it's less and then it kind of leaves


---------101:38----------
your mind for a while and then you're


---------101:39----------
kind of living and you're feeling good


---------101:41----------
about yourself you're able to get out of


---------101:42----------
bed and that song pops up in here oh you


---------101:44----------
suck at life right so it just because


---------101:47----------
these we have these cognitive things


---------101:49----------
that exist within our mind doesn't mean


---------101:52----------
that they're they're true they're not


---------101:53----------
correct it doesn't mean you actually


---------101:55----------
suck at life and so just notice that


---------101:58----------
that self-loathing arises and like


---------102:01----------
notice when it's there and noticed this


---------102:03----------
is part of the pattern and take some


---------102:05----------
comfort in the fact that that's gonna go


---------102:07----------
away and your inspiration will return so


---------102:11----------
I think you're well on the right path


---------102:13----------
good could be here so I'm just gonna ask


---------102:18----------
people kind of for closing thoughts so


---------102:20----------
what I'd love to hear is a little bit


---------102:21----------
about you know how you found the session


---------102:25----------
and and if you learned something I'd


---------102:27----------
love to hear what that was if you felt


---------102:31----------
like there are things that you'd still


---------102:32----------
like to explore I'd love to hear what


---------102:34----------
what that is as well so I think we can


---------102:36----------
maybe just go around the room


---------102:43----------
oh is that me starting sure um as far as


---------102:49----------
learning something I don't know it's


---------102:53----------
really just more a reflection of things


---------102:57----------
that I've kind of thought or guessed at


---------103:00----------
myself but uh hearing it from other


---------103:03----------
people I don't know it kind of confirms


---------103:06----------
it


---------103:07----------
I don't trust in my opinion as much as


---------103:09----------
I'd say I trust in others


---------103:13----------
excellent point it's very nice to be


---------103:18----------
able to sorry but you go you go I'm just


---------103:22----------
gonna I'm kind of building on what


---------103:23----------
Strait said it's really nice to be able


---------103:24----------
to go into the nuances of these things


---------103:29----------
in a setting where everyone is on the


---------103:31----------
same page already and it there's like a


---------103:35----------
nice feeling of support I think just


---------103:36----------
from that alone yeah like like you said


---------103:41----------
like because it's we're talking I like


---------103:43----------
nuanced things like the Dumon mentality


---------103:46----------
can go so in-depth into these nuanced


---------103:49----------
things and so I guess like the


---------103:51----------
realization of like how much of like if


---------103:54----------
you said loneliness is a problem and


---------103:55----------
like all these like factors but in terms


---------103:58----------
and I acknowledge that and in terms of


---------104:00----------
sort of like the steps to go on a path


---------104:03----------
of quote-unquote fixing it or dealing


---------104:05----------
with it I learned that's like I need to


---------104:07----------
set myself in situations where I should


---------104:10----------
try not to look at like the success or


---------104:12----------
failure part but more of the learning


---------104:14----------
and teaching part and things I try I


---------104:22----------
really


---------104:23----------
the phrase set myself in situations so I


---------104:27----------
think that goes to the balance we are


---------104:29----------
still haven't teased apart about what is


---------104:31----------
the environment responsible for and what


---------104:33----------
are you responsible for right so like


---------104:37----------
what I like about that is it's not like


---------104:39----------
all you or all the environment it's not


---------104:41----------
that the item is opie it's not that you


---------104:43----------
suck at the game it's that there's a


---------104:45----------
there's an environment person


---------104:47----------
interaction and the better you set that


---------104:50----------
up the more likely you are the more


---------104:52----------
optimistic it sounds like you're gonna


---------104:54----------
feel so we can get to that maybe next


---------104:57----------
time better and ah see next time yeah


---------105:01----------
it's pretty much the same what everyone


---------105:03----------
else said but the one thing I'd want to


---------105:05----------
go in tomorrow's isolation okay it's


---------105:07----------
definitely a big thing for me what about


---------105:10----------
what the other people said kind of


---------105:11----------
resonates with you just being able to


---------105:15----------
bounce off ideas and how are we all same


---------105:18----------
in different aspects okay thanks for


---------105:25----------
sure and lotus-eyed say that like it's


---------105:32----------
really reassuring to hear that whenever


---------105:34----------
I fall into a cycle of feeling all these


---------105:37----------
negative thoughts and feeling very


---------105:39----------
pessimistic and not wanting to camera


---------105:40----------
fed I don't have to leap out of the bed


---------105:43----------
immediately and try to just you know man


---------105:46----------
up and like take it all head-on it's


---------105:49----------
okay to sort of take it one step at a


---------105:52----------
time and you know all of this socially


---------105:55----------
I'm gonna get a sauce with dissipate and


---------105:57----------
maybe I'll start feeling better over


---------105:58----------
time it's not some instant


---------106:00----------
transformation yeah very well set I


---------106:04----------
think like change in growth and progress


---------106:06----------
is not like I think the other thing that


---------106:08----------
I'm glad Lotus it sounds like you're


---------106:10----------
giving yourself a lot of time right so


---------106:12----------
that's the other big thing which I love


---------106:14----------
it if you guys could take aways that


---------106:16----------
give yourselves time to build the life


---------106:19----------
that you want it's not like you're gonna


---------106:22----------
switch majors and you're gonna be happy


---------106:24----------
it's it's like exactly what rune said


---------106:26----------
that he made music and it was actually


---------106:29----------
shitty it was like painful and uncertain


---------106:33----------
and weird and he stuck with it he he


---------106:35----------
held on to not held on


---------106:37----------
he listened to his inspiration and I


---------106:40----------
think each and every one of you has


---------106:41----------
something that like has inspires you as


---------106:44----------
well it's just you've been taught this


---------106:46----------
formula for success that has taught you


---------106:49----------
to not listen to that part of yourself


---------106:52----------
but we live in a world where video games


---------106:54----------
are the dominant form of entertainment


---------106:57----------
they've passed everything else right and


---------107:01----------
like that's actually really cool like


---------107:03----------
I'm thrilled about that I'm thrilled


---------107:05----------
that we live in a world where there are


---------107:07----------
indie game studios that can build games


---------107:09----------
that I like to play like really really


---------107:12----------
remote games that like most people would


---------107:14----------
not care about and we live in a world


---------107:17----------
where more people are writing than ever


---------107:18----------
we live in a world where with things


---------107:20----------
like Spotify I can actually listen to


---------107:22----------
runes music if he wants to upload it


---------107:24----------
right we live in a world where someone


---------107:28----------
made the you know that the hog the [ __ ]


---------107:32----------
pong right in like like just think about


---------107:37----------
this for a second the person who made


---------107:38----------
the [ __ ] COG song is probably [ __ ]


---------107:40----------
depressed and isolated in a Doomer but


---------107:43----------
they had a flash of inspiration and they


---------107:45----------
created something beautiful bro get them


---------107:48----------
in here or they a dude it's but just


---------107:50----------
think about this this is coming from our


---------107:52----------
community it's coming from you guys and


---------107:54----------
like can't you see that no matter how


---------107:57----------
depressed or down that person is they've


---------107:59----------
created something that is truly


---------108:01----------
beautiful and has brought a smile and


---------108:03----------
joy to thousands of people beautiful and


---------108:07----------
it's like 56 seconds of awfulness


---------108:12----------
but it's so wonderful I'm equal parts


---------108:17----------
mortified and flattered I think goes the


---------108:21----------
intention right like my kids are gonna


---------108:25----------
like hear that one day like can you guys


---------108:29----------
think about the amount of dad


---------108:30----------
embarrassment like once my kid is gonna


---------108:33----------
go to school at the age of 15 and one of


---------108:36----------
their friends is gonna play that on


---------108:37----------
their phone it's terrifying anyway so


---------108:44----------
