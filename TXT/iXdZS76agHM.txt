---------00:00----------
i feel like i've been abducted by aliens


---------00:01----------
and they're about to aimly probe me


---------00:03----------
you know what i'm talking about yeah


---------00:05----------
that sweater feels like i've come to


---------00:06----------
your house and you're ready like you've


---------00:07----------
opened your mind up to me


---------00:08----------
it seems like we're we're on a more


---------00:10----------
human you know


---------00:12----------
level rather than like an objective


---------00:14----------
specimen level does that make sense


---------00:16----------
yeah i'm glad you feel that way


---------00:22----------
train and i had to arrange for our


---------00:27----------
what what are you what are you drinking


---------00:28----------
man that sounded satisfying holy [ __ ]


---------00:30----------
you know


---------00:31----------
uh you know so you know i'm persian


---------00:35----------
yeah and a lot of iranians a lot of


---------00:38----------
persians they say


---------00:40----------
earl grey tea is the closest thing to


---------00:42----------
persian tea but i actually disagree


---------00:45----------
i think english breakfast is so this is


---------00:47----------
english breakfast


---------00:49----------
yeah i don't think earl grey reminds me


---------00:51----------
of you know persian tea i don't know if


---------00:53----------
i've really had persian tea but i've had


---------00:56----------
you know tea from the mena region


---------01:00----------
and i i mean earl grey is like there's


---------01:01----------
not there isn't hint of


---------01:04----------
i i'd agree i'd say english breakfast


---------01:06----------
but earl grey is like


---------01:07----------
the bergamot is like or bergamot or


---------01:09----------
however you pronounce it


---------01:11----------
it doesn't seem to be there yeah there


---------01:14----------
is like a


---------01:15----------
they taste similar but there's like a


---------01:16----------
distinct difference in earl green for


---------01:18----------
some reason earl grey gives me a


---------01:19----------
stomachache


---------01:20----------
it's really weird yeah maybe maybe the


---------01:23----------
the citrus oils or whatever


---------01:25----------
yeah yeah it's probably something like


---------01:27----------
that i just don't like that little


---------01:28----------
aftertaste either so


---------01:29----------
yeah english breakfast is the way to go


---------01:31----------
how have you been


---------01:32----------
good man um staying busy


---------01:36----------
but good cool good good good um


---------01:39----------
a lot of my patients are really


---------01:40----------
struggling right now so i've been


---------01:42----------
a little bit busier i'm sorry yeah


---------01:45----------
covet's hard on people's mental health


---------01:48----------
it is we didn't we didn't quite realize


---------01:51----------
yeah kovit's been uh yeah


---------01:55----------
definitely uh causing me some anxiety


---------01:58----------
just like uh like


---------02:01----------
i feel like visiting my parents i'm


---------02:03----------
stuck in this uh


---------02:05----------
i'm stuck in this like i'm just like


---------02:08----------
filled with anxiety


---------02:09----------
and stress because i want to go see my


---------02:11----------
parents really bad i miss them you know


---------02:13----------
i love them


---------02:14----------
and you know they want me to come real


---------02:16----------
badly too and


---------02:17----------
i understand there's like you know


---------02:19----------
instant tests this and that but even


---------02:21----------
just


---------02:21----------
even a 0.01 chance of me somehow


---------02:25----------
catching it


---------02:26----------
and giving it to them i just would never


---------02:27----------
forgive myself but on the other hand


---------02:29----------
if i keep pushing it back and this never


---------02:31----------
ends


---------02:32----------
you know who knows what happens you know


---------02:34----------
life comes at you fast so


---------02:36----------
i just i don't know a decision to make


---------02:38----------
does that make sense


---------02:39----------
yeah of course man um and are your are


---------02:42----------
your parents like


---------02:43----------
are they in the u.s is it okay i mean


---------02:45----------
yeah it docks you or anything but just


---------02:47----------
no you're good


---------02:48----------
no no they're in arizona okay so you'd


---------02:51----------
have to fly to see them


---------02:53----------
yeah i would i mean i could drive but


---------02:57----------
that always freaks my mom out and it


---------02:58----------
gives her a lot of she just hates


---------03:00----------
you know she doesn't want me driving


---------03:01----------
long distances so it's a long way man


---------03:04----------
yeah 14 hours that is a long time so i'd


---------03:06----------
have to i'd have to stop some more which


---------03:07----------
defeats the entire purpose of driving


---------03:09----------
yeah yeah that sounds sounds really


---------03:11----------
tricky i think a lot of people are


---------03:12----------
struggling to figure out what the right


---------03:13----------
thing to do is


---------03:15----------
yeah um you know fingers crossed


---------03:17----------
hopefully a vaccine is around the corner


---------03:19----------
and


---------03:19----------
and we'll have uh you know we'll finally


---------03:23----------
get some control over coved yeah


---------03:26----------
definitely


---------03:26----------
knock on wood yeah nothing


---------03:30----------
over um yeah so train is there something


---------03:34----------
in particular that you wanted to talk


---------03:35----------
about today or


---------03:38----------
um


---------03:44----------
hmm


---------03:47----------
i mean you know to be frank


---------03:51----------
i just you know i miss your company


---------03:54----------
cool man i enjoy talking to you you know


---------03:56----------
it's not often i get to talk to uh


---------03:58----------
you know somebody like you and you know


---------03:59----------
we get to bounce back


---------04:01----------
you know bounce our ideas back and forth


---------04:03----------
you know and uh


---------04:05----------
i don't get much of that depth uh you


---------04:07----------
know around these parts of twitch people


---------04:08----------
are usually more


---------04:10----------
you know you kind of get what you see


---------04:14----------
and and what do you end up getting from


---------04:16----------
other people


---------04:17----------
just surface level that's it i'm not


---------04:20----------
sure if that's


---------04:21----------
uh you know the end i doubt that is but


---------04:24----------
i don't think very many people like to


---------04:25----------
open up on twitch um with each other at


---------04:28----------
least right maybe with you yes


---------04:30----------
but with each other i think it's more


---------04:31----------
surface level stuff i think everyone's


---------04:33----------
always playing uh


---------04:35----------
you know there's always a politics to


---------04:37----------
play you know people don't want to give


---------04:38----------
their vulnerability vulnerabilities


---------04:40----------
right because they could be used as a


---------04:42----------
weapon against them which i don't blame


---------04:43----------
them that's kind of just the world we


---------04:44----------
live in


---------04:45----------
yeah so it's unfortunate isn't it it is


---------04:50----------
and and what do you um


---------04:54----------
i'm happy to answer these questions that


---------04:56----------
i'm about to ask you


---------04:57----------
as well but what do you appreciate about


---------04:59----------
our conversations


---------05:02----------
um for the most part


---------05:06----------
i appreciate the


---------05:10----------
um unbiasedness i appreciate the like


---------05:14----------
objectivity to it i appreciate


---------05:17----------
um you know


---------05:21----------
uh you know don't get me wrong i live a


---------05:23----------
very fortunate life


---------05:24----------
you know i'm in a very fortunate place


---------05:26----------
especially during covet you know i have


---------05:27----------
an amazing job make a lot of money


---------05:29----------
um but definitely


---------05:33----------
i think it's always an uphill battle


---------05:35----------
when it comes to


---------05:36----------
people's first impressions of me right


---------05:38----------
with you


---------05:40----------
even if you may have felt anything


---------05:42----------
negative


---------05:43----------
about me i feel like you had the wisdom


---------05:45----------
to put it aside and you know actually


---------05:46----------
talk to me and give me a chance that way


---------05:48----------
so that's what i enjoy


---------05:52----------
i mean uh train just thinking a little


---------05:53----------
bit i think you've faced a lot of


---------05:55----------
judgment bro


---------05:58----------
a lot of judgment


---------06:01----------
yeah some of it


---------06:04----------
justified some of it not but


---------06:12----------
don't we all though i think we all do to


---------06:13----------
a certain degree


---------06:16----------
i mean so you're saying a couple of


---------06:17----------
things that um


---------06:19----------
maybe can be kind of a threat of this


---------06:20----------
discussion you sort of say you're


---------06:22----------
fortunate


---------06:23----------
almost like a disclaimer yeah i wanted


---------06:26----------
to


---------06:26----------
yeah i wanted to make that clear because


---------06:28----------
for some reason uh so like


---------06:30----------
on usually i'd leave that out but


---------06:33----------
on like obviously you know


---------06:36----------
i don't want to say as a public figure


---------06:38----------
it just sounds very weird but like as a


---------06:39----------
public figure i guess


---------06:41----------
for some reason if you're successful


---------06:46----------
and have money then you don't have a


---------06:49----------
right to


---------06:51----------
you know cry about how you feel because


---------06:54----------
you're better than 99


---------06:55----------
you know you better often the 99 percent


---------06:57----------
that don't have money that think money


---------06:59----------
solves everything


---------07:00----------
would trade all of their troubles to


---------07:03----------
just have money right but they don't


---------07:04----------
realize once they get it they'll realize


---------07:06----------
that


---------07:06----------
you know that there's no amount of money


---------07:08----------
that would ever solve or fix


---------07:11----------
the troubles within does that make sense


---------07:13----------
yeah so i i i that is a disclaimer


---------07:15----------
because it seems like that's what people


---------07:16----------
latch on to right oh the big old you


---------07:18----------
know streamer that's living in the one


---------07:20----------
percent he's sad


---------07:21----------
oh big deal right so i just kind of i


---------07:23----------
said as a disclaimer just to avoid like


---------07:25----------
20 minutes of talk yeah i i hear that


---------07:28----------
and what i'm kind of curious about is


---------07:29----------
like what is it like to not


---------07:31----------
allowed to be sad


---------07:39----------
i don't know hey


---------07:42----------
i don't i mean i don't mean to uh


---------07:48----------
for this it's not that deep for me like


---------07:51----------
i think people i think the people that


---------07:52----------
you know care for me


---------07:54----------
they don't do that and the people that


---------07:55----------
kind are just there there's kind of


---------07:56----------
trash talking i just trash talking back


---------07:58----------
it's like that simple i i don't really


---------08:00----------
scurry away into my corner and say oh


---------08:02----------
this is [ __ ] up i just say yo


---------08:03----------
you know suck my dick


---------08:06----------
does that make sense yeah yeah so it's


---------08:08----------
not like that deep yeah yeah


---------08:10----------
let let me let me just make sure i got


---------08:12----------
you so so


---------08:13----------
on the one hand you kind of acknowledge


---------08:14----------
that you are lucky and fortunate in a


---------08:16----------
lot of ways


---------08:17----------
um some of the people that i've worked


---------08:19----------
with i i i've had


---------08:21----------
the opportunity to work with really all


---------08:24----------
walks of


---------08:25----------
life um anywhere from working in a


---------08:27----------
prison to working with


---------08:29----------
um you know successful startup


---------08:32----------
ceos and and one of the things is


---------08:36----------
sometimes like sometimes they do get


---------08:37----------
judged very harshly and it can be really


---------08:39----------
hard


---------08:40----------
to not be allowed to suffer but what i'm


---------08:42----------
hearing from you is that you actually do


---------08:44----------
have a pretty


---------08:44----------
like you do feel like you are allowed to


---------08:47----------
be sad like you don't necessarily have


---------08:48----------
to do it in public


---------08:49----------
and there's sort of the public persona


---------08:50----------
where you don't have to like cry me a


---------08:52----------
river


---------08:53----------
kind of thing but that you know if you


---------08:54----------
have authentic feelings you have people


---------08:55----------
to share them with and it's not too big


---------08:57----------
at all


---------08:57----------
for sure yeah yeah 100 for sure


---------09:00----------
there's definitely a lot there's a lot


---------09:02----------
of the good you know


---------09:04----------
the good viewers it's taking me a long


---------09:05----------
time to realize that don't get me wrong


---------09:06----------
you know


---------09:08----------
three four years to realize that you


---------09:09----------
know i used to focus on the negative i


---------09:11----------
think this was just like six seven


---------09:12----------
months ago


---------09:13----------
i was just focused on all the negative


---------09:15----------
and i kind of was ignoring the


---------09:17----------
positive and i realized that i was kind


---------09:19----------
of reinforcing and perpetuating


---------09:22----------
you know the negative because that was


---------09:23----------
the only way they got attention and now


---------09:25----------
i see all the positive and there's a lot


---------09:27----------
of positive there really is some days


---------09:29----------
i think the negative you know goes


---------09:31----------
overboard but i think


---------09:32----------
most days it's a lot of positive


---------09:33----------
comments and a lot of supporters so


---------09:36----------
i do think i what's up can you tell me a


---------09:39----------
little bit about the positive


---------09:41----------
yeah i think they started focusing on


---------09:43----------
the positive like what kind of


---------09:44----------
um i think i think


---------09:48----------
my favorite thing that i've discovered


---------09:50----------
over the last two three months


---------09:52----------
is there are people watching that


---------09:56----------
they have the social intelligence to


---------09:57----------
recognize when i might not


---------09:59----------
feel you know worthy or i may not feel


---------10:03----------
like


---------10:04----------
i'm worth something to myself and they


---------10:06----------
reach out on twitter or instagram or


---------10:08----------
you know in a whisper and they say hey


---------10:11----------
you saved my life or you changed my life


---------10:12----------
or without you i'd be going through this


---------10:14----------
and that


---------10:15----------
and you know they send those messages


---------10:17----------
pretty much you know


---------10:18----------
on on on point when i'm feeling down so


---------10:22----------
i think i think there's a lot of


---------10:23----------
supporters that are watching and they


---------10:24----------
have a pretty good idea they kind of


---------10:25----------
read me


---------10:26----------
because of how long they've watched me


---------10:27----------
so that's kind of what i mean does that


---------10:29----------
make sense


---------10:29----------
yeah it makes a lot of sense yeah so so


---------10:32----------
it's interesting because


---------10:34----------
you know what i'm if you really listen


---------10:35----------
to those words what um


---------10:37----------
what it almost sounds like is they're


---------10:38----------
thanking you but


---------10:40----------
what i'm hearing from you is that


---------10:45----------
they're actually helping you it's not


---------10:48----------
just an expression of gratitude that


---------10:50----------
they recognize that maybe you're feeling


---------10:51----------
a particular way and that like


---------10:53----------
you know they recognize that you may


---------10:56----------
need a little bit of tlc


---------10:58----------
and so they're giving a little bit back


---------11:01----------
i think they're actually


---------11:02----------
what i think they're doing is which is


---------11:04----------
actually kind of beautiful in a way is


---------11:06----------
they're letting me know that


---------11:09----------
that i have a purpose


---------11:12----------
right like in their own way they're


---------11:14----------
trying to let let me know that


---------11:16----------
i play a role in their happiness or in


---------11:19----------
their life


---------11:19----------
right so like i think it's actually way


---------11:22----------
deeper and more beautiful than that to


---------11:23----------
be honest


---------11:24----------
um but yeah i think yeah just that


---------11:28----------
i i've noticed that recently for a long


---------11:29----------
time i just kind of focused on the hate


---------11:31----------
and


---------11:32----------
you know don't get me wrong i still go


---------11:34----------
in and you know do my thing but


---------11:36----------
for the most part i've recognized a lot


---------11:37----------
of the lurkers you know coming out and


---------11:39----------
you know talking to me let me know what


---------11:42----------
people hate you fortune


---------11:54----------
um


---------12:02----------
well that that that little laugh right


---------12:05----------
there you hear that


---------12:06----------
yeah there's a lot like i can recognize


---------12:09----------
a little bit of


---------12:10----------
cockiness to that laugh kind of like a


---------12:12----------
here we go right


---------12:13----------
i think that's what it is does that make


---------12:16----------
sense


---------12:17----------
sure they hate you because


---------12:21----------
you have a cocky response to their


---------12:23----------
complaints


---------12:27----------
or is it the cockiness itself no


---------12:30----------
i'm not it's not that no no no so i


---------12:36----------
think


---------12:40----------
i think it's okay so most people that


---------12:45----------
so here's what i've noticed from a lot


---------12:46----------
of like new viewers a lot of the new


---------12:48----------
viewers that i get


---------12:49----------
they all uh you know as soon as any kind


---------12:52----------
of bullying talk comes up they go yo


---------12:53----------
you're the bully


---------12:54----------
right and then we always show my high


---------12:57----------
school photo when they always start


---------12:58----------
laughing and saying holy [ __ ]


---------12:59----------
right so i think people uh you know


---------13:03----------
they look at this and they think that


---------13:04----------
like i've always been here


---------13:07----------
confidence wise not realizing that


---------13:12----------
right i'm here because i recognized my


---------13:15----------
insecurities you know i went through my


---------13:16----------
periods of insecurity i


---------13:17----------
still have my insecurities right so i


---------13:19----------
think it's more so the thing where


---------13:22----------
there's like a general stereotype for


---------13:24----------
male gamers or male personalities or


---------13:26----------
male larger


---------13:26----------
creators to have some sort of flaw


---------13:30----------
which don't be wrong i have many of


---------13:32----------
those you know i mean look at me


---------13:34----------
you know i look like a gorilla which i


---------13:36----------
like to be honest i like it right but


---------13:38----------
anyways


---------13:38----------
get back to the point i think


---------13:42----------
there needs to be i feel like okay now


---------13:45----------
i could be totally wrong here but i


---------13:47----------
really feel like


---------13:51----------
not everybody but the vote the most


---------13:54----------
vocal viewers


---------13:56----------
i think they need


---------14:00----------
a a streamer


---------14:04----------
or someone they watch to have something


---------14:06----------
that makes them feel better


---------14:10----------
but i feel like my personality and the


---------14:12----------
way i go about things no matter


---------14:13----------
what insults are thrown at me i


---------14:17----------
hold the certain composure


---------14:20----------
that they need


---------14:24----------
to disappear like they need me to like


---------14:26----------
fall in order


---------14:27----------
i can't explain like sure maybe i can


---------14:30----------
help you out in a second but just keep


---------14:32----------
going


---------14:33----------
what i'm trying to say is right so if


---------14:35----------
you notice a lot of the successful


---------14:37----------
streamers they either make fun of


---------14:38----------
themselves whether it's


---------14:39----------
purposefully or accidentally right like


---------14:42----------
it's either just the


---------14:43----------
indirect or like passive thing they have


---------14:45----------
or they're quirky and they're not


---------14:46----------
realizing it or


---------14:47----------
it's like a purposeful like you know


---------14:49----------
degrading themselves in order


---------14:51----------
you know for people to be able to laugh


---------14:53----------
and appreciate them right


---------14:55----------
but if you don't have that or do that i


---------14:58----------
think there is


---------14:59----------
some sort of i don't know i've noticed


---------15:02----------
this throughout


---------15:03----------
uh twitch like does that make sense i


---------15:05----------
don't know if that makes any sense


---------15:07----------
actually


---------15:08----------
yeah i don't know i think it makes a lot


---------15:10----------
of sense so train


---------15:12----------
you know a couple of things that i'm


---------15:13----------
remembering one is that


---------15:15----------
you'll frequently mention that you feel


---------15:18----------
like you're you don't make sense


---------15:21----------
well i know i make sense


---------15:24----------
to me the problem is


---------15:27----------
sometimes i give these like


---------15:30----------
anecdotal examples that


---------15:35----------
may not fully you know


---------15:39----------
uh


---------15:43----------
clear experience it might not exactly


---------15:45----------
well yeah


---------15:47----------
yeah does that make sense so yeah i


---------15:49----------
think there it is again


---------15:51----------
[Laughter]


---------15:53----------
yeah so so let's let me see if i um


---------15:56----------
understood you so you then you tell me


---------15:58----------
if this is you know


---------16:00----------
and then we'll see if it made sense or


---------16:01----------
not i thought it makes sense yeah so


---------16:02----------
like


---------16:03----------
you know i think a lot of times so if we


---------16:06----------
let's talk about ego for a second okay


---------16:08----------
sure so our ego i i generally think of


---------16:12----------
our ego as a defensive mechanism that


---------16:14----------
protects us from feeling bad


---------16:16----------
so you know if you call me stupid then


---------16:19----------
[ __ ] you you're stupid


---------16:20----------
that's what my ego does right it sort of


---------16:22----------
like rises up


---------16:23----------
and then it puts other people down so


---------16:25----------
usually the way that the ego helps us


---------16:27----------
feel better about ourselves is it kind


---------16:29----------
of pumps us up


---------16:30----------
or it puts other people down and then


---------16:33----------
the interesting thing is that like if


---------16:35----------
you think about putting


---------16:36----------
other people down


---------16:39----------
there's uh you gain more value


---------16:42----------
the bigger the person is so if i'm


---------16:44----------
feeling bad about myself


---------16:46----------
and then i go if i take a


---------16:50----------
tree and i i


---------16:54----------
play against a tree in overwatch


---------16:57----------
and i win against a plant i don't feel


---------16:59----------
any sense of satisfaction


---------17:02----------
right because like if i like if i play


---------17:04----------
chess against my three-year-old


---------17:05----------
and i crush her it's like my ego is not


---------17:07----------
gonna get anything from that


---------17:09----------
and so the the bigger someone is the


---------17:11----------
more we gain


---------17:13----------
from like putting them down right


---------17:16----------
and i think we see a colossal amount of


---------17:18----------
hate towards public figures


---------17:21----------
and i think sometimes they do things


---------17:22----------
that you know genuinely


---------17:24----------
speaking or kind of out of line and


---------17:26----------
stuff like that but i i think generally


---------17:27----------
speaking i don't think that the


---------17:30----------
amount of toxicity that public figures


---------17:33----------
get


---------17:33----------
get is proportional to like how bad they


---------17:36----------
are


---------17:37----------
because generally speaking i think that


---------17:38----------
like most people are about


---------17:40----------
in the ballpark of the same amount of


---------17:41----------
good and bad and it's not true


---------17:44----------
you know so it's just one person just


---------17:45----------
happens to be public


---------17:47----------
but i i have noticed this thing where a


---------17:49----------
lot of people and you'll see this a lot


---------17:51----------
like i was trying to understand why


---------17:52----------
people make hate videos


---------17:55----------
yeah you know like when a lot of people


---------17:56----------
make hate videos and like


---------17:58----------
like i sort of understand that there's a


---------18:01----------
population that likes


---------18:03----------
easy to monetize and a lot of people


---------18:04----------
watch them and stuff and the question is


---------18:05----------
like why do people


---------18:07----------
why do people like watching hate videos


---------18:09----------
why do


---------18:10----------
people like watching attack videos for


---------18:12----------
public figures


---------18:13----------
and i think probably because it makes


---------18:15----------
them feel better about themselves i'd


---------18:17----------
really love to talk to someone who like


---------18:18----------
makes these


---------18:19----------
hate videos one day like you know one of


---------18:21----------
these hate farmers and


---------18:22----------
kind of ask them what motivates you to


---------18:24----------
make the video that the videos that you


---------18:26----------
make


---------18:27----------
is it just no no i think


---------18:30----------
i think it's a little deeper than that i


---------18:34----------
think


---------18:34----------
they truly believe they're doing a


---------18:37----------
public service


---------18:38----------
right you can't see


---------18:44----------
so from your perspective when you see


---------18:46----------
you know someone make a mistake


---------18:48----------
right or someone do something from your


---------18:50----------
perspective you can kind of be like okay


---------18:52----------
you know


---------18:52----------
it's it's [ __ ] up but you know we've


---------18:55----------
all realized that we've all done that


---------18:56----------
right


---------18:57----------
some people i think they're they


---------19:00----------
genuinely believe


---------19:01----------
they're like doing like some like god's


---------19:04----------
right hand work like they truly believe


---------19:06----------
this person is this way


---------19:08----------
they need to come out with the truth and


---------19:09----------
let people know let them you know beware


---------19:12----------
right so i think it's more of like an


---------19:14----------
ignorance or like not an ignorance it's


---------19:15----------
like a delusion or it's like some sort


---------19:17----------
of


---------19:18----------
it's like some sort of like i don't know


---------19:20----------
what you'd call it but that's what i


---------19:21----------
think it is


---------19:22----------
i don't think it's this thing where


---------19:23----------
they're thinking like how can i i mean


---------19:26----------
maybe half of it is how can i get big


---------19:27----------
off of this i don't think it's this


---------19:29----------
thing about monetization necessarily i


---------19:31----------
actually think there that there's


---------19:32----------
certain people like


---------19:33----------
you know you know not large creators


---------19:35----------
like just the small


---------19:36----------
you know maybe viewers that are creating


---------19:38----------
or clipping things to try and


---------19:39----------
uh you know i think i think there's like


---------19:41----------
a


---------19:43----------
i don't know it's a god complex or some


---------19:44----------
sort of complex where they believe


---------19:46----------
they're doing like


---------19:47----------
society the good they're the good person


---------19:49----------
they're outing the bad does that make


---------19:50----------
sense


---------19:51----------
yeah yeah why would you call that


---------19:52----------
delusional


---------19:57----------
because not always but


---------20:01----------
i think from most of what i see


---------20:06----------
i mean i shouldn't say most but from


---------20:07----------
some of what i see


---------20:09----------
i think


---------20:13----------
anyone that had the wisdom or any anyone


---------20:16----------
that was wise


---------20:17----------
could kind of step back and like okay


---------20:20----------
there's a lot missing here


---------20:21----------
so i think for these individuals the


---------20:23----------
reason i say delusional for some of them


---------20:25----------
i think they fill in their own gaps


---------20:30----------
to portray so like i don't think they're


---------20:31----------
neces so i think a lot of the time at


---------20:33----------
least in my experience


---------20:38----------
i don't think they're telling the full


---------20:39----------
story they're telling the story that


---------20:41----------
they


---------20:41----------
need to be true in order for their ego


---------20:44----------
to be saved


---------20:45----------
right this person needs to be this way


---------20:48----------
they need to be this way right


---------20:49----------
this isn't just a one-time thing oh


---------20:51----------
we've done this they've done this no


---------20:52----------
this is


---------20:53----------
truly evil and terrible and let me let


---------20:55----------
me let you let me tell you how right


---------20:57----------
i think that's what it is does that make


---------20:59----------
any sense yeah i i mean i think


---------21:01----------
righteousness is a good word i think you


---------21:03----------
used it earlier yeah


---------21:04----------
now this is some right some others


---------21:06----------
obviously it's fine but


---------21:08----------
yeah yeah i mean what i'm hearing you


---------21:10----------
say is that they're


---------21:12----------
you know their internal compass is that


---------21:15----------
like the reason that they make such hate


---------21:16----------
videos is to actually make the world a


---------21:18----------
better place


---------21:19----------
it's almost like they protect people


---------21:21----------
yeah i feel like it's closer to that


---------21:23----------
yeah yeah i mean they're sort of they're


---------21:26----------
kind of


---------21:26----------
protectors of the innocent yeah the


---------21:30----------
the internet masses yeah protecting them


---------21:34----------
from


---------21:34----------
you know these sociopathic influencers


---------21:38----------
streamers


---------21:39----------
youtubers whatever yeah


---------21:42----------
yeah yeah so you know i'm curious


---------21:46----------
you know i i i think i think what you're


---------21:48----------
saying has a lot of merit and at the end


---------21:50----------
of the day


---------21:51----------
um you know it's been my overwhelming


---------21:53----------
experience that


---------21:55----------
you can come up with a theory that's as


---------21:56----------
brilliant as as you want it to be but


---------21:58----------
until you actually talk to the person


---------22:00----------
and really listen to what they have to


---------22:02----------
say you'll


---------22:02----------
you won't really know you know yeah


---------22:06----------
um and one of the things i was kind of


---------22:08----------
thinking about train so i think


---------22:10----------
last time when we wrapped up um


---------22:13----------
my recollection was that like you know


---------22:15----------
we were talking a little bit about this


---------22:17----------
icon that people


---------22:19----------
turn you into and to a certain degree


---------22:21----------
you like


---------22:22----------
bear that mantle like you're okay


---------22:24----------
bearing it but that actually


---------22:27----------
you know because sometimes people need


---------22:28----------
someone to hate and and you're like yeah


---------22:31----------
okay fine i can handle that


---------22:34----------
um but that actually it does on some


---------22:36----------
level like make you angry that the way


---------22:38----------
that people treat you


---------22:41----------
i don't know if we're back there if it's


---------22:43----------
been too long or whatever but that was


---------22:45----------
sort of my recollection of our last


---------22:46----------
conversation


---------22:50----------
yes that's right that's on point that's


---------22:54----------
definitely what we


---------22:55----------
left off at i know the cure for it


---------22:58----------
i know that like i know what i need to


---------23:00----------
do


---------23:01----------
i think sometimes i just uh don't even


---------23:04----------
tell you


---------23:05----------
what the problem is first how would you


---------23:07----------
describe the problem before we get to


---------23:09----------
the


---------23:09----------
cure well i think the problem is so for


---------23:12----------
example


---------23:12----------
um it's very weird because


---------23:16----------
um and this only happens with like


---------23:17----------
first-time viewers right


---------23:19----------
my core community they'll [ __ ] around


---------23:20----------
they'll mess around they'll meme


---------23:22----------
but a lot of first time viewers that


---------23:23----------
come in and i realize this from


---------23:25----------
you know whether it's new accounts or


---------23:27----------
just followed accounts that are old


---------23:29----------
um the first you know comments


---------23:33----------
are usually something along the lines of


---------23:35----------
like some sort of physical activity or


---------23:37----------
some sort of


---------23:37----------
size up right like something like


---------23:41----------
uh you know you probably have a small


---------23:42----------
dick or do you know how to fight oh i


---------23:44----------
you know drop you like it's always like


---------23:46----------
that's always a starter which tells me


---------23:48----------
that when people look at me


---------23:50----------
that they see some sort of


---------23:54----------
something they need to size up like they


---------23:55----------
can't just come like hey what's up right


---------23:57----------
so like i don't know if that's


---------23:58----------
you know an insecurity on their end i


---------24:00----------
don't know if it's just you know a vibe


---------24:01----------
i give off which


---------24:02----------
i i actually i'm not cause i don't know


---------24:03----------
i know for a fact that's something


---------24:05----------
that's just given off even though it's


---------24:06----------
not


---------24:06----------
you know i don't mean to and i i've


---------24:08----------
realized this because recently i i was


---------24:10----------
testing this thing out with i was


---------24:11----------
playing among us


---------24:13----------
and i decided to test out this thing


---------24:15----------
where


---------24:16----------
i actually hire the pitch of my voice


---------24:20----------
and i talk more like i'm asking


---------24:23----------
questions than i am


---------24:25----------
making a statement right so so


---------24:28----------
like i'll give an example so i'm like oh


---------24:30----------
no yeah no it's okay don't worry about


---------24:32----------
it no i'll go ahead


---------24:34----------
right like i'll talk like that and like


---------24:35----------
suddenly like i'm very well


---------24:37----------
yeah suddenly i'm like everything's okay


---------24:40----------
i'm the nicest person in the world


---------24:42----------
like no one's having any issues like i'm


---------24:45----------
invited back


---------24:46----------
right but then as soon as i'm like all


---------24:48----------
right where were you


---------24:50----------
tell me what task you're doing suddenly


---------24:51----------
like you know i'm getting messages like


---------24:53----------
uh from the person you're scaring them


---------24:54----------
like you're being a little aggressive


---------24:55----------
they don't want to play with you


---------24:56----------
right but it's like i'm not doing


---------24:58----------
anything right it's only the pitch of my


---------24:59----------
voice that's changing


---------25:02----------
and it's like it's some crazy [ __ ] i've


---------25:04----------
noticed it's crazy [ __ ]


---------25:05----------
right so


---------25:08----------
yeah not son you know it's it's weird


---------25:11----------
train and i i hope i'm not falling into


---------25:14----------
a trap which i think maybe we can talk


---------25:15----------
about but


---------25:16----------
sure i feel like interviewing you like


---------25:19----------
have you seen the movie beauty and the


---------25:20----------
beast


---------25:22----------
yeah of course i feel like this is the


---------25:23----------
closest i'll ever get to interviewing


---------25:25----------
the beast


---------25:26----------
oh my man appreciate that hey you keep


---------25:28----------
talking like that i'll be buying you a


---------25:30----------
christmas gift you know what i mean


---------25:32----------
honestly i mean it's kinda


---------25:36----------
i'm just kidding sorry um is that a


---------25:39----------
reference to dick in a box


---------25:41----------
it is okay at least i'm on i'm on point


---------25:44----------
there


---------25:45----------
i was like yeah go ahead it's it's it's


---------25:48----------
great i appreciate it


---------25:49----------
um so so but but really train because


---------25:51----------
what i'm what i'm hearing from you is


---------25:52----------
sort of like


---------25:54----------
you know you keep on saying like you


---------25:55----------
look like a gorilla


---------25:57----------
and what i what i'm what i'm hearing is


---------25:59----------
that like people


---------26:01----------
look at you and they're frightened of


---------26:02----------
you


---------26:04----------
and what's it like to be someone that


---------26:06----------
people are fright like people come in


---------26:08----------
and they just can't say what's up like


---------26:10----------
people


---------26:10----------
you know you have to raise the pitch of


---------26:12----------
your voice and boy do you sound like a


---------26:14----------
completely different person


---------26:16----------
i do don't i it's crazy like i was i was


---------26:18----------
listening to some uh


---------26:19----------
i was listening to the vod afterwards


---------26:20----------
and i was like damn like


---------26:23----------
this is what people need me to be just


---------26:24----------
like a total like


---------26:27----------
i i you know just a total [ __ ] like


---------26:30----------
they need me to like you know succumb to


---------26:32----------
their


---------26:33----------
you know they need me to like do


---------26:35----------
something that lets them know that like


---------26:36----------
they're in charge


---------26:37----------
otherwise like i'm a wild card right


---------26:40----------
like anything can happen they can


---------26:41----------
they can't be themselves i might step up


---------26:44----------
and call them out i might beat them up


---------26:45----------
like some crazy [ __ ] like that it


---------26:47----------
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense


---------26:48----------
how long have people been scared of you


---------26:50----------
tree people


---------26:52----------
aren't scared of me i think there was


---------26:54----------
just uh


---------26:55----------
i don't want to say they're scared of me


---------26:56----------
right like that's going to invite in


---------26:58----------
some [ __ ]


---------26:58----------
listen i know some badass [ __ ]


---------27:00----------
is probably watching hey listen i don't


---------27:01----------
want any trouble


---------27:02----------
but anyways um let me rephrase how


---------27:06----------
yeah people been initially reacting to


---------27:09----------
you with fear


---------27:10----------
oh since the beginning i still remember


---------27:13----------
my


---------27:13----------
beginning middle school


---------27:16----------
middle school for 100 high school middle


---------27:19----------
school i'm kind of just


---------27:20----------
assuming based on my high school


---------27:22----------
experience so high school i'll explain


---------27:23----------
to you


---------27:25----------
high school uh i moved high schools and


---------27:27----------
i went to this in


---------27:28----------
this new city new school a whole


---------27:30----------
different beat different vibe different


---------27:32----------
culture


---------27:33----------
different you know um it was an


---------27:35----------
all-white school it was really weird


---------27:37----------
right like it wasn't like an all-white


---------27:38----------
school but like everyone was just


---------27:40----------
white like i remember like junior year


---------27:42----------
we had one black kid it was just a very


---------27:44----------
weird experience because my other


---------27:45----------
the place i came from the middle school


---------27:47----------
i went to it was just all mixed it was a


---------27:48----------
melting pot just everybody was there


---------27:50----------
and that's kind of what i was used to


---------27:51----------
right all my boys like um


---------27:53----------
but anyways go to the school and you


---------27:56----------
know it was just


---------27:58----------
man it was non-stop uh


---------28:01----------
you know it was just psychological uh


---------28:03----------
bullying right and in those days


---------28:05----------
there was no there was no attention to


---------28:08----------
psychological bullying


---------28:09----------
right back then it was sticks and stones


---------28:11----------
might break your bones but words cannot


---------28:12----------
hurt you so that no one paid any


---------28:13----------
attention to that


---------28:15----------
and anyways to fast forward we can go


---------28:18----------
deeper into that stuff


---------28:19----------
later if you ask any questions relating


---------28:20----------
to it but fast forward to senior year


---------28:24----------
i ended up approaching like the main


---------28:28----------
i don't know what i'd call him the main


---------28:30----------
kid


---------28:31----------
that kind of uh like facilitated


---------28:35----------
you know the the bullying or the hate


---------28:37----------
and


---------28:38----------
you know he kind of came to me i went to


---------28:40----------
him and i'm like yo


---------28:42----------
like why and he actually apologized he


---------28:45----------
was super like nice and sweet and


---------28:48----------
he's like it all came down to freshman


---------28:51----------
year when you walked through our holes


---------28:52----------
you were the new kid no one knew you and


---------28:56----------
when we looked at you you walked around


---------28:58----------
with your head up high it just seemed


---------29:00----------
like you thought you owned the place


---------29:02----------
and we needed to bring you down and let


---------29:03----------
you know that we own it


---------29:05----------
right and i'm thinking here like damn so


---------29:07----------
me walking around with my head high


---------29:11----------
it tells them that it like they feel


---------29:14----------
threatened


---------29:14----------
by me walking around my head high i need


---------29:16----------
to walk my head down i need to


---------29:18----------
show some visible insecurity or some


---------29:20----------
visible sadness or some visible misery


---------29:23----------
in order for them to be okay and my


---------29:25----------
entire four years of high school


---------29:27----------
of bullying was because


---------29:30----------
of that single walk of the hole right so


---------29:34----------
so how does it feel to be in that


---------29:36----------
position


---------29:38----------
where who you are pisses people off


---------29:46----------
because that hasn't changed right like


---------29:49----------
what this that what you just told me


---------29:52----------
applies to among us


---------29:53----------
too


---------29:56----------
because you can't well no no oh


---------30:00----------
oh i'm so sorry oh oh


---------30:03----------
oh well among us a little different you


---------30:05----------
know among


---------30:06----------
you know among us there's a little bit


---------30:08----------
more you know i wouldn't say amongst


---------30:10----------
directly connected


---------30:11----------
there's a lot more politics going on


---------30:12----------
among us you know people want to be the


---------30:14----------
best in the lobby so they can farm the


---------30:15----------
best youtube clips and continue to be


---------30:16----------
relevant right


---------30:17----------
there's a different dynamic going on


---------30:19----------
there right that's just that's like


---------30:21----------
content creator


---------30:22----------
life people it's like survival of most


---------30:24----------
relevant right if i'm in the lobby


---------30:26----------
they're not going to get off their plays


---------30:27----------
or it's going to be harder and they're


---------30:28----------
going to get one clip instead of 20.


---------30:29----------
so like that's different like i think


---------30:31----------
that's just you know


---------30:33----------
the competitiveness of whatever right so


---------30:36----------
i don't think


---------30:36----------
yeah but yeah does that make sense you


---------30:39----------
just told me that people think that


---------30:40----------
you're scary what does that have to do


---------30:42----------
with


---------30:44----------
hey train you're scaring people a little


---------30:46----------
bit


---------30:47----------
can you talk a little bit more like a


---------30:48----------
[ __ ]


---------30:50----------
i've never said that but yeah


---------30:53----------
i mean so so i i understand that like


---------30:55----------
look i'm not


---------30:56----------
disputing that the among us


---------31:00----------
streaming community in high school are


---------31:02----------
really different situations


---------31:04----------
well to be further kind of similar there


---------31:06----------
are so many what shocks me is that


---------31:08----------
is that like i mean i i think it's like


---------31:12----------
not unreasonable to draw a parallel


---------31:14----------
between


---------31:15----------
walking in with your head held high and


---------31:17----------
speaking like you normally do


---------31:19----------
both of those are just being just you


---------31:23----------
and something tells me that if you had


---------31:24----------
spoken when you


---------31:26----------
when they walked when you walked in with


---------31:28----------
your head held high if you had opened


---------31:29----------
your mouth and you'd use your among us


---------31:31----------
voice


---------31:32----------
they wouldn't have bullied you


---------31:35----------
oh i'm so sorry what um huh


---------31:39----------
[Music]


---------31:41----------
yeah probably not i mean then again like


---------31:45----------
if you saw the way i looked in high


---------31:46----------
school i don't know why the hell they


---------31:47----------
were so [ __ ] intimidated


---------31:49----------
i mean i guess i did have my you know


---------31:51----------
you know i slapped my same big


---------31:53----------
face and big head but damn i was


---------31:56----------
i was a creature out of sheesh i gotta


---------31:59----------
show you a picture one of these days


---------32:01----------
god damn i gotta show you a picture


---------32:04----------
doctor okay i'm telling you


---------32:05----------
i'm gonna show you a picture right now


---------32:06----------
actually screw it why not take a look at


---------32:07----------
this hold on hold on hold on hold on i'm


---------32:09----------
happy to see the picture but just


---------32:11----------
before you show me the picture i'm


---------32:13----------
curious what do you think my reaction is


---------32:15----------
going to be


---------32:20----------
that's a good pho that's a good point i


---------32:21----------
guess you'll have no reaction but i


---------32:23----------
guess deep down


---------32:24----------
whatever's healthy like damn my man


---------32:27----------
but yeah what do you what do you want


---------32:29----------
what do you want me what are you looking


---------32:30----------
for by showing me this picture


---------32:33----------
i guess i'm holy [ __ ] that's actually


---------32:36----------
you know what


---------32:37----------
that is what you just asked me there


---------32:40----------
just unlocked something that


---------32:42----------
now that i've like now that i understand


---------32:44----------
why i keep showing this picture


---------32:46----------
it's the most logical common sense thing


---------32:49----------
ever


---------32:49----------
but i never thought of it before i'm


---------32:51----------
showing it so you don't


---------32:53----------
see me this way and you see me that way


---------32:56----------
so instead


---------32:57----------
you cannot be threatened just talk me


---------32:58----------
normal i'm showing you a picture of me


---------33:00----------
at a point


---------33:01----------
where i'm just ugly


---------33:04----------
terrible weak and i'm shown that you're


---------33:08----------
hoping that when you look at me now


---------33:10----------
you see that instead of this so you can


---------33:12----------
just chill holy [ __ ]


---------33:14----------
because i keep showing this as a


---------33:15----------
reference point to everyone that i talk


---------33:17----------
to


---------33:18----------
with whatever argument i get into and


---------33:20----------
now like that holy [ __ ]


---------33:22----------
good [ __ ] good [ __ ] i like that that was


---------33:25----------
good


---------33:25----------
holy [ __ ] that was good good stuff yeah


---------33:27----------
yeah here it is though check that out


---------33:32----------
hold on i'll check it out in a second


---------33:35----------
we're not we're not done we're just


---------33:36----------
getting started okay


---------33:38----------
sure so like something struck me as


---------33:40----------
strange and you're like every time we


---------33:41----------
talk about high school


---------33:43----------
and then you said we we end up looking


---------33:45----------
at a picture of me from high school and


---------33:46----------
i was like


---------33:47----------
how on earth does that happen do people


---------33:50----------
go and google what you look like


---------33:52----------
in high school and i think there's more


---------33:53----------
to it if you really want me want to show


---------33:54----------
me the picture that's fine


---------33:56----------
but what i want i like that i want you


---------33:59----------
to pay attention


---------34:02----------
[Music]


---------34:04----------
to


---------34:06----------
i want you to pay attention to yourself


---------34:08----------
so do me a favor actually


---------34:10----------
can you screen share the picture so that


---------34:12----------
we see the picture instead of you


---------34:15----------
yes sir and i want you to pay attention


---------34:17----------
to what you feel as i look at it


---------34:19----------
right as you click the button


---------34:28----------
uh give me a second to make sure okay


---------34:32----------
uh share your screen make sure this


---------34:33----------
doesn't mess anything up oh


---------34:35----------
did i mess anything up no i didn't nope


---------34:37----------
is this it


---------34:38----------
there should be it can you see that


---------34:46----------
okay i'm sorry i couldn't help but laugh


---------34:50----------
how did you


---------34:51----------
how did you feel when i looked at that


---------34:52----------
picture and laughed i felt relieved


---------34:55----------
i felt good that's what i want i want


---------34:58----------
i want that's that's all i want i want


---------35:00----------
you to look at it laugh and now we're


---------35:01----------
just good


---------35:02----------
right because like now you have


---------35:03----------
something of me that made you do that so


---------35:05----------
now from now on when we talk i mean


---------35:07----------
obviously this is the case between us


---------35:08----------
anyways


---------35:08----------
but what would happen normally is from


---------35:10----------
now when we talk


---------35:12----------
if your ego ever tells you this guy is


---------35:14----------
threatening something


---------35:16----------
you just go back to this picture plop it


---------35:17----------
in your image you go okay we're good


---------35:19----------
never mind look at this dude like


---------35:20----------
no shot right does that make any sense


---------35:23----------
can i unsure


---------35:24----------
yeah you can unsure yeah so i


---------35:28----------
i think it's a great revelation on your


---------35:30----------
part and i want to keep digging


---------35:32----------
is that okay sure whatever you want


---------35:38----------
so the interesting thing is that that


---------35:41----------
uh what what i what i felt was that i


---------35:43----------
judged the picture negatively


---------35:46----------
no i didn't get that bad no that's


---------35:48----------
that's what i felt i was like like


---------35:49----------
that belongs on have you seen this part


---------35:51----------
of this reddit called blunder years


---------35:55----------
yeah it reminds me a little bit of


---------35:58----------
blunder years like


---------35:59----------
i don't mean to be condescending towards


---------36:00----------
you but like that was my initial like


---------36:02----------
it reminded me of like how we all look


---------36:04----------
super awkward in high school and


---------36:06----------
and i saw a little bit of myself in that


---------36:08----------
picture and i was like oh [ __ ]


---------36:10----------
you know if you see a picture of me in


---------36:11----------
high school it reminds me yeah


---------36:13----------
it reminds me of have you seen those uh


---------36:15----------
those


---------36:17----------
like movies that have the actors then


---------36:20----------
like at the end it shows like their high


---------36:22----------
school photo of like


---------36:23----------
their entire like metal gear like you


---------36:25----------
know some some


---------36:26----------
some [ __ ] uh solar system of braces


---------36:29----------
on


---------36:30----------
right like that that's what reminds me


---------36:31----------
of it reminds me of that like you know


---------36:33----------
what we see now


---------36:34----------
you know there's a story behind it right


---------36:36----------
not all of we didn't look to swear into


---------36:37----------
our lives we didn't you know we've all


---------36:40----------
had our


---------36:40----------
you know whatever yeah so that yeah i


---------36:43----------
don't know


---------36:46----------
so like just to kind of draw a couple of


---------36:48----------
random ass parallels okay


---------36:50----------
and i'm just gonna start tossing stuff


---------36:52----------
out train you let me know it sounds like


---------36:53----------
you've


---------36:54----------
discovered something important so cool


---------36:57----------
um


---------36:58----------
i'm gonna just offer a couple of other


---------37:00----------
hypotheses one is that


---------37:02----------
what i'm sort of seeing is that like


---------37:03----------
you're showing people


---------37:05----------
hey do you see how i wasn't always the


---------37:07----------
beast i used to be human


---------37:10----------
right it's like like you like in beauty


---------37:12----------
and the beast it's sort of like


---------37:13----------
you're the beast at that point and


---------37:15----------
that's what everyone sees and like you


---------37:16----------
want to show people that


---------37:18----------
i wasn't always like this and please


---------37:20----------
remember


---------37:21----------
that i'm not as scary as i appear yeah


---------37:24----------
i mean i know what i have to do like i


---------37:26----------
know what i realistically have to do i


---------37:28----------
just don't know the patience for it


---------37:29----------
what are you i just everyone that comes


---------37:32----------
to me and thinks i'm some sort of


---------37:33----------
you know [ __ ] beast right you know to


---------37:35----------
pick something with i just gotta kill


---------37:36----------
him with kindness that's it i gotta come


---------37:38----------
with kindness until one day they you


---------37:39----------
know just say


---------37:40----------
[ __ ] it right [ __ ] [ __ ] i'm the [ __ ]


---------37:41----------
right but i just you know i'll keep it a


---------37:43----------
buck fifty i just say [ __ ] that


---------37:45----------
and i just you know give him a little


---------37:46----------
roast back cause i'll tell you what it's


---------37:49----------
always the weebs


---------37:50----------
and it's always the overwatch uh uh


---------37:52----------
viewers


---------37:53----------
that are always the most judgmental and


---------37:55----------
it's crazy it's crazy it's bad [ __ ]


---------37:57----------
because those those two sections have no


---------37:59----------
place to be judgmental


---------38:01----------
sorry i went off on a tangent


---------38:06----------
yeah so train i i wonder if there's a


---------38:08----------
little bit more to it so like


---------38:09----------
i have a wild wild wild thought


---------38:13----------
which is what if when people look at you


---------38:16----------
they don't see what you think they see


---------38:20----------
what if they don't see you as scary


---------38:28----------
well here's the thing


---------38:33----------
i'm gonna ask you a question okay now


---------38:35----------
not this dr k


---------38:36----------
but the the you 20 years ago okay


---------38:41----------
if you saw someone that was actually


---------38:44----------
hideous


---------38:45----------
that was actually overweight would you


---------38:48----------
sit there


---------38:49----------
and non-stop call them those names call


---------38:51----------
them those things let them know that


---------38:52----------
they're the those things


---------38:54----------
no you wouldn't right it's only the ones


---------38:57----------
that you know or not but you need to


---------39:00----------
keep


---------39:00----------
saying it to make them smile believe it


---------39:04----------
right because like if they actually were


---------39:08----------
you're not right like people who are


---------39:11----------
actually these things


---------39:12----------
if they actually were you'd feel bad


---------39:14----------
saying them right


---------39:16----------
so like i've come to this conclusion


---------39:19----------
that


---------39:21----------
if i was truly this hideous ugly


---------39:24----------
disgusting beast that scared everyone


---------39:27----------
right


---------39:29----------
maybe people wouldn't you know right


---------39:31----------
like it seems like there's something


---------39:33----------
else to it doesn't make any sense


---------39:34----------
i completely agree so then let me ask


---------39:36----------
you something so your conclusion is that


---------39:38----------
if people keep on calling you out is


---------39:41----------
scary you must not be that scary because


---------39:43----------
if you were really really scary then


---------39:45----------
like


---------39:45----------
if people are truly hideous we don't


---------39:47----------
call them hideous to their face well


---------39:48----------
no one says scary because like like that


---------39:51----------
would contradict the entire purpose of


---------39:53----------
even coming to say anything


---------39:55----------
if you say someone's scary you're


---------39:57----------
automatically you're already giving up


---------39:59----------
the peace that your ego is supposed to


---------40:01----------
be fighting for right sure good point


---------40:03----------
yeah it doesn't it doesn't manifest in


---------40:05----------
your scary yeah it's more so


---------40:09----------
it it comes through as in like ugly or


---------40:12----------
something negative just it's it's


---------40:14----------
something that


---------40:15----------
i know if it was true they wouldn't say


---------40:18----------
it instead they'd look and feel bad like


---------40:19----------
damn


---------40:20----------
why do you keep calling yourself a girl


---------40:22----------
why do you keep saying that you look


---------40:23----------
like a gorilla


---------40:29----------
i mean i'm going to be honest i i kind


---------40:31----------
of like it i i think you know i mean i


---------40:33----------
don't think i look i mean


---------40:35----------
technically we evolved from them is that


---------40:38----------
too bad


---------40:39----------
you feel me yeah i don't


---------40:44----------
you kind of like it what do you like


---------40:46----------
about it


---------40:48----------
it's just


---------40:52----------
i don't know it's perfect right think


---------40:55----------
about this


---------40:55----------
gorillas they're these powerful


---------41:01----------
creatures right but they just sit there


---------41:04----------
and


---------41:04----------
they eat grass it's perfect


---------41:07----------
right people see me as this guy that's


---------41:10----------
gonna bend the bars and


---------41:11----------
beat everyone up and do the worst things


---------41:13----------
in the world but really i'm just eating


---------41:14----------
my grass


---------41:16----------
hanging out doing what i can right does


---------41:18----------
that make sense so what i'm hearing is


---------41:20----------
that a gorilla is a good


---------41:22----------
representation for the way that


---------41:25----------
you are treated in the way that you are


---------41:27----------
in the sense that a grill is like


---------41:29----------
gigantic and can look kind of scary but


---------41:31----------
they're just sort of chilling


---------41:34----------
and so you're judged for being sort of


---------41:35----------
gigantic and kind of scary but you're


---------41:37----------
just


---------41:37----------
kind of chilling well to be fair i'm


---------41:40----------
kind of small right now but yeah


---------41:42----------
for the most part i would say so i mean


---------41:43----------
does that mean you're kind of small


---------41:45----------
right now


---------41:46----------
well kobit you know i haven't really


---------41:48----------
done any of my regiments


---------41:49----------
so uh oh i see you mean like musculature


---------41:54----------
yeah which is another thing which is


---------41:56----------
crazy right when i'm big


---------41:58----------
the problem is even worse i lose my size


---------42:01----------
and then we're in a new avenue right


---------42:03----------
oh you look like a skinny [ __ ] bro yeah


---------42:05----------
i hit the gym again then i hit the gym


---------42:08----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] trying to get


---------42:09----------
muscles just make you dick bigger like


---------42:11----------
right like nothing's going to fix your


---------42:13----------
dick size right like there's always


---------42:15----------
something right that's life


---------42:16----------
i think just life there's haters and


---------42:17----------
there's none right


---------42:20----------
i just think there's more show in my


---------42:21----------
head it sounds to me like you can win


---------42:24----------
oh i don't think i don't i don't think


---------42:25----------
anyone can win the point is


---------42:28----------
this is gonna exist no matter what right


---------42:30----------
you have to accept it and you have to


---------42:31----------
just


---------42:31----------
you know put yourself around like for


---------42:34----------
you to


---------42:35----------
always have people be unhappy


---------42:39----------
with who you are


---------42:42----------
well thank thankfully i've realized


---------42:45----------
recently that it's only


---------42:46----------
a vocal minority right like the people i


---------42:48----------
pay attention to are the positive


---------42:49----------
commenters and the people that are there


---------42:51----------
for me the things that i have done that


---------42:52----------
we have done as a community


---------42:54----------
right i just pay attention to them now


---------42:55----------
for a lot that took me a long time


---------42:57----------
right and even once in a while i'll be


---------42:59----------
honest you know i'm a little content


---------43:01----------
starved some you know i'll point a


---------43:02----------
couple out roast them but i think for


---------43:04----------
the most part they're gonna exist no


---------43:05----------
matter what


---------43:06----------
you just to focus on the more positive


---------43:08----------
ones and not give them


---------43:10----------
but here's the craziest part that i've


---------43:11----------
noticed the ones that are doing this


---------43:14----------
i don't even know if it's right to call


---------43:16----------
them


---------43:17----------
like haters or whatever you want to call


---------43:19----------
them because i've noticed they're


---------43:21----------
actually


---------43:23----------
it's this weird thing they're actually


---------43:24----------
more loyal than the positive ones


---------43:27----------
my most loyal like the ones that like it


---------43:30----------
feels like they die for me in some weird


---------43:31----------
sadistic criminal minds aaron hochner


---------43:33----------
way


---------43:35----------
or ones that should talk me right now


---------43:36----------
don't get me wrong i love the ones that


---------43:37----------
are positive they're loyal as hell too


---------43:39----------
but it seems like


---------43:40----------
the most diehard it isn't even like a


---------43:41----------
pure hatred they want to bring me down


---------43:43----------
it seems like in order to continue to


---------43:46----------
watch me


---------43:47----------
they need to do it to justify it for


---------43:49----------
themselves i don't know it's some weird


---------43:51----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] well so


---------43:52----------
let's not worry about the minority for a


---------43:53----------
second because you're sort of talking


---------43:55----------
about the minority but what i'm hearing


---------43:57----------
is that this has been like


---------43:59----------
this doesn't sound like a minority issue


---------44:02----------
to me this sounds like you've been


---------44:03----------
judged for your appearance


---------44:05----------
and your voice like every person that


---------44:09----------
you


---------44:09----------
talk to you have these thoughts about


---------44:12----------
not wanting to scare them you have these


---------44:15----------
thoughts of like


---------44:16----------
eventually showing them the picture so


---------44:18----------
that they are not scared of you


---------44:20----------
that doesn't sound to me like you're


---------44:21----------
responding to the minority that sounds


---------44:22----------
to me like you're


---------44:23----------
responding to a fact of life yeah you're


---------44:26----------
right i'm kind of just downplaying right


---------44:28----------
now because i feel like


---------44:29----------
i feel like the the problem with being


---------44:31----------
in that situation is


---------44:38----------
the very situation itself


---------44:42----------
it's almost like what is it what is it


---------44:45----------
it's a paradoxical situation


---------44:47----------
because the people that that the peop


---------44:49----------
let me explain why what that means okay


---------44:51----------
here's why it's this weird thing that


---------44:54----------
can never be solved and never be fixed


---------44:55----------
because the people


---------44:56----------
that do it passively they don't


---------44:58----------
recognize it because they don't actually


---------45:01----------
when they look at me they don't see it


---------45:03----------
as this unfair treatment


---------45:05----------
they in their minds have come to a


---------45:06----------
conclusion based on certain things that


---------45:09----------
i do


---------45:09----------
or whatever the case might be right and


---------45:12----------
it is


---------45:14----------
this objective rational thing that


---------45:15----------
they've come to you know


---------45:17----------
to a conclusion of right like this isn't


---------45:18----------
something that like so when you point it


---------45:20----------
out


---------45:21----------
it sounds like i'm not taken responsibly


---------45:23----------
for something i'm doing


---------45:25----------
and if it's not right and if it's not


---------45:28----------
that


---------45:30----------
then what i'm saying doesn't exist i'm


---------45:31----------
delusional right like there's no solving


---------45:33----------
it because the people


---------45:34----------
yeah i get that so here's my question


---------45:36----------
what's it like to be on the receiving


---------45:38----------
end of


---------45:39----------
all of that like it sounds like you


---------45:42----------
can't win


---------45:43----------
like they look at you they judge you


---------45:46----------
like


---------45:47----------
if you point it out to them it feels


---------45:50----------
delusional


---------45:52----------
if you try to be yourself they're scared


---------45:54----------
of you in an among us lobby


---------45:58----------
you know and and so then you have to go


---------45:59----------
through all these hoops and gymnastics


---------46:01----------
of showing them high school pictures so


---------46:03----------
that they're like


---------46:04----------
what is it like to like walk around and


---------46:05----------
and like


---------46:07----------
have to convince people that you're not


---------46:10----------
scary like holy [ __ ] man


---------46:27----------
well that's not even the saddest part


---------46:33----------
okay the saddest part


---------46:37----------
is i don't even have like for 90


---------46:40----------
of the people i meet it's not even the


---------46:44----------
case where i have an


---------46:45----------
opportunity to show them i'm not this


---------46:47----------
person


---------46:48----------
right it's i'm just disconnected


---------46:50----------
instantly and i don't know why


---------46:52----------
right i'll send a message like yo i'm


---------46:54----------
sorry if i you know did this or did that


---------46:55----------
and like it's just like


---------46:57----------
right because that's the best way i've


---------46:59----------
noticed people like to


---------47:00----------
deal with their stuff right they just


---------47:01----------
totally remove it from their lives


---------47:03----------
instead of facing and seeing what made


---------47:05----------
them feel this way and what actually i


---------47:07----------
might have done


---------47:08----------
right which might have been something


---------47:09----------
who knows right i think a lot of people


---------47:11----------
i've had a lot of friends reach out to


---------47:12----------
me saying yo you know when you said [ __ ]


---------47:14----------
you to me that sounded like a


---------47:16----------
terror right like right like it sucks


---------47:19----------
okay


---------47:20----------
i can't like for example okay on the


---------47:22----------
podcast if i like


---------47:23----------
get excited and argue everyone thinks


---------47:25----------
i'm this in this [ __ ] crazy


---------47:26----------
aggressive mood


---------47:27----------
i'm just excited like i wonder if i had


---------47:29----------
a higher pitched voice


---------47:30----------
do i have the right to be excited in my


---------47:32----------
arguments but since i have a deeper


---------47:34----------
pitched voice and i get excited


---------47:35----------
i'm going to war with them and all of a


---------47:36----------
sudden they think i'm coming at them


---------47:38----------
right it so it sucks yeah but i guess


---------47:39----------
that's


---------47:40----------
how it is i don't know


---------47:43----------
does that make any sense yeah entirely


---------47:46----------
too much


---------47:48----------
i mean listen my mom has told me this


---------47:50----------
since i was a kid though dr k


---------47:52----------
mom told me listen you have a deep voice


---------47:54----------
when you get excited


---------47:55----------
you know you kind of you know get a


---------47:57----------
little aggressive


---------47:58----------
right one day someone's going to punch


---------47:59----------
you in the face she told me that she


---------48:01----------
drove my [ __ ] head drew down my head


---------48:03----------
drill down my head for so long


---------48:04----------
right and that eventually that's kind of


---------48:06----------
what started happening not


---------48:08----------
physically punching the face but you


---------48:10----------
know over the internet people would be


---------48:11----------
like [ __ ]


---------48:12----------
you know the [ __ ] back the [ __ ] up right


---------48:13----------
and then we get into an argument we're


---------48:14----------
gonna talk for three weeks


---------48:16----------
but i was just excited in an argument


---------48:17----------
does that make any sense makes a lot of


---------48:19----------
sense so i have i have a


---------48:21----------
wild thought okay and this is probably


---------48:24----------
the most


---------48:25----------
wrong thought that i will have


---------48:28----------
in a conversation with you but i'm going


---------48:31----------
to share it anyway


---------48:32----------
so when i think about


---------48:36----------
so sometimes i work with people who


---------48:37----------
don't aren't confident let's say


---------48:40----------
in the way that they approach i'll just


---------48:42----------
assume a heteronormative stance for a


---------48:43----------
second


---------48:44----------
so like we'll we'll talk about you know


---------48:46----------
gamers who have trouble talking to women


---------48:48----------
so we're assuming the gamer's a dude


---------48:50----------
we're assuming they're heterosexual and


---------48:51----------
we're assuming that they


---------48:52----------
like women okay and so then there's


---------48:55----------
something really wild which is that like


---------48:58----------
they say that yeah the reason that i


---------49:00----------
have trouble


---------49:02----------
talking to women is because i am


---------49:04----------
terrible


---------49:05----------
and i'm ugly and i have a small jaw


---------49:08----------
and all these other things they'll sort


---------49:10----------
of use this bio-deterministic


---------49:12----------
approach to explain


---------49:16----------
why people respond to them the way that


---------49:18----------
they do


---------49:20----------
right it's not my fault it's just women


---------49:22----------
judge me this way


---------49:25----------
and so the wild thing that when i work


---------49:26----------
with these people is that


---------49:28----------
what we actually find is that it's the


---------49:30----------
insecurity itself


---------49:32----------
that is based on this belief that


---------49:36----------
women don't like them that is what makes


---------49:38----------
them unattractive to women


---------49:40----------
yeah and so here's the wild thing that i


---------49:43----------
have for you


---------49:44----------
train is that is does the same apply to


---------49:47----------
you is it your belief that you're scary


---------49:50----------
is it is it your mom drilling into you


---------49:52----------
like just imagine what that does to a


---------49:54----------
kid when your mom tells you


---------49:55----------
hey by the way you're a scary looking


---------49:57----------
kid and if you get excited


---------49:59----------
people are gonna dislike it like that


---------50:00----------
plants a seed in your mind and i'm


---------50:02----------
almost wondering whether


---------50:04----------
the reason people think you're scary is


---------50:06----------
because you


---------50:07----------
think you're scary i don't think i'm


---------50:10----------
scary


---------50:12----------
the point that that's what i'm trying to


---------50:13----------
say i don't think i'm scary


---------50:15----------
i know myself i'm a [ __ ] teddy bear


---------50:18----------
i mean right like you think you think


---------50:21----------
people think you're scary


---------50:28----------
i wouldn't say scary i would say i think


---------50:30----------
there's an intimidation factor


---------50:32----------
somewhere there where they feel like


---------50:33----------
they i need to be you know they need to


---------50:34----------
size me up just to let me know


---------50:37----------
i don't think it's a scary thing i think


---------50:38----------
scary is a little bit of an extreme i


---------50:39----------
think yeah there's


---------50:40----------
definitely there's an intimidation thing


---------50:41----------
but i don't know


---------50:45----------
i'm not right like it's not like i'm


---------50:47----------
still i i don't know


---------50:49----------
yeah so so here's what should i do in


---------50:51----------
your opinion then to not


---------50:53----------
give off i i know this this sounds this


---------50:57----------
sounds like


---------50:58----------
so like i said this is probably the


---------50:59----------
thing that i may be the most wrong about


---------51:01----------
right but i think that if if this


---------51:03----------
happens to be right even if it's


---------51:05----------
you know the low light likelihood that i


---------51:07----------
think it could actually change a lot of


---------51:09----------
your interaction so like let's just go


---------51:10----------
through two scenarios right one is that


---------51:12----------
yeah you know you're a smart guy and


---------51:16----------
and you've made lots of observations


---------51:17----------
about your life and you've noticed the


---------51:19----------
way that you're treated and it's like


---------51:21----------
the height of arrogance for me to tell


---------51:23----------
you that your experiences


---------51:25----------
have been incorrectly interpreted by you


---------51:28----------
right


---------51:29----------
i mean you've grown up with your face


---------51:31----------
and your voice


---------51:33----------
well i've been told these things right


---------51:34----------
sure of course of course


---------51:36----------
right just like the incels say about


---------51:39----------
like


---------51:40----------
i've been i have all this data they give


---------51:42----------
me tons and tons of data about why


---------51:43----------
they're unattractive


---------51:45----------
they point to all sorts of things so


---------51:49----------
you know you know so so it's like it


---------51:51----------
like so it's


---------51:52----------
it's very it's the height of like


---------51:56----------
psychiatric arrogance to dismiss


---------51:59----------
your experiences based on some beautiful


---------52:02----------
theory


---------52:03----------
that is mind-blowing that i've


---------52:04----------
constructed right it's like the worst


---------52:07----------
mistake that my profession makes is when


---------52:09----------
i say


---------52:09----------
you are wrong train here is really


---------52:11----------
what's going on with you it's all in


---------52:12----------
your [ __ ] head


---------52:14----------
so i could be making the biggest mistake


---------52:16----------
of my profession right now


---------52:17----------
and at the same time there's a part of


---------52:19----------
me that wonders


---------52:21----------
you know like how much of this is like


---------52:24----------
your


---------52:25----------
perception that people think you're


---------52:27----------
scary


---------52:28----------
and almost like an over compensation


---------52:32----------
for insecurity that signals insecurity


---------52:36----------
right because you know you're a teddy


---------52:37----------
bear and you have to start raising your


---------52:39----------
voice


---------52:40----------
which then sort of like maybe that's


---------52:42----------
like it's the overcompensation that's


---------52:44----------
actually kind of like people are like


---------52:46----------
not quite sure


---------52:47----------
i don't really know here i think it's


---------52:48----------
just it's like it's just a thought that


---------52:50----------
i had


---------52:51----------
well i'll tell you the exact process


---------52:53----------
that it goes through okay


---------52:54----------
so it's not the case that i talk to


---------52:57----------
someone and


---------52:58----------
someone is standoffish and i'm like oh


---------53:00----------
damn i must have scared them that's not


---------53:01----------
the case right like what happens is


---------53:04----------
i something happens and then i'm not you


---------53:07----------
know invited back or they stop talking


---------53:08----------
to me or they get


---------53:09----------
very weird and i i sense that i don't go


---------53:12----------
okay well


---------53:13----------
must have been hey you know they must


---------53:15----------
have just got scared of my voice just


---------53:16----------
real quick i actually sit there and i


---------53:19----------
think okay


---------53:19----------
what could i have done i must have said


---------53:21----------
something i must have did something


---------53:23----------
that i sit through this process and then


---------53:25----------
i reach out i send


---------53:27----------
a nice like well-written apology saying


---------53:29----------
yo i'm sorry if i offended you in any


---------53:30----------
way


---------53:31----------
i'm looking through this i don't see


---------53:32----------
what i've said but i had no intention


---------53:34----------
right


---------53:35----------
and then that's when i'll get the


---------53:36----------
response back right like and there's


---------53:38----------
many people uh big figures that i've


---------53:40----------
some some you've talked to some you


---------53:42----------
haven't


---------53:43----------
that have just directly said hey and i


---------53:45----------
can name names if you'd like they've


---------53:46----------
said


---------53:47----------
listen you have this aggressive


---------53:51----------
vibe to you your your voice


---------53:54----------
mixed in with your emotion scares people


---------53:57----------
these are the exact words written to me


---------53:59----------
by very credible


---------54:01----------
and like brand friendly like people like


---------54:03----------
direct messages


---------54:04----------
this exactly and i was very shocked that


---------54:06----------
they'd admit this because


---------54:07----------
no no one will they'd rather just put it


---------54:09----------
on me than admit it because it's a


---------54:10----------
direct


---------54:11----------
you know a conflict with their ego if


---------54:14----------
they admit it right so the fact that


---------54:15----------
this person


---------54:16----------
these people have admitted this only


---------54:19----------
after we've become


---------54:20----------
such you know does that make sense yeah


---------54:22----------
it makes sense i i just don't want to


---------54:24----------
accept that


---------54:25----------
i i don't like i'm having trouble i


---------54:27----------
realized why i'm offering this crazy


---------54:29----------
theory


---------54:30----------
i don't want to accept that you have to


---------54:32----------
live a life where people are scared of


---------54:34----------
you for you just being you


---------54:36----------
i don't think they're scared of me


---------54:38----------
whatever call it whatever you want i


---------54:40----------
just don't


---------54:41----------
i that hurts too much for me to think


---------54:43----------
about


---------54:44----------
so i i'm just for a way to disprove that


---------54:48----------
because i don't want that to be true and


---------54:51----------
there's


---------54:51----------
i think a lot i think a lot of people


---------54:53----------
don't want to be true either


---------54:54----------
i mean like over the last like four


---------54:56----------
years i i think i've been saying this


---------54:58----------
for a long time


---------54:59----------
and a lot you know it all started with


---------55:00----------
your delusional right ego andy


---------55:02----------
delusional like


---------55:03----------
not can't take responsibility then you


---------55:05----------
know a year goes by some people are like


---------55:06----------
holy [ __ ] you're right what the [ __ ] two


---------55:08----------
years goes by


---------55:09----------
now i'm at a point where there's content


---------55:10----------
creators that i don't even know that i'm


---------55:12----------
seeing post


---------55:12----------
things of me saying if train did this


---------55:14----------
people would freak the [ __ ] out


---------55:16----------
right when this guy does it they're cool


---------55:18----------
with it like


---------55:19----------
i see this everywhere now people that


---------55:20----------
i'm not even connected to because people


---------55:22----------
are slowly


---------55:23----------
the more i talk about it the more people


---------55:25----------
are stepping back and they're realizing


---------55:26----------
holy [ __ ]


---------55:28----------
six people just did this yesterday train


---------55:31----------
did one tenth of this


---------55:32----------
and there's 15 head threads and six news


---------55:34----------
articles and trying to get them banned


---------55:35----------
right


---------55:36----------
like it's there unfortunately you know


---------55:40----------
you know really what i want to do


---------55:41----------
i don't know if this is this is probably


---------55:42----------
a bad idea so i'm just going to share


---------55:44----------
this thought kind of randomly like i


---------55:45----------
wonder if we ever meet in person


---------55:47----------
you're you're in texas right yes so we


---------55:50----------
were thinking about as healthy gamer


---------55:51----------
doing sort of like an austin meetup


---------55:53----------
at some point and and what i'm just


---------55:56----------
really curious about this is probably a


---------55:57----------
terrible idea so we you know shouldn't


---------55:59----------
do it for all kinds of reasons


---------56:00----------
i'm really curious what i want to do is


---------56:02----------
i i want to introduce you to my kids


---------56:05----------
and i just want to see how they react


---------56:08----------
and if my kids are scared of you


---------56:11----------
boy is that going to hurt but i think


---------56:15----------
but if if they're not scared of you then


---------56:18----------
like i think we've got to go back to the


---------56:20----------
drawing board


---------56:21----------
i don't think they'll be scared of me


---------56:23----------
most kids that i meet like


---------56:24----------
they love me right like and


---------56:29----------
i don't know what like why do you think


---------56:31----------
that is why do you think it is that


---------56:32----------
adults are


---------56:33----------
i know scared as a strong word but you


---------56:35----------
know


---------56:36----------
because they have nothing to be


---------56:37----------
threatened by that's not it's not even a


---------56:39----------
thought in their head like


---------56:40----------
they don't like upon entrance of the


---------56:42----------
room they don't think oh damn


---------56:44----------
the [ __ ] like this guy walks in like


---------56:48----------
my girlfriend [ __ ] this guy like they're


---------56:49----------
not thinking they're not there all


---------56:51----------
they're thinking about is like


---------56:52----------
trade you're so deep into these people's


---------56:54----------
heads man that's wild


---------56:56----------
like just think about how much you're


---------56:58----------
inferring about someone else's thought


---------57:00----------
process


---------57:02----------
i i think i think it's just a


---------57:06----------
i don't think it's like something that's


---------57:07----------
like i think it's just basic human [ __ ]


---------57:11----------
to be honest right it's like a flight or


---------57:13----------
flight thing right like if i


---------57:15----------
right like if i see someone that's you


---------57:17----------
know right there's people i look at


---------57:19----------
listen i do it too and i have to step


---------57:21----------
back like holy [ __ ] this is what happens


---------57:23----------
to me i don't like it i gotta not do


---------57:24----------
this guy i i'm respond


---------57:25----------
i am guilty of doing what people do to


---------57:28----------
me to others


---------57:29----------
there's people i look at i'm like damn


---------57:31----------
this [ __ ] like can i act myself


---------57:32----------
can i be wild they're going to chill out


---------57:34----------
around this guy i might slap the [ __ ]


---------57:35----------
out of me right


---------57:35----------
i do the same thing right that's how i


---------57:38----------
can recognize it so well because i'm


---------57:40----------
guilty of it just just as everyone else


---------57:42----------
has their person that they're guilty of


---------57:43----------
it with too i think


---------57:45----------
the part of it is once you go through


---------57:46----------
yourself you really right there's a


---------57:48----------
wisdom to it


---------57:49----------
until you get to a certain point of


---------57:50----------
maturity maybe i don't know but


---------57:52----------
i've done it myself and i've i've


---------57:54----------
actually had to hold back my damn


---------57:55----------
this isn't right this isn't fair i don't


---------57:57----------
like this why the [ __ ] would he and i


---------57:59----------
end up meeting the guy and


---------58:00----------
you know sometimes he's actually a great


---------58:01----------
guy and sometimes he is actually a dick


---------58:04----------
well so that actually makes me a little


---------58:06----------
bit hopeful because


---------58:07----------
because what we tend to do as human


---------58:09----------
beings is apply


---------58:10----------
our own internal calculus to other


---------58:13----------
people


---------58:14----------
right so like just to give you an


---------58:16----------
example like a projection right yeah


---------58:17----------
like projecting


---------58:18----------
yeah so like like so for example um


---------58:22----------
you know i don't care about birthdays


---------58:26----------
and events and christmas and stuff like


---------58:28----------
that like i


---------58:28----------
enjoy christmas as a holiday with family


---------58:30----------
but gift giving has never really been


---------58:32----------
something that's important to me so


---------58:34----------
you know if my wife like gets bent out


---------58:36----------
of shape because she doesn't get me a


---------58:37----------
gift for her she was like bent out of


---------58:38----------
shape because like


---------58:40----------
my birthday rolled around and like there


---------58:42----------
wasn't a gift and i was like


---------58:44----------
you know but what she was doing in that


---------58:46----------
moment is


---------58:47----------
is assuming that i was going to react to


---------58:50----------
the


---------58:50----------
same situation the way that she would


---------58:53----------
and on the flip side


---------58:54----------
you know like sometimes i won't get her


---------58:55----------
a gift or or you know i've learned now


---------58:58----------
because i'm still married and you can't


---------58:59----------
stay married unless you learn


---------59:01----------
um but like you know i've kind of


---------59:03----------
learned but for a while like i didn't


---------59:05----------
prioritize gift giving for her because i


---------59:06----------
was like what


---------59:07----------
you know no big deal like i'll just get


---------59:09----------
you something at a random date because i


---------59:10----------
think it's


---------59:11----------
something that you'll like i don't have


---------59:12----------
to get it for an occasion


---------59:14----------
yeah and so i used to assume that she


---------59:17----------
had my thinking


---------59:18----------
and she used to assume that i had her


---------59:19----------
thinking when it comes to giving gifts


---------59:22----------
and that's just something that human


---------59:23----------
beings do and and that's what i'm kind


---------59:25----------
of saying is like


---------59:26----------
so first of all i admit that like like i


---------59:29----------
said i could be wrong


---------59:30----------
secondly i also admit that i have a i


---------59:32----------
care about you


---------59:34----------
and i don't want to accept


---------59:37----------
that you live in the world that you live


---------59:39----------
in


---------59:40----------
and so i'm going to go as far as


---------59:43----------
disputing that your reality is real


---------59:47----------
with the hopes that maybe it doesn't


---------59:48----------
have to be that way


---------59:51----------
now you make the most convincing


---------59:53----------
argument if you give me an


---------59:54----------
insult if you give me a narcissist


---------59:57----------
if you give me someone who has a history


---------59:59----------
of trauma


---------60:00----------
i feel pretty [ __ ] confident that


---------60:02----------
their perception of reality is wrong


---------60:04----------
and i am right i think the tricky thing


---------60:08----------
here is that you i think make the


---------60:10----------
strongest case


---------60:12----------
for your perception of reality being


---------60:15----------
right


---------60:16----------
which gives me a sliver of a hope that


---------60:18----------
like


---------60:19----------
something about the way that you


---------60:21----------
interact with people


---------60:23----------
actually creates the very thing that you


---------60:27----------
have learned to accept and that's the


---------60:29----------
other thing is like like


---------60:31----------
since you've learned to accept that


---------60:32----------
people treat you this way you know it


---------60:34----------
hurts and it sucks but you're just sort


---------60:36----------
of like that's life right like what am i


---------60:37----------
gonna do sit around and [ __ ] about it


---------60:39----------
like i still have a lot to be grateful


---------60:40----------
for


---------60:41----------
you know i've learned how to deal with


---------60:42----------
it and that also makes me sad because


---------60:45----------
it's like


---------60:46----------
i just don't want you to live a life


---------60:47----------
where like people are judging you this


---------60:49----------
way and i wonder a little bit


---------60:51----------
it's like this picture thing i think


---------60:52----------
there's more than meets the eye to this


---------60:54----------
whole situation


---------60:56----------
you just you just mentioned way too much


---------60:58----------
that you look like a gorilla


---------61:05----------
well there's one common thing i've been


---------61:06----------
told my entire life by everybody


---------61:08----------
love hate great you know friends enemies


---------61:11----------
there's one thing that's used to


---------61:13----------
describe me that's been common among


---------61:15----------
among everybody everyone says when they


---------61:17----------
meet me


---------61:18----------
and they say this about my eyes they say


---------61:21----------
i'm very


---------61:21----------
intense the way my eyes like stare like


---------61:24----------
it's very intense


---------61:26----------
i've been talking about everybody so


---------61:28----------
like maybe when we meet


---------61:30----------
you can do a little you know diagnosis


---------61:32----------
on that or whatever the hell you call it


---------61:33----------
right


---------61:34----------
and and that could be the start of


---------61:36----------
everything right like


---------61:38----------
i mean people listen on a more joking


---------61:41----------
side


---------61:41----------
people go as far as saying you know i


---------61:43----------

---------61:44----------
i've been through six wars some crazy


---------61:47----------
[ __ ]


---------61:48----------
right i remember my first girlfriend my


---------61:50----------

---------61:51----------
eyes and all she sees is darkness


---------61:53----------

---------61:56----------
just coming in my head


---------61:57----------
i'm being told these things like some


---------61:59----------
crazy [ __ ] and then right like and then


---------62:01----------
you know


---------62:01----------
there is the actor from the punisher he


---------62:04----------

---------62:10----------

---------62:48----------

---------62:50----------
train


---------62:56----------
you're not a scary guy man i know you


---------62:59----------
know what's crazy


---------63:00----------
when i tell jokes i have to and


---------63:04----------
hey you can ask my chat about this look


---------63:06----------
my vods i have developed this thing this


---------63:08----------
habit


---------63:09----------
over the last 10 years of my life where


---------63:12----------
i


---------63:13----------
have to every time i make a joke i need


---------63:16----------
to add a


---------63:17----------
fake laugh at the end of the joke it's


---------63:18----------
like a little chuckle to let people know


---------63:20----------
this is a joke right i'm telling you i'm


---------63:23----------
just i have this like very


---------63:25----------
i don't know what it is right yeah i


---------63:27----------
mean it's probably my fault but


---------63:28----------
you know that's it right there that was


---------63:31----------
it i can


---------63:32----------
i i can get behind it i i think i'm


---------63:34----------
convinced


---------63:36----------
i'm convinced that people look at you


---------63:38----------
and are intimidated


---------63:41----------
i'm convinced makes me sad


---------63:46----------
but i i don't think it's all in your


---------63:48----------
head i do still think that there are


---------63:50----------
elements of projection or almost like


---------63:52----------
this sort of projective insecurity like


---------63:55----------
you know like you know you're kind of


---------63:57----------
thinking like oh my god i'm so scary


---------63:59----------
and so like because the the truth the


---------64:02----------
truth i'm not thinking that though


---------64:03----------
because that's not the truth right like


---------64:05----------
if you and i talked deeper into it


---------64:07----------
i don't think i'm that because i know


---------64:09----------
what i actually am


---------64:10----------
that's the problem that's why that's why


---------64:12----------
i have to show the high school photo if


---------64:14----------
i truly thought i was scary


---------64:15----------
i wouldn't show the high school photo


---------64:17----------
i'd be like yeah what's up right


---------64:19----------
i need to show the high school photo


---------64:21----------
yeah no you


---------64:22----------
you would that's why you show the high


---------64:23----------
school photo right because you're


---------64:25----------
showing the high school photo to dispel


---------64:28----------
the myth that you are scary it's not


---------64:30----------
that you're scary on the inside


---------64:32----------
it's that you're the beast you're scary


---------64:34----------
on the outside


---------64:35----------
you've got this kind of like you know


---------64:38----------
ape-like countenance and intense


---------64:40----------
gaze a physical imposing kind of thing


---------64:43----------
and and and i'm just really torn because


---------64:46----------
i don't know if this is just like


---------64:48----------
you know just play to it right because


---------64:50----------
this is just what's what god has given


---------64:52----------
you


---------64:52----------
and you've got a deep voice and and you


---------64:54----------
know you are


---------64:56----------
and then there's a part of me that's


---------64:57----------
sort of like it's it's got to be tough


---------64:59----------
to be


---------65:00----------
you know to walk around and not be able


---------65:02----------
to talk i've heard this from women


---------65:03----------
actually


---------65:04----------
that like women have to learn like


---------65:06----------
especially in like high-powered


---------65:08----------
professions they have to learn


---------65:10----------
how to be how like use a different voice


---------65:13----------
i've heard of that actually


---------65:14----------
there are it's called something i've


---------65:15----------
heard of that we talked about that last


---------65:16----------
podcast actually


---------65:18----------
that in certain situations they have to


---------65:19----------
change their voice and thank you vocal


---------65:21----------
something


---------65:22----------
yeah vocal friend vocal fry sorry vocal


---------65:24----------
fry yeah yeah yeah so they'll like


---------65:25----------
they'll like add vocal fry to their


---------65:27----------
language so that


---------65:28----------
people don't think that they're a cold


---------65:29----------
[ __ ] and so they'll be sort of like


---------65:32----------
ditzy or valley girl or call it whatever


---------65:35----------
i i've


---------65:36----------
actually talked to women who sort of had


---------65:37----------
these experiences and i'm wondering


---------65:39----------
whether


---------65:40----------
yeah it's hard train i don't know i just


---------65:41----------
want you know because


---------65:43----------
something tells me like because my my


---------65:44----------
kids know the disney tropes and if


---------65:46----------
you're a scary looking dude i'm pretty


---------65:48----------
sure you know


---------65:50----------
one of my kids is kind of a scaredy cat


---------65:52----------
and i think if she's not scared of you


---------65:54----------
i i i'd sort of trust her


---------65:58----------
and i i think i i've i've never met a


---------66:00----------
kid that's scared of me


---------66:01----------
kids so so that's the other thing train


---------66:03----------
is i i think you've got to really think


---------66:04----------
about that right like because kids are


---------66:06----------
pretty


---------66:07----------
like they're pretty surface love i mean


---------66:09----------
in a sense they're surface level and in


---------66:10----------
the sense they're deep


---------66:12----------
and and and something makes me wonder


---------66:14----------
like why is it that


---------66:16----------
you've like what is it that the kids see


---------66:19----------
that the adults don't and what's the


---------66:21----------
difference there


---------66:22----------
it's it's not about what the kids see in


---------66:24----------
the adults don't it's what the kids


---------66:26----------
don't and what the adults see


---------66:27----------
right as you grow older there's


---------66:30----------
different stereotypes and social like


---------66:32----------
constructs or social standards that are


---------66:34----------
set such as what you said earlier right


---------66:36----------
the in cells say i don't have a jawline


---------66:38----------
she's not going to like me right


---------66:39----------
so when you point that out right thank


---------66:42----------
you


---------66:43----------
so thank you so much so


---------66:46----------
actually ludwig said the same thing like


---------66:48----------
two days ago but anyways so


---------66:50----------
just kidding but seriously but anyways


---------66:52----------
right when you point out that an incel


---------66:54----------
says


---------66:55----------
you know i have a small jawline she's


---------66:56----------
not gonna like me you're


---------66:58----------
you're literally right there it's being


---------67:00----------
admitted that


---------67:01----------
there is this weird social


---------67:04----------
uh uh uh standard set that if you have a


---------67:07----------
stress


---------67:08----------
strong jawline if you have a deep voice


---------67:11----------
if you look like a man then you're a


---------67:12----------
true man and without that you're not a


---------67:14----------
man right


---------67:15----------
so it's these things i think it's that


---------67:17----------
right i think it's insecurity


---------67:19----------
so right here's here's my experience


---------67:21----------
people who have


---------67:22----------
who i've met that have treated me normal


---------67:25----------
and they've been the coolest people in


---------67:26----------
the world


---------67:28----------
they could be the ugliest the most


---------67:29----------
beautiful they share one thing


---------67:32----------
confidence when they have


---------67:34----------
self-confidence there is


---------67:36----------
nothing there's none of this none of


---------67:38----------
this ever right


---------67:39----------
like a good example is will neff right i


---------67:42----------
think will neff


---------67:43----------
has a a a a


---------67:46----------
strong uh uh grasp of who he is at least


---------67:50----------
for now with where he is in life i don't


---------67:52----------
know and


---------67:53----------
i think he has a confidence when he sees


---------67:56----------
me he doesn't see me as this


---------67:58----------
he talks me like we're talk like like


---------67:59----------
we're souls floating in the sky


---------68:01----------
right so there's different people that


---------68:03----------
i've met that have just a true


---------68:04----------
confidence


---------68:06----------
and i never have that issue with it's


---------68:08----------
usually


---------68:10----------
you know and when i say true confidence


---------68:12----------
it's understanding and being one with


---------68:13----------
your insecurities i don't think it's


---------68:14----------
possible to be


---------68:15----------
fully rid of your insecurities or at


---------68:17----------
least like i think everyone has them and


---------68:19----------
you kind of become aware of them you


---------68:20----------
manage them you know


---------68:22----------
maybe one day you can live without them


---------68:23----------
sure but like i think insecurities make


---------68:25----------
who you are right


---------68:26----------
so when i say confidence that's what i'm


---------68:28----------
referring to right i think


---------68:30----------
go ahead can i ask you kind of just a


---------68:32----------
random question that i i don't think


---------68:33----------
we've talked about and i find myself


---------68:34----------
being really curious about this


---------68:36----------
so what is what is what have your


---------68:38----------
romantic relationships been like


---------68:44----------
good i've had three girlfriends


---------68:48----------
that's it and they've been good you know


---------68:52----------
uh


---------68:55----------
you know i think they you know


---------68:59----------
when i talk honestly with them i think


---------69:00----------
they you know they open up


---------69:02----------
you know you know i actually just had


---------69:04----------
this conversation recently with


---------69:06----------
uh my current girlfriend and we were


---------69:07----------
talking about when she first met me


---------69:09----------
versus


---------69:09----------
you know what she knows of me now you


---------69:10----------
know what she knows of me now you know


---------69:12----------
she knows i'm like a nice guy and you


---------69:14----------
know


---------69:14----------
i'm softer than inside but when she


---------69:16----------
first met me when she first looked at me


---------69:18----------
you know she thought i was just


---------69:20----------
this douchebag she even


---------69:23----------
went as far as me you know me even when


---------69:24----------
as far as saying you know


---------69:26----------
she could see me snapping becoming you


---------69:28----------
know serial killer or some [ __ ] right


---------69:29----------
like


---------69:29----------
like these are the things right that are


---------69:31----------
admitted like once you like get close


---------69:32----------
enough with someone where they're where


---------69:34----------
they they lose nothing admitting these


---------69:35----------
things to you right i've been told that


---------69:36----------
by a lot of people the serial killer


---------69:38----------
remark i've been told that by


---------69:39----------
so many people and it's the eyes it's


---------69:42----------
the eyes i don't know what it is listen


---------69:43----------
with my eyes what what i looked at you


---------69:46----------
already we did this we played this game


---------69:49----------
so i i don't know what that does to like


---------69:50----------
i'm just so professionally like i don't


---------69:53----------
know what what it does to a human being


---------69:55----------
to be told by multiple people that


---------69:57----------
i thought you look like a serial killer


---------70:00----------
like what the [ __ ] man


---------70:02----------
what does that do to someone


---------70:06----------
well to be fair she was just using it as


---------70:08----------
an example to like she thinks i would


---------70:09----------
like you know


---------70:10----------
you know beat someone's ass if they


---------70:12----------
pissed me off right she was like but


---------70:14----------
other people


---------70:14----------
when they say that i think they're being


---------70:15----------
serious i don't think she was being i


---------70:17----------
don't think she'd date me if she was


---------70:18----------
she thought that right i don't because


---------70:19----------
like she's she's like a good girl right


---------70:21----------
so i don't think she'd date me if she


---------70:22----------
thought that but when other people tell


---------70:24----------
me that


---------70:25----------
you know i don't know i don't know i


---------70:28----------
guess the people that tell me that i


---------70:29----------
don't really [ __ ] with


---------70:31----------
so i'm kind of happy they think that


---------70:32----------
because i don't want them coming near me


---------70:33----------
so i think it works it's a win-win


---------70:35----------
does that make any sense yeah i mean so


---------70:39----------
i don't know man trained you've


---------70:43----------
i i don't know that i'm i'm just so


---------70:46----------
conflicted between


---------70:48----------
my heart going out to you and also like


---------70:51----------
thinking that


---------70:52----------
if if you did have a gigantic amount of


---------70:54----------
cognitive bias or projection


---------70:56----------
or view of the world how would that


---------70:58----------
happen it would be


---------70:59----------
like you know a 15 year old kid being


---------71:01----------
told that they look like a serial killer


---------71:02----------
i mean it's


---------71:03----------
i don't know that you were 15 at the


---------71:04----------
time 18 years old 19 year old i do want


---------71:06----------
to make clear


---------71:07----------
the reference i made it was more of like


---------71:09----------
a metaphoric thing of like how mad i'd


---------71:11----------
get


---------71:11----------
right with my girlfriend's i don't know


---------71:14----------
the other the other people i don't know


---------71:15----------
i just want to make that clear because


---------71:16----------
that's not fair i i've been on this


---------71:18----------
earth for 38 years and no one has ever


---------71:20----------
called me


---------71:20----------
a serial killer in any way shape or form


---------71:22----------
even jokingly metaphorically


---------71:28----------
if there is something that i'm doing


---------71:30----------
right i can't even think like even if i


---------71:31----------
told


---------71:32----------
even if i roasted somebody told him to


---------71:33----------
suck my dick and [ __ ] off i don't even


---------71:35----------
think that would


---------71:36----------
would justify their silicone thing so i


---------71:38----------
don't know what i'm doing right


---------71:40----------
they're watching me behind the screen so


---------71:42----------
what could i be doing


---------71:43----------
so that's that's a damn good question


---------71:45----------
right so like you you have a lot of good


---------71:46----------
hypotheses you have it's it's my voice


---------71:49----------
it's my face it's my gaze i think all


---------71:52----------
those make sense but then i think i i


---------71:54----------
gotta think


---------71:55----------
there are some things you're doing right


---------71:56----------
because you're doing this weird [ __ ]


---------71:57----------
like showing a bunch of people your high


---------71:59----------
school photo


---------72:00----------
could it be my demeanor


---------72:04----------
uh that's the thing i i don't know if it


---------72:06----------
could be demeanor or attitude


---------72:08----------
or mindset or like whether there's some


---------72:10----------
weird ass because i think you certainly


---------72:12----------
sound like you're projecting like when


---------72:15----------
when i hear people


---------72:17----------
go into a lot of detail about what other


---------72:19----------
people are thinking that usually is


---------72:21----------
coming from you


---------72:22----------
it's not coming from that right if you


---------72:24----------
think about someone who's got social


---------72:25----------
anxiety for example they're like you


---------72:26----------
walk into


---------72:27----------
like a room and they're like yeah these


---------72:28----------
people all think i look like stupid


---------72:31----------
and like the the more they double down


---------72:33----------
on knowing what is in someone else's


---------72:36----------
head the more likely they are


---------72:39----------
to be incorrect the real problem


---------72:42----------
but but these things weren't here until


---------72:44----------
they were said it's like


---------72:45----------
you know that's that makes sense it does


---------72:48----------
so that's that's where i'm really


---------72:49----------
conflicted because i don't know if


---------72:50----------
you're just you're pulling the same


---------72:51----------
biodeterminism [ __ ] that an incel is


---------72:54----------
or if this is actually like you know


---------72:57----------
because it's not like


---------72:58----------
you know incel is it's such a common


---------73:01----------
phenomenon that you can't


---------73:04----------
it's not just one person's psychology


---------73:06----------
right like well the thing is with an


---------73:07----------
end cell and cells projecting all that


---------73:09----------
onto you know and they


---------73:11----------
they they hate women or whatever right i


---------73:15----------
it's not the case where i'm sitting here


---------73:16----------
like hating everybody i


---------73:18----------
i'm i just go about my life i i just


---------73:20----------
have to have to work a little harder


---------73:21----------
i put it on myself i don't think they


---------73:23----------
put it on themselves they put it on the


---------73:24----------
people


---------73:25----------
right i think insult puts it on the


---------73:26----------
women i'm putting this on myself right


---------73:28----------
that's why i have to constantly give


---------73:29----------
disclaimers that's why i'm constantly


---------73:31----------
adding laughs to the end of my jokes


---------73:32----------
i'm taking responsibility realizing that


---------73:34----------
if this is how it is i need to maybe


---------73:36----------
work a little harder


---------73:37----------
to get to the base minimum i'm not


---------73:38----------
putting it on them right if that was the


---------73:40----------
case [ __ ]


---------73:41----------
right so yeah that makes sense i'm with


---------73:43----------
you i think that's very


---------73:44----------
different it's a huge difference i think


---------73:46----------
it makes you adaptive and


---------73:48----------
makes it healthy the thing that i still


---------73:50----------
don't want to accept


---------73:51----------
because i care about you and i like you


---------73:54----------
is that it has to be that way at all


---------73:57----------
i just don't want to accept that


---------74:04----------
so i i don't know i mean i think you


---------74:06----------
could be right but well


---------74:07----------
if i'm not right then hey let me know


---------74:09----------
because i'd love to you know i'd love to


---------74:11----------
change it


---------74:11----------
but let me ask you this when i change my


---------74:15----------
when i change my uh tone of voice and


---------74:18----------
i'm you know accepted in and well


---------74:20----------
received and everyone's cool


---------74:22----------
how can that be like refuted really like


---------74:25----------
how can you explain that phenomenon i


---------74:26----------
guess


---------74:27----------
like right very very simply and this is


---------74:31----------
hard but the the real question is


---------74:33----------
whether that actually happens


---------74:36----------
right so your perception is that when


---------74:38----------
you change your voice


---------74:40----------
people treat you in a different way oh


---------74:42----------
for sure


---------74:43----------
i'll make you vods right so so that's


---------74:47----------
that's what the in cell says for sure


---------74:49----------
i'll show you all this data about how i


---------74:51----------
was rejected by women because of my


---------74:53----------
jawline


---------74:55----------
no because that's that's made up that's


---------74:57----------
in their heads like they're being


---------74:58----------
rejected because


---------75:00----------
their insecurity their jaw line is


---------75:01----------
seeping through them physically and the


---------75:03----------
girls recognizing that right


---------75:04----------
but there's a difference there no but


---------75:06----------
the whole point is that you have an


---------75:08----------
opinion that you are saying this is


---------75:10----------
reality you have a particular way of


---------75:11----------
interpreting events


---------75:13----------
that you say is reality


---------75:16----------
yeah but what i'm being told by these


---------75:18----------
group of people by


---------75:19----------
the leaders of themselves in cells get


---------75:21----------
told too right like the only thing is


---------75:23----------
that they have a


---------75:24----------
they have a cognitive bias that causes


---------75:26----------
them to filter


---------75:28----------
certain kinds of information and then


---------75:30----------
they believe that


---------75:31----------
reality is a particular way let me let


---------75:34----------
me


---------75:34----------
read this you know this is a very


---------75:36----------
awkward situation because there's this


---------75:37----------
whole


---------75:38----------
meme based on some of the things that i


---------75:40----------
preach and say


---------75:41----------
of this in-cell stuff so people are


---------75:42----------
going to eat this the hell up but they


---------75:43----------
can suck my dick but realistically i'll


---------75:45----------
read you


---------75:45----------
the message so you can see that i'm not


---------75:47----------
projecting or adding some things in


---------75:48----------
there you can


---------75:49----------
i will read this out loud to you you can


---------75:50----------
tell me what you take from it okay


---------75:53----------
okay let me find it i mean you can tell


---------75:55----------
me


---------75:56----------
give me a sec i'm not going to tell you


---------75:58----------
from who i'll tell you privately but


---------76:00----------
you know what i mean i've already said


---------76:01----------
on my stream 100 times


---------76:03----------
yeah so just while we're waiting i want


---------76:05----------
to echo once again that i


---------76:07----------
you know this is i really could be wrong


---------76:10----------
here i just i just don't know


---------76:12----------
i don't think that this it just fits the


---------76:14----------
pattern train but it doesn't


---------76:16----------
feel accurate to me if that makes sense


---------76:20----------
[Music]


---------76:26----------
sorry i zoned either okay here we go


---------76:28----------
here it is here to service


---------76:30----------
okay here we go


---------76:34----------
okay okay so


---------76:43----------
this individual says


---------76:47----------
lol to be honest you have an


---------76:49----------
intimidating presence


---------76:50----------
i thoroughly enjoy playing with you and


---------76:52----------
i'm always down to play more


---------76:54----------
but the lobby gets upset when people


---------76:56----------
raise their voices even a little


---------76:58----------
i hope you didn't take offense i didn't


---------77:01----------
mean your intimidating presence thing in


---------77:02----------
a bad way at all


---------77:03----------
but that's just that so that's exactly


---------77:06----------
what i was told to me right so this is


---------77:07----------
what's being told to me right


---------77:09----------
so either i am mistaken what she just or


---------77:12----------
what this individual just said


---------77:14----------
and i'm delusional like an incel or


---------77:17----------
this person just explained exactly what


---------77:19----------
i'm trying to explain to you happens


---------77:23----------
so here's the question how what happens


---------77:25----------
when other people raise their voices


---------77:31----------
uh you know i i gotta think i don't know


---------77:33----------
i i gotta i gotta sit in on these people


---------77:35----------
like because i i've


---------77:36----------
heard so much [ __ ] about among us


---------77:39----------
i have to just listen to you guys


---------77:41----------
playing this [ __ ] game


---------77:43----------
because i haven't done that yet i'm just


---------77:46----------
curious like


---------77:47----------
what like i like i just yeah dude i i


---------77:50----------
don't know i don't know that we're gonna


---------77:52----------
like i i want data i want my own data


---------77:55----------
well here's the thing i don't have an


---------77:57----------
issue with it with it right like i


---------77:59----------
haven't like


---------78:00----------
changed the way i treat people i still


---------78:01----------
do the things that i do i still do what


---------78:03----------
i believe i still


---------78:04----------
you know do my good stuff it's not that


---------78:05----------
like i haven't like become


---------78:07----------
what's the word i'm looking for i


---------78:08----------
haven't become uh


---------78:11----------
jaded because of this i haven't become


---------78:13----------
some douchebag and just dismissing


---------78:14----------
everyone [ __ ] everybody like not the


---------78:15----------
case


---------78:16----------
i just i just recognize it and


---------78:19----------
i try to just hang around people that


---------78:21----------
know me and the ones that don't it is


---------78:23----------
what it is right


---------78:24----------
like we'll have a conversation or two so


---------78:25----------
like that's the that's the main


---------78:27----------
difference i think right i think you


---------78:28----------
just wanted to know a little deeper of


---------78:29----------
how it felt


---------78:31----------
and yeah it doesn't feel good but that's


---------78:33----------
just that's kind of just the way it's


---------78:34----------
been since middle school high school


---------78:35----------
right so this isn't something new i've


---------78:37----------
just realized in the streaming world


---------78:38----------
it's been like this


---------78:40----------
now i guess you could go as far as


---------78:41----------
saying well what's the common


---------78:42----------
denominator and all these you


---------78:44----------
so the problem could be you right that's


---------78:46----------
a completely logical


---------78:47----------
thing to come to right and i could


---------78:50----------
definitely


---------78:51----------
understand you know that but you know


---------78:54----------
over the internet


---------78:55----------
so when i'm in person now that i'm over


---------78:57----------
the internet when i'm being told like


---------78:58----------
you have an intimidating presence


---------79:00----------
i'm not doing anything right like i'm


---------79:04----------
literally not doing anything


---------79:05----------
yeah yeah does that make any sense i


---------79:07----------
mean i guess i guess i guess you could


---------79:08----------
argue that maybe


---------79:09----------
subconsciously some sort of projection


---------79:12----------
or insecurity seeking through and


---------79:13----------
i guess you could argue that but how


---------79:14----------
could i control that if it's


---------79:15----------
subconscious


---------79:16----------
that just sounds like psychological


---------79:18----------
[ __ ] to me so so here's


---------79:20----------
here's kind of where where i am right


---------79:21----------
now is like i i think i think train


---------79:24----------
yeah i mean i i think you


---------79:28----------
i like the word intense


---------79:31----------
more so than intimidating i like intense


---------79:34----------
too


---------79:35----------
well i i i just always think that as a


---------79:37----------
negative thing


---------79:38----------
but now i just realize it means i think


---------79:40----------
it's it's sort of like


---------79:42----------
i i think you have a certain charisma


---------79:45----------
too and it's not


---------79:48----------
it i kind of think about do you play d d


---------79:52----------
i don't but i've heard it's very fun


---------79:55----------
okay so like


---------79:56----------
i sort of think about charisma not


---------79:58----------
necessarily as making you likeable but


---------80:00----------
that you have like a force of


---------80:01----------
personality that can influence other


---------80:04----------
people right so it's it's not just that


---------80:07----------
you can be


---------80:09----------
it's like you can be intimidating you


---------80:12----------
can be inspiring


---------80:13----------
and like people have different sort of


---------80:14----------
flavors of charisma i like that i like


---------80:17----------
that a lot actually


---------80:18----------
but but i i think it's just something


---------80:19----------
about who you are i mean i have it too


---------80:21----------
it's just mine is a different color from


---------80:23----------
yours


---------80:26----------
right and and so so


---------80:30----------
it's been interesting to see what it


---------80:32----------
impact you can have on other people


---------80:35----------
just by virtue of your presence which is


---------80:37----------
probably an amalgamation


---------80:39----------
of things like the way that you speak


---------80:42----------
subconscious tendencies


---------80:44----------
your voice i will admit i will admit one


---------80:47----------
thing dr k


---------80:48----------
there is one thing that i think adds to


---------80:50----------
it that i am in control of that i'm 100


---------80:52----------
responsible for


---------80:53----------
like when i think about it there's one


---------80:54----------
thing that i know i can stop


---------80:57----------
or at least be more attentive to it or


---------80:59----------
like be more aware of it


---------81:02----------
and it's a flaw that makes if you want


---------81:05----------
to call it a passive worse


---------81:06----------
and it's my it's my


---------81:10----------
combativeness it's my extreme


---------81:12----------
defensiveness


---------81:13----------
so like if you come at me with something


---------81:16----------
right like i'll take it and then i'm


---------81:17----------
coming back


---------81:18----------
right it's that so i think that is


---------81:20----------
actually something that


---------81:21----------
i would have a control over and i do


---------81:22----------
have a controller and i need to work on


---------81:25----------
because i think that actually would add


---------81:27----------
a negative thing to it all right


---------81:30----------
does that make sense yeah why do you do


---------81:33----------
that


---------81:36----------
i don't know i was just i guess it was


---------81:38----------
just the friend i don't know the way the


---------81:39----------
way me and my friend


---------81:41----------
listen i had a [ __ ] up friend group my


---------81:43----------
friend group


---------81:45----------
there was no you know


---------81:48----------
mature classy arguments there was no you


---------81:51----------
know disagreeing and moving on there was


---------81:53----------
no shaking hands


---------81:55----------
every single disagreement


---------81:59----------
was a punch of the mouth it was all fist


---------82:01----------
fights


---------82:02----------
probably three four five hundred plus


---------82:04----------
fist fights just in the period of like


---------82:06----------
high school


---------82:06----------
within my group of friends and that was


---------82:08----------
my friends and then obviously the high


---------82:10----------
school experience was [ __ ] terrible


---------82:11----------
that was just psychological bullying


---------82:13----------
so like that's just kind of where i am


---------82:15----------
right everything was just kind of uh


---------82:16----------
you know you come at me i come at you


---------82:18----------
you get coming right it was just back


---------82:19----------
and forth


---------82:20----------
does that make sense yeah i think that


---------82:23----------
could explain a lot of what we're


---------82:24----------
talking about because like i wonder if


---------82:26----------
that attitude


---------82:27----------
seeps through even if you don't


---------82:30----------
wait for people to come at you


---------82:33----------
right you may be signaling to people


---------82:36----------
train that


---------82:36----------
if you come at me i'm gonna come at you


---------82:43----------
yeah 100 i think that's definitely


---------82:45----------
something that's there 100


---------82:47----------
yes i think for sure i give up [ __ ]


---------82:50----------
is that not like relevant to you being


---------82:53----------
intimidated because everyone has that


---------82:55----------
right now if i if i if i call out let's


---------82:57----------
say uh bigdick6974 and say hey


---------82:59----------
what's up [ __ ] you have a big ass


---------83:00----------
nose what do you think he's gonna say


---------83:02----------
he's gonna say


---------83:03----------
look who's talking [ __ ] dome head big


---------83:05----------
ass head [ __ ]


---------83:06----------
gigantic ass bobble head right that's


---------83:08----------
what i'm talking about we'll just go


---------83:08----------
back and forth


---------83:09----------
but but i don't know that big ass dick


---------83:12----------
ass


---------83:13----------
997 is


---------83:16----------
is gonna is gonna be


---------83:19----------
exuding that pheromone


---------83:25----------
like pheromone isn't like we're talking


---------83:26----------
like some like crazy [ __ ] we're talking


---------83:28----------
like the [ __ ] that like the wild in the


---------83:30----------
kingdom


---------83:31----------
you know the female gorillas are


---------83:32----------
attracted to i mean i mean i'm i'm not


---------83:35----------
i i don't mean literal pheromone i i


---------83:37----------
mean like like if


---------83:38----------
if you have a presence where you're sort


---------83:41----------
of like ready to throw down which sounds


---------83:44----------
like it could have been conditioned in


---------83:45----------
you because that's sort of like


---------83:47----------
where you grew up right like you grew up


---------83:49----------
around


---------83:50----------
well no i grew up in a very good place


---------83:52----------
let's not get that to a stop i don't


---------83:53----------
want to sound like i'm


---------83:54----------
from the hood i'm not okay with my


---------83:55----------
friend group like you said you guys got


---------83:56----------
into my friend group yeah


---------83:58----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah like so


---------84:00----------
you were conditioned to be


---------84:01----------
like on your guard and sort of like let


---------84:04----------
people know


---------84:05----------
that you know if you [ __ ] with me like


---------84:07----------
i'm gonna [ __ ] with you


---------84:08----------
and i don't think most people like i


---------84:10----------
don't think i'm i don't think


---------84:12----------
you know i think i don't think i was


---------84:14----------
conditioned the same way


---------84:16----------
like if anything well i'm not gonna hurt


---------84:18----------
you like i i i'm not the type to punch


---------84:20----------
in the face i don't like that i just


---------84:22----------
always do headlocks


---------84:23----------
i i i get what you're saying but what


---------84:26----------
like you're the one who said hey i think


---------84:29----------
that this could be something that i do


---------84:30----------
that contributes and it


---------84:31----------
sounds like to me that it could


---------84:33----------
contribute a lot like i'm agreeing with


---------84:35----------
you


---------84:36----------
yeah i agree but but let's not forget


---------84:38----------
that like i'm never really on the attack


---------84:41----------
i'm i'm the defensive so like we have to


---------84:43----------
we have to ask why


---------84:45----------
the attack is happening in the first


---------84:46----------
place right sure


---------84:48----------
but this definitely isn't a good


---------84:49----------
reaction my reaction is terrible so


---------84:50----------
here's here's what i'm hearing


---------84:52----------
is that like you you walk softly and you


---------84:54----------
carry a big stick that's only six and a


---------84:58----------
half inches but yeah


---------85:00----------
right pretty thick though


---------85:03----------
and i'm cut okay


---------85:08----------
but you know it's something to think


---------85:10----------
about train like whether whether that


---------85:12----------
sort of


---------85:12----------
readiness is maybe a good way to put it


---------85:15----------
is part of what contributes to the way


---------85:17----------
that people respond to you like


---------85:19----------
there's a certain like readiness and


---------85:21----------
willingness to throw down


---------85:23----------
why i had to i had to


---------85:26----------
it was it was it was what i needed to be


---------85:30----------
right so yeah what i'm saying is like


---------85:33----------
absolutely so so


---------85:34----------
it's what you needed to be and now the


---------85:37----------
real question is


---------85:38----------
how much of an influence does that


---------85:41----------
part that you've carried with you exert


---------85:44----------
on your interactions


---------85:46----------
and i'm almost wondering whether like


---------85:47----------
the the picture the high school picture


---------85:50----------
is a way to disarm that


---------85:56----------
i use the high school picture to disarm


---------85:57----------
everything yep


---------85:59----------
yeah i mean i don't listen i don't think


---------86:01----------
listen when i go to conversation


---------86:03----------
okay what do you think this


---------86:06----------
if you look at the entire way i talk


---------86:09----------
does that make sense or you know you


---------86:12----------
know well you know


---------86:13----------
this is all to try and add a quirkiness


---------86:17----------
a a level of like goofiness a level of


---------86:21----------
unsureness uncertainty because if i just


---------86:23----------
say


---------86:24----------
dr k this is what it is how do you think


---------86:25----------
that's gonna be perceived that's getting


---------86:26----------
perceived as


---------86:27----------
cocky thinks he knows everything he's 29


---------86:29----------
and thinks he's figured out life


---------86:31----------
right so you i don't know you know you


---------86:33----------
know i mean does that make any sense i


---------86:35----------
i can't explain right you have to add


---------86:36----------
these in there otherwise


---------86:38----------
believe me whatever's happening now it's


---------86:40----------
gonna be 50 times [ __ ] worse does


---------86:41----------
that make any sense


---------86:44----------
you feel me i i want to see i want to


---------86:46----------
see the 50 times worse i want to see


---------86:48----------
that


---------86:50----------
okay ask me a question


---------86:57----------
tell me about your girlfriend


---------87:01----------
that's not [ __ ] fair that's that's a


---------87:03----------
soft spot right i'm saying


---------87:06----------
i'm saying ask ask like a question you


---------87:07----------
know what i'm saying you can't like


---------87:08----------
right


---------87:09----------
i'm not gonna say oh well you know she's


---------87:12----------
a


---------87:12----------
bad [ __ ] no like she's a good girl


---------87:15----------
she's you know


---------87:16----------
a very nice and classy woman you know


---------87:18----------
good morals good ethics


---------87:20----------
um you know uh


---------87:24----------
she's just a good person you know she


---------87:26----------
has a lot of qualities that


---------87:27----------
i don't have that i wish i had and


---------87:31----------
you know i see a you know


---------87:34----------
version of me in her that i wish one day


---------87:38----------
i could be i guess


---------87:39----------
does that make any sense beautiful


---------87:42----------
beautiful bro because i i think it had


---------87:44----------
your intensity


---------87:46----------
it had your presence it had a depth of


---------87:49----------
voice


---------87:50----------
it was profound it was intense and it


---------87:52----------
wasn't scary


---------87:54----------
it was devoted oh yeah


---------87:57----------
you asked about my girlfriend if you ask


---------87:59----------
one of my friends i'm going to tell you


---------88:00----------
like nice


---------88:00----------
you know well so but hold on like i mean


---------88:02----------
if if


---------88:03----------
if you asked me to step in the ring and


---------88:05----------
then i'd throw a punch and then you said


---------88:06----------
nothing below the belt like


---------88:08----------
you asked me to throw a punch and i


---------88:10----------
threw a punch


---------88:12----------
because my whole point is that you can


---------88:14----------
be intense


---------88:15----------
you can be passionate and it's not scary


---------88:17----------
it's [ __ ] amazing dude


---------88:20----------
it's beautiful


---------88:25----------
thank you you're beautiful


---------88:30----------
i love that sweater by the way i don't


---------88:31----------
mean to break off to different topic


---------88:33----------
that sweater since day one since i first


---------88:35----------
saw your channel


---------88:36----------
i don't know if it's just if it's a


---------88:38----------
tactic psychologists or psychiatrists


---------88:40----------
have


---------88:41----------
that sweater i swear in itself is a cure


---------88:44----------
to so much like it's almost as if like


---------88:46----------
this sweater is just it's it's


---------88:48----------
trustworthy it's cozy i feel like i'm


---------88:50----------
talking to sanjay gupta on cnn like


---------88:52----------
like he always has that like blue


---------88:54----------
sweater on on cnn i'm talking about i


---------88:56----------
said


---------88:56----------
same blue sweater he has and then i'm


---------88:58----------
talking to dr k


---------88:59----------
here i just i just realized holy [ __ ]


---------89:03----------
that that may have just sounded racist


---------89:04----------
because i feel like i'm talking to


---------89:05----------
sanjay gupta i didn't mean that at all


---------89:07----------
hope you don't take any offense to that


---------89:10----------
no good good what i mean is like every


---------89:13----------
like


---------89:13----------
good vibe doctor wears a sweater like


---------89:17----------
that


---------89:18----------
and that the sweater in itself has to be


---------89:21----------
like some hairy


---------89:22----------
have you seen in harry potter they give


---------89:23----------
you a little like quilt that makes you


---------89:25----------
invisible


---------89:26----------
i feel like this is the psychiatry


---------89:27----------
psychology md


---------89:29----------
quilt that goes over you and it


---------89:33----------
it it's like a magnet of


---------89:37----------
it draws


---------89:40----------
i don't know i lost my train of thought


---------89:42----------
completely the point is it's a really


---------89:43----------
nice sweater i


---------89:44----------
i mean you know then again my dad has


---------89:46----------
one of those too


---------89:47----------
my dad's not a doctor but he has one of


---------89:49----------
those and i really like it


---------89:50----------
i used to wear soccer practice anyway


---------89:52----------
sorry i i went on a whole different road


---------89:54----------
there


---------89:54----------
yeah well i you know i'm glad it


---------89:58----------
turns you on you know it just it's so


---------90:02----------
cozy i can't explain it entirely it's


---------90:04----------
just it's very cozy


---------90:05----------
i feel safe i i'm i'm with you i


---------90:08----------
appreciate that so i i also so the


---------90:09----------
reason i love the sweater so this this


---------90:11----------
[ __ ] it's a high quality thing i wore it


---------90:13----------
literally like


---------90:15----------
you know five days a week for four years


---------90:17----------
or i have


---------90:18----------
two or three actually is that something


---------90:20----------
i give to you in med school


---------90:22----------
no or whatever you go to presidency and


---------90:24----------
and the reason is because like you know


---------90:26----------
we work in hospitals and hospitals are


---------90:28----------
cold and i'm


---------90:28----------
like a little bit cold-blooded so i


---------90:31----------
would wear it


---------90:32----------
all the time um and i i really like it


---------90:35----------
because it it's just


---------90:36----------
very very comfortable and keeps me kind


---------90:38----------
of snug and there


---------90:40----------
there are some studies that suggest that


---------90:42----------
um white coats which is what a lot of


---------90:44----------
doctors wear


---------90:45----------
uh actually can make people nervous so


---------90:48----------
it's sort of like white coat is sort of


---------90:50----------
a symbol of authority


---------90:51----------
um so i steer clear of the white coat


---------90:54----------
um and a lot of people do nowadays


---------90:56----------
actually yeah funny thing


---------90:58----------
go ahead yeah so a lot of doctors wear


---------91:00----------
fewer white coats and a lot of nurse


---------91:01----------
practitioners and physician assistants


---------91:03----------
are wearing more white coats


---------91:05----------
yeah white coats are like i feel like


---------91:07----------
i've been abducted by aliens and they're


---------91:09----------
about to aimly probe me


---------91:10----------
you know what i'm talking about yeah


---------91:12----------
that sweater feels like i've come to


---------91:13----------
your house and you're ready like you've


---------91:14----------
opened your mind up to me it seems like


---------91:16----------
we're


---------91:16----------
we're on a more human you know level


---------91:20----------
rather than like an objective specimen


---------91:22----------
level does that make sense


---------91:23----------
yeah i'm glad you feel that way i you


---------91:25----------
know i just wear it because it's comfy


---------91:27----------
and you know hmm


---------91:32----------
wow sorry sorry we went off on that


---------91:34----------
tangent i just kind of


---------91:36----------
that sweater since since since day one


---------91:38----------
that you've come on


---------91:39----------
uh twitch i've been telling myself about


---------91:42----------
that sweater i just had to say something


---------91:45----------
okay that's it


---------91:49----------
okay thanks for sharing thanks for


---------91:52----------
thanks for listening um


---------91:56----------
yeah are we at a good stopping point for


---------91:59----------
today


---------92:00----------
i guess we are you know what's crazy the


---------92:02----------
last three sessions we've


---------92:04----------
stopped so the next session we can get


---------92:06----------
into the drug use days


---------92:08----------
and we always talk about some some some


---------92:11----------
small little avenue


---------92:13----------
that ends up being this huge topic that


---------92:15----------
we never intended for


---------92:17----------
and then we never get to the uh crazy


---------92:19----------
days of craving chaos right in between


---------92:21----------
high school and college


---------92:22----------
you know finding the you know the


---------92:24----------
identity finding yourself


---------92:26----------
what helped me come back and cold turkey


---------92:28----------
and you know not go to any


---------92:29----------
rehabs or you know rely on suboxone or


---------92:32----------
anything and just do it full cold turkey


---------92:33----------
like what


---------92:34----------
you know gave me that strength you know


---------92:36----------
i want to go into these things because


---------92:37----------
i understand that you're a uh uh like


---------92:40----------
addiction


---------92:41----------
uh uh psychiatrist right i may have


---------92:44----------
missed this but i didn't realize you had


---------92:45----------
a period of extended drug use


---------92:47----------
oh yeah heroin uh i've used meth before


---------92:51----------
uh you know percocets oxycontin that was


---------92:53----------
like probably two years two three years


---------92:54----------
of my life


---------92:56----------
crazy that's rough man yeah yeah


---------93:00----------
you know if you wanted to know it's


---------93:01----------
crazy too i wanna know what's insane it


---------93:02----------
was while i was in school


---------93:04----------
getting both of my degrees and i still


---------93:06----------
maintain my grades maintain my uh office


---------93:09----------
hours


---------93:09----------
while doing this in between it was some


---------93:11----------
crazy [ __ ] and the two people i did it


---------93:13----------
with that got me into it


---------93:15----------
are both doctors today and they were


---------93:17----------
they were literally pre-med


---------93:19----------
and i remember like they had to study


---------93:21----------
for their ocam and their pee


---------93:22----------
cam and they were just non-stop in the


---------93:25----------
office hours just doing all the extra


---------93:26----------
work with the professor because you know


---------93:27----------
if you


---------93:28----------
go to office hours they increase your


---------93:29----------
grade like 23 at the end even if you


---------93:31----------
don't deserve it


---------93:32----------
so like it was just an insane [ __ ]


---------93:34----------
some should have a movie


---------93:35----------
but you should never lose drugs don't


---------93:37----------
ever do those drugs terrible [ __ ]


---------93:38----------
drugs not even once i'll explain next


---------93:40----------
time why not even once


---------93:41----------
i have this theory on what not even once


---------93:42----------
means it's not even about


---------93:44----------
it's not about the effect of it to you


---------93:48----------
it's about once you make that your new


---------93:51----------
base


---------93:52----------
once you normalize the usage of it the


---------93:55----------
next time you're


---------93:56----------
extremely sad the next time you're


---------93:57----------
extremely broken and vulnerable the next


---------93:59----------
time you want an escape


---------94:00----------
it's no longer going to have a drink now


---------94:03----------
the normal


---------94:04----------
base is that that's what you're opened


---------94:06----------
up to because it's so normalized too and


---------94:08----------
that's what i think that not even once


---------94:09----------
is


---------94:10----------
it's some crazy [ __ ] does that make any


---------94:12----------
sense


---------94:13----------
i could i could totally bat [ __ ] i guess


---------94:14----------
this is your avenue no no i mean i i


---------94:16----------
think


---------94:17----------
it does it makes sense sort of because i


---------94:20----------
think it's


---------94:20----------
it's like the first half of a thought to


---------94:22----------
me you know i'm really curious about


---------94:24----------
what else you have to say and to add


---------94:27----------
context and depth and and flavor to what


---------94:30----------
you just shared


---------94:31----------
you know it's sort of like sharing like


---------94:33----------
you're sharing with me e equals m c


---------94:35----------
squared and you're saying does it make


---------94:36----------
sense and it's like i can tell that


---------94:38----------
that's


---------94:38----------
a monumental equation but i don't quite


---------94:40----------
understand it


---------94:42----------
pretty much uh i don't think people


---------94:44----------
explain what don't


---------94:45----------
not even once means i don't think people


---------94:47----------
really explain that accurately they just


---------94:49----------
try to


---------94:49----------
scare the hell out of you um and


---------94:54----------
yeah next time we can talk about it yeah


---------94:56----------
i mean next time i think is good let's


---------94:57----------
just open yeah


---------94:59----------
open a can of worms with with small


---------95:01----------
things so yeah but real quick i want to


---------95:03----------
make sure i reiterate this don't do


---------95:05----------
drugs don't do any of those drugs don't


---------95:06----------
do any drugs okay


---------95:07----------
i'd even go as far hey people are going


---------95:09----------
to hate me for this i even go as far as


---------95:11----------
saying marijuana's gateway drug


---------95:12----------
i didn't go as far as that i'm telling


---------95:14----------
you shit's [ __ ] crazy but you know i


---------95:16----------
think it has its good uses don't get me


---------95:17----------
wrong


---------95:17----------
medicinally i think you know if you're


---------95:18----------
going through like some treatment like


---------95:20----------
cancer stuff like that i think it's it's


---------95:21----------
a good avenue right


---------95:22----------
you know but i think i even you know i


---------95:24----------
would i don't know that's i


---------95:26----------
have my opinions people are getting


---------95:27----------
upset about yeah yeah i don't know


---------95:29----------
yeah i mean i i'd echo as well though i


---------95:31----------
think drugs are


---------95:32----------
bad kids yeah um


---------95:36----------
but okay so train do you feel like


---------95:38----------
meditating today


---------95:40----------
of course let's do it sorry i'm


---------95:42----------
literally like i slept two days


---------95:45----------
straight my body needed it because like


---------95:46----------
i was like putting so much work into


---------95:48----------
streaming


---------95:49----------
and i ended up waking up like yesterday


---------95:51----------
at like 7 00 p.m


---------95:53----------
so right now so like i streamed and i


---------95:55----------
tried going to bed but i realized i


---------95:57----------
slept for two days i


---------95:58----------
i couldn't so i slept like two hours so


---------96:00----------
i'm kind of like wired off of the tee


---------96:02----------
and no sleep i feel like no sleep is


---------96:05----------
more


---------96:07----------
energizing temporarily than caffeine


---------96:11----------
it's crazy does that make any sense yeah


---------96:13----------
i mean that's


---------96:14----------
actually especially scary if you have


---------96:16----------
any history


---------96:17----------
of bipolar bipolar yeah


---------96:21----------
and yeah i know so you got to be careful


---------96:24----------
i i don't really know we don't need to


---------96:26----------
get into that but one thing that i say


---------96:27----------
to all of my patients who have bipolar


---------96:29----------
disorder is that


---------96:30----------
sleep is medicine and is the most


---------96:33----------
important medicine


---------96:35----------
so you know i'd say if you feel a little


---------96:37----------
bit energized sometimes people can kind


---------96:38----------
of get a second win


---------96:39----------
things like that but you want to be


---------96:40----------
really really careful it's the second


---------96:42----------
one it's not a manic thing


---------96:44----------
yeah it's definitely a second wind


---------96:45----------
because yeah


---------96:47----------
yeah i mean if you slept for two days


---------96:48----------
and then you woke up and you know it


---------96:50----------
sounds like you've been up for about


---------96:52----------
16 hours with a nap in the middle of the


---------96:55----------
night i took a two i took a two-hour


---------96:56----------
little nap then i'll probably do another


---------96:58----------
nap before today's stream i found this


---------96:59----------
really i found this really good show


---------97:00----------
called repair shop have you heard of it


---------97:03----------
very cozy anyways continue let's do this


---------97:04----------
meditation


---------97:06----------
okay so let me just think about what


---------97:08----------
kind of meditation have i taught you ohm


---------97:10----------
chanting


---------97:12----------
no you haven't actually i'm actually


---------97:14----------
interested


---------97:16----------
so speaking of you know things that will


---------97:18----------
be


---------97:20----------
deep and resonant so i i think train i


---------97:22----------
like to teach you chanting


---------97:24----------
cause i'm kind of curious what what


---------97:26----------
would happen if you did it for a little


---------97:27----------
while


---------97:28----------
so om chanting we're going to start with


---------97:30----------
om chanting


---------97:31----------
and om is composed of three syllables


---------97:37----------
okay so what we're gonna do is it's


---------97:39----------
gonna be so


---------97:40----------
i'll demonstrate one round so i'm gonna


---------97:41----------
start with making an ah


---------97:43----------
sound and then we're gonna go into oh


---------97:45----------
should i crisscross applesauce uh


---------97:48----------
if you can yeah so the main most


---------97:50----------
important thing is that your back is


---------97:51----------
straight


---------97:52----------
so more important than crisscross


---------97:53----------
applesauce is i take your elbows off of


---------97:56----------
your armrests


---------97:58----------
there we go and so sit up straight and


---------98:00----------
then if


---------98:01----------
if your knees um are lower than your


---------98:04----------
hips that's


---------98:04----------
ideal if if you're doing crisscross


---------98:06----------
applesauce oftentimes your knees will be


---------98:08----------
above your hips


---------98:09----------
and then you'll slouch forward so yeah i


---------98:11----------
put them down i realized that was way


---------98:13----------
too bold of a move i'm not too flexible


---------98:14----------
i need to do some yoga


---------98:17----------
so what we're gonna do actually let me


---------98:19----------
think for a second


---------98:22----------
yeah okay we'll do i'm chanting okay


---------98:28----------
so big deep breath


---------98:42----------
oh


---------98:47----------
um oh you're demonstrating i'm so stupid


---------98:50----------
i'm so sorry


---------98:53----------
it's all good man i didn't realize that


---------98:55----------
you're demonstrating for me i thought it


---------98:56----------
was just the follow you that's fine


---------98:58----------
it's it's okay oh it's fine it's okay


---------99:01----------
sorry i just realized i was it really


---------99:02----------
it's not a problem


---------99:03----------
so a couple of things to note one is


---------99:05----------
it's over the course of one breath


---------99:06----------
good job train over the course of one


---------99:09----------
breath


---------99:10----------
second thing is that what i want you to


---------99:11----------
focus on is


---------99:13----------
vibration not sound


---------99:16----------
third thing is keep your mouth nice and


---------99:20----------
open


---------99:21----------
okay so okay ah


---------99:29----------
okay okay now sit up straight sit up


---------99:33----------
straight sorry


---------99:33----------
yeah oh sorry here we go and then


---------99:37----------
so we're gonna do one together okay so


---------99:40----------
deep breath


---------99:49----------
[Music]


---------99:52----------
in


---------99:54----------
[Music]


---------100:03----------
yeah the push talks messing with me yeah


---------100:05----------
it's okay


---------100:06----------
so sit up straight don't slouch between


---------100:09----------
rounds


---------100:10----------
right so stay anchored and now we're


---------100:12----------
going to do three rounds okay so


---------100:14----------
it's going to be deep breath uh um


---------100:18----------
brief period of silence afterward before


---------100:20----------
we take the next deep breath


---------100:23----------
we'll do three rounds and then we'll sit


---------100:25----------
in silence for a little bit


---------100:26----------
and just feel the


---------100:30----------
um sort of the aftermath of the


---------100:32----------
vibration after we're done with our


---------100:34----------
three rounds


---------100:35----------
okay okay and then we'll sit silently


---------100:38----------
with our eyes closed for maybe about 60


---------100:39----------
seconds


---------100:40----------
and then i'll prompt you when we kind of


---------100:42----------
come back okay is it possible to push


---------100:44----------
the talk off and try it once because


---------100:45----------
when it freezes i feel like you've gone


---------100:49----------
i'm gonna just i i we're gonna do push


---------100:51----------
to i'm gonna keep push to talk on but


---------100:53----------
i'm gonna just


---------100:54----------
leave it i'm gonna leave my hand on the


---------100:56----------
finger


---------100:57----------
okay okay so let's begin so deep breath


---------101:02----------
in


---------101:16----------
oh


---------101:18----------
[Music]


---------101:25----------
breathe in


---------101:30----------
oh


---------101:42----------
[Music]


---------101:52----------
again


---------101:58----------
oh


---------102:12----------
[Music]


---------102:17----------
beautiful we're going to do two more a


---------102:20----------
lot of power train give me everything


---------102:21----------
you got


---------102:22----------
deep breath in


---------102:27----------
[Laughter]


---------102:31----------
[Music]


---------102:42----------
[Music]


---------102:44----------
beautiful one more time


---------103:51----------
you


---------104:18----------
wow


---------104:20----------
that is so calming


---------104:24----------
i was so wired a second ago and like i'm


---------104:26----------
just like i'm like balanced now


---------104:28----------
i have a meeting in like 30 minutes


---------104:29----------
that's crazy


---------104:33----------
good what does that do like like


---------104:37----------
am i just exerting a certain energy


---------104:39----------
that's just kind of


---------104:40----------
that i'm like like is that is that


---------104:44----------
excess energy that i'm like exhausting


---------104:46----------
into the planet is that like what's


---------104:48----------
making me feel calm


---------104:50----------
part of it so ohm chanting does


---------104:53----------
thousands see that was a good breath


---------104:55----------
right there at the end just letting it


---------104:57----------
out right


---------104:58----------
yeah so it does several things so one is


---------105:01----------
it does should be


---------105:02----------
should he is cleansing so i think that's


---------105:04----------
where you were


---------105:05----------
so you were a lot of excess energy


---------105:08----------
excess


---------105:08----------
thoughts focusing your mind on one thing


---------105:11----------
letting those things go


---------105:13----------
kind of grounding other thing that it


---------105:16----------
does


---------105:17----------
is so it does should be which is


---------105:18----------
cleansing it does like the generation of


---------105:21----------
shakti


---------105:22----------
which is energy so it's kind of like


---------105:24----------
stoking the fire within you


---------105:27----------
um and if you think about fire like fire


---------105:29----------
burns away impurities


---------105:30----------
and also like you know gets hot


---------105:34----------
and then um the last thing


---------105:38----------
is that the post chanting phase so om


---------105:41----------
chanting actually has


---------105:42----------
four parts and the fourth part is


---------105:45----------
actually the post


---------105:46----------
chanting silence when you stop breathing


---------105:50----------
so i don't know if you notice this but


---------105:51----------
after the long breath


---------105:53----------
you'll kind of have a deep breath in and


---------105:56----------
then you'll be like


---------105:57----------
not breathe for like 15 20 maybe even 30


---------106:00----------
seconds


---------106:02----------
and it's that period of stillness where


---------106:04----------
the real money is


---------106:06----------
um but yeah it certainly is cleansing


---------106:08----------
putting off excess energy it also


---------106:10----------
creates vibration


---------106:12----------
and i don't i don't know if this makes


---------106:13----------
sense but vibration


---------106:15----------
um gets things flowing no it does make


---------106:18----------
sense


---------106:21----------
so it's sort of you know chanting is a


---------106:23----------
really good practice there's a reason


---------106:25----------
why home chanting is


---------106:27----------
central it's like a spiritual massage


---------106:30----------
yeah it's a great way to put it yeah


---------106:32----------
it's like a chakra massage


---------106:34----------
yeah cool well good luck well thank you


---------106:37----------
again


---------106:38----------
yeah thank you thank you so much for


---------106:40----------
coming on and being so authentic train


---------106:43----------

---------106:46----------

um but the short answer is that uh


---------107:17----------
you know because of your support train


---------107:19----------
we've been able to help


---------107:21----------
i'm just trying to remember exactly how


---------107:22----------
much you donated but probably and that's


---------107:24----------
ongoing right so i can like keep


---------107:26----------
donating like i can just keep doing it


---------107:27----------
all


---------107:28----------
yeah is it like an ongoing thing i'm not


---------107:30----------
fishing for a donation but


---------107:32----------
oh i know i know you're not i just yeah


---------107:34----------
no you're good the quite the opposite


---------107:36----------
what i'm trying to do is


---------107:37----------
is is express appreciation and actually


---------107:40----------
like it's


---------107:40----------
really helping a lot of people um and


---------107:44----------
uh are you know i have to be hesitant


---------107:46----------
about


---------107:47----------
saying things like this because it's not


---------107:48----------
really a medical treatment but


---------107:50----------
we're seeing substantial reductions in


---------107:52----------
depression and anxiety like


---------107:54----------
people who come in with moderate to


---------107:56----------
severe depression


---------107:57----------
after about 12 to 16 weeks we'll be like


---------108:00----------
more in the mild to moderate range


---------108:02----------
and this you guys have to take this with


---------108:05----------
a grain of salt but the effect size is


---------108:07----------
actually


---------108:08----------
quite similar maybe a little bit weaker


---------108:11----------
than uh 10 to 20 percent weaker than


---------108:14----------
prozac


---------108:14----------
in terms of reducing depressive symptoms


---------108:17----------
so


---------108:18----------
i i'm really grateful for your support


---------108:20----------
because it really is like


---------108:21----------
helping people so we're going to send


---------108:22----------
