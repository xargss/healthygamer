---------00:00----------
it's crazy like what on earth why do


---------00:03----------
people expend so much energy in hating


---------00:07----------
you so the first thing to understand is


---------00:10----------
that that has nothing to do with you


---------00:12----------
like Lily I know I was talking about how


---------00:15----------
you were amazing and inspirational and


---------00:17----------
you can transform lives and all that


---------00:19----------
good stuff I don't think you have it


---------00:21----------
within you to inspire someone to mail


---------00:24----------
something that comes from them it


---------00:26----------
doesn't come from you


---------00:30----------
yeah are you feeling okay I'm getting


---------00:33----------
over a cold


---------00:35----------
that's unfortunate yeah


---------00:38----------
what do you what do you do to take care


---------00:40----------
of yourself when you get a cold um I try


---------00:43----------
to take my quote equal a lot of cough


---------00:45----------
drops try to drink a lot of water um try


---------00:50----------
to sleep


---------00:52----------
does that when you say try to sleep is


---------00:55----------
it do you not get enough sleep um yeah


---------00:59----------
wait lately


---------01:00----------
trouble sleeping I'm sorry to hear that


---------01:03----------
is that because you're sick um no just


---------01:07----------
in general I don't know just recently to


---------01:11----------
look at me hmm I'm not supposed to


---------01:14----------
dispense medical advice over the


---------01:15----------
internet so this is not medical advice


---------01:17----------
yeah so recent studies have shown that


---------01:22----------
honey lemon tea is actually equally


---------01:25----------
effective to over-the-counter cough


---------01:28----------
remedies


---------01:29----------
I mean cold remedies when it comes to


---------01:31----------
actually treating symptoms okay so it's


---------01:34----------
it's kind of bizarre but apparently like


---------01:35----------
honey lemon tea works just as well and I


---------01:38----------
don't have a reference at my fingertips


---------01:39----------
for that right now but I think it's


---------01:42----------
actually they were looking at kids so


---------01:45----------
this is a pediatric journal so if you


---------01:47----------
I'm honey lemon tea I you know works


---------01:49----------
well I I drink it a lot when I'm sick


---------01:51----------
and it has vitamin C and other


---------01:54----------
anti-inflammatory properties that can be


---------01:55----------
good for you okay I've been drinking tea


---------01:59----------
too good just doing everything I can to


---------02:01----------
get very good so and what am i what am i


---------02:06----------
calling you


---------02:06----------
i I really Lily okay so hi I'm Alec or


---------02:12----------
nice to meet you so can you help me


---------02:14----------
understand a little bit about what we're


---------02:15----------
talking about today


---------02:17----------
sure um I don't understand myself


---------02:20----------
I thought we were talking about feelings


---------02:22----------
or something okay


---------02:24----------
you don't understand yourself that's


---------02:25----------
that's a great topic you do not


---------02:27----------
understand your feelings is also a great


---------02:28----------
topic ooh


---------02:29----------
sometimes people have a particular thing


---------02:32----------
that they like to talk about or focus on


---------02:34----------
so I was just curious if that's the case


---------02:36----------
with you I'm not sure okay


---------02:40----------
that's that's so can you tell me a


---------02:43----------
little bit


---------02:44----------
about hmm do you I'm just curious about


---------02:51----------
if I should just ask you about sleep and


---------02:53----------
we can kind of get through things get to


---------02:54----------
thinking that well so how long have you


---------02:57----------
had trouble sleeping like two months


---------03:01----------
what's been going on over the last


---------03:03----------
couple of months um I broke up with my


---------03:09----------
boyfriend hold on one sec oh okay sorry


---------03:14----------
[ __ ] hello hi okay she's kind of loud


---------03:21----------
okay thank you all right fine


---------03:26----------
so my mods try to sometimes get my


---------03:30----------
attention when I'm talking to people but


---------03:32----------
I'm so absorbed in the person that I'm


---------03:33----------
talking to that that I've given them


---------03:37----------
permission to call my cell phone and


---------03:40----------
they were saying that you're too loud is


---------03:42----------
she better now


---------03:45----------
hello testing okay okay okay okay all


---------03:56----------
right so you were saying two months ago


---------03:58----------
you broke up with your boyfriend yeah


---------04:01----------
yeah then you haven't been able to sleep


---------04:04----------
since then I'm not well cuz I guess


---------04:09----------
we're just kidding he he cheated on me


---------04:11----------
so [ __ ]


---------04:12----------
yeah it was super super hard I'm sorry


---------04:17----------
ever since then uh yes Lee thing's


---------04:19----------
really hard what happens when you try to


---------04:22----------
sleep


---------04:23----------
um so usually sorry Hilda


---------04:40----------
so um let's pause for a second what are


---------04:43----------
you feeling


---------04:55----------
hey what are you apologizing for I can't


---------05:02----------
control in that where do you get the


---------05:09----------
presumption that you have to control


---------05:11----------
being sad where does that come from okay


---------05:21----------
um okay yeah just nothing is a bad habit


---------05:26----------
I'm trying to break that okay so I want


---------05:30----------
to point something out so if you're


---------05:31----------
apologizing for nothing is a bad habit


---------05:33----------
and you're trying to break that are you


---------05:35----------
judging yourself for apologizing too


---------05:37----------
much yeah yeah right so so that's


---------05:41----------
something that we're gonna keep an eye


---------05:43----------
on because I think that something about


---------05:46----------
we're just gonna put a pin in that we'll


---------05:48----------
come back to that I'm sure how does it


---------05:54----------
do you do you feel like you're not


---------05:55----------
allowed to be sad well I stream feeling


---------06:04----------
angry um so uh I don't like like I don't


---------06:12----------
want to seem like I'm throwing like a


---------06:14----------
pity party I guess cuz um like I don't


---------06:19----------
want to appear like I'm not strong but I


---------06:22----------
don't think you know yeah so the topic


---------06:26----------
figure yeah so do you think that okay so


---------06:30----------
this is great


---------06:30----------
I'm glad we're talking about this what


---------06:32----------
do you think so if you are sad on stream


---------06:38----------
what is that how do you understand the


---------06:41----------
impact of that is that like a good thing


---------06:43----------
or is it a bad thing are you


---------06:44----------
disappointing people I think sometimes I


---------06:47----------
rely too much on like sadness or


---------06:51----------
depression or stuff like that I joke


---------06:53----------
about it a lot because that's I think a


---------06:56----------
lot of my I do a lot of stuff defecating


---------06:58----------
camera and stuff like that I'm trying to


---------07:01----------
not because I don't want to be seen it's


---------07:03----------
like I don't want that to just be me


---------07:05----------
right does that make sense


---------07:08----------
yeah so let's understand something very


---------07:10----------
subtle that you said I don't want to be


---------07:13----------
seen as and I don't want that to be me


---------07:17----------
yeah those are two very different things


---------07:24----------
okay does that make sense or no yeah


---------07:29----------
yeah so I I I agree so I think this is


---------07:33----------
what I've already noticed with streamers


---------07:34----------
is that the person it gets confusing


---------07:38----------
like who you are because you don't want


---------07:41----------
to be seen a certain way and you don't


---------07:43----------
want to be a certain way but the way


---------07:44----------
that you're perceived in the person that


---------07:46----------
you are are like fundamentally different


---------07:48----------
things but I think a lot of times people


---------07:51----------
get into trouble because they start can


---------07:53----------
like those two things become blended


---------07:55----------
okay so that makes sense so what are you


---------08:01----------
can it comes to being sad why do you


---------08:04----------
apologize for feeling sad let's not


---------08:06----------
judge it let's not say it's bad because


---------08:08----------
I don't necessarily think it's bad let's


---------08:09----------
try to understand why you're doing that


---------08:11----------
and where that's coming from I guess I


---------08:13----------
feel bad that I fall back on like


---------08:16----------
depression humor and joking about it


---------08:19----------
like too much like every time I turn on


---------08:22----------
my stream and I talk about my feelings


---------08:24----------
or whatever it always comes back to like


---------08:26----------
depression or sadness or something like


---------08:28----------
that and I don't like that I guess what


---------08:32----------
don't you like about that I feel like I


---------08:34----------
should be more positive what I don't


---------08:38----------
like people watch me to feel sadder


---------08:42----------
okay so let's great so let's explore


---------08:45----------
that for a second if you talk about


---------08:47----------
sadness how do you think other people


---------08:49----------
feel who are watching um sometimes they


---------08:54----------
say like it's cool that I talk about


---------08:57----------
sadness because they can relate but


---------09:01----------
other times I get the feeling that all


---------09:04----------
Lily's talking about depression again


---------09:06----------
you know you get that feeling hmm


---------09:11----------
right so let's let's title down into


---------09:13----------
what you said again because I think this


---------09:14----------
is important sometimes people say that


---------09:19----------
it resonates with them and it helps them


---------09:21----------
rule


---------09:22----------
and other times you get the feeling that


---------09:25----------
Oh Lilly's talking about sadness again


---------09:27----------
yeah do people say Oh Lilly's talking


---------09:32----------
about sadness again um very rarely yeah


---------09:38----------
so how do you understand that I guess I


---------09:40----------
take it too seriously it's not I don't


---------09:43----------
think I think that's like a very


---------09:46----------
minority yeah most people find it


---------09:49----------
relatable but yeah I yeah I guess I


---------09:54----------
worry that I talk about it too much


---------09:56----------
anyway I don't know if that's good or


---------09:58----------
not yeah so let's take a step back from


---------10:02----------
what's good and what's not good because


---------10:04----------
in my experience judgment doesn't help


---------10:07----------
us so much I think let's start with


---------10:08----------
understanding and then we can sort of


---------10:10----------
decide from a clearer mindset like what


---------10:12----------
we want to do and what we don't want to


---------10:14----------
do like what we want to cultivate and


---------10:15----------
what we don't but I'm already noticing


---------10:18----------
that if you're concerned about something


---------10:21----------
how do you think that shapes your


---------10:24----------
perception of whether that thing is


---------10:26----------
happening or not if I'm worried about


---------10:32----------
something I feel like it becomes a


---------10:35----------
reality even if it's not real absolutely


---------10:38----------
absolutely that's exactly what it does


---------10:40----------
right so if I'm concerned that my hair


---------10:43----------
is look silly


---------10:44----------
and then I'm walking down the street and


---------10:46----------
someone looks in my direction I just


---------10:49----------
automatically assumed that they're


---------10:50----------
looking at my hair because it's silly


---------10:52----------
even though it's a street and they're


---------10:56----------
just gonna be people looking in my


---------10:57----------
direction right so you're absolutely


---------10:58----------
correct that sometimes if we are


---------11:01----------
concerned about something we feel like


---------11:04----------
we get information to reinforce it yeah


---------11:12----------
let it get to my head too much yeah


---------11:15----------
so that - but that's normal right so I


---------11:18----------
I'm noticing subtle amounts of judgement


---------11:21----------
when you say I let it get to my head too


---------11:22----------
much that implies that you should do you


---------11:25----------
should there's another side to that


---------11:26----------
statement which is that you should let


---------11:28----------
it get to your head less do you see that


---------11:31----------
yeah and so these statements the self


---------11:35----------
self-critical statements are like


---------11:36----------
they're very reflexive for you yeah they


---------11:39----------
are they've always done this and I wish


---------11:42----------
I didn't but it's it just slips out I


---------11:45----------
yeah yeah yeah so so that that's a


---------11:49----------
pattern of the mind and it's unfortunate


---------11:51----------
that you do that in the sense that it


---------11:53----------
causes you suffering but I do think that


---------11:55----------
we can try to understand like where you


---------11:57----------
learned how to do that and hopefully


---------11:59----------
teach you a different way to like think


---------12:01----------
about yourself um but let me just kind


---------12:04----------
of go back to this the streaming thing


---------12:06----------
because I think so I'm gonna just think


---------12:08----------
for a second is that okay oh I'm just


---------12:10----------
I'm just trying to make a mental list of


---------12:12----------
like stuff to think about and not lose


---------12:15----------
track of


---------12:21----------
okay so I'm gonna go back to the


---------12:27----------
statement that you made that you're you


---------12:29----------
sometimes you feel like you talk about


---------12:31----------
it too much


---------12:31----------
hmm so in the context of what we're


---------12:35----------
talking about now this is kind of a


---------12:36----------
weird abstract read my mind question but


---------12:38----------
what do you think about that what do you


---------12:40----------
think you actually talk about depression


---------12:42----------
too much I genuinely think sometimes I


---------12:46----------
do fall back on it too much because well


---------12:49----------
when you stream like every day for


---------12:51----------
exemplary there's only so many things


---------12:53----------
you can talk about yourself like stream


---------12:56----------
knows a lot of things about me already


---------12:57----------
right and I guess I kind of habit I just


---------13:01----------
talk about depression because I was such


---------13:02----------
a big part of my life and and if you if


---------13:08----------
you talk about it too much like what is


---------13:10----------
that how do you know what's too much I


---------13:16----------
guess it's just my own personal way of


---------13:19----------
quantifying it like oh I talked about


---------13:22----------
this last team and the last dream I


---------13:24----------
shouldn't talk about this dream I like


---------13:26----------
made a joke about it again


---------13:27----------
oops yeah so why do you think people


---------13:30----------
come back to your stream like do you


---------13:31----------
think people are looking for like it in


---------13:34----------
general when you're watching something


---------13:36----------
on Twitch how do you decide who to watch


---------13:38----------
I don't know why people watch it do you


---------13:43----------
have do you have a yeah but do you watch


---------13:45----------
people on Twitch I'm making assumption


---------13:47----------
that's me


---------13:48----------
I watch my friends a lot okay so and


---------13:50----------
let's talk about restaurants actually so


---------13:53----------
when you're going to a restaurant why do


---------13:56----------
people like do you go to like you have


---------13:58----------
some favorite restaurants in the area


---------13:59----------
yes okay so like what are some of your


---------14:02----------
favorite restaurants there's this really


---------14:04----------
nice Thai place and has really nice


---------14:06----------
tasty and it's walking distance oh wait


---------14:09----------
you mean that you go to the Thai


---------14:11----------
restaurant again and again for Thai iced


---------14:14----------
tea yeah you don't go for something


---------14:16----------
different every time um sometimes I do


---------14:19----------
sometimes I feel like I'll explore the


---------14:22----------
menu a little but mostly because it's


---------14:23----------
walking distance and it's good and it's


---------14:25----------
cheap and yeah yeah sort of consistently


---------14:29----------
you go there for consistency right yes


---------14:32----------
so in general like when I watch things


---------14:35----------
like I know I tend to watch things like


---------14:37----------
so when I I I mean I I like dota okay


---------14:40----------
and I know you sometimes play League of


---------14:43----------
Legends right


---------14:43----------
do you like League of Legends less so


---------14:46----------
but I know that that's gonna catch if


---------14:52----------
you play League of Legends I don't play


---------14:55----------
League of Legends oh you don't think of


---------14:57----------
Legends yeah I'm sorry No um but you


---------15:01----------
know I I probably should because most of


---------15:02----------
the people that I know play League of


---------15:04----------
Legends so I may install so but when I


---------15:08----------
when I went for example like when I


---------15:10----------
watch like when I go to like the dota


---------15:12----------
streamers like I'm not going to the dota


---------15:14----------
streamers to watch football hmm or


---------15:17----------
cooking I'm going to them to watch dota


---------15:20----------
and why do you think I mean you sort of


---------15:23----------
talk about so you're you talk about


---------15:26----------
depression a fair amount on stream


---------15:28----------
mm-hmm you think you talk about it too


---------15:30----------
much but what I'm guessing is that based


---------15:35----------
on what you've told me like it sounds


---------15:36----------
like that resonates with people and


---------15:38----------
maybe part of what they like about


---------15:39----------
stream is that you can play League of


---------15:41----------
Legends and you probably have some fun


---------15:43----------
other content that you do and sometimes


---------15:45----------
you talk about depression hmm and that


---------15:49----------
the people who probably feel a little


---------15:51----------
bit sad and lonely and are somehow


---------15:52----------
inspired by some of the work that you do


---------15:54----------
like to see that you're like a complex


---------15:57----------
human being who has a full range of


---------16:00----------
feelings because it sort of allows them


---------16:01----------
to have a full range of feelings what do


---------16:04----------
you think about that painting a


---------16:09----------
wholesome like when you see it like that


---------16:12----------
so when when you say paints it in a very


---------16:15----------
wholesome life I'm wondering I'm


---------16:18----------
wondering is that is there a part of you


---------16:21----------
that's sort of like yeah that sounds


---------16:22----------
great but that's not really how it is


---------16:24----------
it's like I want to believe that good


---------16:28----------
right but you don't 60 percent believe


---------16:35----------
it yeah yeah so that's what I'm saying


---------16:37----------
is that is that there's a there's a


---------16:39----------
there's an undercurrent of a but which


---------16:41----------
is perfectly fine so let's just notice


---------16:43----------
that right which is that I'm painting it


---------16:45----------
in a rosy light but that there's like


---------16:47----------
something else that's like there's a


---------16:49----------
that's kind of like [ __ ] yeah okay


---------16:54----------
so good yeah what a sight you said


---------16:58----------
always cyanea yeah that's good I I live


---------17:02----------
on yeah so our goal here is to


---------17:09----------
understand the different voices in your


---------17:11----------
head right so there's a part of you that


---------17:13----------
sort of thinks that in theory what I'm


---------17:15----------
saying is fine but that just doesn't


---------17:16----------
feel real to you yeah okay I have days


---------17:22----------
where I'm like yeah people are watching


---------17:24----------
me because they like watching me I'm


---------17:25----------
cool like I'm awesome


---------17:26----------
days are I'm like dude you don't deserve


---------17:29----------
these here's how daddies there are days


---------17:35----------
and and what kind of person doesn't


---------17:39----------
deserve those viewers can we talk about


---------17:41----------
the person that you are on those days


---------17:42----------
sure um okay well I think I got into


---------17:47----------
shaming by like complete look really


---------17:50----------
like if you start streaming now I know


---------17:53----------
like the market is like super saturated


---------17:54----------
right super hard to get into I was lucky


---------17:57----------
to start years ago when it wasn't that


---------18:00----------
saturated I'm lucky enough to have like


---------18:03----------
I live in a streamer house that helped


---------18:06----------
me a lot um when I got cheated on my


---------18:09----------
boyfriend like two months ago that that


---------18:11----------
told drama I gave me like a huge influx


---------18:13----------
of viewers so that was like very sudden


---------18:17----------
right like I got thousands of views for


---------18:20----------
some reason um


---------18:22----------
so sometimes on those days it's like am


---------18:26----------
i doing enough to deserve this success


---------18:32----------
and I I think that makes a


---------18:36----------
sensed have you I'm gonna think for a


---------18:43----------
second is that okay yeah thanks for


---------18:48----------
there somebody just gifted a bunch of


---------18:50----------
subs


---------18:50----------
Bongiorno thanks for the gifted subs oh


---------18:53----------
and thanks for the rate the other day I


---------18:55----------
didn't realize but thank you


---------18:56----------
oh yeah you're welcome


---------19:02----------
okay so you sometimes have self-critical


---------19:04----------
thoughts about about yourself right like


---------19:06----------
you sort of say that I don't deserve so


---------19:09----------
let me ask actually ask you this is it


---------19:11----------
that you don't know what you've done to


---------19:13----------
deserve this


---------19:14----------
and you're pleasantly surprised or is


---------19:16----------
there a part of you that feels like


---------19:17----------
actually you don't deserve this I'm like


---------19:20----------
pleasantly surprised like okay I feel so


---------19:25----------
lucky sometimes that's just really hard


---------19:29----------
to take in like wow what did I do to


---------19:33----------
deserve you


---------19:36----------
yeah so okay very good so why is it hard


---------19:41----------
to take in


---------19:45----------
[Music]


---------19:49----------
emotional what are you calling when I


---------19:55----------
ask that question what are you feeling


---------19:59----------
you


---------20:02----------
you


---------20:04----------
you


---------20:06----------
[Music]


---------20:12----------
you


---------20:14----------
you


---------20:17----------
you


---------20:19----------
I feel anything bad yeah just take a


---------20:29----------
minute let's just feel what you're


---------20:41----------
feeling close your eyes for a second


---------21:01----------
tell me what you're feeling physically


---------21:03----------
in your body thank you


---------21:06----------
what does that mean


---------21:18----------
I feel frustrated I try to talk and


---------21:24----------
can't tell you if I cry I'm trying not


---------21:26----------
to cry it's very frustrating


---------21:28----------
yeah so let's let's try not to talk


---------21:33----------
because let's just talk about this for a


---------21:35----------
second okay you're coming on here with


---------21:37----------
the expectation that you're supposed to


---------21:39----------
talk yeah yeah that's not what you're


---------21:44----------
here for


---------21:44----------
because you talking is for who I don't


---------21:53----------
think so because because if I mean I


---------21:56----------
think I think you talking is probably


---------21:58----------
more for the viewers right oh yes yeah


---------22:03----------
so let's not worry about them because I


---------22:05----------
try my best I mean I I mean no offense


---------22:07----------
to anyone who's watching but like I


---------22:08----------
think that the this is really just about


---------22:10----------
me in here this is a conversation


---------22:12----------
between two people that thousands of


---------22:15----------
people people happen to be watching but


---------22:17----------
let's not try to do something for them


---------22:20----------
let's just try to do something for you


---------22:22----------
and if that means periods of awkward


---------22:24----------
silence then periods of awkward silence


---------22:28----------
okay because I think what is actually


---------22:31----------
going to benefit them the most is if you


---------22:33----------
instead of trying to push down your


---------22:35----------
feelings and talk to give a performance


---------22:37----------
you just give yourself the time and


---------22:39----------
space to feel what you feel you


---------22:41----------
understand what you feel and then I


---------22:43----------
think that's what helps people so you


---------22:48----------
know and we'll get back to the sadness


---------22:49----------
because I can see it's going away a


---------22:51----------
little bit yeah yeah it is going away


---------22:54----------
yeah sorry sometimes yeah good good okay


---------23:01----------
okay how what's that about


---------23:09----------
crying yeah like what do you mean I cry


---------23:12----------
a lot


---------23:12----------
I just feel like therapeutic sometimes


---------23:15----------
just crying letting it out like I just


---------23:18----------
want to let it out yeah do you feel


---------23:20----------
better afterward I do I think yeah did


---------23:23----------
you cry on stream oh I try not to okay


---------23:28----------
okay so I think the most recent batch of


---------23:35----------
crying happened when I asked you why


---------23:37----------
it's hard for you to that feeling lucky


---------23:41----------
is like like it's hard for you right so


---------23:46----------
feeling like people actually care about


---------23:47----------
you and that you're lucky and that you


---------23:50----------
know you're successful like it seems to


---------23:53----------
be that it feels kind of it's hard for


---------23:56----------
you why do you think that is how do you


---------24:01----------
understand that


---------24:02----------
um can I think it ties into the whole


---------24:05----------
like uh because I got the influx of you


---------24:14----------
is right from the drama thing whatever


---------24:16----------
that and I just wonder what I'm doing


---------24:23----------
really like yeah I turn on my stream I


---------24:27----------
do my thing you know like I talked my


---------24:29----------
feelings or you draw or like play music


---------24:31----------
or whatever right but sometimes I do it


---------24:34----------
and I'm just like it's just like


---------24:36----------
entertaining like is this fun to watch


---------24:38----------
it I why and I don't I don't think I'm


---------24:45----------
like special yeah okay so I think what


---------24:53----------
I'm hearing from you is you don't


---------24:54----------
deserve what the world is giving you and


---------25:00----------
then some things people say like oh you


---------25:02----------
only have yours cuz you're a girl or


---------25:05----------
like you have a cute voice are you


---------25:08----------
faking your voice or whatever that help


---------25:09----------
do you say about me um or like it's just


---------25:15----------
because if your roommate story more


---------25:16----------
popular than you or and how does that


---------25:22----------
sit with you ah doesn't make me feel


---------25:26----------
good because I'd want people to watch me


---------25:29----------
because uh just because of Mary yeah but


---------25:34----------
yeah I'd awful things like there's like


---------25:36----------
a bunch of people out there who are you


---------25:41----------
know talent


---------25:41----------
what more talented more pretty prettier


---------25:44----------
for entertaining so sometimes a and I'm


---------25:48----------
so worried about like relevancy to in


---------25:51----------
which she me is super important you


---------25:53----------
could be a nobody in a month right and


---------25:57----------
this is my job okay so I'm hearing a lot


---------26:03----------
of different things I'm gonna try to try


---------26:06----------
to go through these like one at a time


---------26:07----------
so the first is that there's a part of


---------26:11----------
me that feels like you don't feel like


---------26:13----------
you deserve success that's why you use


---------26:15----------
the word luck right like like if we


---------26:18----------
think about why people invoke luck it's


---------26:21----------
because like luck is on one end of the


---------26:24----------
spectrum in like something that you


---------26:27----------
deserve or worked for or earned like


---------26:30----------
earned and locker on two opposite ends


---------26:32----------
of the spectrum right and there may be


---------26:35----------
luck involved I don't know but but the


---------26:37----------
first thing that I understand when you


---------26:39----------
say that you kind of feel lucky so


---------26:42----------
there's a there's a difference between


---------26:43----------
feeling privileged and grateful that


---------26:46----------
people are interested in you and


---------26:48----------
supporting you and things like that and


---------26:49----------
I get the sense that you definitely feel


---------26:51----------
that way and there's also like another


---------26:55----------
feeling that can happen which is like


---------26:56----------
what's sort of wrong with these people


---------26:58----------
and why are they interested in you


---------27:00----------
because there are people who are as you


---------27:02----------
put it prettier and what my talented


---------27:06----------
yeah they're better than you right so


---------27:09----------
that implies to me that somewhere along


---------27:11----------
the way you feel like you don't you got


---------27:14----------
the idea or there's a part of you that


---------27:16----------
believes that you don't deserve to be


---------27:18----------
successful


---------27:23----------
and so my question for you and then


---------27:27----------
there's the haters which we'll get to in


---------27:30----------
a second but my question to you is like


---------27:34----------
how long have you felt like you don't


---------27:36----------
deserve to be happy or successful um I


---------27:43----------
feel like it's like since I started


---------27:47----------
almost because I got into this job by


---------27:50----------
luck you know when you first start off I


---------27:53----------
think a lot of things are kind of I love


---------27:55----------
hina you kind of stumble upon it oh all


---------27:57----------
of a sudden it's my my job I can do this


---------28:00----------
and I used to be super inconsistent even


---------28:04----------
more so than now I used to literally


---------28:07----------
just not get out of bed and maybe stream


---------28:09----------
like once a month if my fans are lucky


---------28:11----------
um I use a super low effort super super


---------28:15----------
and like for some reason they still


---------28:18----------
dance who would still watch me right so


---------28:20----------
luckily I got into this streamer house


---------28:24----------
that helped motivate me to work more and


---------28:28----------
become more consistent stream yeah I


---------28:34----------
guess and also that again I keep


---------28:37----------
bringing this up it was a huge thing


---------28:39----------
where I got my good pooped on my furious


---------28:42----------
right all of a sudden almost overnight


---------28:43----------
and then I mean you think like oh what


---------28:46----------
can I do - like deserve these views how


---------28:48----------
can I make them stay how can I me how


---------28:50----------
can I feel like I'm like be happiest


---------28:54----------
this type of streamer I guess okay can


---------28:57----------
you help me understand what what


---------28:59----------
happened I mean you you because you you


---------29:00----------
do keep coming back to this so you got


---------29:02----------
an influx of viewers because you got


---------29:04----------
cheated on by your boyfriend yeah in a


---------29:07----------
very public manner


---------29:08----------
it was super public even my parents


---------29:10----------
heard about it it was like there are


---------29:12----------
articles it was just [ __ ] ton sorry I'm


---------29:16----------
a little crazy yeah I think so like just


---------29:19----------
okay tons of videos about it


---------29:22----------
um threads people messaging me like it


---------29:26----------
was overwhelming me so I'm new to twitch


---------29:30----------
so can you help me understand why your


---------29:33----------
boyfriend on cheating on you


---------29:36----------
we were a very public couple so you guys


---------29:38----------
are like you're like a celebrity right I


---------29:43----------
mean I don't like the word either but


---------29:44----------
from the Boomer world where I come from


---------29:47----------
yeah yeah okay fine like pseudos live


---------29:50----------
it's not right so like I've never heard


---------29:52----------
I mean so I have you know I know people


---------29:53----------
in my life who sometimes deal with


---------29:56----------
infidelity and I've never heard about


---------29:58----------
anyone writing articles about it okay


---------30:00----------
yeah okay so yeah there were some


---------30:01----------
articles there yeah it's because they


---------30:04----------
were a very public couple I involved him


---------30:06----------
in a lot of my content actually like


---------30:08----------
everything good


---------30:09----------
I dream we did music together we


---------30:11----------
collapse together like I'm a super


---------30:14----------
serious about because when I when it


---------30:16----------
comes to relationships I'm very like if


---------30:18----------
I choose someone I'm hard committing I


---------30:20----------
see you myself with you for the rest of


---------30:22----------
my life so yeah we were together for two


---------30:26----------
years or so and I found out when I was


---------30:30----------
in Japan and another country um with him


---------30:35----------
with all of my friends I mean I didn't


---------30:39----------
want it to blow up but


---------30:49----------
sorry they'll feel bad about that


---------30:53----------
like if there's one thing I could change


---------30:55----------
it would be I would try to make it more


---------30:58----------
private break nicely instead like


---------31:03----------
everyone knows about it and I felt bad


---------31:08----------
because he also got like a lot of hate


---------31:17----------
anyone scissors


---------31:21----------
even if


---------31:35----------
ever since then that's where the trouble


---------31:41----------
sleeping comes from I think from then I


---------31:44----------
haven't been able to really sleep I've


---------31:46----------
been trained to distract myself um let


---------31:50----------
distract yourself from what and how do


---------31:59----------
you feel sad what does that mean sad I'm


---------32:08----------
sad because I wish it didn't happen I


---------32:11----------
wish the entire Internet I wish things


---------32:17----------
could just go back to normal


---------32:20----------
how do I know it's never gonna be like


---------32:22----------
that again um I've been trying to ya


---------32:26----------
distract myself just try them on you


---------32:28----------
know I feel sometimes feel like just


---------32:32----------
kind of weak I guess I feel like I


---------32:35----------
should be over it I know okay Lily


---------32:40----------
I don't think sad is the best word to


---------32:44----------
describe what you're going through I


---------32:45----------
think what you need to do to move on so


---------32:48----------
first of all you know I know that you


---------32:50----------
blame yourself for not being good enough


---------32:51----------
and that's a thing so I'd like to talk


---------32:54----------
you know at some point maybe we can talk


---------32:56----------
about that maybe not today actually


---------32:57----------
because I'm getting the sense that maybe


---------33:04----------
understand


---------33:05----------
is actually even a little bit premature


---------33:07----------
just just with where you are and I think


---------33:09----------
the first thing that I'd like to share


---------33:11----------
with you is that I think what you need


---------33:13----------
to do is grieve I don't know if you've


---------33:15----------
ever thought about it like this


---------33:16----------
I tried craving um I know it's bad but I


---------33:22----------
drank a lot just crying letting it all


---------33:26----------
out I and I think like there are days


---------33:28----------
where I'm like okay I'm good um I can do


---------33:31----------
this but then I get these where it's


---------33:33----------
late


---------33:35----------
[ __ ] it this hurts


---------33:38----------
yeah so I don't think drinking is


---------33:40----------
griefing oh it's not like open district


---------33:45----------
I know it's bad yeah I know yeah so so


---------33:48----------
let's just think about grief so like


---------33:50----------
what are the things that you do when you


---------33:51----------
grieve for someone if you have you like


---------33:53----------
is someone that you care about passed


---------33:55----------
away you have to be a person so so if we


---------34:01----------
think about like when someone can we is


---------34:03----------
it okay if we talk about that for a


---------34:04----------
second okay because because what I'm


---------34:06----------
hearing from you is that you'd like to


---------34:08----------
move on from this right and in in a


---------34:11----------
sense I think you're doing a good job


---------34:13----------
because there are days that you're able


---------34:15----------
to like kind of fully function it sounds


---------34:16----------
like you're able to find joy and


---------34:18----------
happiness and pleasure in life and then


---------34:20----------
there are days where this thing kind of


---------34:22----------
like rears its ugly head yeah and


---------34:24----------
unfortunately that's how grief works so


---------34:26----------
grief doesn't it's not like you beat a


---------34:29----------
level it's like it's like you know once


---------34:31----------
you beat a level like you randomly go


---------34:33----------
back to that level when grief decides


---------34:35----------
that we're gonna go back to that place


---------34:37----------
but I wonder if there's also some ways


---------34:39----------
in which we can help you move on I mean


---------34:42----------
I even want to say like faster sounds


---------34:44----------
like the wrong sentiment but for us to


---------34:47----------
understand what you're going through and


---------34:49----------
if there's some way that like if we can


---------34:50----------
understand what you're going through


---------34:51----------
maybe we can make the process easier or


---------34:54----------
less bumpy for you and my first thought


---------34:57----------
is like when you think about someone


---------34:58----------
that you lost do you think that you've


---------35:00----------
grieved for that person or animal


---------35:03----------
appropriately like you feel like you've


---------35:05----------
you're you're in a good place with that


---------35:07----------
oh all I do is just cry is that good


---------35:12----------
yeah sure but I mean do you still feel


---------35:14----------
do you still cry about the person that


---------35:16----------
you lost I do I do


---------35:20----------
does it feel like does it feel bad when


---------35:22----------
you try again cathartic yeah so that's


---------35:31----------
that's important right so like II there


---------35:33----------
are two kinds of crying there's the


---------35:36----------
crying that sort of feels good at the


---------35:38----------
end of it and then there's the crying


---------35:40----------
that sort of can also sort of feel good


---------35:43----------
temporarily but isn't quite cathartic


---------35:45----------
and doesn't lead to less


---------35:48----------
there are two kinds of crime there's the


---------35:49----------
cathartic crying which over time leads


---------35:51----------
to less crying and processing of


---------35:53----------
feelings and then there's the crying


---------35:55----------
that sort of just is experiencing


---------35:57----------
awfulness that doesn't necessarily


---------36:00----------
decrease the amount of awfulness down


---------36:02----------
the road you with me yes and what what


---------36:08----------
are we calling your boyfriend what


---------36:09----------
should I you can it should I just say


---------36:10----------
your boyfriend or do you want to use a


---------36:12----------
name okay so when it comes to Albert you


---------36:20----------
know when you cry about that which way


---------36:21----------
does it feel that I lost it I want it


---------36:32----------
back but I can't like just a loss I


---------36:37----------
guess yeah so and this is gonna be kind


---------36:40----------
of weird but do you feel confident that


---------36:46----------
you can find being a good committed


---------36:49----------
healthy relationship again I don't know


---------36:55----------
if I want to commit and that idea is


---------36:59----------
like it's really scary no I guess cuz


---------37:03----------
yeah I put everything into this and he


---------37:06----------
did that so what's to say that's not


---------37:10----------
gonna happen again or it just feels very


---------37:13----------
scary like the idea of committing


---------37:15----------
yourself to one person no yeah


---------37:18----------
absolutely I think it I mean I imagine


---------37:22----------
if I were in your shoes I would be


---------37:23----------
terrified of it not only that because


---------37:26----------
like I hope where I'm just just really


---------37:29----------
being open with my viewers as well I


---------37:31----------
tell them a lot of things so if I were


---------37:34----------
in a relationship right I'd want to


---------37:36----------
share it I want them to be part of my


---------37:38----------
life but last time that Boston Public


---------37:42----------
it was so yeah probably became self I


---------37:45----------
can be so messy and like I totally like


---------37:47----------
deal with that every can you know scary


---------37:51----------
yeah so I'm noticing attention within


---------37:54----------
you and sort of like even if you had


---------37:56----------
another relationship do you sort of stay


---------37:58----------
true to kind of the unspoken promise


---------38:01----------
your fans which is that they get to see


---------38:03----------
the inside of your life and thereby open


---------38:07----------
yourself up to you know the pain of a


---------38:10----------
very public and you know commented on


---------38:14----------
break up where apparently he also got a


---------38:16----------
lot of hate or do you change the the way


---------38:19----------
that you interact with your fans which


---------38:21----------
sounds like it's probably compromising


---------38:22----------
or sacrificing something I don't know


---------38:26----------
yeah because it feels bad hiding such a


---------38:31----------
big part of my life


---------38:32----------
I like having if I had a significant


---------38:36----------
other I'd want them to be you know part


---------38:38----------
of what I do like I went to club with


---------38:40----------
them I want to spend time with them I


---------38:42----------
want to work with that I wanna I want to


---------38:45----------
do things with them solely its we like


---------38:49----------
your relationship with its Albert with


---------38:53----------
Albert was pretty perfect it seemed like


---------38:58----------
I thought I thought I'd marry I thought


---------39:01----------
it was like you know he was great I


---------39:04----------
really really loved him like he yeah we


---------39:09----------
lost somewhere in trees we we played


---------39:12----------
music together we we got along really


---------39:16----------
well I had no idea that he was an apple


---------39:20----------
see um how do you know he wasn't happy


---------39:28----------
cuz he we talked after words he he told


---------39:31----------
me the reasons why cuz I'm gonna to know


---------39:34----------
and yeah and I felt bad cuz he bottled a


---------39:41----------
lot of things into um I wish he total


---------39:45----------
but he didn't and that just manifested


---------39:48----------
in this really ugly manner and just felt


---------39:54----------
bad there's really bad what does that


---------39:59----------
mean bad that he couldn't tell me they


---------40:03----------
couldn't communicate with me like I


---------40:06----------
would have done anything to fix whatever


---------40:08----------
it really


---------40:12----------
but he told someone else like I know


---------40:19----------
you're not supposed to compare yourself


---------40:20----------
but hey I'm like what did they have that


---------40:24----------
I didn't mmm and I thought I was a good


---------40:30----------
girlfriend but I just yeah Lily there's


---------40:38----------
something very subtle in in honestly


---------40:40----------
dangerous that you're doing I think


---------40:42----------
you're accepting a lot of responsibility


---------40:44----------
for things that are not your


---------40:46----------
responsibility so like I'll just put it


---------40:49----------
to you bluntly like there's something


---------40:50----------
that really makes me angry at the


---------40:53----------
thought that someone feels like this


---------40:54----------
that if a relationship didn't work out


---------40:59----------
and I hear you say that I mean I have no


---------41:01----------
idea what kind of girlfriend you are or


---------41:03----------
what kind of boyfriend Albert is or so I


---------41:05----------
can't judge this but I hear this thread


---------41:08----------
consistently in what you're saying that


---------41:10----------
you kind of say I like you weren't good


---------41:13----------
enough of a girlfriend whereas like I


---------41:15----------
don't know if that's true right like I'm


---------41:18----------
hearing this theme of like I wasn't like


---------41:21----------
if if he had told me I could have done


---------41:23----------
something about it


---------41:24----------
and you feel like that sort of a


---------41:26----------
deficiency on your part that he wasn't


---------41:30----------
with me meals too clingy I don't know


---------41:33----------
maybe yeah right so so so just notice


---------41:36----------
what you're doing there is like you're


---------41:37----------
accepting responsibility for like


---------41:39----------
everything that happens around you right


---------41:42----------
that if you had been better he would


---------41:44----------
have been able to be more open if you


---------41:47----------
had been a more better girlfriend and


---------41:48----------
less clingy like he would have stayed if


---------41:50----------
you had been more entertaining or more


---------41:53----------
talented or more attractive you would


---------41:56----------
have gotten these viewers without drama


---------42:00----------
yeah do you see that thread so like I


---------42:03----------
think we've got it and I'm struggling


---------42:04----------
I'm really struggling here because


---------42:06----------
there's a part of me that says that


---------42:07----------
you're hurting right now and there is


---------42:09----------
something that is really at the top of


---------42:11----------
mind for you which is this relationship


---------42:13----------
and how you're kind of thinking about


---------42:14----------
yourself but there's another part of me


---------42:16----------
that says that all of this stuff comes


---------42:19----------
from like one common place because it's


---------42:22----------
like the same thing which is that like


---------42:24----------
Lily sometimes isn't good enough and I'd


---------42:30----------
like to understand I mean I I'm torn so


---------42:33----------
maybe you can help me out like what do


---------42:35----------
you think we should talk about should we


---------42:36----------
aren't try to understand where that


---------42:38----------
comes from


---------42:39----------
or should we talk about Albert and sleep


---------42:41----------
and how you feel in the process of


---------42:43----------
grieving I don't know okay well that


---------42:54----------
makes two of us maybe the first one done


---------43:05----------
okay so I can you I'm gonna quaint us


---------43:18----------
okay what are your choice like II just


---------43:23----------
um I mean so so that the choices are


---------43:27----------
like do you want to talk about the last


---------43:29----------
two months and sleeping and grieving and


---------43:32----------
relationships how do you want to talk


---------43:34----------
about where you got the idea that you're


---------43:37----------
not good enough maybe not good enough


---------43:40----------
fun okay that seems more yeah what


---------43:46----------
happened to your indecisiveness make a


---------43:50----------
decision I feel bad stalling okay I


---------43:56----------
could live with that so he asked you how


---------43:59----------
long have you so you know when you feel


---------44:02----------
like you don't deserve success let's say


---------44:06----------
and I know that you don't always feel


---------44:07----------
that way right so this is something that


---------44:09----------
no it's almost exactly so so like let's


---------44:12----------
just


---------44:13----------
first appreciate that it's almost like


---------44:15----------
something there's like a dormant Lily


---------44:17----------
there's like the Lily who doesn't think


---------44:19----------
that she's like good enough can we like


---------44:23----------
conceptualize her that way okay and then


---------44:26----------
sometimes like is there some way that


---------44:28----------
you can think of that we can kind of put


---------44:30----------
a name to her Lily - Lily - okay and so


---------44:35----------
is there some way that


---------44:37----------
sohow and Lily - like sometimes wakes up


---------44:40----------
in your mind right there are days that


---------44:42----------
you something is happening like some


---------44:44----------
days you get out of bed and it's like


---------44:45----------
Lily - who's running the show and you're


---------44:47----------
self-critical in your self judgmental


---------44:49----------
and there are other days where it's like


---------44:50----------
regular Lily is running the show and


---------44:52----------
here you can feel grateful what yeah I


---------44:56----------
like that yeah feeling like that I wish


---------44:59----------
I could feel like that every day we're


---------45:02----------
gonna get there okay I mean maybe not at


---------45:05----------
the end of the hour but we're gonna get


---------45:06----------
there so and then there's a certain I


---------45:15----------
there's certain things that like even if


---------45:17----------
Lily one is regular lily is waking up


---------45:20----------
and is living your day something can


---------45:22----------
happen at 3:00 p.m. where the lily -


---------45:24----------
sort of takes over rightly some kind of


---------45:26----------
interaction yeah or someone says


---------45:28----------
something to you yes right so Lily - is


---------45:33----------
like a part of you that wakes up or goes


---------45:36----------
to sleep yeah yeah and and so the


---------45:41----------
solution that we have is oddly enough


---------45:43----------
not executing Lily - and dumping her in


---------45:47----------
the river


---------45:47----------
what steel Apple I know you would but


---------45:51----------
that's not how it works and that's what


---------45:52----------
happens every time you know you drink to


---------45:54----------
excess or whatever like that's what


---------45:55----------
distraction and coping is its pushing


---------45:57----------
Lily to away what we actually need to do


---------46:00----------
is like like let's act let's just think


---------46:01----------
for a second how does Lily to feel to


---------46:08----------
feel yeah dread okay


---------46:14----------
dread about what every


---------46:18----------
yeah so dread I think of his fear so


---------46:25----------
Lily too is afraid of certain things


---------46:28----------
happening what is she afraid of


---------46:34----------
everything like aa career yep and what


---------46:41----------
is the fear about her career streaming


---------46:49----------
is seems volatile yep scary yep I want


---------46:54----------
to do other things


---------46:56----------
I have other dreams then I don't know if


---------46:59----------
I can fulfill them trying my best


---------47:02----------
this doesn't sound like Lily - to me


---------47:04----------
sorry this is only 1 or 2 it 3 you know


---------47:07----------
we're talking about Lily - so-so


---------47:09----------
and that's okay so let me just try to


---------47:11----------
avenge or something right so I would be


---------47:13----------
I would imagine that if Lily 2 is waking


---------47:15----------
up which is sort of like the sad


---------47:16----------
depressed Lily - isn't good enough it's


---------47:18----------
that she won't be able to cut it


---------47:19----------
streaming that one day she's gonna wake


---------47:21----------
up and what she's afraid of is that


---------47:23----------
people are gonna realize that she


---------47:24----------
doesn't deserve the success that she's


---------47:26----------
getting and that they're gonna kind of


---------47:28----------
see you for who you are and they're


---------47:29----------
gonna move on to someone else


---------47:32----------
yeah is that a fear of Lily - is that


---------47:35----------
accurate that's the fear okay okay so


---------47:39----------
what do you think that person needs if


---------47:41----------
your friend was like let's say like you


---------47:46----------
say you live in a house full of


---------47:47----------
streamers right so if one of your


---------47:49----------
friends says like voices those fears to


---------47:52----------
you uh-huh


---------47:53----------
what do you do for her or him I tell her


---------47:57----------
reassure them that they are good enough


---------47:58----------
but they they're they are good they're


---------48:01----------
great they got here for a reason


---------48:04----------
yeah like you to support them okay and


---------48:08----------
how does that work for your friend um


---------48:11----------
they would appreciate it yeah and so


---------48:14----------
what do you say - Lily - is that what


---------48:20----------
you say - - Lily - I try sometimes good


---------48:26----------
that's impressive


---------48:29----------
that that's really good how does that


---------48:32----------
work um sometimes it works you know like


---------48:38----------
I tell myself like yeah you're good


---------48:39----------
enough you can do this like people like


---------48:41----------
you you're you're great you know you're


---------48:44----------
good and that's great and the diesel


---------48:48----------
works it's great and on the days that it


---------48:50----------
doesn't it doesn't work it's just like


---------48:53----------
ah [ __ ] everything I'm going back to bed


---------48:57----------
yeah so so like I just wanted to point


---------48:59----------
that out to you for a second because


---------49:00----------
what you're doing - Lily - when you say


---------49:03----------
actually you are good enough and and you


---------49:06----------
have worked hard and from what I hear


---------49:08----------
from you I think you are I mean who


---------49:10----------
deserves success is sort of a separate


---------49:12----------
issue but I hear a lot about what you've


---------49:16----------
worked hard to do and I mean I think


---------49:19----------
you're deserving of your success for the


---------49:22----------
simple reason that you were telling me


---------49:23----------
that you used to be consistent and then


---------49:24----------
it sounds like you made a lot of large


---------49:26----------
scale changes to your life and you put


---------49:28----------
forth a lot of effort into like actually


---------49:32----------
you know doing a good job and that in


---------49:37----------
spite of actually a lot of internal


---------49:40----------
demons that you struggle with you still


---------49:41----------
managed stream somewhat consistently and


---------49:44----------
things like that which i think is really


---------49:46----------
amazing and also that doesn't so there's


---------49:51----------
some days where that wins but but there


---------49:54----------
are other days where it loses and I just


---------49:58----------
want to point out that that's not


---------49:59----------
actually like shooting Lily - and


---------50:01----------
dumping her in the river right $0.07


---------50:03----------
like there's a part of you that wants to


---------50:06----------
dump her in the river and I suspect that


---------50:07----------
that's part of the reason why this is so


---------50:10----------
hard for you to shake because I actually


---------50:11----------
think that you know there's there's like


---------50:13----------
a fight between like Lily one and Lily -


---------50:16----------
but what you described is not a fight


---------50:18----------
between Lily one and Lily - its Lily one


---------50:21----------
doing what for Lily -


---------50:27----------
getting rid of her know what no right so


---------50:32----------
when you tell yourself what do you tell


---------50:35----------
yourself when sometimes you're feeling


---------50:37----------
down oh um yeah you're good enough is


---------50:40----------
that getting rid of her


---------50:42----------
no it's not um try to


---------50:46----------
supporter yeah absolutely that's the


---------50:49----------
very opposite of getting rid of her yeah


---------50:51----------
sorry yeah yeah so so I think it's it's


---------50:54----------
it's a normal it's something that's very


---------50:56----------
confusing and Lily I think you're


---------50:57----------
actually one step ahead of the game


---------50:59----------
because most people when they when they


---------51:01----------
have a part of themselves that feels


---------51:02----------
like they're


---------51:06----------
you know very self-critical self


---------51:07----------
judgmental where you feel like you're


---------51:09----------
not good enough you want to get rid of


---------51:11----------
them right like when I asked you like


---------51:13----------
you want to dump them in the river you


---------51:14----------
like hell yes I want to be happy for the


---------51:17----------
rest of my life what what what I think


---------51:20----------
you actually need to do which I'm really


---------51:21----------
happy to hear that you're able to do


---------51:23----------
this for yourself is actually like like


---------51:25----------
actually I'm not gonna say that I'm


---------51:27----------
gonna ask you a few more questions right


---------51:29----------
so let's let's think about where the


---------51:31----------
lily 2 comes from so how long have you


---------51:34----------
like when like do you remember feeling


---------51:36----------
that way like in the past yeah but how


---------51:40----------
long has Lily 2 and let's just be clear


---------51:43----------
so who is Lily - the past one the [ __ ]


---------51:48----------
John yep and and more specifically what


---------51:51----------
do we mean by depressed and sad scared


---------51:57----------
ok scared I think


---------51:59----------
do you so I would say that what I'm


---------52:02----------
hearing from you is that like Lily -


---------52:03----------
isn't good enough


---------52:04----------
oh yeah that that that - so it sounds


---------52:08----------
like there's more to it no I mean if


---------52:14----------
there is that's fine so let's just try


---------52:15----------
to understand so like when you're


---------52:17----------
feeling sad and depressed when it comes


---------52:19----------
to thinking about Albert is there a part


---------52:22----------
of you that feels like you know there's


---------52:25----------
a part of you that's sad because you had


---------52:26----------
something beautiful and now it's gone


---------52:27----------
and there's also this part of you that


---------52:30----------
creates these thoughts like oh if I had


---------52:32----------
done this then he would have stayed if I


---------52:35----------
had been better at listening if I had


---------52:37----------
been less clingy then that could have


---------52:41----------
worked out sometimes right it's


---------52:46----------
you


---------52:48----------
okay so when you say sometimes are there


---------52:54----------
how can I put this I think there's a


---------52:56----------
healthy sadness and there's an unhealthy


---------52:58----------
sadness within you and that I think the


---------53:01----------
healthy sadness is just you know kind of


---------53:04----------
the normal sadness and sometimes that


---------53:06----------
can be cathartic as you put it but then


---------53:08----------
there's an unhealthy sadness where you


---------53:10----------
think certain thoughts about yourself


---------53:12----------
and how the relationship made you feel


---------53:14----------
that's not quite the same as like


---------53:16----------
fearing relationships in the future and


---------53:18----------
stuff because that's kind of a different


---------53:19----------
thing but I do think there's like


---------53:21----------
actually more than just two lilies


---------53:22----------
there's like lilies three and there's


---------53:24----------
Lily four but right there are a lot of


---------53:27----------
lilies and and what I'd like to focus on


---------53:30----------
is the one who leads you to thoughts


---------53:33----------
like you were too clingy or if you had


---------53:36----------
been better he would have talked to you


---------53:37----------
or things like that


---------53:39----------
does that make sense we're gonna focus


---------53:42----------
on her so how long have you felt like


---------53:46----------
you're kind of undeserving of success or


---------53:49----------
that you're kind of not good enough okay


---------54:00----------
I don't know if I can pinpoint it but it


---------54:04----------
okay feels like it's been like just


---------54:07----------
there all my life right okay do you have


---------54:10----------
any memories of like things that


---------54:12----------
happened when you were young that sort


---------54:14----------
of made you feel that way yeah so I


---------54:19----------
remember when I was younger my parents


---------54:24----------
very very traditional Korean they


---------54:26----------
wouldn't mean a coda like good college


---------54:28----------
and stuff right um I got depression in


---------54:31----------
high school and that made me feel like


---------54:33----------
not good enough and I ended up almost


---------54:36----------
failing and went to Community College


---------54:38----------
and then I had no idea what to do with


---------54:42----------
my life I have nothing to offer really


---------54:46----------
so I stumble upon YouTube and streaming


---------54:50----------
just by chance I started like you know


---------54:52----------
cute little videos but voice acting and


---------54:55----------
like art and stuff like that people ate


---------54:57----------
it so I started doing that


---------55:01----------
um but even throughout all that I wasn't


---------55:04----------
consistent I thought everything I made


---------55:06----------
was like whatever but it gave me


---------55:09----------
something to do so I continued what do


---------55:13----------
you mean by got depressed in high school


---------55:14----------
oh I used to fight a lot with my parents


---------55:18----------
I was very suicidal very very depressed


---------55:21----------
um it took my mom some time to realize


---------55:24----------
how serious it was she didn't believe me


---------55:27----------
at first uh and then I just felt like


---------55:32----------
really a failure I guess in high school


---------55:35----------
because I would not go I would not get


---------55:38----------
out of bed I would refuse to go to


---------55:39----------
school I almost missed the minimal


---------55:42----------
attendance think so I almost failed and


---------55:44----------
I remember I was talking with the


---------55:46----------
counselor and she was like yeah your GPA


---------55:49----------
is like 2 point 1 point z naught I don't


---------55:52----------
give a [ __ ] I just did not care I guess


---------55:56----------
I don't know but I mean it sounds like


---------55:59----------
the the fighting with your parents is a


---------56:01----------
consequence of your depression not the


---------56:05----------
origin of your depression mmm I guess I


---------56:08----------
don't know how the depression started I


---------56:11----------
really okay


---------56:12----------
don't can you tell me about what middle


---------56:13----------
school was like for you middle school


---------56:15----------
was okay actually like up until well


---------56:18----------
elementary school


---------56:19----------
okay so element is what it was a period


---------56:21----------
of time where I had no friends but two


---------56:24----------
three years that was hard and then I got


---------56:26----------
into middle school I moved and I've made


---------56:28----------
friends and I'm like okay I'm happy I


---------56:31----------
thought it was generally like a happy


---------56:33----------
time I was doing well in school I had


---------56:35----------
friends I was socializing it was fun I


---------56:38----------
went to high school the first year was


---------56:40----------
fine I remember I was like I had a lot


---------56:43----------
of hopes I want to go to college I want


---------56:45----------
to succeed I want to do a lot of things


---------56:47----------
and then like 10th grade started


---------56:51----------
fighting with my parents a lot I


---------56:54----------
retreated into the internet forums and


---------56:57----------
stuff what would you fight with your


---------57:00----------
parents about just remember it's like


---------57:04----------
they would be really angry at me for


---------57:08----------
[Music]


---------57:09----------
like just not going to school not


---------57:13----------
getting the dates or


---------57:15----------
just being really useless in general


---------57:16----------
like I literally did not do anything I


---------57:19----------
just stayed in bed all day and I was


---------57:21----------
playing a lot of video games at the time


---------57:23----------
they hated that they hated me going on


---------57:26----------
the computer so much that they hid


---------57:28----------
behind I used to hide the mouse in the


---------57:30----------
keyboard in the basement and when they


---------57:32----------
went to work I would bring it up I used


---------57:35----------
to put a lot of like MMORPGs a lot of


---------57:38----------
them I thought was like my escape


---------57:40----------
MMORPGs which ones yeah I used to play


---------57:46----------
back knock online a lot mmm I connect


---------57:49----------
online that was maplestory just every


---------57:51----------
like mo more appreciate around that time


---------57:52----------
like I just I played them all I tried


---------57:54----------
them all it was really fun and they got


---------57:56----------
into like I'd meet friends on the


---------57:57----------
internet so I'm like no I don't need


---------57:58----------
friends really yeah how did it feel when


---------58:02----------
your parents were angry with you I felt


---------58:05----------
really bad like I was disappointing them


---------58:07----------
and they would like we wanted these


---------58:10----------
fights were really really bad like there


---------58:13----------
were parts where she would she would


---------58:16----------
threaten to call like a psychiatric ward


---------58:18----------
and like take me in and stuff and like


---------58:21----------
she told me once I remember I can't


---------58:24----------
forget this like I was 15 years old she


---------58:26----------
was dropping me off at high school I


---------58:28----------
think I'm yeah high school of course and


---------58:31----------
and we had a fight in the car and she


---------58:34----------
she told me like she wished I was never


---------58:36----------
born


---------58:37----------
so that stuck with me for going my


---------58:41----------
relationship with my parents are great


---------58:43----------
by the way right now


---------58:44----------
it's like wonderful but back then it was


---------58:46----------
just so bad oh and then she won't feel


---------58:52----------
like um compare me to other treaties so


---------59:04----------
easy I know and I'm like and I'm just


---------59:06----------
like yeah whatever mom and I'll go back


---------59:08----------
to my MMORPG yeah yeah very even mm-hmm


---------59:16----------
they feel so many comments about my


---------59:18----------
weight too so I always felt like that


---------59:21----------
even though I wasn't that and then yeah


---------59:25----------
so how do you how would they how


---------59:29----------
that make you feel and we're not trying


---------59:30----------
to bash your parents here okay so I


---------59:34----------
think they just you know I have Asian


---------59:37----------
parents too I mean Indian parents but my


---------59:41----------
dad when we were young said so I have an


---------59:44----------
older brother and this is the story that


---------59:47----------
I would tell during med school


---------59:48----------
interviews so they would ask me why do


---------59:50----------
you want to be a doctor and then I well


---------59:53----------
my dad when we were growing up said one


---------59:55----------
of you is gonna be a doctor and one of


---------59:57----------
you is gonna be a lawyer


---------59:57----------
and my brother is older than I am so he


---------60:01----------
got to choose first and he got he went


---------60:03----------
to law school so here is that's funny


---------60:07----------
yeah so you know I I think I think Asian


---------60:13----------
and South Asian parents are very similar


---------60:15----------
in terms of you know you have a there's


---------60:19----------
a there's a very specific sense of what


---------60:21----------
successes in life and in a sense I come


---------60:26----------
to realize it's not their fault it's


---------60:27----------
just because that's the formula for them


---------60:29----------
right like that's how they got to this


---------60:30----------
country is by like working hard and and


---------60:33----------
not playing mmo's they did um come


---------60:36----------
around eventually obviously right yeah


---------60:38----------
and I think they realized how much they


---------60:41----------
[ __ ] up with me so like my brother and


---------60:43----------
I like to joke he's my younger brother


---------60:44----------
I'm like the beta product and he's like


---------60:46----------
the final product my brother had no


---------60:49----------
issues like he went to like an


---------60:51----------
engineering college he's he's great he's


---------60:53----------
fine he's super healthy and how are you


---------60:56----------
oh yeah Lee in the same way that you're


---------61:02----------
talking about your brother oh I I guess


---------61:06----------
I found success you know sorry um yeah


---------61:16----------
by chance miraculously my mom says it's


---------61:20----------
a miracle I somehow got here to where I


---------61:23----------
am and yeah still very like Wow to me so


---------61:31----------
yeah I didn't know what its gonna do


---------61:34----------
first of all sure


---------61:39----------
do you I'm still okay I'm gonna need a


---------61:46----------
second I'm just trying to understand so


---------62:01----------
I'm gonna say something and maybe this


---------62:03----------
is not gonna be fair but I'm just


---------62:04----------
curious whether twitch chat is as


---------62:06----------
confused as I am oh right like are you


---------62:10----------
guys confused or does this make sense to


---------62:12----------
you they say something wrong no no you


---------62:18----------
didn't say anything wrong it's just it


---------62:21----------
blows my mind that and it's hard because


---------62:27----------
I I think I think that I'm just gonna


---------62:33----------
think for a second


---------62:40----------
okay so I was about to say it blows my


---------62:45----------
mind that you're not able to see that


---------62:47----------
you have value I'm gonna steer clear


---------62:52----------
this word success but that that you have


---------62:54----------
immense value and that just because you


---------62:59----------
didn't find you didn't follow the road


---------63:02----------
that was scripted doesn't mean that you


---------63:05----------
didn't find your own way and that you


---------63:07----------
were you're deserving of respect because


---------63:13----------
even more so than like just going to an


---------63:16----------
engineering school like you struggled


---------63:19----------
and you found your own path you forged a


---------63:22----------
road like you you built a path that did


---------63:26----------
not exist before that despite all of


---------63:28----------
your difficulties and all of the


---------63:30----------
challenges that you faced including


---------63:32----------
depression including parents who are not


---------63:34----------
supportive back then in spite of all of


---------63:36----------
those things you managed to get to where


---------63:39----------
you are and it blows my mind that you


---------63:42----------
can't see it that way but of course you


---------63:45----------
can't see it that way


---------63:47----------
and the question is like well why not


---------63:49----------
and then it kind of comes back to I'm


---------63:53----------
gonna just keep going normally I would


---------63:55----------
stop because you're crying but I'm just


---------63:56----------
gonna plow forward is that okay Lily


---------63:59----------
okay um maybe I should ask you how you


---------64:04----------
feel but I'm just gonna keep going okay


---------64:06----------
so I think this is a cathartic cry


---------64:08----------
that's what I'm gonna guess yeah okay so


---------64:11----------
I'm gonna keep going


---------64:12----------
so so then the question like for a


---------64:14----------
second there I was about to say blows my


---------64:16----------
mind why you can't see that but then of


---------64:19----------
course like you've actually already


---------64:20----------
answered that and it comes back to


---------64:22----------
something that we talked about at the


---------64:23----------
beginning of the interview is when you


---------64:25----------
believe something about yourself like if


---------64:26----------
I believe that my hair is messed up and


---------64:29----------
someone is walking down the street like


---------64:32----------
I'm going to perceive that that person


---------64:34----------
is looking at my hair even though that


---------64:36----------
is like completely insane and this is


---------64:41----------
Lilly - Lilly - is the person who keeps


---------64:44----------
you from seeing that you were absolutely


---------64:48----------
amazing and deserving of love and


---------64:52----------
respect and that you've like forged a


---------64:56----------
path for yourself where despite being


---------64:58----------
and this is going to be bizarre


---------64:59----------
less talented and less attractive


---------65:04----------
thousands of people watch you every time


---------65:06----------
you stream


---------65:07----------
so rather than being undeserving if


---------65:10----------
we're really being if we're really being


---------65:12----------
scientific we have to conclude that you


---------65:14----------
have something else right like if you


---------65:17----------
think about your favorite restaurants


---------65:19----------
and the ones that have no no tablecloths


---------65:22----------
in crappy service and look like [ __ ]


---------65:25----------
and if people keep coming back over and


---------65:29----------
over and over why is that Lily


---------65:36----------
consistency of what the service sucks it


---------65:39----------
looks bad they like something about it


---------65:43----------
what do they like about the restaurant


---------65:45----------
could be anything


---------65:47----------
what are you okay so like maybe this is


---------65:49----------
a harder question than I'm thinking in a


---------65:50----------
spec so when I think about a restaurant


---------65:54----------
I think about like you know food service


---------65:58----------
ambiance wait times cleanliness and at


---------66:04----------
the end of the day I sometimes go to


---------66:06----------
restaurants that have bad service bad


---------66:09----------
ambiance and are dirty like a food truck


---------66:13----------
but they're like go for the cute waiter


---------66:15----------
you know even if everything else is they


---------66:18----------
could but why do they go back to that


---------66:21----------
restaurant the food thing absolutely is


---------66:26----------
at the end of the day what you put in


---------66:29----------
your mouth and what you're looking for


---------66:31----------
you get right like I said the end of the


---------66:34----------
day if people are coming back to a


---------66:36----------
restaurant it's for the [ __ ] food


---------66:37----------
okay and that you can make a good


---------66:41----------
argument I'm sure you can convince


---------66:43----------
yourself of this because your mom taught


---------66:45----------
you from a very young age just like my


---------66:47----------
parents did that you can compare


---------66:49----------
yourself to other people and then then


---------66:51----------
now I I kind of joke about it that you


---------66:54----------
know I'm every Indian parents dream and


---------66:57----------
every Indian kids worst nightmare


---------67:00----------
because I'm a harvard-trained physician


---------67:02----------
right so you can yeah and you can


---------67:05----------
convince yourself and compare yourself


---------67:07----------
but at the end of the day there's no


---------67:08----------
doubt in my mind that the people are


---------67:10----------
coming to watch you because of you and


---------67:12----------
it's not about Talent it's not about


---------67:14----------
appearance that you have the secret


---------67:16----------
sauce there's something just authentic


---------67:18----------
and amazing about the person that you


---------67:19----------
are that keeps people coming back


---------67:21----------
because like I work with a lot of people


---------67:24----------
who are sociopathic I work with a lot of


---------67:28----------
executives and you can't keep up and act


---------67:31----------
that long there's got to be something


---------67:32----------
legit you just can't do it like you can


---------67:35----------
fool the world for like a day a month


---------67:37----------
even a year but you've been doing this


---------67:40----------
for years and people keep coming back


---------67:42----------
and you're not able to see that because


---------67:45----------
you're not primed to see it and you're


---------67:48----------
not primed to see it because of Lily too


---------67:50----------
and when I hear about what your mom did


---------67:52----------
like it sort of makes sense right


---------67:54----------
because what did your mom what was sort


---------67:56----------
of like the TLDR of your the way you


---------68:00----------
know your parents treated you in high


---------68:02----------
school


---------68:02----------
what did you learn from them


---------68:05----------
disappointment absolutely right


---------68:10----------
disappointment why because what there we


---------68:14----------
go


---------68:18----------
right that and we see that that's where


---------68:22----------
the lily 2 is from and I don't I mean I


---------68:25----------
I feel like we're get bashing your


---------68:26----------
parents I really don't they just did the


---------68:28----------
best that they could and you know I had


---------68:34----------
I almost failed out too so with you from


---------68:37----------
playing too many video games not so much


---------68:39----------
mmo's more RTS and Diablo but you know


---------68:45----------
and III think I I just don't know I mean


---------68:47----------
it it it makes me sad to see that you


---------68:53----------
know you've just you've started to think


---------68:55----------
about yourself in a particular way in


---------68:58----------
terms of and it's actually like there's


---------69:00----------
a part of you that side but there's a


---------69:01----------
part of me that's kind of happy and this


---------69:03----------
is part of what's been confusing for me


---------69:04----------
is I think you've actually made a lot of


---------69:05----------
progress because I see Lily too but I


---------69:08----------
think it's amazing that you are able to


---------69:10----------
actually see that you do demonstrate


---------69:12----------
value and that like you aren't


---------69:13----------
disappointed like your fear is that like


---------69:16----------
when when I asked earlier like what is


---------69:18----------
Lily to feel you said dread and then I


---------69:20----------
asked dread of what and like you didn't


---------69:23----------
really give me an answer but I'd put


---------69:25----------
money that it's dread of disappointment


---------69:29----------
probably


---------69:35----------
so what was it like hearing me say that


---------69:43----------
clarity


---------69:45----------
but more clarity cathartic cry yeah well


---------69:50----------
let's go to your Chi that was inside so


---------69:54----------
let me and if you have questions and


---------69:56----------
stuff we can we can get to that but


---------70:03----------
so let me just start by saying this the


---------70:05----------
first thing is that


---------70:08----------
the other thing that I think is actually


---------70:10----------
really kind of cool and unfortunate is


---------70:13----------
that I think sometimes you know we


---------70:15----------
suffer and I think that I talk a lot


---------70:17----------
about Dharma which means duty or


---------70:19----------
responsibility and I think you are under


---------70:21----------
valuing your contribution to the world


---------70:26----------
because you kind of you've been


---------70:28----------
programmed to think about a contribution


---------70:30----------
in a particular way and you sort of say


---------70:32----------
like I talk too much about depression


---------70:33----------
maybe I should talk less about


---------70:35----------
depression but I think what people are


---------70:37----------
resonating with is that like a lot of


---------70:38----------
people who are watching on twitch feel


---------70:42----------
disappointed in themselves and feel like


---------70:47----------
the world is disappointed in them right


---------70:51----------
mm-hmm like there's a part of me that


---------70:53----------
says that every gamer is a little bit


---------70:55----------
broken like that sometimes right and and


---------70:59----------
I think that like that's something that


---------71:01----------
when you show that part of yourself and


---------71:04----------
what you've been through like they


---------71:06----------
resonate with that and I think that's


---------71:09----------
incredibly important for them because


---------71:10----------
like here's the thing you know when you


---------71:13----------
were 15 we haven't talked about this but


---------71:15----------
I imagine you felt incredibly incredibly


---------71:18----------
alone that you didn't understand what


---------71:21----------
was going on in your life and like the


---------71:23----------
people like no one understood you and


---------71:26----------
you didn't understand why like you tried


---------71:27----------
to be a different person you tried so


---------71:30----------
hard to be a different person and you


---------71:32----------
just could not figure out how to do it


---------71:34----------
and you were just busted old you and


---------71:39----------
like there's something really powerful


---------71:41----------
about people who are feeling that way


---------71:44----------
being able to watch you struggle and say


---------71:47----------
like oh wow like she's busted lily and


---------71:49----------
I'm busted me and she manages to do it


---------71:53----------
so I shouldn't give up and I think if


---------71:55----------
we're talking about like contributions


---------71:57----------
to the world like that's [ __ ] amazing


---------71:58----------
man so don't stop what you're doing and


---------72:02----------
they deserve like you deserve every


---------72:04----------
ounce of it not only do you deserve it


---------72:06----------
but they need you Lily it's not even


---------72:08----------
about you it's about like what you're


---------72:09----------
doing for that you make it sound very


---------72:15----------
cool


---------72:18----------
and there it is again right there's the


---------72:22----------
part of you that hesitates to believe I


---------72:27----------
use like 60% police Hey yeah so that's


---------72:33----------
progress that's that's what makes my


---------72:34----------
life hard because I think you've


---------72:35----------
actually done a lot of I know you've


---------72:38----------
done a lot of good work in terms of


---------72:40----------
understanding your 60% there and for


---------72:42----------
that last 40% this is kind of what I'll


---------72:44----------
leave you with is that you know that


---------72:49----------
person needs your compassion so that's


---------72:52----------
like 15 year old Lily who just got


---------72:54----------
yelled at and told that you know by her


---------72:56----------
mom that I wish you were never born and


---------72:58----------
she needs you she needs the strong


---------73:01----------
version of you she needs the person that


---------73:03----------
you've actually become the person who's


---------73:07----------
successful who can look back on her life


---------73:09----------
and say like because this is something


---------73:11----------
that I think you can do and I imagine


---------73:13----------
you do you know that like even if you're


---------73:16----------
lost and you feel hopeless like and you


---------73:17----------
went to Community College like you can


---------73:19----------
find you can find a life where you can


---------73:21----------
be you know you can have joy and


---------73:24----------
happiness and travel the world and like


---------73:26----------
there's a road for you like life isn't


---------73:27----------
over and so 15 year old Lily needs how


---------73:31----------
old are you now 20 needs 28 year old


---------73:34----------
like you need to be your own older


---------73:36----------
sister and there's there forty percent


---------73:39----------
of you still skeptical that's fine I


---------73:43----------
mean 600 sure okay thoughts questions no


---------73:58----------
like my brain is just blank I'm sorry


---------74:01----------
yeah that's okay that's what we're


---------74:03----------
shooting for so


---------74:10----------
you don't need to jumpstart it I would


---------74:12----------
just I would just sit sit with where you


---------74:14----------
are for a minute mm-hmm close your eyes


---------74:17----------
just feel no looking no peeking okay


---------74:36----------
okay good so do you do you have any


---------74:44----------
questions I mean like thinking of a


---------74:53----------
bunch of things right now on Trent


---------74:55----------
okay think of what to say I also wanted


---------75:01----------
to mention um like my parents are


---------75:04----------
definitely a big part of why I fear


---------75:09----------
disappointment I also can we talk about


---------75:16----------
hate for a second sure yeah I got a lot


---------75:21----------
of hate thirty years a lot there are so


---------75:26----------
many moments I wanted to quit because of


---------75:30----------
that because people who don't know me


---------75:33----------
make assumptions about me or talks me or


---------75:39----------
send me letters to my hope mhm


---------75:42----------
call me uh non-stop hate and I think


---------75:51----------
it's gotten better dealing with it


---------75:52----------
because you have to get better dealing


---------75:54----------
with it


---------75:55----------
when you do this kind of stuff right


---------75:56----------
when you have like yeah but there's


---------76:01----------
still some days where I read like one


---------76:05----------
thing and it's like a spiral


---------76:08----------
yeah yes it's hard and that's also I


---------76:13----------
think why I fear giving myself value


---------76:17----------
because sometimes I'm scared


---------76:20----------
if I see myself in a better light or


---------76:24----------
like a valuable light that just means


---------76:32----------
like it gives them more ammo I guess how


---------76:37----------
does it give them more ammo hmm I've


---------76:42----------
been told that if they can't [ __ ] on me


---------76:50----------
if I [ __ ] on me you know what I mean


---------76:54----------
like you can't insult me if they insult


---------76:57----------
myself yeah so that's very powerful and


---------77:04----------
potent you think yeah


---------77:25----------
deprecation yes I do that a lot


---------77:32----------
you


---------77:34----------
how long do you want to talk about this


---------77:35----------
Lily what do you want to really dive


---------77:37----------
into it or do you wanna do you have


---------77:39----------
somewhere to go you have to go somewhere


---------77:40----------
I mean um I need to go for my car in


---------77:45----------
about 25 minutes so I'm just trying to


---------77:47----------
understand so like if you want to have a


---------77:49----------
conversation which i think is very


---------77:50----------
productive I first of all just need to


---------77:53----------
take a little bit of a break because


---------77:56----------
this wears me out a little bit and


---------77:58----------
before you dive into it no no that's


---------78:00----------
it's fine it's just I'm I'm just trying


---------78:02----------
to think a little bit about you know if


---------78:03----------
you want a simple answer I can give you


---------78:05----------
that in five to ten minutes but if you


---------78:07----------
really want to dive into hate I think


---------78:08----------
that's fine I'm just gonna like drink


---------78:10----------
some water and and maybe use the


---------78:14----------
bathroom and then we can come back


---------78:15----------
refreshed and dive in how does like you


---------78:17----------
tell me what do you what you need to do


---------78:20----------
um yeah okay dive okay so I just need a


---------78:23----------
minute


---------78:23----------
yes so I'll be back in like five minutes


---------78:27----------
okay


---------78:28----------
okay okay so you guys talk to Lily okay


---------78:32----------
oh god okay


---------78:38----------
[Music]


---------78:53----------
all right thank you um okay so hatred


---------79:04----------
let's dive in or what so tell me so


---------79:08----------
you're saying that people send you hate


---------79:12----------
stuff yeah oh wait I need fix naming oh


---------79:19----------
yeah


---------79:26----------
and you were saying something this is


---------79:28----------
brilliant so you're saying that if you


---------79:33----------
you know if you don't build yourself up


---------79:35----------
they can't tear you down yes right so


---------79:52----------
I'm noticing an instinct to try to


---------79:55----------
protect you from some things but okay so


---------80:01----------
well well we'll get to that are you are


---------80:03----------
you up for a little bit more emotion or


---------80:05----------
you feel like you're spent know I love


---------80:08----------
emotions curling okay so we'll see what


---------80:11----------
happens but okay so all right so tell me


---------80:15----------
you know how does it so tell me about


---------80:18----------
why you know why bring this up with me


---------80:21----------
now like what's what's the motive I felt


---------80:25----------
like um the reason why I don't value


---------80:31----------
myself not only comes from you know my


---------80:35----------
upbringing my parents but also this too


---------80:38----------
and I felt like it wasn't you know


---------80:40----------
genuine if I didn't bring it up as well


---------80:43----------
like it felt like I should I guess I


---------80:46----------
should have so the first thing is that


---------80:50----------
this may not actually come from your


---------80:51----------
parents so I think your it coming from


---------80:53----------
your parents is an easy thing but the


---------80:57----------
number of streamers who I've talked not


---------80:59----------
just streamers but people who I talked


---------81:01----------
to who sort of say like you know I see


---------81:05----------
how what you said sort of relates but I


---------81:07----------
didn't mention this thing because I


---------81:09----------
didn't feel comfortable talking about it


---------81:11----------
on streem and oftentimes it comes from


---------81:13----------
somewhere else I just didn't want to


---------81:18----------
yeah yeah no no I'm just saying that a


---------81:20----------
lot of people will sort of I think it's


---------81:22----------
actually great that you're you're


---------81:23----------
choosing to bring it up because a lot of


---------81:25----------
people will like message me privately


---------81:26----------
afterwards and say like oh so I think


---------81:29----------
it's actually great that you did so how


---------81:31----------
do you think so it's it what I'm getting


---------81:34----------
from you is that instinctually hatred


---------81:37----------
seems to be a part of this equation like


---------81:40----------
that this discussion is not complete


---------81:42----------
without talking about sort of hatred and


---------81:44----------
how people are venomous towards a lot


---------81:49----------
yeah and can you tell me like so what


---------81:53----------
are we talking about are we talking


---------81:55----------
about like post streaming career or like


---------81:57----------
prior to streaming


---------81:59----------
um post okay


---------82:03----------
during I guess during yeah um so tell me


---------82:08----------
a little bit about what what you mean by


---------82:09----------
hatred and what happens and what you


---------82:11----------
expect like what you receive and how you


---------82:15----------
feel um okay so first my voice that I


---------82:22----------
want to hate for that Yad no people


---------82:26----------
really did not like it like just a lot


---------82:30----------
of hate over it yeah but it died down


---------82:33----------
for sure but it was really bad pardon me


---------82:37----------
because I'm just she only just be


---------82:40----------
completely ignorant but what on earth


---------82:43----------
does your voice have to do with it like


---------82:45----------
I don't even understand oh oh they


---------82:49----------
thought I was like freaking it I see


---------82:53----------
like they they think I'm faking it they


---------82:55----------
thought it well they still think I don't


---------82:57----------
know okay yeah but that's the crux of it


---------83:05----------
really like they think I'm thinking why


---------83:06----------
does why do they hate that like why


---------83:08----------
would anyone think you're hating your


---------83:09----------
voice I'm just so confused oh okay so


---------83:14----------
they think I'm faking my voice so they


---------83:18----------
think I'm faking it for attention and


---------83:20----------
then that gives way to like oh she's


---------83:22----------
just doing everything for it tension


---------83:24----------
she's fake or whatever oh I see okay got


---------83:27----------
it yeah yeah so what do you think about


---------83:34----------
that well nowadays I really don't care


---------83:39----------
anymore good like there's there's only


---------83:42----------
so many years you can get that in like


---------83:43----------
you know [ __ ] it and this is my voice


---------83:45----------
like I'm just gonna tuck in whatever is


---------83:47----------
comfortable for me like I'm just that's


---------83:48----------
it right what else can I do


---------83:50----------
yeah um so how does it make you how did


---------83:53----------
it make you feel when they when they


---------83:55----------
would you know hate on you and how does


---------83:57----------
someone hate on you for their voice what


---------83:59----------
do they actually say they say you're


---------84:00----------
faking your voice for attention is that


---------84:02----------
what in how that I don't know what the


---------84:06----------
hate mail this looks like okay


---------84:09----------
hey you're not talking in your real


---------84:11----------
voice but I'm not talking in my real


---------84:12----------
voice too


---------84:13----------
but that's that's okay you don't have to


---------84:15----------
do it like that you can do with it


---------84:16----------
whatever kind of voice you want to do


---------84:19----------
this we can do a little bit the German


---------84:24----------
accent we can do all kinds of the


---------84:25----------
different accents so all all kinds of


---------84:28----------
voices that are all fake everything is


---------84:30----------
false in the south meaning when you


---------84:34----------
order like that yeah it makes no sense


---------84:36----------
huh


---------84:36----------
but that's just one part of it is yeah


---------84:40----------
go ahead oh no no oh okay other part of


---------84:46----------
it is I think I don't know why they


---------84:49----------
there are people who just really didn't


---------84:51----------
like me like they would send me messages


---------84:54----------
where they were channeling psychoanalyze


---------84:57----------
me like this is why you do this like you


---------85:00----------
only do it for attention your fake


---------85:01----------
nothing about your you don't deserve


---------85:03----------
success like [ __ ] like that they do say


---------85:05----------
message me stuff like that okay and


---------85:08----------
that's like okay um that used to bother


---------85:13----------
me a lot back then especially when I was


---------85:15----------
them oh is it I was dating them before


---------85:20----------
Alfred a a public figure as well and


---------85:23----------
people would messaged me saying how oh


---------85:26----------
you're just dating them for attention


---------85:29----------
you're gold digger stuff like that and


---------85:32----------
that really bothered me because I don't


---------85:37----------
like being misunderstood


---------85:39----------
I guess cuz I'm not like that but they


---------85:42----------
believe that so I don't know sucked you


---------85:51----------
Risa


---------85:52----------
okay sure feel like I'm breaking him is


---------85:55----------
he okay is he's fine right he's okay I


---------85:58----------
just I feel bad oh and there was one


---------86:01----------
time yes someone sent me like a letter


---------86:06----------
to my house when I live with my parents


---------86:08----------
I don't know how they caught me I just


---------86:10----------
well probably pull up the docks and hey


---------86:12----------
yeah it was creepy do you send me a


---------86:15----------
seven-page letter saying how like


---------86:18----------
disparaging like everyone thought I was


---------86:20----------
hanging out with and that I wasn't good


---------86:22----------
for them it was just weird


---------86:24----------
oh okay


---------86:28----------
no seven-page I wish I kept it now it's


---------86:30----------
part of history but I threw it away I


---------86:32----------
British I burned it or something oh and


---------86:41----------
then there are people who message me


---------86:43----------
like after the whole Albert thing


---------86:45----------
happened like ah how I deserved to be


---------86:48----------
cheated on and like stuff like that and


---------86:52----------
I know this sounds like a stupid


---------86:55----------
question even me but like how does that


---------86:56----------
make you feel people those already like


---------87:00----------
in my own head but do you believe that


---------87:02----------
when they say it um in my lowest of


---------87:08----------
times maybe like at my little point


---------87:12----------
right good for you so so I see this is


---------87:15----------
interesting so I think this is different


---------87:16----------
because you would think because they're


---------87:19----------
saying the very things that you actually


---------87:22----------
like Lily to actually believes but you


---------87:25----------
tell me that at your lowest of low maybe


---------87:29----------
so I think that something something


---------87:32----------
within you rebels against that and


---------87:34----------
actually doesn't believe that I don't


---------87:36----------
want to believe in that of course you


---------87:38----------
don't want to believe it I'm not asking


---------87:40----------
what you want I'm asking what you do do


---------87:42----------
you actually believe them when they say


---------87:43----------
these things about you I can just that


---------87:46----------
by little points yeah yeah I I think


---------87:50----------
it's good that you don't believe them


---------87:51----------
that doesn't mean that it isn't hurtful


---------87:54----------
but I don't think that this is the same


---------87:56----------
is you feeling like do they make you


---------87:59----------
feel inadequate I think it's more like


---------88:03----------
they're triggers for like more thoughts


---------88:06----------
like they'll mention like oh you did


---------88:09----------
this so he cheated on you then I'm like


---------88:11----------
I know I didn't but then Lily I would


---------88:13----------
think like I did do a up I wasn't like a


---------88:15----------
little clingy I guess I guess I was like


---------88:17----------
that like I guess okay so they they kind


---------88:20----------
of caused you to doubt some but it's not


---------88:22----------
like you you feel like these people are


---------88:24----------
or you hit the nail on the head no no no


---------88:27----------
I don't think so okay


---------88:37----------
okay


---------88:45----------
okay there there are three or four


---------88:46----------
things I want to say one of them I think


---------88:48----------
could be hard for you to hear and the


---------88:50----------
other three I think are gonna be fine so


---------88:52----------
the first is we can talk a little bit


---------88:53----------
about understanding like why people hate


---------88:56----------
right so this is not even about you it's


---------88:58----------
just like what on earth would possess


---------89:03----------
someone to go through all of the effort


---------89:06----------
of finding out your address and then


---------89:09----------
writing you a seven-page late letter and


---------89:12----------
like mailing it like so first of all it


---------89:15----------
boggles my mind that someone would like


---------89:18----------
I can't even it takes every ounce of my


---------89:22----------
willpower to like put us like find a


---------89:25----------
stamp buy an envelope print something


---------89:29----------
out and mail it even if it's like


---------89:32----------
important like my mortgage but they did


---------89:36----------
it in a different color


---------89:37----------
like paper and pen color I remember so


---------89:40----------
it was it it's crazy like what on earth


---------89:44----------
why do people expend so much energy in


---------89:48----------
hating you so the first thing to


---------89:51----------
understand is that that has nothing to


---------89:54----------
do with you like Lily I know I was


---------89:56----------
talking about how you were amazing and


---------89:57----------
inspirational and you can transform


---------90:00----------
lives and all that good stuff I don't


---------90:02----------
think you have it within you to inspire


---------90:04----------
someone to mail something that comes


---------90:07----------
from them it doesn't come from you does


---------90:10----------
that make sense yeah that make sense so


---------90:12----------
that's the first thing to understand is


---------90:14----------
that this actually has nothing to do


---------90:15----------
with you and there's a decent chance


---------90:18----------
that you know we have to be a little bit


---------90:19----------
careful about like being narcissistic


---------90:20----------
and saying like oh my haters like it's


---------90:23----------
just all on them and has nothing to do


---------90:24----------
with me so I think you should you know


---------90:25----------
reflect like if someone if you have a


---------90:27----------
criticism like if someone criticizes you


---------90:29----------
so some people criticize me and I think


---------90:32----------
that's fair you know to take their


---------90:34----------
criticism seriously and that sort of


---------90:37----------
depends on the way in manner in which


---------90:38----------
they do it right so if someone sends me


---------90:40----------
a letter that's seven pages long I don't


---------90:42----------
like magazine type of different colors


---------90:45----------
like I don't I mean I'm just less likely


---------90:49----------
to take that seriously because that's


---------90:50----------
just [ __ ] weird right where I


---------90:54----------
sometimes people say like oh what you're


---------90:55----------
doing is irresponsible and stuff like


---------90:57----------
that no those are like legitimate


---------90:58----------
criticisms and


---------90:58----------
and who knows but I so there's a chance


---------91:01----------
there's ego deflecting this and saying


---------91:03----------
oh it's all in them but I really think


---------91:04----------
it's all on them I don't think it's ego


---------91:06----------
I think it's just understanding that


---------91:08----------
hatred comes from them like first of all


---------91:10----------
they don't even know you they're like


---------91:12----------
seeing something and something grates


---------91:15----------
with them about the person that you have


---------91:17----------
become they have to tear you down


---------91:21----------
because if you exist that is something


---------91:25----------
that they cannot like tolerate within


---------91:27----------
their own psyche and I've dealt with


---------91:30----------
people like this in in my own life where


---------91:33----------
like you know like this is kind of like


---------91:37----------
important like that like in a way


---------91:40----------
they've constructed a shell for


---------91:43----------
themselves and the shell involves like


---------91:46----------
certain things being true like for


---------91:48----------
example so I think part of the reason


---------91:49----------
that you may get a lot of hate is


---------91:51----------
because you talk about depression and


---------91:52----------
and when someone says like I'm just


---------91:55----------
gonna you know I have no idea who these


---------91:56----------
people are and and some people were


---------91:58----------
saying I should talk to them I'm happy


---------91:59----------
to talk to them actually but I'm just


---------92:02----------
gonna toss something out there okay this


---------92:04----------
is so like you talk about depression and


---------92:07----------
you struggle with depression and there


---------92:10----------
are other people out there who struggle


---------92:11----------
with depression and there are people who


---------92:13----------
struggle so much with depression that


---------92:15----------
they become disabled and they're not


---------92:16----------
able to do anything with their lives


---------92:18----------
and they blame their depression but


---------92:20----------
there's also a bizarre amount of


---------92:22----------
security in that depression because it


---------92:25----------
absolves you of responsibility and here


---------92:28----------
comes [ __ ] Lillee Picchu who also


---------92:31----------
struggles and got told by her mom like


---------92:37----------
God like you know really emotionally


---------92:39----------
abused by her mom and told her that she


---------92:40----------
wouldn't rather be born and and that's


---------92:42----------
what my parents told me and here she is


---------92:45----------
being successful and that terrifies them


---------92:49----------
because if you can be successful then


---------92:52----------
it's not the depressions fault it's


---------92:55----------
their fault


---------92:59----------
so nothing inspires hate as much as


---------93:03----------
seeing the person that you could be that


---------93:07----------
inspires the deepest hate that I've ever


---------93:10----------
seen because they look at you and they


---------93:14----------
say like oh I could be like that but I'm


---------93:16----------
not so I have to tear her down because


---------93:19----------
if you're fake then they're fine does


---------93:22----------
that make sense a lot of so that's where


---------93:26----------
I think a lot of this hate comes from it


---------93:28----------
comes from them and it comes from their


---------93:30----------
own issues and they have to tear you


---------93:33----------
down in order to make themselves feel


---------93:35----------
better about like their own situation in


---------93:37----------
life Oh like heaven forbid Lily actually


---------93:42----------
is talented and brings value she must


---------93:44----------
have some trick right it must be like


---------93:47----------
she must be faking her voice because and


---------93:51----------
like I can't make that voice and that's


---------93:53----------
why I'm not successful like there's no


---------93:56----------
way that they can like their mind their


---------93:58----------
ego it comes down to ego their ego can


---------94:01----------
tolerate like you being the person that


---------94:03----------
you are because it assaults their


---------94:05----------
worldview in some way questions about


---------94:09----------
that um so you know I don't know that


---------94:17----------
this necessarily helps but I think you


---------94:19----------
know going forward I would just try to


---------94:21----------
remember that right so like you when


---------94:23----------
you're gonna read those words in in your


---------94:26----------
this is gonna come to point number two


---------94:28----------
which is that you are just full of love


---------94:30----------
and we'll get to that in a second but


---------94:32----------
you know like you're gonna you're gonna


---------94:36----------
those words are gonna have an impact on


---------94:39----------
you but remember that like a lot of hate


---------94:43----------
in this world doesn't I mean most hatred


---------94:46----------
is not actually like I mean sometimes


---------94:48----------
it's it's really deserving of the person


---------94:49----------
who did it but most of the time like


---------94:52----------
hatred is like coming from them in like


---------94:54----------
their own sense of like hurt or anger or


---------94:56----------
fear or I mean that's you know when I


---------95:00----------
get hatred like when I get a patient


---------95:01----------
who's like you know I get a lot of hate


---------95:03----------
like I work in a lot of situations where


---------95:05----------
you know sometimes I'll involuntarily


---------95:08----------
hospitalized people and things like that


---------95:09----------
or I'm working with people who were


---------95:11----------
hospitalized against their will


---------95:12----------
and and sometimes I work with people who


---------95:14----------
are like psychotic like not in a


---------95:16----------
colloquial sense but in like a clinical


---------95:18----------
sense and and so that you know you can


---------95:21----------
my overwhelming sense is that hate


---------95:24----------
rarely has to do with you and it mostly


---------95:28----------
has to do with them the other thing to


---------95:31----------
remember is if we think about hate hate


---------95:33----------
is like really kind of a manifestation


---------95:36----------
of anger right it's anger taken to


---------95:38----------
extreme agree understand with me okay


---------95:41----------
and so if we think about it what makes


---------95:43----------
us angry like where does angry come


---------95:46----------
where does anger come from


---------95:50----------
so like Lily over the last two months


---------95:53----------
sorry you know if I say something that's


---------95:56----------
insensitive because now I'm sort of


---------95:57----------
treating you in a different way but in


---------95:59----------
the last two months have you been angry


---------96:03----------
yeah where does that anger come from


---------96:06----------
hate


---------96:08----------
absolutely so this is the other thing to


---------96:11----------
understand is that the birthplace of


---------96:13----------
anger is hurt 99% of the time I don't


---------96:17----------
know maybe 90% is out maybe 50% of time


---------96:19----------
for the intensive purposes of this


---------96:21----------
discussion


---------96:21----------
it comes from hurt and that's been my


---------96:23----------
experience that hurt is what leads to


---------96:26----------
anger and I remember like reading like a


---------96:29----------
school shooters manifesto and just


---------96:31----------
thinking like the origin of this is


---------96:34----------
heart right and and it's like I'm not


---------96:37----------
you know I don't know exactly where I'm


---------96:40----------
going with this but this is important to


---------96:41----------
understand and so it's kind of sad but


---------96:44----------
that like those people like even though


---------96:46----------
they're hating you and you suffer for


---------96:48----------
that and that's not cool and we'll get


---------96:50----------
to that but at the end of the day like


---------96:52----------
this this is all born of like their hurt


---------96:54----------
and like because like if you think about


---------96:56----------
it you know if you're successful and


---------96:58----------
you're a reject and you went to


---------96:59----------
Community College and you have


---------97:01----------
depression they don't have a [ __ ]


---------97:03----------
excuse because those are their excuses


---------97:06----------
those that's what they live behind right


---------97:08----------
like that's that's the armor of their


---------97:10----------
life it's like they can look at me and


---------97:13----------
it's like way harder to hate me because


---------97:15----------
they look at me and they say oh dr. K is


---------97:18----------
different he's smarter he works hard he


---------97:21----------
has willpower went to Harvard they don't


---------97:24----------
see us as being the same


---------97:26----------
but the people who hate me are the ones


---------97:28----------
that see themselves within me like they


---------97:32----------
look at me and they see a part of


---------97:33----------
themselves and that can be terrifying to


---------97:35----------
deal with and that thought hurts so damn


---------97:38----------
much because if you have excuses for


---------97:42----------
life then it's okay but like the thought


---------97:44----------
that you actually are in control that if


---------97:47----------
you had worked harder or hadn't given up


---------97:50----------
or expended more effort your life could


---------97:52----------
be somewhere where it isn't that is


---------97:55----------
immensely hurtful most devastating thing


---------97:58----------
and then it leads to anger and it leads


---------98:01----------
to hatred and since they are depressed


---------98:04----------
and disabled and may not may have failed


---------98:06----------
out of Community College they have a


---------98:08----------
bunch of time on their hands and this is


---------98:11----------
I feel protective of you so I'm being an


---------98:13----------
[ __ ] to them which is not really good


---------98:15----------
but I have nothing better to do than to


---------98:17----------
write seven-page letters and mail them


---------98:19----------
to you right so I think the main thing


---------98:22----------
that we need to understand is like


---------98:24----------
members of this community who receive


---------98:25----------
hurt is that I mean I think we as best


---------98:28----------
as we're able I'm not saying you should


---------98:30----------
do this but as best as we're able to try


---------98:32----------
to remember that this actually is coming


---------98:34----------
from hurt that most anger comes from


---------98:36----------
hurt and that if someone is like hates


---------98:40----------
you that if there's some way in which


---------98:42----------
you can help that person I think you


---------98:44----------
should I think that's more my ballpark


---------98:46----------
than your ballpark so I'm not trying to


---------98:48----------
suggest that you should do that but


---------98:49----------
that's a big part of why I street so I


---------98:52----------
don't want to project that on you but


---------98:54----------
questions about that okay so second


---------98:59----------
thing about hatred is that Lily you're


---------99:03----------
incredibly empathic like right like I


---------99:07----------
think you and your just your heart is


---------99:10----------
just full of love and it's an amazing


---------99:12----------
beautiful thing and also sometimes sucks


---------99:14----------
for you because I think all right like


---------99:20----------
screaming being a public figure and


---------99:23----------
caring so much about everything is so


---------99:26----------
hard yeah and I wish I didn't carry so


---------99:29----------
much yep I wish you but so you're an


---------99:31----------
empathic sponge and your heart is just


---------99:34----------
full of love and caring and you have to


---------99:37----------
be careful


---------99:38----------
so I think part of the reason that like


---------99:40----------
the hatred bothers you is not because


---------99:42----------
and this is why I was like early on I


---------99:44----------
started asking like do you believe that


---------99:45----------
about yourself I don't think this I


---------99:47----------
don't think the hatred actually has


---------99:48----------
anything to do with your lack of worth


---------99:50----------
like your lack of sense of self-worth I


---------99:52----------
think it's something completely


---------99:53----------
different and the reason that you suffer


---------99:55----------
for it is because you are just so your


---------99:58----------
heart is just so full of love and you


---------100:00----------
are so empathic that somehow


---------100:02----------
subconsciously psycho socially


---------100:04----------
spiritually I don't even know what this


---------100:06----------
is we're getting into territory that I


---------100:08----------
really do not understand and I'm just


---------100:10----------
observing you are able to connect with


---------100:12----------
that person and you feel not only their


---------100:16----------
hatred but the hurt underneath and I


---------100:21----------
think it's hard on you and I think


---------100:25----------
that's because you love and because you


---------100:27----------
care and because your heart is open that


---------100:30----------
like things affect you in a in like a


---------100:34----------
bigger way so like you know it's not


---------100:38----------
your fault it's not I mean generally


---------100:40----------
speaking I kind of think of it as good


---------100:41----------
but even then it's not good or bad it's


---------100:43----------
just you need to understand that you're


---------100:45----------
being whether it's your you know whether


---------100:47----------
you believe in souls or whatnot that's


---------100:49----------
fine


---------100:49----------
whether it's personality or neuroscience


---------100:51----------
like your empathic circuitry your EQ


---------100:53----------
something about the way that like your


---------100:55----------
brain is wired you feel the feelings of


---------100:58----------
others in a very deep and intense way


---------101:00----------
and also the intensity of your own


---------101:02----------
feelings is like greater so I would


---------101:05----------
guess that you test very very low on


---------101:08----------
like the sociopathy scale because your


---------101:12----------
empathy is actually very high so like


---------101:14----------
you're not you know I think it would be


---------101:16----------
hard for you to take advantage of other


---------101:17----------
people and things like that because yeah


---------101:20----------
and and so that's just the way you are


---------101:22----------
so you need to be careful about the way


---------101:24----------
in which you care for yourself because


---------101:29----------
you need to understand that like other


---------101:30----------
people like you can't judge what you


---------101:34----------
should do to take care of yourself based


---------101:35----------
on what you see other people do and yeah


---------101:43----------
so especially so I do I say this you're


---------101:48----------
doing nonsense


---------101:50----------
so I was confused about like what what


---------101:55----------
offline TV is because my quads were like


---------101:59----------
you should raid this person they're part


---------102:00----------
of the offline TV crew and like I didn't


---------102:03----------
understand literally what those words


---------102:05----------
meant like I don't understand what part


---------102:08----------
of the offline TV crew is like do you


---------102:10----------
guys understand how that sentence


---------102:13----------
doesn't like I don't even I just don't


---------102:16----------
like my head does not know how to


---------102:17----------
compute that so I was really confused


---------102:20----------
and I try not to prepare for interviews


---------102:22----------
which I think is good but then I googled


---------102:25----------
offline TV and I saw what offline TV was


---------102:28----------
uh and then I I watched some offline TVs


---------102:33----------
and so I'm gonna be very explicit with


---------102:36----------
you I I think you've got to be careful


---------102:38----------
because you're different from some of


---------102:39----------
your colleagues some of your colleagues


---------102:41----------
are different in terms of their degree


---------102:44----------
of empathy and also their degree of


---------102:45----------
sociopathy so like their ability to


---------102:48----------
withstand things and also to put


---------102:51----------
themselves like to separate out the


---------102:55----------
their feelings from their actions is


---------103:00----------
like very different from yours and you


---------103:03----------
need to take care of yourself in a


---------103:04----------
different kind of way like you need so


---------103:07----------
you need to think about yourself as a


---------103:08----------
sponge and you absorb negativity very


---------103:11----------
easily you hold on to negativity very


---------103:13----------
easily you also absorb positivity very


---------103:15----------
easily and you also let go of positivity


---------103:17----------
very easily so you need to have a life


---------103:20----------
where like your you know how to wring


---------103:23----------
out the sponge if it's negative and then


---------103:25----------
stick it into something that you like


---------103:27----------
but you gotta wring it out and the


---------103:29----------
reason you can't sleep is because you're


---------103:31----------
not wringing it out you got to wring it


---------103:35----------
out and then put yourself into something


---------103:37----------
good this isn't distractions just like


---------103:39----------
this is just how your being works so I'm


---------103:41----------
different I test very highly on the


---------103:42----------
sociopathy scale my sense of inherent


---------103:45----------
empathy is very like was low and and so


---------103:48----------
like I'm different from you so the


---------103:50----------
things that work for me are not gonna


---------103:52----------
work for you I don't know exactly what


---------103:54----------
that means and I think we're gonna maybe


---------103:55----------
have a more concrete conversation about


---------103:59----------
how you can take care of yourself better


---------104:01----------
because I think you do need to take care


---------104:03----------
of yourself batter in


---------104:04----------
by better I mean probably differently


---------104:06----------
because you're trying to take care of


---------104:07----------
yourself in the way that normal people


---------104:08----------
take care of themselves but you're not a


---------104:10----------
normal person you're just way too full


---------104:12----------
of love and so you've got to take care


---------104:14----------
of like I don't know what the ringing


---------104:16----------
out is gonna be but it may be a


---------104:18----------
particular meditation exercise I have


---------104:21----------
one in mind


---------104:22----------
which also is for insomnia but it's also


---------104:25----------
just acknowledging that like you need to


---------104:27----------
think about yourself as like a white


---------104:28----------
cloth and a white cloth stains way


---------104:31----------
faster but a white cloth you can also


---------104:34----------
bleach so you're gonna have to be a


---------104:36----------
little bit more rigorous about


---------104:37----------
understanding what are the things that


---------104:39----------
make you feel how do you let go of


---------104:42----------
negative emotions and then how do you


---------104:45----------
soak up positive emotions and the more


---------104:48----------
that you're able to think about yourself


---------104:49----------
in that way and like actively do that


---------104:51----------
instead of just hope it happens the


---------104:55----------
better off you're gonna feel on a


---------104:56----------
day-to-day basis you're like a real-life


---------105:00----------
like healer you're like a healer from an


---------105:02----------
MMO yeah okay fine maybe maybe better


---------105:09----------
questions about being an empathic sponge


---------105:17----------
yeah so it and that's not that's not a


---------105:20----------
bad thing right so we don't want you to


---------105:22----------
change we just want you to at least in


---------105:25----------
my mind I don't think you should change


---------105:26----------
I don't think that's right I think what


---------105:28----------
you should do is learn how to be


---------105:29----------
yourself and learn how you work so that


---------105:33----------
you can be like happy day-to-day and


---------105:35----------
like understand what your body what your


---------105:38----------
physical emotional and spiritual needs


---------105:40----------
are and that those may be different from


---------105:43----------
other people's okay I mean everyone's


---------105:45----------
are different from other people's


---------105:46----------
because we're all unique so we can think


---------105:49----------
a little bit about that I think that's a


---------105:50----------
potentially a longer conversation okay


---------105:52----------
so the last thing is like you know it


---------105:55----------
related to this is that you're just


---------105:57----------
gonna have to sort of deal with that


---------105:58----------
hate because when they send you the hate


---------106:00----------
like you absorb it and and it doesn't


---------106:03----------
feed your negative cognitive biases


---------106:05----------
about yourself and that you're worthless


---------106:07----------
it's just I think you just absorb it


---------106:08----------
you're like you know and and that's


---------106:11----------
tough so once again it comes to figuring


---------106:13----------
out like how do you wring out that


---------106:15----------
sponge


---------106:15----------
how can you sort of sit with those


---------106:17----------
feelings


---------106:18----------
don't try to push them away don't try to


---------106:20----------
cope with them I mean cope with them but


---------106:23----------
like you know if you need to but but


---------106:24----------
don't try to distract yourself just feel


---------106:26----------
those feelings and then kind of think


---------106:28----------
through okay like just recognize that


---------106:29----------
wow this person like has a lot of anger


---------106:31----------
and hatred and they're directing it


---------106:32----------
towards me so I'm gonna feel it but then


---------106:34----------
as best as you can let it wash through


---------106:36----------
you okay and figure out what are the


---------106:39----------
things that help emotions wash through


---------106:41----------
you yeah


---------106:44----------
is figuring that I was the hardest part


---------106:48----------
yeah um that's what I'm saying I think


---------106:53----------
I'm doing you in a sense of disservice


---------106:55----------
because I'm I'm telling you to do


---------106:59----------
something that I don't think that most


---------107:01----------
people are trained to learn how to do so


---------107:04----------
I'm giving you a goal I'm sort of saying


---------107:05----------
like oh like you know come up with a


---------107:09----------
grand unified theory of physics and


---------107:10----------
you're like I don't know how to do that


---------107:11----------
I'm like yeah I get that it's you know


---------107:15----------
so that's why I say yeah so III think so


---------107:19----------
I mean we could talk very concretely in


---------107:21----------
a few minutes about like what the first


---------107:22----------
phase of that is yeah so just just to


---------107:26----------
remember that that paint is gonna come


---------107:28----------
on to you but that you can let that go


---------107:30----------
like that's possible you just need to


---------107:32----------
process it and and also you know try as


---------107:35----------
best as you can try to remember and like


---------107:37----------
hopefully this will help that like the


---------107:38----------
hates not coming I mean it's not really


---------107:40----------
about you it's about them like what the


---------107:42----------
[ __ ] like why why do they go through all


---------107:44----------
this effort to try to hurt you in some


---------107:46----------
way and now we come to the thing


---------107:49----------
questions thoughts yeah can I go the


---------107:55----------
bathroom yes sorry


---------107:57----------
nope go for it


---------108:27----------
you


---------108:33----------
should I be talking right now I'm


---------108:35----------
confused maybe I should talk I was


---------108:38----------
I shall interact with scream for a few


---------108:40----------
moments


---------108:44----------
oh yes so psychiatrists test intend to


---------108:52----------
test highly on the sociopathy scale it's


---------108:55----------
part of what makes us govern our job


---------108:58----------
what are you drink I'm drinking water


---------109:07----------
tell people who I am


---------109:09----------
oh oh right so there are a lot of new


---------109:12----------
people here I feel I sometimes okay so


---------109:14----------
my name is all okay noise I'm a


---------109:15----------
psychiatrist


---------109:16----------
thank you chat I need you guys I really


---------109:20----------
need you guys okay so my name is all


---------109:22----------
O'Connor I'm a psychiatrist I'm


---------109:23----------
practicing in Boston Massachusetts in my


---------109:28----------
day job I'm an addiction psychiatrist I


---------109:30----------
guess very briefly just about my


---------109:32----------
backstory so I played a ton of video


---------109:34----------
games was addicted to video games in in


---------109:37----------
growing up high school almost failed out


---------109:40----------
of college had less than a 2.0 GPA was


---------109:44----------
on academic probation ended up going to


---------109:46----------
India to find myself etc loved it


---------109:50----------
because I sort of discovered the Olga


---------109:52----------
and meditation and I Reza decided to


---------109:53----------
become a monk sort of trained in yoga


---------109:57----------
and meditation I was still like coming


---------109:59----------
back and forth between the US and India


---------110:01----------
with the goal of becoming a monk so did


---------110:04----------
that training for about seven years and


---------110:05----------
then ended up becoming going to medical


---------110:09----------
school and became a psychiatrist and a


---------110:12----------
neuroscience research for a while and so


---------110:16----------
now I tried to help people understand


---------110:18----------
themselves a couple years ago I'm doing


---------110:21----------
a quick intro Lily because people were


---------110:23----------
suppose myself and so a couple years ago


---------110:29----------
started like asking some of my like


---------110:34----------
professors and stuff about video game


---------110:35----------
addiction and realize like no one really


---------110:37----------
knows anything about video game


---------110:39----------
addiction because the leaders in the


---------110:41----------
field of Psychiatry are in their 50s 60s


---------110:43----------
or 70s just true of most of medicine


---------110:45----------
like if you think about an expert in the


---------110:47----------
field like if you think about you know


---------110:48----------
people who get named to like fend chair


---------110:51----------
and and things like that people who are


---------110:53----------
CEOs and and things like people are


---------110:56----------
older and so they've never played video


---------110:58----------
games they don't understand what gaming


---------110:59----------
is like so I started working with gamers


---------111:01----------
about five years ago and then recently


---------111:04----------
started streaming on Twitch because like


---------111:06----------
you know gamers are not gonna wind up in


---------111:08----------
my office so if I want to talk to people


---------111:09----------
about


---------111:10----------
their mind and mental health and how to


---------111:13----------
understand it that twitch is the right


---------111:14----------
thing to do and that seems to have


---------111:16----------
worked out so far because people seem to


---------111:17----------
enjoy this kind of thing so I enjoy it


---------111:19----------
too and so that's who I am yeah so last


---------111:29----------
thing yeah okay so this self deprecation


---------111:33----------
this is important to understand


---------111:36----------
okay I'm gonna I'm kind of spent so I'm


---------111:38----------
gonna just do this quickly and maybe you


---------111:42----------
need no no I I'm just I'm just I guess I


---------111:47----------
don't mean to make you feel bad I just


---------111:49----------
can't walk you to this in the way that I


---------111:52----------
normally do okay and so sometimes I also


---------111:56----------
find I'm afraid that this could sound


---------111:58----------
hurtful or callous because usually I


---------112:00----------
preface things pretty well okay so I


---------112:02----------
think it's very good Lily that you


---------112:04----------
understand that the self you sort of


---------112:06----------
self deprecated your I mean I think


---------112:08----------
sometimes you know self deprecation is


---------112:09----------
really not has nothing to do with the


---------112:12----------
way you feel about yourself it's just


---------112:13----------
like the way that you're funny like it's


---------112:15----------
your mode of humor but I think there is


---------112:18----------
something very true that you said about


---------112:19----------
you know if you unless if you put


---------112:21----------
yourself down then others can't hurt you


---------112:24----------
yeah right so you can you can protect


---------112:27----------
yourself from hurt as long as you're the


---------112:30----------
one who's like making fun of yourself


---------112:32----------
like as then you're in control and and


---------112:36----------
that sort of works it's a survival


---------112:38----------
mechanism I'd be really curious if you


---------112:39----------
would like bullied growing up because


---------112:42----------
that's something that people learn how


---------112:45----------
to do to protect themselves bullies and


---------112:48----------
it's dangerous because you are willing


---------112:56----------
to treat yourself badly because there's


---------113:01----------
certainty and security in that like


---------113:03----------
that's something you can deal with its


---------113:05----------
territory that you know you're willing


---------113:09----------
to beat up on yourself or not let


---------113:12----------
yourself feel hopeful or successful


---------113:14----------
because if you aren't successful Lily


---------113:17----------
you can't be disappointing to anyone


---------113:20----------
kyoool right so your fear when we talk


---------113:24----------
to Lily to remember what is Lily to feel


---------113:26----------
what's a primary feeling was the word


---------113:28----------
used disappointment Oh dread of


---------113:32----------
disappointment right so you have you


---------113:35----------
have like this perfect armor against


---------113:39----------
everything that Lily to dreads and that


---------113:43----------
perfect armor is that you don't become


---------113:45----------
successful because if you're never


---------113:47----------
successful you can't be disappointed and


---------113:49----------
if you can't be disappointed


---------113:51----------
then Lily too has nothing to worry about


---------113:53----------
because her fears will never come to


---------113:55----------
pass and that is very protective and it


---------114:01----------
is I think a bad way to live life and


---------114:05----------
now we're gonna come to Albert because


---------114:08----------
you've engaged in a relationship where


---------114:10----------
you loved and you gave your entire heart


---------114:12----------
and you got devastated and now you're


---------114:16----------
hesitant to love again and it's the same


---------114:18----------
thing because unless you let yourself


---------114:20----------
become successful you can't be


---------114:22----------
disappointed and there's a lot of


---------114:24----------
security security and comfort in not


---------114:28----------
letting yourself love again yeah and I


---------114:32----------
think it's the wrong move it doesn't


---------114:35----------
mean you have to do it now mm-hmm


---------114:37----------
but that's just that's a value judgment


---------114:39----------
that I'm placing I'm not saying that you


---------114:41----------
should do that it's just I have a bias


---------114:43----------
and I have a belief that living a life


---------114:46----------
of security and comfort is not how you


---------114:50----------
live a fulfilling life that a life of


---------114:53----------
fulfillment comes out of facing


---------114:56----------
uncertainty and embracing uncertainty


---------114:59----------
and taking a chance and part of what


---------115:03----------
devastates all of these people about you


---------115:06----------
lily is that like you are doing the


---------115:08----------
thing that they did not do which is that


---------115:09----------
you took a chance and you faced up to


---------115:12----------
like all of your demons and you started


---------115:14----------
streaming and you did it inconsistently


---------115:16----------
and you self-deprecating soft but you


---------115:18----------
you walked the very uncertain road which


---------115:20----------
is why I think you're amazing because


---------115:22----------
you walk that road and you did it and it


---------115:24----------
terrifies them because they look at you


---------115:27----------
and they see the person that they could


---------115:28----------
be


---------115:31----------
and so at some point I hope you're


---------115:34----------
willing to walk that road of uncertainty


---------115:36----------
again when it comes to engaging in a


---------115:38----------
relationship you know because I think


---------115:40----------
that there is a lot of joy and


---------115:42----------
fulfillment in that but it's dangerous


---------115:43----------
in the prospect yes very scary and so


---------115:50----------
not saying it has to be anytime soon


---------115:51----------
mm-hmm but when I kind of think about


---------115:54----------
someone who is as full of empathy and


---------115:57----------
love as you are and who clearly


---------115:58----------
resonates with people and helps them in


---------116:00----------
a profound way and I think about you


---------116:03----------
sort of living like at the age of 60 if


---------116:05----------
you're kind of alone and I've never you


---------116:07----------
know being in the same vocation that's


---------116:09----------
kind of sad like that thought makes me


---------116:10----------
sad and I think you deserve more


---------116:14----------
and I'm not saying that you know


---------116:15----------
Albert's a good guy or bad guy or


---------116:17----------
anything I'm just saying like you as a


---------116:18----------
human being I think people deserve to be


---------116:20----------
loved and cherished and appreciated I


---------116:28----------
hope for that maybe one thing


---------116:38----------
commitments might scare you that yeah


---------116:41----------
that's why I think that's healthy


---------116:42----------
reasonably yeah okay other thoughts


---------116:46----------
questions this was a really nice


---------116:49----------
conversation I enjoyed it a lot too


---------116:52----------
I really liked it thank you you're very


---------116:56----------
welcome


---------116:57----------
do people have questions for you are we


---------117:00----------
doing questions I don't know hold on do


---------117:04----------
you want to or you spent okay let me


---------117:12----------
just um because we have some questions


---------117:15----------
for you okay oh and also we need to t I


---------117:19----------
need it we need to do meditation


---------117:25----------
okay let's do meditation first and if


---------117:26----------
people have questions for Lily then


---------117:29----------
y'all can ask them so I'm gonna teach


---------117:33----------
you a really simple meditation technique


---------117:34----------
which I think will hopefully will help


---------117:37----------
unclear but it's a meditation technique


---------117:41----------
that I usually teach for people who have


---------117:43----------
trouble sleeping do you meditate by the


---------117:45----------
way


---------117:45----------
no okay okay that's great we'll start


---------117:51----------
fixing that problem today so so what I


---------117:56----------
want you to it we were talking about you


---------117:58----------
kind of being an emotional sponge so


---------118:03----------
when you wake up in the morning Lily


---------118:05----------
when you're not in a period of


---------118:07----------
depression how do you usually feel I


---------118:10----------
wake up I wouldn't bet eyebrows write it


---------118:13----------
for like three hours


---------118:14----------
not big eyes and does eyebrows write it


---------118:18----------
um just think what I would have to do


---------118:21----------
today [ __ ] have to do that well god damn


---------118:25----------
it I didn't do that yesterday uh-huh how


---------118:30----------
do you that when you first wake up


---------118:33----------
really lazy okay okay yeah that may be


---------118:43----------
because you're not getting enough sleep


---------118:44----------
but okay so um you know I I don't know


---------118:49----------
if this is actually true but but


---------118:51----------
generally speaking I think about the


---------118:53----------
mind is being relatively fresh in the


---------118:55----------
morning and then if we think about


---------118:57----------
insomnia what happens is like over the


---------119:00----------
course of the day like it's easy to go


---------119:03----------
to bed in the morning right uh-huh it's


---------119:05----------
easy to fall asleep in the morning but


---------119:07----------
it's hard to fall asleep at night so


---------119:08----------
something changes between morning and


---------119:11----------
night and we have to understand what


---------119:13----------
that is that prevents you from sleeping


---------119:15----------
at night because it's definitely not


---------119:16----------
there in the morning so I think a lot of


---------119:20----------
people don't appreciate that as they go


---------119:22----------
through the day is you have thoughts


---------119:24----------
like you're having that creates a little


---------119:27----------
bit of anxiety a little bit of tension


---------119:28----------
like oh I didn't do that it creates


---------119:30----------
regret and those negative emotions the


---------119:33----------
more that you think like oh I didn't do


---------119:35----------
this and I did do this like even though


---------119:36----------
you may feel like going back to sleep


---------119:38----------
how


---------119:39----------
does that affect your ability to sleep


---------119:40----------
um not comfortable absolutely yes so


---------119:48----------
when you try to go to bed at night what


---------119:49----------
is it that keeps you awake I don't know


---------119:53----------
I need you have thoughts I do I think a


---------119:56----------
lot yep I just think a lot about what


---------120:02----------
well first I need to get off reddit that


---------120:06----------
could take like hours there's so many


---------120:08----------
separate us out there it's crazy


---------120:10----------
um and then I just think like a lot of


---------120:14----------
what-ifs a lot okay a lot okay yeah okay


---------120:20----------
so that's I'm thinking that maybe we


---------120:22----------
need to teach you something else but I'm


---------120:24----------
gonna continue teaching when I was


---------120:25----------
playing teacher but that's just changed


---------120:27----------
my sense of what what could be helpful


---------120:29----------
to you but my sense is that you know


---------120:33----------
when when we wake up in the morning it's


---------120:35----------
relatively easy to go to sleep and as we


---------120:37----------
go through the day we start to have


---------120:39----------
thoughts and those thoughts have like


---------120:41----------
little emotional impacts so we take like


---------120:44----------
a little bit of emotional damage and


---------120:45----------
usually that damage is there because the


---------120:47----------
thought is not incomplete I mean if the


---------120:49----------
thought is incomplete it's not like


---------120:51----------
resolved so we think about something and


---------120:54----------
it's like something that's left


---------120:55----------
unresolved and it's kind of this little


---------120:57----------
emotional weight that needs to be


---------120:59----------
settled so if you're thinking oh I


---------121:01----------
didn't do this yesterday then that's


---------121:03----------
like a little bit of regret and a little


---------121:05----------
bit of guilt and you're not quite at


---------121:06----------
peace with that does that make sense


---------121:08----------
in fact the thoughts of like guilt and


---------121:10----------
regret are a sign of lack of peace you


---------121:15----------
with me like you're not at peace about


---------121:18----------
it which is why you regret it


---------121:19----------
those are like tide so basically what


---------121:22----------
happens is throughout the day we have


---------121:24----------
little instances either thoughts or


---------121:26----------
encounters with people we're like oh I


---------121:28----------
say this and like let's say like at the


---------121:30----------
end of tonight if I'm laying in bed and


---------121:32----------
I say oh I should have said this to Lily


---------121:34----------
I forgot to say this I was less


---------121:37----------
compassionate than I could have been or


---------121:38----------
this or that and so there are all things


---------121:41----------
that happen throughout the day that sort


---------121:43----------
of give us this like it's like we're


---------121:44----------
absorbing a little bit of that stuff in


---------121:46----------
our emotional sponge and then as we


---------121:48----------
accumulate all that crap through


---------121:51----------
the day then we go to bed and we just


---------121:53----------
have this flood of like random thoughts


---------121:56----------
about all kinds of stuff half of which


---------121:59----------
is not good yeah right so that's like


---------122:02----------
I'm like just in complete mental energy


---------122:05----------
that we've accumulated through the day


---------122:07----------
because our experiences are not complete


---------122:10----------
or processed they're all like half done


---------122:11----------
like I walked in the grocery store and


---------122:14----------
there was this chick and she was


---------122:15----------
checking me out


---------122:16----------
I was like oh yeah like like there's


---------122:18----------
that thought or I was walking down the


---------122:20----------
street and there was this chick and she


---------122:22----------
was looking at my hair because it was


---------122:23----------
ridiculous oh my god


---------122:24----------
I'm mortified that's oh there are all


---------122:27----------
these incomplete little things that


---------122:28----------
happen right so yeah I'm going to do


---------122:32----------
meditations they trying to complete all


---------122:34----------
of this sort of this meditation is is


---------122:38----------
way easier than completing them because


---------122:40----------
completing them is a lot of work it's


---------122:42----------
actually unwinding so I want you to


---------122:43----------
think about your mind in the morning is


---------122:45----------
unwound and as you go through the day


---------122:48----------
you kind of wind it up like it gets


---------122:50----------
round right like you get like tense and


---------122:52----------
you get energy and then at night you


---------122:54----------
have like insomnia so this technique is


---------122:56----------
relatively simple it's just you start at


---------122:59----------
the end of your day so you start in the


---------123:01----------
moment so you're laying in bed and then


---------123:03----------
you go through your day in reverse order


---------123:05----------
so you start with the most recent thing


---------123:07----------
and then you go to the thing before and


---------123:08----------
then you go to the thing before and you


---------123:10----------
go to the thing before and you just


---------123:12----------
think through the emotional impact or


---------123:15----------
you acknowledge the emotional impact you


---------123:17----------
don't have to process anything you just


---------123:18----------
think like you just acknowledge the


---------123:20----------
emotions that you felt and how you felt


---------123:22----------
the moment before in the moment before


---------123:24----------
and the moment before and the goal is to


---------123:26----------
left leave yourself being unwound at the


---------123:31----------
beginning of the morning when you were


---------123:32----------
tired and sleepy and then if you get


---------123:35----------
good at the technique so this is


---------123:36----------
important to remember is that like


---------123:38----------
meditation is a skill so you have to


---------123:40----------
practice this technique for a period of


---------123:42----------
about eight weeks five times a week for


---------123:46----------
it to really have a significant change


---------123:48----------
on your sleeping pattern that's what you


---------123:51----------
should expect and so I'll give you just


---------123:53----------
kind of an example right so like I was


---------123:55----------
before I got into bed I brushed my teeth


---------123:57----------
before I brush my teeth I changed my


---------124:02----------
clothes and


---------124:03----------
and I saw and as I was changing my


---------124:06----------
clothes my wife yelled at me because


---------124:09----------
instead of putting clothes in the hamper


---------124:10----------
I put them on the floor actually clothes


---------124:13----------
on the floor and I felt irritated with


---------124:16----------
her and before that I was reading my


---------124:19----------
kids a bedtime story and that felt


---------124:21----------
actually really amazing because they're


---------124:24----------
very cuddly but then one of them was


---------124:27----------
like moving around too much and she


---------124:29----------
wasn't sitting still so I felt


---------124:31----------
frustrated with her I also felt like


---------124:33----------
annoyed that my other kid couldn't hear


---------124:35----------
a story because I was dealing with the


---------124:38----------
wiggly one and before that I was eating


---------124:41----------
dinner and I felt kind of frustrated


---------124:43----------
because like I wanted to eat chicken


---------124:46----------
wings but instead say comfy I'm sorry


---------124:54----------
yeah so so I mean welcome didn't feel


---------125:00----------
that way to me but I mean I recognize


---------125:05----------
there parts of it better wholesome but


---------125:07----------
but so to basically go through your day


---------125:09----------
in reverse order and so like acknowledge


---------125:11----------
the things that you felt so let's


---------125:13----------
practice now and as you feel comfortable


---------125:15----------
let's so close your eyes and and start


---------125:19----------
in reverse order so what tell me about


---------125:20----------
what you did today today yeah so we're


---------125:24----------
gonna start now what you did and how it


---------125:26----------
made you feel was wrong with this moment


---------125:29----------
I talked to you felt cathartic actually


---------125:35----------
helped me a lot um then I was looking


---------125:39----------
for my glasses for about an hour it made


---------125:43----------
me very frustrated cuz I think I still


---------125:46----------
haven't found my glasses I'm wearing


---------125:48----------
someone else's glasses or you know


---------125:49----------
actually okay so good this is a mistake


---------125:51----------
I'm just going off on a tangent


---------125:53----------
yes very good so this is a problem so


---------125:55----------
don't indulge in new lines of thought


---------125:58----------
just acknowledge I felt frustrated that


---------126:02----------
I could not find my glasses and then


---------126:04----------
move to the thing before good hey


---------126:07----------
frustrated could not find my glasses uh


---------126:10----------
I drank a lot of water cuz I was sick


---------126:15----------
felt better I had a cough drop because I


---------126:17----------
was sick also felt better um I put some


---------126:21----------
makeup on cuz ya felt better


---------126:24----------
um wash my face changed woke up I guess


---------126:31----------
that's my day okay


---------126:33----------
so I want you to how long ago did you


---------126:37----------
wake up around how many hours sorry I


---------126:45----------
completely forgot one more thing um


---------126:47----------
before that eyebrows right if for like


---------126:50----------
an hour to me people okay I woke up at


---------126:54----------
like 9:00 so now what we need to do is


---------126:57----------
increase the resolution of like zoom in


---------127:00----------
more right so like there are a lot of


---------127:02----------
things so did you feel something before


---------127:04----------
you came on stream I did I felt very


---------127:08----------
anxious actually threatens oh so this


---------127:11----------
technique doesn't work unless you catch


---------127:13----------
that right because like the the feelings


---------127:15----------
that you acknowledge are the things that


---------127:16----------
you unwound but unless you acknowledge


---------127:19----------
the anxiety that anxiety is gonna sit


---------127:21----------
with you okay yeah so so in the span of


---------127:25----------
like you know 30 to 60 seconds you went


---------127:28----------
through your entire day we need to spend


---------127:30----------
five minutes like so you want to go


---------127:34----------
through each thing that happened okay


---------127:37----------
okay so so yeah that's okay that's the


---------127:41----------
point of the technique is this it's not


---------127:43----------
supposed to be easy the point of the


---------127:45----------
technique is so that it it trains you to


---------127:49----------
acknowledge the various things that


---------127:51----------
happen throughout the day so that you


---------127:53----------
can unwind them a little bit and then


---------127:55----------
they're weighing on you less okay so I


---------128:01----------
think let's try this one more time and


---------128:04----------
why don't you start with last night so


---------128:07----------
pretend that you're in bed last night


---------128:09----------
and try to go I'll stop you after like


---------128:12----------
two or three minutes okay but like put


---------128:14----------
yourself in the frame of mind of like


---------128:16----------
what did you do like you were in bed


---------128:17----------
last night and start there


---------128:20----------
okay was in bed then I washed up then


---------128:27----------
how did you feel when you washed up


---------128:29----------
relieved oh yeah


---------128:32----------
relieved I felt relieved when I washed


---------128:33----------
up because I had a long day um uh then


---------128:39----------
some people dropped me off home before


---------128:42----------
that we watched a movie and the movie


---------128:46----------
was entertaining it's funny I enjoyed it


---------128:49----------
how was the car ride home uneventful it


---------128:52----------
was just the car ID okay before that I


---------128:56----------
was with my friend Michael we went to a


---------128:59----------
premier event was exciting we streamed


---------129:03----------
for hours and hours um most fun then


---------129:07----------
before that car ride to the event


---------129:10----------
uneventful again and before that got


---------129:14----------
makeup hair stylist done but just also


---------129:18----------
exciting machine gun as well um before


---------129:21----------
that uh ordered food eight wasn't very


---------129:26----------
hungry but it's late and then before


---------129:29----------
that


---------129:30----------
well browsed right it probably washed up


---------129:34----------
a little browser edit I guess okay so


---------129:39----------
great so I think you're doing a far


---------129:41----------
better job at sort of incorporating


---------129:42----------
different things throughout your day but


---------129:44----------
something tells me that the majority of


---------129:46----------
your emotion yesterday maybe this isn't


---------129:48----------
right but that the did you have trouble


---------129:50----------
sleeping last night I have trouble


---------129:53----------
sleeping every night okay


---------129:55----------
so I'm curious about the little the


---------129:58----------
little anxieties fears dreads that you


---------130:01----------
may have had throughout the day I did


---------130:03----------
miss a lot actually I had a big problem


---------130:05----------
with the streaming backpack it was super


---------130:07----------
stressful I don't know I didn't see it


---------130:10----------
Wow um yeah I was so stressed about that


---------130:13----------
cuz I didn't know if we could stream or


---------130:15----------
distressed mean um I was like anxious I


---------130:20----------
get nervous and I was feeling like


---------130:23----------
overwhelmed about the topic okay


---------130:29----------
um at the event too I was really tired


---------130:34----------
super physically exhausted super tired


---------130:37----------
um okay good so lily I think this is


---------130:45----------
this is good so you need to practice the


---------130:47----------
technique sort I would say is that you


---------130:49----------
know as as you now that you're kind of


---------130:51----------
you can even do sort of the flipside of


---------130:53----------
the technique which is as you're going


---------130:54----------
through your day just take note of how


---------130:57----------
you feel so that you can do the


---------130:59----------
technique at night the other thing that


---------131:02----------
you're not allowed to do so it's great


---------131:03----------
that you acknowledge these things now if


---------131:05----------
you're really doing the technique like a


---------131:07----------
hard-ass you start over at the beginning


---------131:09----------
and you include those with everything


---------131:12----------
else okay don't do that yeah let's try


---------131:15----------
it one more time okay so yesterday yes


---------131:21----------
from the moment I woke up on the moment


---------131:24----------
you went to sleep


---------131:25----------
backwards is really hard yes it's harder


---------131:29----------
than yeah okay so washed up felt good


---------131:33----------
cuz I had a long day um I was closed


---------131:37----------
okay um eat some food did not feel like


---------131:42----------
it I wasn't hungry but I made myself II


---------131:44----------
because I didn't eat much that day car


---------131:47----------
ride home was uneventful relieved to go


---------131:50----------
the event itself was fun but tiring um


---------131:55----------
just really tiring but I kind of wanted


---------131:58----------
to go home to uh then the car ride to


---------132:01----------
the event was kind of stressful because


---------132:04----------
we were trying to work out the stream


---------132:06----------
there was some problem with the screen I


---------132:08----------
remember it was super cool I was very


---------132:11----------
cool and then bring a jacket I was a


---------132:13----------
mistake and before that the hair makeup


---------132:16----------
was fine but I was also still stressed


---------132:18----------
because I wasn't sure if the screen was


---------132:20----------
gonna be good that day and I didn't know


---------132:22----------
if the backpack was gonna work on before


---------132:24----------
I start to stream before the makeup we


---------132:26----------
were trying to fix the backpack for a


---------132:28----------
long time I was stressed because I


---------132:31----------
didn't know what to do and I felt bad


---------132:34----------
cuz I was relying on my goal to fix it


---------132:36----------
and I couldn't help then ordered food


---------132:40----------
Dallas oak


---------132:42----------
I wasn't that hungry but just ate cuz I


---------132:44----------
was nervous about that day oh I had an


---------132:47----------
eyelash appointment that morning I


---------132:48----------
forgot that was kind of okay I fell


---------132:52----------
asleep during the most of it because you


---------132:54----------
just lay there for two hours then I woke


---------132:56----------
up oh I auditioned for something that


---------132:59----------
morning too


---------133:00----------
I was very tired so I was kind of


---------133:01----------
nervous because I wasn't sure if my


---------133:03----------
voice sounded good in the morning and I


---------133:05----------
was sick too and then I woke up at 8:00


---------133:09----------
so what do you notice about the first


---------133:12----------
run in the second run I forgot so many


---------133:15----------
pings Wow so that's all crap that is


---------133:20----------
swimming around in your unconscious it's


---------133:25----------
just like I can't believe I forgot all


---------133:27----------
of that yeah right so living a life like


---------133:31----------
where you're where you're mindful of


---------133:33----------
like moments and things like it's very


---------133:35----------
hard it takes practice I think you're


---------133:37----------
doing a fantastic job I'm amazed by how


---------133:39----------
much progress you've made between like


---------133:40----------
one run and so keep practicing yeah yeah


---------133:44----------
closing your eyes this huh very good


---------133:48----------
okay so let's see I think I think that's


---------133:51----------
let me see if people have questions for


---------133:53----------
you okay so


---------133:58----------
Sheena's how do I get healing like this


---------134:00----------
if I cannot afford the expense of a


---------134:01----------
therapist or psychiatrist so that's why


---------134:03----------
we're training coaches so I'm like


---------134:04----------
training a dozen coaches who are gonna


---------134:07----------
be working hopefully with people and our


---------134:09----------
beta program is gonna be free at some


---------134:11----------
point though we're gonna probably have


---------134:12----------
to charge something because you know


---------134:13----------
they can't continue to volunteer their


---------134:15----------
time but and it's gonna be it's not it's


---------134:17----------
not like it's not treatment so it's


---------134:19----------
gonna be like cheap so maybe like 40


---------134:22----------
bucks an hour or something like that


---------134:24----------
so okay


---------134:36----------
okay so someone says you had mentioned


---------134:38----------
with Kevin to not live in a world with


---------134:42----------
hypotheticals I know Kevin is but after


---------134:45----------
getting cheated on the first time I


---------134:47----------
started living in a world of what if my


---------134:49----------
next girlfriend cheats on me


---------134:50----------
in my case my next girlfriend did how do


---------134:54----------
you let go of the hypothetical if it was


---------134:57----------
correct once what do you think Willie um


---------135:02----------
how do you I don't even know I don't I


---------135:07----------
wish I knew that now - yeah


---------135:10----------
I still think what if my next boyfriend


---------135:13----------
cheats on me or I'm scared of that still


---------135:15----------
yeah so I think it's a great question


---------135:18----------
right so I think that's the challenge is


---------135:20----------
that each time you get hurt you can fear


---------135:24----------
engaging in the relationship again and


---------135:28----------
so that sort of makes sense like it can


---------135:31----------
be hard every time every time that you


---------135:35----------
know you get hurt it can be hard to


---------135:36----------
shake that thing again and again and and


---------135:39----------
I've talked about something called a


---------135:41----------
some scar which is sort of like a ball


---------135:42----------
of undigested emotion or trauma before


---------135:44----------
and I think when I talk about Lilly -


---------135:47----------
for example I'm talking about in


---------135:49----------
Sanskrit Lilly - is something called a


---------135:51----------
some scars so it's like this this sort


---------135:54----------
of dormant set of emotions that rise up


---------135:58----------
and change Lilly's thought patterns and


---------136:00----------
behaviors and then they go dormant again


---------136:02----------
and she's back to being normal Lilly so


---------136:04----------
each time you get emotionally hurt and


---------136:07----------
you don't process it the strength of the


---------136:09----------
some scar grows so if we look at Lilly


---------136:11----------
we see that Lilly has this persistent


---------136:14----------
sense of self judgment in disappointment


---------136:17----------
and falling short because that she


---------136:21----------
didn't get told that she was


---------136:23----------
disappointing once she got told she was


---------136:25----------
disappointing again and again and again


---------136:27----------
and again and each time she gets told


---------136:29----------
she's disappointing that thing grows and


---------136:32----------
what we see is like what we see today


---------136:34----------
right which is this persistent negative


---------136:36----------
self-critical kind of like it's like


---------136:39----------
subtitles like you're living your normal


---------136:41----------
life and these subtitle thoughts are


---------136:43----------
just like popping up and you


---------136:45----------
struggle because you're trying to like


---------136:47----------
stop the subtitles and it's kind of okay


---------136:49----------
because you're actually still living


---------136:51----------
life but the subtitles are there it's


---------136:52----------
really [ __ ] annoying so with the with


---------136:54----------
the girlfriend I think you've got to


---------136:55----------
understand that each time it happens


---------136:57----------
it's gonna create some emotional weight


---------136:59----------
and that you have to sort of learn how


---------137:01----------
to like face uncertainty again and step


---------137:06----------
out of your security and comfort zone


---------137:08----------
which is a little bit of an unsatisfying


---------137:10----------
answer the other thing that you've


---------137:11----------
really got to be careful about is that a


---------137:13----------
lot of times people get into similar


---------137:16----------
relationship patterns and from


---------137:18----------
psychiatry this is something we call the


---------137:20----------
repetition compulsion that people tend


---------137:22----------
to essentially like try to repeat the


---------137:25----------
same they end up repeating the same


---------137:27----------
thing over and over again because


---------137:29----------
they're trying to like fix something and


---------137:31----------
a good example of this is people who are


---------137:34----------
in abusive relationships often times


---------137:36----------
we'll get into abusive relationships


---------137:38----------
again and they'll get into abusive


---------137:40----------
relationship after abusive relationship


---------137:42----------
after abusive relationship so the other


---------137:44----------
thing that you can do and I know this is


---------137:46----------
gonna sound kind of weird but you can


---------137:48----------
look at like how you select the people


---------137:50----------
that you end up dating because there's a


---------137:53----------
chance that you you gravitate towards a


---------137:56----------
certain kind of person who is more


---------137:58----------
likely to be unfaithful and I know that


---------138:00----------
sounds crazy and it sounds kind of like


---------138:02----------
you know I'm not I'm not trying to blame


---------138:03----------
you but at the same time we actually had


---------138:06----------
an interesting early on when we started


---------138:10----------
streaming we had a great conversation


---------138:11----------
with someone who found that like Heath


---------138:13----------
he gets into the same relationship


---------138:14----------
patterns over and over again and a lot


---------138:17----------
of people do experience that they get


---------138:18----------
into the same relationship patterns like


---------138:20----------
over and over again like why do I always


---------138:22----------
date [ __ ] like Oh like there may be


---------138:24----------
a reason for that you know so so I think


---------138:28----------
one thing that you can do is just learn


---------138:30----------
how to sort of emotionally process that


---------138:32----------
hurt and then hopefully it'll be eat I


---------138:36----------
mean it's gonna be harder but each time


---------138:38----------
it happens it's understandably a harder


---------138:40----------
to like have faith in another person and


---------138:42----------
that's normal the second thing that you


---------138:44----------
can do is really look at the ways in


---------138:46----------
which your your kind of selecting people


---------138:48----------
and is something going on in terms of


---------138:51----------
the kind of person that you gravitate


---------138:53----------
towards or things like that do you


---------138:55----------
ignore signs that the relationship isn't


---------138:56----------
going well there are a lot of other


---------138:58----------
things that you can practice


---------138:59----------
we do which I feel like it's kind of a


---------139:04----------
mean answer but I mean it's true right


---------139:08----------
like you you were right once and you


---------139:09----------
were right again and that's bad that


---------139:12----------
sucks


---------139:12----------
okay can you do a day in the life video


---------139:18----------
I guess that's for me or you I don't


---------139:21----------
know what that's for you - what is that


---------139:27----------
day in the life is like a video where


---------139:30----------
you just show you view the day in the


---------139:32----------
life of me I wake up I do this I do that


---------139:35----------
you know make it interesting maybe draw


---------139:38----------
it out you know anything maybe it's for


---------139:40----------
me I don't know but yeah okay okay so


---------139:49----------
let's people have questions about a


---------139:51----------
psychiatrist psychosis is the experience


---------140:01----------
for people with very high IQs similar as


---------140:04----------
in are they mostly depressed and lonely


---------140:06----------
no so one thing that is similar is that


---------140:08----------
the the US Department of Defense did a


---------140:11----------
study on their soldiers and found that


---------140:14----------
soldiers who play video games have an IQ


---------140:16----------
that's 10 to 20 percent higher than


---------140:19----------
soldiers who don't play video games so I


---------140:21----------
do actually genuinely believe that


---------140:23----------
gamers are like general that being very


---------140:27----------
intelligent is actually a risk factor


---------140:29----------
for video game addiction and there's a


---------140:32----------
very simple reason for that it's not


---------140:34----------
like super complicated so I'll tell you


---------140:36----------
guys so I was early on and when I


---------140:38----------
started working with gamers I was


---------140:39----------
talking to a very particular gamer and I


---------140:41----------
asked him you know when did you like


---------140:43----------
really like video games and like how did


---------140:45----------
you get into them and the story they


---------140:46----------
told me like blew my mind and has stuck


---------140:48----------
with me ever since and they said that so


---------140:50----------
I was in the second grade and I went to


---------140:52----------
school and my teacher gave me a math


---------140:54----------
worksheet and I knew how to do the math


---------140:57----------
so I did the worksheet and then 10


---------140:58----------
minutes later I went and I handed in the


---------141:00----------
worksheet and then I said can I have the


---------141:03----------
next one and Lily what do you think the


---------141:05----------
teacher said what happens when you turn


---------141:09----------
in your worksheet in class what do you


---------141:11----------
think


---------141:13----------
no yeah that's exactly says she says


---------141:17----------
this is the worksheet for the day we're


---------141:19----------
gonna do another one tomorrow right


---------141:21----------
that's how school works like you have a


---------141:23----------
lesson plan for the day and if you're a


---------141:25----------
smart kid and you finish it early then


---------141:28----------
you get to sit and wait and read quietly


---------141:30----------
by yourself and then he would go home


---------141:33----------
and he would play a video game and Lily


---------141:35----------
he would beat level one of the video


---------141:37----------
game and then what happened next what


---------141:41----------
happens after you beat level one


---------141:44----------
absolutely


---------141:46----------
absolutely right so like a video game is


---------141:49----------
something that paces its challenge to


---------141:53----------
your capabilities and and and school


---------141:57----------
moves at the rate of the slowest kid and


---------142:00----------
so I think that like very early on like


---------142:03----------
people like smart kids gravitate towards


---------142:06----------
video games because they actually get


---------142:08----------
challenged in a game the way they can't


---------142:10----------
in real life so I you know when I work


---------142:14----------
like I was recently working with a kid


---------142:15----------
and my solution to his video game


---------142:17----------
addiction cuz he's a he's a big-time


---------142:20----------
anyway he's he's a successful player in


---------142:23----------
a particular game is to like hook him up


---------142:26----------
with an internship at MIT so I called a


---------142:29----------
buddy of mine who is has a start-up at


---------142:31----------
MIT and was like hey can you like take


---------142:34----------
this kid he's 15 they're like we have


---------142:36----------
600 applicants for interns and I was


---------142:38----------
like yeah but this gets different he's


---------142:39----------
special and the kid goes to to do the


---------142:43----------
internship and now he's not playing many


---------142:45----------
games anymore because he realizes oh


---------142:47----------
there's actually like really cool


---------142:49----------
challenging stuff in the world that I


---------142:50----------
can engage in and and like when you do


---------142:54----------
that it you know that's how you kind of


---------142:55----------
get free from your addiction but I do


---------142:57----------
think that that generally speaking I see


---------142:59----------
a lot of correlation between


---------143:00----------
intelligence and video game addiction


---------143:02----------
although I don't necessarily think that


---------143:03----------
intelligence leads to being depressed


---------143:05----------
and lonely because you know I would say


---------143:08----------
that for example so I guess I didn't


---------143:11----------
mention this in my bio but I'm faculty


---------143:13----------
at Harvard Medical School and I trained


---------143:14----------
there and a lot of people they're smart


---------143:17----------
but I don't think that their average


---------143:18----------
experiences to be depressed and lonely


---------143:20----------
I think gamers who are very intelligent


---------143:23----------
oftentimes are depressed and lonely


---------143:25----------
but that's because like games give them


---------143:28----------
what real life can't and as they move


---------143:30----------
away from real life and gravitate more


---------143:32----------
towards games then they become depressed


---------143:35----------
similarly sorry I don't think it's just


---------143:39----------
the IQ it's like a combination of like


---------143:41----------
the way that gaming influences your life


---------143:42----------
just trying to see ok


---------143:48----------
did you talk to her about Dharma I don't


---------143:51----------
think so


---------143:52----------
sort of so Padma is something I talked a


---------143:56----------
lot about in stream and it's the Sun


---------143:59----------
script word for duty or responsibility I


---------144:01----------
sort of talked to her about it because I


---------144:04----------
told her so but I didn't talk about it


---------144:07----------
explicitly because I didn't think it was


---------144:08----------
kind of just random I didn't think it


---------144:11----------
was relevant


---------144:12----------
I mentioned yeah so so what I did talk


---------144:16----------
about Lilly is like why do you stream


---------144:21----------
because I like it and it's a good job


---------144:24----------
yeah so you like it and it's a good job


---------144:28----------
yeah and what is it what do you like


---------144:32----------
about streaming um I think it's a very


---------144:36----------
unique job but um I take the word lucky


---------144:41----------
now but I'm lucky to have and I don't


---------144:42----------
want to waste it I don't wanna waste the


---------144:45----------
opportunity yeah but what do you like


---------144:47----------
about it


---------144:47----------
I like talking with my chat like talking


---------144:51----------
about feeling I like drawing blinking


---------144:54----------
yeah


---------144:55----------
do you think that your is there some


---------144:58----------
part of you that feels like streaming is


---------145:02----------
you're making the world a slightly


---------145:04----------
better place


---------145:04----------
Oh 60% me me it's hard it's hard it's


---------145:10----------
hard you think that it is right so I


---------145:12----------
don't think you're ready to accept that


---------145:14----------
but I think earlier on you were there


---------145:16----------
yeah and and so now her mental patterns


---------145:20----------
have returned so like now she's back to


---------145:23----------
sit but it's good that you can recognize


---------145:24----------
that 60 playing no that's but that's the


---------145:26----------
Dharma right so I think we talked about


---------145:28----------
it but we just didn't call it what it


---------145:29----------
was I mean I think you're genuinely


---------145:32----------
connecting with a lot of people yeah


---------145:34----------
they come back


---------145:35----------
[Music]


---------145:40----------
okay so I think those are all the


---------145:42----------
questions that sort of relate to you I


---------145:43----------
mean they're all kinds of questions


---------145:44----------
about porn addiction and stuff but I


---------145:45----------
don't think but yeah anyway thanks a lot


---------145:53----------
Lilly no thank you this is really great


---------145:56----------
I'm really happy I got to talk to you


---------145:58----------
yeah I I really enjoyed talking to you


---------146:02----------
and and you know if if you want to talk


---------146:04----------
more practically if you ever want to


---------146:05----------
talk again just you know let us know and


---------146:08----------
then the second thing is Makai a little


---------146:13----------
bit more in terms of guidance in terms


---------146:15----------
of helping you understand how to wring


---------146:17----------
out your sponge and how to absorb good


---------146:19----------
stuff and like actually like you know


---------146:23----------
give you something concrete that you can


---------146:24----------
do but let's start with the meditation


---------146:26----------
type of technique and let me know how


---------146:27----------
that works for you and there's a decent


---------146:29----------
chance that's gonna be very hard to do


---------146:31----------
like cuz you just won't remember so I


---------146:33----------
can problem solve around that too okay


---------146:36----------
hey all right take care thank you thank


---------146:40----------
you


---------146:40----------
actually let me ask you real so do you


---------146:42----------
