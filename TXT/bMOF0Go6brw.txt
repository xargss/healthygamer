---------00:11----------
so today we're going to do something fun and 
something different something i'm really looking  

---------00:14----------
forward to so you know we've been on the david 
pakman show i think about twice now and um you  

---------00:22----------
know really appreciate his dialogue in the way 
that he works and the way he thinks and stuff  

---------00:26----------
like that and so you know the last time we were on 
on david pakman's show we sort of talked a little  

---------00:31----------
bit about you know sometimes he'll he'll say 
that people will kind of disagree with him and  

---------00:35----------
will be pretty vocal and i sort of mentioned to 
him that you know it would be really cool to like  

---------00:40----------
sort of talk to someone in an open-ended 
non-judgmental manner about you know what they  

---------00:46----------
believe and how they came to believe it because 
i find that so much of political discourse right  

---------00:50----------
now is like really just you know plastering the 
other side as backward or idiots or whatever and  

---------00:57----------
one of the things that i really appreciate about 
you know training to be kind of non-judgmental  

---------01:02----------
through you know be training to become a monk 
and sort of accepting people where they're at  

---------01:06----------
and like learning how to listen is all and also 
like learning how to be a good listener through  

---------01:11----------
um you know training as a therapist i think that 
those skills can actually be applied to like you  

---------01:17----------
know non-therapeutic or non-spiritual places and 
one of the goals that we we kind of are focused on  

---------01:23----------
you know here at healthy gamer is just to try to 
understand people right and educate people about  

---------01:28----------
different different perspectives and so a lot of 
times our focus has been on like mental health but  

---------01:33----------
sometimes we'll talk about stuff like you know 
how to efficiently study and things like that  

---------01:37----------
but today we're going to try something a little 
bit different and we're going to hop into a call  

---------01:41----------
with david pakman as well as a long time i don't 
know if i should call him fan of the show but um  

---------01:50----------
you know there's someone who's who disagrees a lot 
with david pakman but i understand calls in a lot  

---------01:54----------
and i think they've got like a good and healthy 
dialogue hopefully and that's jimmy from philly  

---------01:58----------
and so we're going to hop in with them and we're 
just going to talk to jimmy for uh and david for  

---------02:02----------
a little while and try to sort of understand you 
know a little bit about jimmy's experience of the  

---------02:07----------
world and what he believes so i know it's a little 
bit different but i'm really looking forward to it  

---------02:12----------
um and let's get started welcome everyone 
david do you want to go ahead and kick things  

---------02:17----------
off or let me do that yeah just to kind of 
set the the situation here um so basically  

---------02:23----------
i talked to all sorts of people on my show 
at some point jimmy started calling in and we  

---------02:29----------
know jimmy is jimmy from philly and we would he 
would bring to me different ideas and questions  

---------02:36----------
and i found jimmy to be an interesting 
character a sad character in many ways  

---------02:40----------
a concerning character in some ways as well um i 
think our rapport is sort of okay although jimmy  

---------02:48----------
does regularly say you know homophobic things 
transphobic things racist things etc and i  

---------02:54----------
think there's probably a lot to dig into there 
about the the sort of origins or oranges of that  

---------03:00----------
um a couple things i'll mention about you 
know our dialogue with with jimmy um jimmy  

---------03:05----------
has talked to me about his um problems with 
alcohol and you guys can probably see he's  

---------03:10----------
got some bottles there over his right shoulder and 
that's something i've talked to jimmy about before  

---------03:15----------
um jimmy has talked about how he has a daughter 
but at least at one point wasn't allowed to see  

---------03:22----------
her because of some physical violence that jimmy 
was at least i'll say he was accused of and we'll  

---------03:28----------
maybe leave it to jimmy to tell us more about the 
specifics of that um jimmy was also arrested not  

---------03:34----------
long ago because of as i understand it chasing 
a car with four black teenagers down the street  

---------03:42----------
while intoxicated and that led to a sort of legal 
situation as well for jimmy and that's kind of the  

---------03:50----------
jimmy that i that i know big picture and every 
once in a while jimmy will say something that's  

---------03:57----------
sort of open and he seems open to considering 
other ideas etc but very quickly he'll go back  

---------04:04----------
into the transphobia the homophobia the racism 
um and uh and that that's kind of that's jimmy  

---------04:12----------
as far as my relationship with him which has 
been through the internet and through my show

---------04:20----------
quite the introduction so i want to just clarify 
a couple things so i noticed um you know david  

---------04:26----------
mentioned like alcohol use and things like that 
so just to clarify and make sure we're all on  

---------04:30----------
the same page jimmy i am a psychiatrist but i and 
my understanding of this conversation is that you  

---------04:37----------
know i'm not here because david's here too we're 
gonna just three people having a conversation i  

---------04:42----------
wanted to just make sure that are you under the 
impression that i'm your medical doctor or that  

---------04:46----------
i'm not going to diagnose you with anything yeah 
treat you for anything okay so we're just going to  

---------04:51----------
have a conversation and and try to understand 
each other better so the goal of what we do  

---------04:56----------
um the reason i stream is just so that we 
can try to understand people better and  

---------05:01----------
share that understanding with everyone who's 
watching um are you kind of cool with that yes  

---------05:07----------
um just so you understand you know if after the 
call if you do sort of decide that you do want  

---------05:12----------
mental health support or treatment or things like 
that you're welcome to kind of message us and we  

---------05:16----------
can kind of provide you with resources we do that 
for every uh you know guest that that comes on um  

---------05:22----------
it you know but that's kind of at your request 
we're not going to push anything on you or  

---------05:26----------
recommend anything or anything like that it's 
just sometimes fine okay um so jimmy is it okay  

---------05:33----------
if i uh kind of ask you i mean do you want to 
share a little bit like do you want to offer an  

---------05:36----------
introduction or or i've got a couple yeah i mean 
yeah so first of all like how did it feel to hear  

---------05:44----------
david's kind of like litany of how he introduced 
you well he's gotten a little bit wrong actually  

---------05:52----------
okay can you when i did the call with him last 
year um i clearly said that they were four  

---------05:59----------
black 20-somethings not teenagers um this didn't 
occur in philadelphia it occurred in the suburb  

---------06:07----------
of philadelphia um let's see what else um i was 
arrested for public drunkenness but i beat the  

---------06:15----------
case they had a video of me going after her car 
it doesn't prove that i was drunk they the rest  

---------06:22----------
of me because i was off my the video showed them 
that i was off the property and they said i was  

---------06:27----------
publicly drunk the video showed that i was 
angry not that i was drunk i was drunk but  

---------06:35----------
i i was very i i wasn't that drunk i was they 
were ready to let me go at the police station  

---------06:41----------
i said the m were in the back of the police 
car so they wouldn't let me go sure so what  

---------06:46----------
i'm kind of hearing is that like you didn't get a 
fair rap from david well doc here's what happened  

---------06:52----------
okay so i'm a trump supporter i have signs on my 
lawn they continued to get stolen right so i sat  

---------06:58----------
out there and was guarding them and i'm drinking a 
little bit while i'm out there four black men bomb  

---------07:03----------
rushed the lawn they take signs real quick and 
they ride around the clock torning me three times  

---------07:11----------
[ __ ] whitey [ __ ] trump the second time 
they did it around the house i got a knife  

---------07:17----------
third time they got caught at the light i ran 
after the car i was a little tipsy i stopped to  

---------07:23----------
stab the top of the tire i should have stabbed the 
sidewall but the knife just disintegrated in my  

---------07:28----------
hand and uh they got out of the car laughing then 
chased me back to the house and something that we  

---------07:34----------
took a video of me doing this and uh they gave it 
to the cops and the cops locked me up for public  

---------07:41----------
talking this but i beat the case because they 
never showed up they never they didn't have a case  

---------07:46----------
so yeah so i i mean thanks for sharing that 
jimmy i appreciate it but what i'm kind of  

---------07:51----------
curious about is like when you have kind of 
your side of the story and like i was frankly  

---------07:56----------
kind of shocked i mean david is it i mean is 
it okay if i be critical of you for a second  

---------08:01----------
please i wouldn't i would love it so like here 
he is introducing you and like he starts off with  

---------08:07----------
like bottles in the back and like got arrested for 
this and like you know it's kind of a weird way

---------08:16----------
yeah i mean how does that feel 
to be i mean like because it's  

---------08:19----------
almost like he's sharing like the most 
negative or provocative things about you  

---------08:25----------
well david's a propagandist what can 
i tell you i mean he's good at it yeah  

---------08:29----------
yeah so how does that how does that make you kind 
of feel to be i was laughing the entire time i  

---------08:35----------
noticed that yeah that's what i was kind of asking 
right because and so so i don't get offended easy  

---------08:41----------
doc if that's what you're getting at i i really 
don't people can say what they want i really don't  

---------08:45----------
care yeah so okay definitely a happy person yeah 
so now see what david wants to make hey out of in  

---------08:52----------
this situation is basically that i'm crazy for 
going after the car well i had two choices doc  

---------08:59----------
how many men are going to sit there when four 
men come on to their lawn take their property  

---------09:04----------
i don't give a [ __ ] what it was took for my 
trump signs then they have to to marry me to  

---------09:10----------
drive around the neighborhood three times yelling 
racial appetites at me pointing me with the signs  

---------09:16----------
out the window and i'm just supposed to sit there 
like a little soy boy i don't think so that's not  

---------09:22----------
gonna happen that's not the type of person i am i 
am going to do something about it right or wrong  

---------09:27----------
i'm going to jail i don't give a [ __ ] you do 
something like that to me you are you're going  

---------09:33----------
to get held responsible in some kind of way 
and you know i think the whole thing's funny  

---------09:38----------
the whole thing's funny you know so jimmy you kind 
of said that's not the kind of person i am can you  

---------09:43----------
help me understand what kind of person you are 
well apparently david would have sat on the wall  

---------09:47----------
and watched these morons ride around and taunt him 
david thought it was crazy for me to go after them  

---------09:55----------
yeah so jimmy i'm gonna just i may do something 
a little bit unusual i may sort of ask a question  

---------09:59----------
again so like when i ask you like you said that's 
not the kind of person i am and you say well david  

---------10:04----------
would have done this like i'm not interested 
in what kind of person david has destroyed  

---------10:09----------
like in other words i had two choices right 
i was either to call the police or do nothing  

---------10:16----------
but but david was trying to make me sound 
crazy that and i actually took action and  

---------10:20----------
went after these people that just stole 
from me and do you [ __ ] i'm saying i'm  

---------10:24----------
not the kind of person that's going to sit 
there and watch something like that yeah  

---------10:31----------
yeah you know i i i get that uh so i'm i'm 
do you oftentimes so what i'm hearing is  

---------10:37----------
that like you know a lot of people in your 
situation kind of may lay down and take it  

---------10:41----------
but you're not going to lay down and take it why 
yeah but this was basically a thing david put out  

---------10:47----------
there you know like i was nuts for taking action i 
was not crazy not just the type of person i am and  

---------10:53----------
i wouldn't blame a guy for not doing nothing 
sure so i mean but yeah yeah and and do you  

---------11:00----------
find that oftentimes um you know people try 
to like paint you as crazy by sort of sharing  

---------11:05----------
stories like this or or things like that well i 
am a little nuts doc i have no problem with that  

---------11:11----------
what does that mean i do think that most 
people wouldn't do i'm very aware of that  

---------11:16----------
that is my personality that's how i am can you 
help me understand that a little bit like what  

---------11:21----------
what do you do that other people wouldn't 
like help me understand like who are you bro  

---------11:26----------
uh gee i don't know uh i i like to have 
fun okay um i see everything is funny um  

---------11:36----------
i make fun of everybody and everyone including 
myself okay see david see if i make fun of like a  

---------11:42----------
homosexual or transsexual let's face it 
the man in the dress is the funniest thing  

---------11:48----------
since the dawn of time all right i'm sorry i make 
fun of these folks but that doesn't mean that i  

---------11:53----------
hate them if these people want to be accepted as 
normal then they better be ready to take jokes  

---------11:59----------
you understand yes because if if you're making 
them some sacred cow which is what david does  

---------12:06----------
and then that that's that's just they're not 
special people okay i have nothing against  

---------12:12----------
them but i think when [ __ ] is funny it's funny 
and i'm gonna point it out sure so what i'm kind  

---------12:17----------
of hearing is the way that you you kind of you 
know treat them in a sense fairly right because  

---------12:22----------
everyone gets made fun of i don't treat them 
anywhere i make fun of them sure yeah big deal  

---------12:29----------
they can't handle that and you're wearing the 
dress trying to look if you look like steve i'm  

---------12:34----------
not calling you susie okay i'm just not doing it 
i'm not doing it i think in new york a landlord or  

---------12:40----------
an employer is fined well over a hundred thousand 
dollars if they don't refer to these people  

---------12:45----------
as a certain pronoun it could be they zur zay 
what that's insanity i'm not going to accept  

---------12:52----------
your delusion go ahead and be deluded you have the 
freedom to do it but you're not going to force me  

---------12:57----------
to address you as a woman when you're clearly 
a man it's it's that simple this is com this  

---------13:04----------
is logic it's science biology yeah and and so i'm 
a little bit curious jimmy when when you sort of  

---------13:11----------
you know when there's a group of people that 
are defying science and logic and biology like  

---------13:17----------
how does that because you seem to get kind of 
passionate there as you were talking about it  

---------13:21----------
how does that kind of affect you it pisses 
me off and what pisses you off about it  

---------13:29----------
what pisses me off you're trying to get me to 
accept your delusion you have the right to be  

---------13:34----------
delusional but you ain't making me look if you 
look like steve i'm not calling you susie that  

---------13:39----------
that sums it up my whole philosophy on the issue 
sure i got no problem with gay people i got no  

---------13:44----------
problem with trans people i i think it's funny as 
hell i i i think it's abso [ __ ] lutely hilarious  

---------13:52----------
and i mocked them but that doesn't mean i hate 
them that doesn't mean if if i if look if i  

---------13:58----------
were the grand pooh bar would i stop it no i think 
it's hilarious it's a [ __ ] show i mean you know

---------14:05----------
i just think it's funny and can you 
help me understand this may sound like  

---------14:10----------
a weird question okay but can you help me 
understand what you think is funny about it

---------14:18----------
a man in a dress that says it all okay my name's 
linda and i got a deep voice i mean come on man  

---------14:27----------
this [ __ ] is funny okay okay i hear what you're 
saying so i i think part of the problem with you  

---------14:35----------
know dissecting humor is this the moment you 
dissect it it kind of falls apart right um so  

---------14:43----------
part of it is the commies are destroying 
comedy that's what it really is  

---------14:48----------
okay everybody wants to get you don't have the 
right not to be offended you don't people can make  

---------14:55----------
fun of you it doesn't make them hateful people 
okay i'm not a hateful person not a racist either  

---------15:02----------
how do you know whether someone is is you know 
when someone mocks you how do you know whether  

---------15:08----------
that person is hateful or not hateful you 
don't but this is the way the left paints  

---------15:14----------
comedy anymore you can't make fun of the homos 
you can't make fun of the [ __ ] you know that i  

---------15:20----------
mean i mean look at youtube they've got a library 
of things you can't talk about what why not okay  

---------15:30----------
i hear what you're saying so what i'm also 
hearing that you know that they're they're kind of  

---------15:35----------
anti-science in a sense um and that that they're 
also they can't become a woman this is impossible  

---------15:44----------
i don't care if they cut their dick off don't 
cut that i don't care they cannot become a  

---------15:49----------
woman when they can change dna maybe you got an 
argument but these people cannot become women  

---------15:55----------
and it's just impossible so jimmy let me let me 
kind of ask you so you were kind of saying when  

---------16:01----------
someone mocks someone else you know you can't tell 
whether there's hatred or not hatred right like if  

---------16:09----------
i mock you if i make fun of you you know but look 
if you're if you're known as a person to do that  

---------16:17----------
if you're known as a per like i used to do 
stand-up comedy people that know me know  

---------16:22----------
you know i mean it's not my fault that you're 
a snowflake and you can't handle a joke  

---------16:27----------
yeah i mean that's not if you want to get offended 
and go ahead and get offended i'm going to laugh  

---------16:32----------
even harder okay so so now what i'm kind of 
hearing you say is that if they know you're  

---------16:37----------
a comedian then it's okay to make you know no it's 
always okay to make fun of people why not humor is  

---------16:44----------
a spiritual principle it actually brings people 
together but the left is trying to destroy it  

---------16:51----------
okay um so jimmy is it okay if i ask you a little 
bit about it seems like you have a lot of really  

---------16:57----------
strong beliefs about what's going on is that 
fair to say yeah so is it i'm so curious can  

---------17:03----------
you help me understand like how you came to these 
opinions and how you came to believe these things  

---------17:09----------
because i believe my ears and my eyes when i see 
a man in the dress i almost fall the [ __ ] down  

---------17:15----------
i'm skipping down the street when i see this [ __ 
] like oh my god did you just see what okay i have  

---------17:22----------
a certain amount of sympathy for these people 
but the solution isn't to follow their delusion  

---------17:29----------
it's not dress up play barbie i don't give 
a [ __ ] but when you're trying it's coming  

---------17:34----------
down the plank where they're gonna i'm 
gonna be forced to address these people

---------17:40----------
whatever they [ __ ] want like what i'm i'm 
gonna point something out to you so there have  

---------17:43----------
been like three or four questions and i'm 
curious you know what you think about that  

---------17:47----------
that i've asked you about you and your answer 
seems to be doesn't involve you so i'll ask you  

---------17:54----------
like how did you come to believe these things 
and you kind of started out with like saying  

---------17:58----------
i believe i told you i believe my eyes and my ears 
yeah this is how my brain works everything's funny  

---------18:05----------
okay everything's funny like i think 
in cartoons sometimes i don't know why  

---------18:10----------
so jimmy can you help me understand 
a little bit about where you grow  

---------18:13----------
grew up can i ask you some questions about 
your past yeah yeah i grew up in philly  

---------18:17----------
okay what was growing up like for you what 
was what what was growing up i was very happy  

---------18:26----------
i used to be so happy i used to skip down 
the streets and of course the kids in philly  

---------18:31----------
broke my balls until i stopped doing it 
you know you know the kids on the corner  

---------18:36----------
i would skip i was literally that happy and i have 
a lot of energy too so kids would make fun of me  

---------18:42----------
but you know i mean that's philly for you you know 
you can't do a goddamn thing without getting your  

---------18:48----------
balls busted on the corner you know it's like 
that's what happens in philly i don't know dr k  

---------18:53----------
i don't want to interrupt at such a key moment but 
i do want to just say because i i'm not sure how  

---------18:59----------
familiar your audience maybe is either with me or 
with jimmy but this is not staged and i think it's  

---------19:05----------
important that we just mention that none of this 
is staged first for your i'm being serious here  

---------19:10----------
this is not an act of any kind we're just having 
a real conversation here yeah i i didn't think it  

---------19:16----------
was changed no no no i know you don't think 
i know i know you know it wasn't stage but  

---------19:20----------
just for people some people in your audience 
think this has to be staged this is not staged  

---------19:25----------
this is not okay sure so so jimmy let me ask 
you so apparently i'm stuck in the snowflakes

---------19:31----------
yeah

---------19:34----------
um so jimmy so it sounds like when you 
were growing up you used to like skip  

---------19:39----------
and and you said people would bust your balls 
for that what does that mean can you help me  

---------19:43----------
understand what that means well i mean i was so 
happy that i literally skipped down the street  

---------19:49----------
as a child and the kids would make fun of me it 
wasn't that big of a deal i just stopped skipping  

---------19:55----------
down the street i was still happier than the [ __ 
] but you know i stopped skipping down the street  

---------20:00----------
that's all yeah and i have kind of a 
weird question like so do you think that  

---------20:06----------
i mean how did you feel before you know 
when you were skipping down the street  

---------20:10----------
and people would start making fun of you 
do you remember how you felt as a kid  

---------20:14----------
i didn't like it but that's that's what happens 
when you grow up in philadelphia everybody knows  

---------20:21----------
what you're doing they see you you hang on the 
corner you know you got the girls you got the guys  

---------20:27----------
you know sure so break your blows people 
break your butt you know i'm hearing that  

---------20:33----------
people would make fun of you and and that 
you sort of didn't like it but that's life  

---------20:38----------
pretty much yeah and i'm kind of curious like 
you know this is going to sound kind of weird but  

---------20:46----------
do you think as a kid you would have 
preferred it if they didn't make fun of you  

---------20:52----------
no because it taught me how to uh come back 
with snappy witty responses to uh insults and  

---------20:58----------
[ __ ] i see so it's you gotta be on your guard 
in philly you know you're hanging on the corner  

---------21:04----------
you know you got to be able to hold your own 
you know sure so i'm hearing that it was kind  

---------21:08----------
of like you kind of grew up right so the school 
of hard knocks like it's sort of big streets  

---------21:15----------
i wasn't in some really bad neighborhood 
i grew up in roxbury it's almost like the  

---------21:19----------
suburbs but i hung all over philadelphia i 
hung in some tough neighborhoods i was in a  

---------21:25----------
boys home when i was a child and uh i would hang 
out with the kids in their neighborhoods because  

---------21:31----------
it didn't sound west philly well i've been all 
over philadelphia i used to call me the rabbit  

---------21:38----------
what does that mean you were in a boy's 
home yeah my mom put me in a it's called  

---------21:43----------
saint francis vocational school and that 
you didn't have to be adjudicated but  

---------21:51----------
i was doing a lot of stupid [ 
__ ] i had gotten into drugs  

---------21:54----------
i had committed some crimes my mother didn't know 
what to do with me she put me in this boy's home  

---------21:59----------
she thought she was helping me believe me i 
had a [ __ ] ball there i didn't want to leave  

---------22:06----------
but you know you were allowed out in the community 
you weren't you know i had friends i had you know  

---------22:11----------
we went went to concerts like 50 of us like i 
went to school in the area i mean i pretty much  

---------22:18----------
ah doc i have fun i i literally have fun 
everywhere i go like i have fun in jail so  

---------22:25----------
you know i mean like i always my number one goal 
is to have fun okay so can i ask you uh jimmy  

---------22:33----------
so how old were you when you got put into the 
vocational school 13. and do you remember how you  

---------22:40----------
felt when your mom kind of put you in there well 
i i i felt abandoned was very angry with my mother  

---------22:47----------
um i remember her crying kissing me and my dad 
going something like fly right or some [ __ ] you  

---------22:56----------
know and and but uh that wore off very quickly 
but like the con artist i was at that age i kept  

---------23:05----------
trying to let my mother think kind 
of let her letting her feel guilty  

---------23:11----------
but within days like i was having a very 
good time there these were all kids my age  

---------23:15----------
like they put you on different divisions and 
uh there were some really cool characters you  

---------23:21----------
know what i mean like i liked a lot of these guys 
they had a pool table they had a ping pong table  

---------23:25----------
you know i mean i had fun there i you know i did 
i got sent to another place called saint gabes  

---------23:32----------
that was a [ __ ] had the christian brothers ran 
that you had to stay in line for a punishment  

---------23:38----------
stand in line means you stand and face the wall 
for hours and of course i was always online  

---------23:46----------
so so what what why did you get sent to 
saint gabes um the court sent me there i um  

---------23:54----------
and with the insistence of my mother my 
mother thought that these places would help me  

---------23:59----------
she didn't know what to do with me what was 
wrong what did you need help for well i was doing  

---------24:04----------
drugs i was committing crimes she thought 
i was going to die early so she told me  

---------24:11----------
she used to come to court and the judges were 
going to let me go and she would i want him  

---------24:14----------
placed in and they would listen to her and i 
would get real pissed off for her now this was  

---------24:18----------
as a child as an older man now i understand what 
my mother was doing you understand i agree with  

---------24:25----------
her you know she just she just placed faith in 
agencies that i don't know probably made me worse  

---------24:33----------
but you know as a child i [ __ ] hated her 
so i'm i'm kind of what you're saying on the  

---------24:40----------
one hand makes a lot of sense so can i just 
kind of repeat back what i've heard so far  

---------24:45----------
so you kind of grew up in philly right like not 
like super bad situations sort of suburbs but you  

---------24:50----------
kind of hung out with some kids went to some parts 
of town where you got kind of got made fun of  

---------24:54----------
it sounds like you were sort of like a 
happy-go-lucky kid and yeah i've been described  

---------24:59----------
as exactly that yeah and and and you know the kids 
on the street like they you know they kind of got  

---------25:06----------
you to stop being so carefree pretty quickly no i 
just stopped skipping and started being a comedian  

---------25:13----------
i just started being a comedian you know they 
were calling me gay and this and that you know  

---------25:18----------
i mean it's just it just teaches you to toughen 
up that's all i mean you know you're living in  

---------25:24----------
philly you're on the corner you can't be a [ 
__ ] sure you can't be skipping down the street  

---------25:29----------
let's put it that way and then somehow you kind of 
started getting into trouble with like drugs and  

---------25:34----------
and some criminal activity and stuff yeah and 
then your mom kind of shipped you off to one place  

---------25:40----------
and then she kind of shipped you off 
like and it sounded like you kind of  

---------25:43----------
did what you were supposed to do right so and 
then well see here's the first thing they did  

---------25:48----------
they took me to the valley forge military academy 
right they were gonna put me in there right  

---------25:53----------
and there was no [ __ ] way i was going to be a 
10 soldier right so this the the guy that runs a  

---------26:00----------
joint he said i'm going to talk to him privately 
and he pulls me in a room and he says listen  

---------26:05----------
if you don't want to come here we're not going 
to make you come here he's like i don't care  

---------26:10----------
what your parents say he said do you want to 
come here i said absolutely not he said okay  

---------26:16----------
he had a little consultation with my mom and 
dad we walked away how did you feel about that  

---------26:22----------
great what what yeah i mean so i'm gonna ask 
you kind of a weird question do you have a  

---------26:29----------
sense of why you felt great there because 
i didn't want to be a little cadet you mean

---------26:41----------
march around wake up at five o'clock [ 
__ ] that i was 13 what the [ __ ] i see  

---------26:49----------
and then how did it feel when when you know the 
judge was ready to let you come home and your  

---------26:52----------
mom was like uh oh we gotta st gabes when i was 
a child that really pissed me the [ __ ] off what  

---------26:59----------
do you think about that i'm watching i'm watching 
because she wouldn't take me back in other words i  

---------27:04----------
got angry with her and i would be in the cell with 
these kids from kensington where kenston's like  

---------27:10----------
a real bad sex in philadelphia it's you know it's 
where the men are men and so are the women i mean  

---------27:15----------
it's it's crazy that it's gotten even crazier but 
these kids would do all kind of [ __ ] like way  

---------27:20----------
worse [ __ ] than me and their mothers and fathers 
would pick them up mine wouldn't you know and it i  

---------27:26----------
mean as as young as that that that was my thinking 
i i couldn't stand her i [ __ ] hated her and my  

---------27:33----------
father behind her back would say you know if it 
was up to me this wouldn't happen you know so he  

---------27:38----------
pissed me off too because i thought he was a [ __ 
] snowflake you know when i got older i realized  

---------27:43----------
my mother was trying to help me that's all i 
was an [ __ ] i was a kid i mean i was immature

---------27:53----------
can i think for a second jimmy 
what's that can i think for a second  

---------27:58----------
you don't need my permission to think

---------28:08----------
so you know jimmy what i'm 
kind of hearing is that you  

---------28:10----------
have every reason to be a snowflake but 
you'll be damned if you're a snowflake

---------28:19----------
you get more respect if you're not a snowflake see 
but the way the left paints people now soyboy is  

---------28:26----------
the way to go the real me yeah yeah so i i think 
that's exactly what i'm saying so i'm what i'm  

---------28:33----------
saying is that like you know the story that you're 
sharing makes you if you look at like if the check  

---------28:40----------
boxes of being a snowflake like getting abandoned 
by your mom getting sent to a military academy  

---------28:47----------
getting sent to a vocational school getting sent 
to a nut like you're be you know doing what you're  

---------28:51----------
graduating from there or whatever and then you 
know your mom is like like the judge is about  

---------28:57----------
to send you home your mom's like i can't handle it 
getting sent back to another place having your dad  

---------29:03----------
huh i hated her for that yeah and so 
like if we think about like you know  

---------29:07----------
when you use the word snowflake what i sort of 
think of is like a victim complex right is that  

---------29:12----------
fair yeah and so when i'm thinking it like when i 
hear this story bro like it sounds like you know  

---------29:17----------
if any wasn't one is entitled to call themselves 
a victim it's you but you're not gonna do that  

---------29:25----------
well what no i don't i'm not a victim 
of of of anything i'm i'm i'm just  

---------29:33----------
a person that's shaped by their experiences i you 
know i don't see myself as any kind of victim no  

---------29:39----------
i i get i get that you don't see yourself 
as like that's sort of what i'm saying but  

---------29:42----------
if you like if you think about it right 
so if you had like you know let's say a  

---------29:46----------
liberal snowflake who had your background do you 
think they would think of themselves as a victim  

---------29:52----------
i i i don't know interesting okay i couldn't 
you know i can only speak for myself i mean  

---------29:58----------
you know i don't know is it i mean i was a i was 
a liberal till my brother put me hip to what the  

---------30:03----------
corporate media does it all started with trayvon 
martin like what a bunch of [ __ ] that was  

---------30:08----------
and then michael brown what a bunch of [ __ ] 
that was and you got to hear about racism like  

---------30:12----------
like nothing has went forward between the races 
like like it it's it's systemic racism which  

---------30:18----------
means everything's racist right sick and tired of 
hearing this [ __ ] and my brother proved to me  

---------30:23----------
i mean nbc doctored the 9-1-1 call that zimmerman 
made that's clear they admitted it they fired two  

---------30:30----------
underlings but guess what this is how the news 
works and david knows this once you get someone  

---------30:35----------
to make an emotional judgment a nuclear bomb 
of truth isn't going to make that person change  

---------30:40----------
their opinion very few people will well because 
they don't want to admit they were duped and  

---------30:46----------
this is how the news works and this is how they 
brainwash people you know it's just it's sickening

---------30:55----------
that's kind of interesting so let me 
just make sure i heard you correctly  

---------30:59----------
so once someone makes an emotional judgment no 
amount of truth is going to change their mind  

---------31:06----------
for the most part the media that's what the media 
does sure so heard some hyperbolic [ __ ] report  

---------31:13----------
an absolute lie and then the truth comes 
out a few days later and people already  

---------31:17----------
made a judgment on it for the most part human 
beings are not going to go back on the initial  

---------31:23----------
emotion emotional judgment that they made that's 
just you being human yeah so people radioplasia  

---------31:32----------
do you think people who make emotional judgments 
are aware that they make emotional judgments

---------31:39----------
sure why wouldn't they be interesting you see 
somebody emotionally you know they they know that

---------31:48----------
interesting so so you because i would actually 
say like the opposite like i would say that you  

---------31:53----------
know once what what emotions tend to do is cloud 
your judgment and most people who make emotional  

---------31:58----------
decisions believe they're behaving rationally 
and that the more emotional you become the more  

---------32:04----------
rational you think you are what do you think 
about that maybe not in all circumstances i mean  

---------32:11----------
i don't know how to you know

---------32:17----------
i don't know okay it's just the way i am it's 
sure i don't like being lied to i don't like  

---------32:23----------
being gaslighted and they're doing it constantly 
the media politicians you're being lied to all the  

---------32:30----------
time everything's a grift everything is a grift 
everything jimmy a couple things so so the second  

---------32:37----------
thing is uh you know so i'm sort of hearing like 
do you think it's possible for you to be a victim

---------32:46----------
that's wow that's

---------32:50----------
i guess anybody can be a victim yeah why not what 
what would that mean to you if you were a victim

---------33:00----------
uh i wouldn't know because i don't behave like a 
victim if somebody wrongs me i get back at them  

---------33:10----------
you know i mean i i find a way to get back to 
them and i generally make it funny and spectacular  

---------33:15----------
okay and this is what i do and what 
what would it what would it feel  

---------33:20----------
like to not get back at them horrible 
in what way help me understand that

---------33:30----------
it's just like an unpaid debt you know the 
best way i could describe it like i got  

---------33:36----------
to get back at you i mean i'm not saying be 
violent but justice you're disrespecting me  

---------33:42----------
i gotta top it yeah so what do you think 
about stuff like forgiveness and compassion  

---------33:49----------
uh well you know i was in a.a for a while and 
and they taught me about forgiveness right  

---------33:55----------
but then i started um investigating different 
religions and i heard this rabbi on the tv say  

---------34:05----------
he said we believe in forgiveness too 
but not like the christians and he said  

---------34:10----------
we believe you got to atone for something before 
we forgive you that i agree with the christians  

---------34:15----------
want you to just forgive a [ __ ] for just to 
forgive them no forgiveness should not come easy  

---------34:23----------
now if you did somebody wrong and you're 
looking to make amends you gotta atone for that  

---------34:28----------
[ __ ] before i forgive you i think that's more 
reasonable now i'm an atheist but you know i do  

---------34:34----------
some of the religions basically it's a philosophy 
right religion some of them come up with some  

---------34:38----------
pretty good [ __ ] i mean i see no problem with 
treat others as you should treat yourself you know  

---------34:44----------
what i mean i i think that's a good thing you 
know i just don't believe there's a god i mean  

---------34:48----------
it's just ridiculous but yeah they do come up with 
some good [ __ ] for human relations so you know  

---------34:54----------
and i'm gonna ask you kind of personal question 
you're okay totally fine to not answer it if you  

---------35:00----------
don't want to i'll answer anything have 
you oh you haven't heard my question yet  

---------35:07----------
but um have you forgiven your mom oh yeah yeah 
help me understand how you did that well i just  

---------35:17----------
grew up and realized that look my mother 
was manic depressive she had her own issues  

---------35:21----------
she was in psychiatric hospital twice six 
months right the woman was a little [ __ ] up  

---------35:28----------
you know and and she wanted to help me 
there's no doubt about it i remember  

---------35:33----------
my aunt from scotland said she my aunt i 
said something derogatory about my mother  

---------35:39----------
and she sat me down she said jimmy do you realize 
you're the golden boy i said what do you mean she  

---------35:44----------
said well there's a problem with your eyes she 
wished you right off to the doctor every time  

---------35:48----------
you were sick she brought you the heart she 
said that woman wasn't trying to hurt you she  

---------35:53----------
had her own problems and she went with what she 
thought would help you and apparently it didn't  

---------35:59----------
yeah yeah i i think i wish they would have 
put a [ __ ] guitar in my hand or something  

---------36:04----------
i mean i was a very happy-go-lucky energetic 
child but you know they tried to make me into  

---------36:10----------
being hyperactive they got me taking ritalin they 
had me in the crazy kids school you know all this  

---------36:16----------
[ __ ] stupid [ __ ] you know they should 
have just gave me something to keep me busy  

---------36:20----------
like if computers were around then you know i 
think i would have got into that if streaming  

---------36:26----------
was around then i think you would have become 
a stranger in the early 70s i don't think so  

---------36:33----------
yeah so jimmy that's so interesting so i'm i'm 
kind of hearing so what i'm hearing is that your  

---------36:37----------
mom really doesn't have anything to atone for 
no she was look she did her best she told me  

---------36:44----------
she said jimmy there's no book on how to raise 
children i make mistakes you know so you know my  

---------36:52----------
mother loved me she was a little nuts i mean she's 
smack depressing i mean you know i mean you know  

---------36:59----------
but i i've no the rest of my family don't forgive 
her they're they're kind of and they're kind of um

---------37:06----------
surprised that i take the tact that 
i take my sister said to me one time  

---------37:11----------
she put you in a cage like my sister was 
threatening to put her in a home right  

---------37:15----------
my mother was definitely afraid of this and i got 
real pissed off my sister i said look she calls me  

---------37:20----------
crying one more time i'm gonna [ __ ] you up you 
know what i mean like i'm tired of this [ __ ] she  

---------37:24----------
wanted to die in her own home the woman had the 
right to do that there was nothing wrong with her  

---------37:29----------
she fell one time big [ __ ] deal my sister was 
like literally terrifying her and i stuck up for  

---------37:35----------
her my sister was shocked she said well she put 
you in the cage i'm like she put me in the cage  

---------37:40----------
for a [ __ ] reason she's trying to [ __ ] help me 
you ain't trying to help this woman i mean i don't  

---------37:45----------
like that [ __ ] and she stopped hmm you know [ __ 
] that [ __ ] you ain't gonna [ __ ] with my mom  

---------37:53----------
mother wasn't perfect she tried to do the best 
she could with me guess what you know what she  

---------37:59----------
told me until you're 18 i'm gonna keep 
your little ass alive and you're gonna go  

---------38:04----------
where the [ __ ] i want you to go and when 
you're 18 if you die it's on you hey it worked  

---------38:11----------
i'm 58 right right so mom wasn't that crazy you 
understand yeah so what i'm hearing from you um  

---------38:20----------
jimmy is that despite you know being very upset 
with your mom when you were growing up what i'm  

---------38:25----------
really hearing is that you kind of really respect 
her you understand her you sort of understand that  

---------38:30----------
she kind of did the best that she could given 
the circumstances she had her own struggles and  

---------38:34----------
you kind of don't blame her for that sure that 
that's what a mature person does it does i mean  

---------38:40----------
that's that's the only way to look at it what am 
i going to still be angry at this woman she's dead  

---------38:45----------
the woman's dead some people 
continue to say angry right yeah

---------38:52----------
yeah there's no point in it 
there's no no percentage of it so  

---------38:58----------
um jimmy i'm kind of curious you said 
you kind of got into drugs and and kind  

---------39:01----------
of criminal activity and stuff as a kid like 
what's your understanding of how that happened  

---------39:06----------
well i mean i started committing crimes to get 
money for drugs okay but and i don't want to  

---------39:12----------
blame it on drugs i mean i did it i owned it 
but had it not been for drugs i wouldn't have  

---------39:17----------
committed to crimes so i certainly committed to 
crimes how do you understand you know drug like is  

---------39:27----------
like so like some people think of uh you know 
substance use is an addiction is a disease is an  

---------39:32----------
illness uh what do you think about it the whole 
disease thing was a bunch of [ __ ] with the  

---------39:37----------
insurance companies and i'm very well reversed on 
all that [ __ ] on a.a the history of it and all  

---------39:43----------
um that's just a word that's all it is it's [ 
__ ] whether or not it's a disease who cares  

---------39:51----------
you know like i went to a free a helped me 
tremendously i went through the 12 steps  

---------39:55----------
in two weeks you know people said oh that's 
crazy well if you study the history of aaa  

---------40:01----------
he did it in days and that's a fact but it did 
shake like like i had a therapist explain me  

---------40:06----------
therapy's supposed to kind of shake you up and 
then you settled down differently right that  

---------40:11----------
was the best description i've ever heard that's 
something that's really exciting it got me to  

---------40:16----------
it got me to take a look at things especially 
my mother and i remember when i went to make  

---------40:21----------
amends to my mother i went to her grave 
and i cried like a baby and i never  

---------40:29----------
looked ill of my mother ever again and i was 38 
years old so i was hating on my mother when i  

---------40:34----------
was 38 years old and i was a damn fool but you 
know i did a fourth step i did a fifth step i'm  

---------40:41----------
running around making amends you know what i 
mean got my car and just started making amends  

---------40:46----------
the man just to fix or repair something to 
the best of your ability and that's what i did  

---------40:51----------
because of these actions see a lot of these 
people they're just told to go to meetings  

---------40:56----------
and listen to other people's sob stories i'm 
sorry it doesn't work it doesn't work you can't  

---------41:01----------
think your way out of bad thinking you have 
to act your way into better thinking and the  

---------41:06----------
actions that i took to the 12 steps helped me even 
today to be more honest to not be deceitful to  

---------41:12----------
not that not that i wasn't an honest person but 
you know but you know to get a real [ __ ] view  

---------41:19----------
of what's really going on rather than that dumb [ 
__ ] that was running around in my head hating on  

---------41:24----------
my mother hating the world thinking the world of 
me a living it doesn't life ain't fair it's not  

---------41:31----------
it's how you react to it and it really helped 
me i mean and then i started to become a  

---------41:36----------
sponsor which was the best thing ever because 
when you're helping somebody else you ain't  

---------41:40----------
thinking about yourself right that was my whole 
problem i thought about my [ __ ] self too much  

---------41:45----------
i was self-centered selfish and helping 
other people really i really enjoy doing that

---------41:53----------
um jimmy i'm just going to kind of give david a 
chance to kind of uh chime in for a second and you  

---------42:01----------
know just because i noticed he's been listening 
thoughtfully and maybe taking notes dave did you  

---------42:05----------
want to add anything or ask any questions or kind 
of share any thoughts no i mean i think you know  

---------42:10----------
one of the interesting things from a complete 
lay person's perspective is that it's i didn't  

---------42:16----------
know the background of jimmy until today but it's 
exactly what i imagined it might be that gets him  

---------42:26----------
to where he is today at 58 in the sense of i do 
see jimmy as a victim myself and it's not about  

---------42:33----------
whether he has to quote behave like one but i i 
i you know in hearing about the situation that he  

---------42:40----------
grew up in it makes a lot of sense to me that 
he kind of behaves in the boisterous way and  

---------42:46----------
finds this need to always uh have this opposite 
reaction to what he's experiencing and he doesn't  

---------42:53----------
feel right unless he does that that it's like 
an unpaid debt i mean it's other viewers of mine  

---------42:59----------
have told me similar stories about how they got to 
where they are in their 30s 40s 50s and so it just  

---------43:05----------
it it makes a lot of sense everything i'm hearing 
is putting a lot of pieces into into place so

---------43:16----------
i know you've got you want to respond to that i 
said okay if i follow up with david a little bit  

---------43:20----------
yeah and okay so david when you said this is you 
know the picture that we're kind of uncovering is  

---------43:25----------
exactly in a sense what you're not surprised to 
hear help me understand like what do you mean  

---------43:30----------
by that why aren't you surprised to hear this 
how do these dots how do the dots of what we've  

---------43:34----------
learned in the past about jimmy connect with your 
understanding of him today well i mean i think it  

---------43:40----------
was very interesting that i've experienced jimmy's 
um homophobic and transphobic language right i'll  

---------43:47----------
give him the benefit of the doubt he says he 
he's just making fun but he doesn't hate people  

---------43:52----------
that's fine so i'll use the term i won't say 
transphobia and homophobia his transphobic and  

---------43:56----------
homophobic language and for ex i've experienced 
it with jimmy as an adult and he revealed today  

---------44:02----------
that he was the recipient of that when he was 
skipping along and being called gay that makes  

---------44:10----------
that that that makes a lot of 
sense to me in the sense that  

---------44:15----------
he's weaponizing the way he felt when that was 
used against him against other people that maybe  

---------44:21----------
he wants to go after or get back at like that's 
a that's one example of why it's fitting together

---------44:29----------
um what do you think about that jimmy

---------44:34----------
i don't know i mean david i certainly am no 
victim you know good and bad things happen to  

---------44:42----------
people all the time and and in fact like what is 
good and bad what's bad what the chinese see um  

---------44:50----------
what is that um um conflict as um like opportunity 
you know i mean if something bad happens you can  

---------45:00----------
go one or two routes right you can become a victim 
get angry get depressed stay that way for years  

---------45:10----------
or you can turn that [ __ ] around make 
lemons out of lemonade lemons right  

---------45:17----------
and how do you how do you think so if someone is 
kind of a victim and someone is sad and depressed  

---------45:22----------
how do you think you kind of speaking about what 
you were sort of mentioning about aaa and becoming  

---------45:27----------
a sponsor and helping other people how do you help 
someone like that turn their lemons into lemonade  

---------45:34----------
well the whole thing with that is it's i guess 
it's a form of selfishness i mean if you keep  

---------45:39----------
thinking about you and your [ __ ] up situation 
you're not thinking about a solution you're  

---------45:44----------
stuck in the problem so you got to get out of 
yourself somehow and but me yeah so you've been  

---------45:52----------
a sponsor right so you've helped people who are in 
a dark space and how did you help him out of that  

---------45:58----------
just helped them with the uh the big book 
of alcoholics anonymous i helped them  

---------46:03----------
take them through the 12 steps and and they got 
to define it the way they did and you know like  

---------46:12----------
they got to experience it the way 
they did the more they practiced it  

---------46:16----------
more they experienced and they got to 
articulate it any way they wanted to i  

---------46:20----------
didn't tell them to say i didn't tell most of 
these guys would tell you when i got sponsors  

---------46:26----------
right and believe me these are these were 
all well-meaning people but they would say  

---------46:29----------
call me every day right so i called them they 
could they'd last about 10 minutes because i was  

---------46:34----------
i was pissed off i was disgusted one thing that 
comforted me drugs or alcohol wasn't available  

---------46:41----------
anymore and they'd lasted about 10 minutes right 
and they would say go tell that at a meeting  

---------46:48----------
you'll feel better i never did i never felt better 
talking about my problems all the [ __ ] time  

---------46:53----------
and believe me i talked about my problems i never 
no i'm asking i'm asking you guys other people  

---------47:01----------
what's that so i'm hearing that you seem to 
be talking about when someone else is your  

---------47:05----------
sponsor it sounded like you were a sponsor yeah 
yeah yeah yeah how did you help other people  

---------47:12----------
oh what i did was i helped help them to open their 
own eyes how did you describe me i was helped  

---------47:19----------
through the 12 steps do a fourth and fifth step 
with them shared the way i made amends discuss  

---------47:27----------
that with them and then they had to go out 
and do the work like i was just like guide  

---------47:34----------
okay i was no special person or anything i you 
know i it's not like i had superhuman powers  

---------47:40----------
sure but i had a problem that i got over and 
you're the same way ain't you and you have a  

---------47:46----------
problem with gaming and you got over it now you 
help gamers well then you understand this uh  

---------47:52----------
absolutely oh sure i mean i understand my 
experience of it so my experience of it and i  

---------47:57----------
was kind of curious because you know i'm sure it's 
similar i i think it is too so let me let me kind  

---------48:02----------
of share with you kind of my experience and you 
let me know so you know i found that when i was  

---------48:05----------
playing video games like i was really struggling 
and and you know some people um would kind of you  

---------48:12----------
know not really understand that i was struggling 
they would sort of blame me they thought it was  

---------48:16----------
weakness things like that some people made fun of 
me um you know i got bullied a lot when i was kind  

---------48:21----------
of growing up for playing video games and things 
like that and the people that helped me sort of  

---------48:24----------
i think did sort of what you did which is that you 
know they didn't make fun of me or or things like  

---------48:29----------
that they sort of helped me see things in a new 
light they helped me sort of recognize that that  

---------48:35----------
you know while i may be a victim in some ways 
that if i'm a victim if it's really my fault  

---------48:40----------
like you know they also empowered me in some ways 
by sort of helping me understand that like there  

---------48:45----------
is some element of this that i control well you 
know doc you know sometimes bullies can be good  

---------48:52----------
you know they can help you to face reality a 
whole lot quicker yeah so um if it's okay with  

---------48:59----------
you jimmy what i'm gonna actually do is like 
share some thoughts and and i'm i'm kind of  

---------49:03----------
curious what about this will kind of land well 
with you and and what won't um you know and  

---------49:10----------
and just i'm super curious because i think getting 
to talk to you by the way first of all bro this  

---------49:14----------
has been an absolute privilege i i really 
appreciate it thank you i'm having fun great

---------49:22----------
um do you have a doctor by the way you have 
a doctor that you see huh got a shrink okay  

---------49:30----------
okay cause i'm just you know noticing that 
you're you're smoking cigarettes and vaping and  

---------49:34----------
and stuff like that so i just want to make sure 
that you know your health is okay and that you  

---------49:37----------
talk to a medical professional about all that 
stuff i'm i'm fine i'm trying to vape more  

---------49:42----------
okay okay um but it sounds like you you were 
you joking when you said you have a shrink or  

---------49:50----------
no i said i don't have a shrink oh you don't 
have it you have you have a fit physical health  

---------49:54----------
doctor yes okay yes yes and they're aware that 
you're smoking and vaping and stuff like that  

---------49:59----------
okay and promote the vaping actually okay okay um 
so a hard reduction now yeah yeah it's good so the  

---------50:10----------
first thing that i kind of want to point out is is 
uh you know so like i think jimmy what i'm really  

---------50:16----------
hearing from you is like you know you grew up and 
you learned a couple of really important lessons  

---------50:23----------
so you were kind of like young and carefree 
and and stuff like that right and then like  

---------50:27----------
you kind of learned that when people behave 
in a manner that is maybe a little bit unusual  

---------50:34----------
is maybe a little bit funny that like the way that 
you respond to that like the way that you were  

---------50:39----------
treated because that's how we learn right like we 
treat other people the way that we were treated  

---------50:43----------
right so that's how human beings learn 
interaction so you know i grew up in texas  

---------50:48----------
where a firm handshake is a great way to greet 
someone and so that's sort of what i thought was  

---------50:53----------
normal and what i'm sort of hearing from you 
is that you know when when someone's a little  

---------50:57----------
bit different the way that you treat them is you 
just kind of make fun of them right because that's  

---------51:01----------
just that's just what we do like that's the way 
that that's what happened to you that's the way  

---------51:05----------
you kind of respond that's sort of the system of 
things not not not always i don't always make fun  

---------51:12----------
of them i generally what can i say my personal 
life everyone knows me no one takes some of  

---------51:20----------
the things i say seriously but when there's a 
time to be serious they know it you know i mean  

---------51:27----------
can i ask you to come up and respectfully you 
know can i ask you a little bit about your  

---------51:31----------
personal life for the band so like who's in your 
life right now who are the you know what are the  

---------51:36----------
relationships that matter to you well i live i 
live in a very nice rooming house in a very nice  

---------51:41----------
area i run the place um i'm i'm the kitchen nazi 
i can find you fifty dollars if you don't clean  

---------51:48----------
up now i've yet to do it but this landlord here 
she likes renting all these kids and you know  

---------51:55----------
[ __ ] vegetarians you know they're going to save 
the world of animals but they won't clean up the  

---------51:59----------
kitchen it's amazing you know i point to the floor 
so so you're having uh artichokes onions and looks  

---------52:08----------
like there's a tomato there too yeah these kids 
it took me two years to whip this place into shape  

---------52:13----------
now we got a professional cleaner yeah so yeah so 
it sounds like like you're you're kind of like uh  

---------52:22----------
it sounds like there are kids like in the sense 
of young kids young folks here and so it sounds  

---------52:27----------
like you're kind of you're kind of imposing 
some discipline in order it's this is the uh  

---------52:33----------
this is the international house of pancakes 
we got west africans we got koreans we got  

---------52:38----------
jamaicans we got black people we got i mean we 
got we got everybody here so so i'm hearing that  

---------52:45----------
you know that some of the relationships 
in your life are kind of the people that  

---------52:48----------
are in the rooming house what about like um 
you know significant others partners family  

---------52:54----------
no i don't i don't have a significant other my my 
i haven't had a steady girlfriend since my ex and  

---------53:01----------
i threw the baby on the floor so you know she 
betrayed me and uh you know i really don't give  

---------53:11----------
a [ __ ] about a relationship okay when you say 
you don't give a [ __ ] do you ever feel lonely  

---------53:19----------
curiously enough now that is kind of curious 
right how do you understand i think i would  

---------53:24----------
no listen i walk down the street i have fun 
i talk to everybody i pet every dog i see i  

---------53:31----------
i don't know what to do i have fun i have i'm a 
relatively happy person mm-hmm yeah i see that but  

---------53:38----------
how do you how do you think that happened 
because you know i'm thinking 58 year old  

---------53:43----------
you know well i'll say this for you lsd has 
helped me tremendously how so this made me happier  

---------53:54----------
interesting okay and and so when was 
the last time you were in a relationship  

---------54:01----------
20 years ago okay let me ask you kind of 
weird question you don't have to answer  

---------54:05----------
if you don't feel comfortable but have 
you ever wondered if you might be gay

---------54:11----------
no and i know it sounds kind of weird but why not

---------54:18----------
uh because i don't think a 
man's hairy ass is appealing  

---------54:23----------
that's basically as right of 
an answer as you can give okay

---------54:29----------
and so it does sound like you're sexual i got no 
problem i got no problem with homosexuals i don't  

---------54:36----------
yeah in fact i've had a few homosexual friends 
that were some funny [ __ ] yeah so i'm just  

---------54:42----------
hearing that you're sexually attracted to women 
and you're pretty sure about that yeah yeah okay  

---------54:48----------
was it okay that i asked you those questions yeah 
you know i hit the sucky [ __ ] every now and then  

---------54:53----------
you know what i hit the sucky [ __ ] every now 
and then i massage place and he's a massage place  

---------55:04----------
okay uh anyway so if you must know what i 
do for sex because that would be the next  

---------55:11----------
logical question and i was just yeah i mean 
i i suppose it would be the next logical  

---------55:17----------
question jimmy i gotta say man you are you 
are a blast to talk to bro that's cool yeah

---------55:27----------
yeah so i i just wanna you know so here here's 
the thing if it's okay with you i'm gonna sort of  

---------55:33----------
share some thoughts and a couple of observations 
you know i i met you now what like about an hour  

---------55:38----------
ago right and and so you got to take all this 
with a healthy grain of salt you you know  

---------55:43----------
um but so i'm going to kind of just start out with 
like it it seems like you kind of grew up and you  

---------55:48----------
were taught a particular you know here's the rules 
of the game of life right if you're a little bit  

---------55:54----------
different you get made fun of you know and that 
like making fun of people is is sort of what  

---------56:00----------
what happens and there's no like there's no victim 
complex here you know you kind of you it's like  

---------56:06----------
it's like tit for tat like if someone makes fun 
of you you make fun of them and it's like that's  

---------56:10----------
just the way of the world no i gotta top them and 
you gotta top em why is that i don't know it makes  

---------56:18----------
me feel better okay yeah so i'll share a couple 
of thoughts with you about that in a second but  

---------56:25----------
so i and and then i think that you know honestly 
like what what you're so i'm a psychiatrist and i  

---------56:29----------
see a lot of people you know who have ptsd and 
gone through traumatic experiences and stuff  

---------56:34----------
like that and i'm i'm actually i know this may 
sound kind of weird but i do think that there's  

---------56:39----------
um you know people some people really 
go too far on the victimhood complex  

---------56:44----------
and and as a psychiatrist sometimes what i find 
is that you know if you play if you kind of think  

---------56:49----------
of yourself as 100 of a victim that also means 
that you have no control or agency over life  

---------56:56----------
and that you can be a victim and at the same time 
there are parts of your life that you can control  

---------57:02----------
you know so i think that there were some well let 
me say this to you the biggest thing that i felt  

---------57:09----------
like a victim when my ex used the police in the 
courts to lie and say i threw the baby on the  

---------57:17----------
floor they were all against me the accusations 
what's meant what what was what what mattered  

---------57:23----------
not the fact whether or not it happened they did 
no investigation they didn't ask if the child  

---------57:28----------
was taken to the hospital they just charged me 
made me spend thousands of dollars for a lawyer  

---------57:34----------
to this day that pisses me off 
that's the way the system is  

---------57:39----------
so i had detectives tell me you're guilty till 
you're proven innocent if it's with a girlfriend  

---------57:44----------
or a wife if they say you did something boom 
you're locked up no investigation yeah i don't  

---------57:50----------
believe that's extremely unfair it's very unfair 
how did it feel to be a victim in that situation

---------57:59----------
not good i went down there and screamed at the 
psychiatrist and the security guards came in  

---------58:05----------
and he put his hand up and he talked to me and 
uh here's what he my lawyer got the notes from  

---------58:13----------
the psychiatrist so the psychiatrist said that i 
was very affable right but that i needed some my  

---------58:22----------
mental health support right yeah no [ __ ] my ex 
just said i threw the [ __ ] baby on the floor  

---------58:27----------
and i didn't you know what i mean but then he 
does the report on her and he says the distance  

---------58:34----------
that miss beef claimed that he threw the child on 
the floor became lower and lower as the interview  

---------58:42----------
went on in other words he called her a liar 
because she is a [ __ ] liar she got away with it  

---------58:49----------
she got away with it because she said she said 
that's ridiculous it pisses me off to this day  

---------58:59----------
and i don't feel like a victim anymore but i'm 
still pissed off it i'm still gonna talk about it  

---------59:05----------
you know [ __ ] ridiculous now the kids in 
harvard so and guess what that kid read books  

---------59:11----------
because she saw me reading books i always read 
her my prior series in their entire [ __ ] life  

---------59:18----------
okay you know are you kid calls me when it's 10. 
listen to this she calls me when she's 10 years  

---------59:25----------
old she says daddy mommy told me to get in the 
tub but i was already in the tub i'm like what  

---------59:30----------
she said mommy told me to get in the 
tub but she was already in the tub  

---------59:34----------
she said uh is mommy drinking she said yeah 
i should put her on the phone i said she's at  

---------59:39----------
the age of reason now if you want her to hate you 
like i [ __ ] hate you keep [ __ ] drinking and to  

---------59:45----------
her credit three weeks and three weeks later she 
went no rehab i believe she's still sober i'm i'm  

---------59:51----------
not sure but she's been sober a number of years so 
are you assassination the kid won't talk to me the  

---------59:59----------
mother poisoned her you know the mother got both 
her titties chopped off right i found on facebook  

---------60:05----------
and i sent her a message it couldn't happen 
to a nicer person i'm skipping down the street  

---------60:10----------
i'm gonna have a party well apparently saying 
mean things is worse than doing mean things  

---------60:18----------
yeah yeah well i said was terrible uh but her 
saying i threw the baby on the floor costing  

---------60:23----------
me thousands of dollars forever ordering the 
relationship i would have with my daughter it's a  

---------60:27----------
lot worse so you deserve that you know what i mean 
i don't give a [ __ ] they can cut her head off  

---------60:34----------
i mean i don't care yeah you sound very very angry 
well what the [ __ ] what would you threw the baby  

---------60:41----------
on the floor what the [ __ ] it never happened 
even my kid when she was five she's like dad  

---------60:46----------
wouldn't i have gotten hurt yeah you think 
these detectives would ask those questions  

---------60:51----------
no but they're forced to charge you that's 
the way the law works if it's a girlfriend or  

---------60:57----------
a spouse if they make some allegation like that 
you're just sent off the court no investigation  

---------61:04----------
none so how would you like to 
be treated not without evidence

---------61:10----------
how would you like to be treated in that situation

---------61:15----------
like to be treated fairly like there was some 
kind of investigation to go on before i'm charged  

---------61:23----------
so it's fun i'm gonna put myself in in the shoes 
of someone else let's say a cop or or you know  

---------61:30----------
your ex-girlfriend or whatever and i'm gonna 
say for a second that you were treated fairly  

---------61:35----------
like what if they thought they were treating you 
fairly even the cops admit it's unfair i've talked  

---------61:42----------
to scores of detectives they say look in that 
instance you're guilty to approve an innocent  

---------61:47----------
it's [ __ ] up it's [ __ ] up no investigation 
like look if somebody accused me of murder they do  

---------61:54----------
a [ __ ] investigation right if somebody accused 
me of burglary they do a [ __ ] investigation  

---------61:59----------
if somebody accused me of anything they do 
with investigation but when a woman says  

---------62:03----------
a man did something to a kid there's no [ __ ] 
investigation they just charge you that's wrong  

---------62:10----------
shit's wrong cost me thousands of dollars 
to disprove a lot [ __ ] yeah that's wrong  

---------62:19----------
believe women [ __ ] that not 
without evidence [ __ ] that

---------62:26----------
you're supposed to get mad about [ __ ] like 
that yeah i completely agree i think the worst  

---------62:32----------
thing a woman can a man can do is rape a woman 
and i think the worst thing a woman can do  

---------62:36----------
is lie and say that you abused your own child 
that's [ __ ] up a kid made it to harvard  

---------62:43----------
looks like i did something [ __ ] right yeah 
it doesn't sound like you got a whole lot of  

---------62:48----------
credit for it what's that doesn't sound like 
you got a whole lot of credit for it well yeah  

---------62:53----------
i shouldn't get credit look the kid was smart kid 
like to read you know what i mean and they're all  

---------63:00----------
my whole family's like thinking carol did 
something that kid went to harvard despite  

---------63:04----------
that dumb [ __ ] he drank a fifth of jd a 
day for 10 years that kid was born smart  

---------63:13----------
and she liked to read and she would ask me daddy 
what's your book he said and i would stop because  

---------63:17----------
my father read all the time but he would get 
pissed off he stopped him so i would stop put  

---------63:22----------
the book down well julia here's what happened so 
far i'll let you know when it ends jimmy i'm going  

---------63:28----------
to tell him i'm gonna kind of interrupt you for a 
second is that okay how does it feel to share this

---------63:36----------
good what feels good about it i don't know i like 
talking about um but i put it uh about my daughter  

---------63:48----------
because see i can tell the [ __ ] truth my ex has 
never told the truth and you know apparently uh  

---------63:56----------
you know she's gotten away with a lot of this 
yeah not a very bright girl but you know so

---------64:06----------
i'm gonna try to do this one more time so 
if it's okay with you i'm going to share  

---------64:12----------
some thoughts about you know what i'm seeing so it 
kind of starts off i'm sort of noticing that when  

---------64:18----------
you grew up and you know you behaved somewhat 
differently and when people didn't understand  

---------64:24----------
what you were how you were the way you were like 
you know you're a kid who skips and the kids on  

---------64:29----------
the corner who like don't understand what that's 
about so they make fun of you right and then you  

---------64:33----------
sort of learned how to like how to survive in that 
situation you also learned that like hey you know  

---------64:38----------
this is where humor comes in like you know you 
kind of fight fire with fire and like i'm sure  

---------64:43----------
that early on before you learned how to how to 
defend yourself using humor it probably hurt when  

---------64:50----------
they make fun of you but you sort of learned that 
like hey if you get hurt laying down and playing  

---------64:54----------
the victim there's no point to that you got to 
kind of you you know you got to fight back and the  

---------64:59----------
way that you fight back is you put people in their 
place you teach them a lesson you kind of make fun  

---------65:03----------
of it you laugh with them you laugh at them you 
kind of like you know that's the way the world  

---------65:06----------
works and then i'm sort of hearing that you know 
that that you had a couple of interesting things  

---------65:14----------
happen to you you kind of got into drugs and stuff 
like that you got into crime because of the drugs  

---------65:20----------
i think you've come to acknowledge that your mom 
wasn't perfect in a lot of ways but she sort of  

---------65:24----------
in her own flawed way did the best that she 
could and you've come to even defend her and and  

---------65:30----------
kind of be a champion for her when other people 
were trying to like you know kind of abuse her  

---------65:35----------
or not kind of treat her properly like you weren't 
gonna let her be a victim and you would stand up  

---------65:40----------
for someone else who kind of couldn't stand up for 
themselves um and that's actually despite you know  

---------65:47----------
getting sent off to like become a tin soldier 
and by the way i think part of the reason that  

---------65:52----------
that you really you know part of the reason 
that you were telling that story i think i  

---------65:57----------
heard some positivity there and i think part of 
the positivity with that story is that someone  

---------66:02----------
actually like paid attention to what you wanted 
and what you cared about and the guy was like  

---------66:07----------
straight with you and said hey if you want to 
be here i got your back and if you don't want  

---------66:12----------
to be here eternally grateful to that commander or 
whatever the hell he was it's weird right because  

---------66:18----------
we go there yeah and he had your back right so 
like you know when i was in saint gabes we played  

---------66:25----------
valley forge military academy in football 
and we beat the [ __ ] out of them  

---------66:30----------
yeah so what i'm sort of hearing is that you know 
some some people like your mom it sort of felt  

---------66:37----------
like she didn't have your back right when she's in 
the court judge is like time to go home and mom's  

---------66:41----------
like uh-uh whereas like it's interesting because 
there are like some people here who who sort of  

---------66:46----------
have your back right and he's like a stranger but 
it's it was really interesting to kind of hear  

---------66:51----------
your and see your emotional expressions and stuff 
as you were kind of telling that story you kind of  

---------66:55----------
got sent to saint francis you actually you sort of 
liked it but you sort of made your mom pay for it  

---------67:00----------
right you weren't going to let her off the phone 
for feeling that she abandoned your kids yeah  

---------67:07----------
and then you went to st gabe's which you really 
didn't like but it i mean it sounds like in a lot  

---------67:11----------
of ways you were sort of a dealt and unlucky hand 
in life but i'm also sort of hearing that you're  

---------67:16----------
not going to play the victim because like that's 
not who you are no and so this is just that's you  

---------67:22----------
know [ __ ] happens to all kind of people all kind 
of negative things happen to people yeah of course  

---------67:28----------
of course and and so i think that like you said 
you know the one place where you maybe get to play  

---------67:33----------
the victim card or you feel like you were really 
treated um you know unfairly was probably the  

---------67:39----------
situation with this whole domestic violence kind 
of thing and stuff like that but i'm also kind  

---------67:43----------
of hearing that that you know this aaa experience 
has been really interesting for you because what  

---------67:49----------
i'm sort of hearing is that you know acknowledging 
that people have their own experience of alcohol  

---------67:55----------
helping people understand their experience of 
alcohol um sorry it's just a bit distracting  

---------68:01----------
and and sort of help other people sort of like 
listening to you and sort of being like kind of  

---------68:06----------
compassionate right but also they're not saying 
like oh it's like it's not your fault alcohol is  

---------68:11----------
a disease like they're not sort of using that kind 
of victim language but what they're sort of doing  

---------68:14----------
is recognizing that hey you may need a little bit 
of support and i think affable and may need some  

---------68:20----------
mental health support i think is a great great 
way to describe you by the way to be fair the  

---------68:24----------
whole disease thing let me just stop to be fair in 
the big book and bill wilson wrote it it did not  

---------68:31----------
declare the disease that he called it an illness 
a melody used other terms the whole disease thing  

---------68:38----------
is a [ __ ] joke it really really is i think 
it's i think it's ridiculous and you know like  

---------68:45----------
the problem from for me for many years is i would 
go to aaa they would tell you to go to a meeting  

---------68:49----------
if you got a problem put it down in the meeting 
like it's group therapy i'm not about you but  

---------68:54----------
constantly talking about my problems doesn't 
makes you feel worse you should feel worse  

---------69:00----------
so i had to like take some actions i knew i had to 
do something i didn't know what the [ __ ] to do  

---------69:07----------
yeah but this man helped me and i was very 
impressed with the fact that he [ __ ] spent his  

---------69:13----------
personal time with me and he said now you go do it 
yeah no i'm with you no i did i was afraid but i  

---------69:22----------
did it so so i and i i'm i'm with you i mean i i 
think we'll i'll kind of address that in a second  

---------69:28----------
too but and so what i'm kind of hearing now is 
that you know you're you kind of got your opinions  

---------69:33----------
and you're going to stick to them and if if people 
want to be snowflakes they can go screw themselves  

---------69:38----------
you're going to say what you're going 
to want to say and so this is where  

---------69:42----------
you know i i'd actually encourage you to rethink 
that a little bit and here's the reason why okay  

---------69:50----------
so like what i'm hearing is as many situations 
in your life where you were not people didn't  

---------69:55----------
listen to you in other situations where 
they kind of did like so we can talk about  

---------70:00----------
you know that the the the general or whatever at 
the tin soldier place we can think a little bit  

---------70:05----------
about your aaa sponsor we can even think about the 
psychiatrist who sort of said you know sort of had  

---------70:10----------
your back and sort of looked at the situation well 
let me finish you know what doc i even look at  

---------70:15----------
it like even the bowie's helped me in some sense 
i'm with you i'm with you i i'll get there right  

---------70:21----------
so like th those those moments uh you know where 
people really like you know cause i'm not hearing  

---------70:26----------
that your aaa sponsor made fun of you and i'm not 
hearing that when you're in a sponsor he actually  

---------70:31----------
did but he was a funny guy he okay he just died 
no i was real he died of hep c he got treated  

---------70:40----------
i had had c2 i got treated and cured but he had it 
for like 30 years and it [ __ ] with his liver so  

---------70:46----------
bad that even though he was cured it killed him 
which was a real shame it sounds like a shame  

---------70:54----------
yeah and and so i'm also hearing loud and clear 
that you know your experiences have made you the  

---------71:00----------
person that you are which is sort of a survivor 
you know if i had to use one word to describe you  

---------71:05----------
know you've been through a lot the number one will 
of a human being is to survive is it not yeah and  

---------71:12----------
what i'm also hearing and i know this may sound 
kind of weird but there have been a lot of times  

---------71:16----------
where we've sort of talked a little bit about you 
know maybe how you're feeling or or you know like  

---------71:21----------
for example like that you don't feel lonely and 
even you're a little bit surprised at that and in  

---------71:26----------
my experience actually like psychologically and 
neuroscientifically like sometimes what happens  

---------71:31----------
when people are survivors is parts of their brain 
actually shut down because like you were kind  

---------71:37----------
of saying if you didn't shut those parts of the 
brain down it'd be like going to an aaa meeting  

---------71:41----------
talking about all the negativity and it just sort 
of like feels worse and worse and worse and so  

---------71:46----------
sometimes what the brain actually does is numb 
ourselves to negative emotions and the last kind  

---------71:54----------
of thing that i'd sort of share with you is that 
you know you were talking a little bit about how  

---------71:58----------
like you don't like to wallow in the negativity 
which i get because you're not a victim and all  

---------72:01----------
that kind of good stuff but there was a little bit 
of time today where you sort of did share hey the  

---------72:06----------
one place where i think if i you know if anyone 
wanted to call me a victim it was in this place  

---------72:10----------
you got pissed off you started off you can even go 
back and watch this you started off laughing about  

---------72:14----------
it and then towards the end you really got angry 
and then i kind of asked you like how does it feel  

---------72:21----------
to talk about it you actually said good now i'm 
not i i think if we had spent an hour and a half  

---------72:25----------
talking about it you would feel worse at the end 
but what i'm sort of maybe yeah well you're the  

---------72:31----------
one who said that wallowing in the negativity 
makes you feel generally speaking worse but  

---------72:37----------
so so this is where you know what i i'm kind of 
noticing is like you're someone who had to kind of  

---------72:41----------
adapt you had to survive you had to learn how to 
laugh you had to learn how to swim yeah you had to  

---------72:47----------
you know tit for tat and at the same time like the 
cost of that survivor that survival like you know  

---------72:54----------
his his comet maybe like you know to a certain 
degree like kind of toning down your compassion  

---------73:01----------
toning down your empathy toning down even feelings 
of loneliness or negative emotions because you've  

---------73:06----------
said time and time and time again everything to me 
is funny everything is to me is funny i'm a happy  

---------73:13----------
guy right and so what i'm sort of noticing there 
is like that seems really unusual and so there's a  

---------73:20----------
part of me that you know based on our conversation 
makes me wonder whether there's like stuff that's  

---------73:24----------
kind of like tucked away swept under the rug that 
i think i just i have a different personality type  

---------73:31----------
i have a rare type i've been typed before 
i'm just i have a rare personality type  

---------73:37----------
you know does it make me special or 
not and i just see things differently  

---------73:42----------
i don't know yeah i i get that i mean i i think 
that you do see things it's better than laughing  

---------73:46----------
try doc isn't it i mean i mean i had i had 
a therapist tell me jimmy about my family  

---------73:52----------
she said there's the brady bunch and then there's 
everybody else so you know that helped put it in  

---------73:58----------
perspective yeah so here's what i'd say i i'd 
say that it's it's it's best to laugh and cry

---------74:07----------
no no i ain't cried in a while yeah 
right and like even then you kind  

---------74:14----------
of said i haven't cried in a while and 
then you laughed what's funny about that

---------74:21----------
yeah so because when you say better to 
laugh that's kind of interesting because  

---------74:25----------
what that doesn't mean i'm looking to cry oh 
i think it means you're looking to not cry  

---------74:32----------
right so when you say it's better to 
laugh than to cry and every time you laugh  

---------74:35----------
what i'm sort of noticing is 
that you've got a choice there  

---------74:39----------
and you're deviating towards laughter instead 
of crying i wouldn't say that i i think um

---------74:50----------
i'm just a happy good lucky person and there's 
there's nothing in my life that would make me  

---------74:56----------
cry right now it's true nothing like you know 
like like like i don't know i mean okay it's  

---------75:04----------
not an option to cry there's nothing to cry about 
things are this is one like one the best period of  

---------75:10----------
my life i got a little youtube channel you know i 
mean uh i i like that that's going pretty good um  

---------75:20----------
yeah quick quit one job for another got two more 
hours now you know i'm doing all right yeah i hear  

---------75:26----------
that man i i i don't disagree with you i'm not 
saying that you need to sit there and and you  

---------75:30----------
know cry all day oh my god your life is crap and 
and things like that what i'm sort of saying is  

---------75:34----------
that you know i think that you've got maybe one 
or two things that you could feel rightfully sad  

---------75:39----------
about but i sort of also understand that you 
know playing a victim is not something that  

---------75:43----------
you're gonna do when i think a little bit about 
your daughter and and her being at harvard and  

---------75:47----------
i hear you kind of speak with pride and also that 
she's been poisoned against you like i think it'd  

---------75:52----------
be okay to shed a tear on that if you felt like 
it nah you know sometimes i get a little sad about  

---------75:58----------
it but i've i basically convinced myself that 
look a kid has reached the pinnacle of schools  

---------76:09----------
she's not going to run for anything if she plays 
her cards right and up to now she's played her  

---------76:13----------
cards right so she's not going to need her father 
that much and if she doesn't want me in her life  

---------76:17----------
then that's her choice there's nothing i can 
do about it so you used an interesting word  

---------76:23----------
i've gotten a few hobbies look 
i started painting that's great

---------76:30----------
jimmy i just want to point one thing out 
to you and then we we can you know can that  

---------76:34----------
discussion but okay you said i've convinced 
myself so when someone uses that word when  

---------76:43----------
i think about convincing what i think about 
is starting from a place where you believe  

---------76:47----------
one thing and working really hard to believe 
something else well in a sense yes because look  

---------76:54----------
let's face it that's a sad situation the kid 
ain't talking to me yeah right there's nothing  

---------76:58----------
i can do about it there's nothing i can do about 
so hopefully the kid grows the [ __ ] up and you  

---------77:05----------
know like apparently it was okay for this woman to 
falsely accuse me three times twice of abusing her  

---------77:14----------
once i'm abusing yeah so jimmy can i cut you off 
again is that okay so here's here's what i'd say  

---------77:21----------
i'm with you that there's nothing you can do about 
it so a lot of times when there's nothing we can  

---------77:24----------
do about something like why cry about it right 
because it's not gonna help anything i'm with  

---------77:28----------
you makes perfect sense right so like why why 
what's use of crying over spilled milk right

---------77:37----------
so this is the last thing that i'd leave with 
you and you know you you don't have to agree  

---------77:40----------
with whatever i'm saying it's really just i'm just 
making observations and you can you can decide you  

---------77:45----------
know you're the expert on you so the last thing 
that i'd say is like you know i'd encourage you  

---------77:49----------
to try you know if you're a funny dude that's 
fine you find something funny that's fine  

---------77:55----------
i'd encourage you to try to be like a 
little bit more compassionate towards people  

---------78:00----------
who may be confused or struggling or see 
themselves as victims i'm not saying that  

---------78:06----------
they are victims i'm not saying that there's an 
objective right or wrong but what i've heard from  

---------78:10----------
you time and time and time again is that there 
have been periods in your life where like whether  

---------78:15----------
you were a victim or you weren't a victim you 
know whether it was really your fault that you  

---------78:20----------
got sent off to these schools or things like that 
whether they formed you into being the person that  

---------78:23----------
you are and so therefore good experiences i'm 
with you all all through that even in terms of  

---------78:28----------
my own video game addiction i'm grateful for it 
because it turned me into the person that i am  

---------78:33----------
and at the same time while i'm going through 
it if someone sort of shares a kind word with  

---------78:38----------
me even if my head is in the wrong space i don't 
understand exactly what's going on you've kind of  

---------78:42----------
said that about yourself you know when you were 
kind of like going through this a a stuff and  

---------78:46----------
you started to have realizations that during 
that dark period before you understand things  

---------78:51----------
that a kind word or even someone sort of like 
you know taking you seriously and saying hey  

---------78:56----------
i don't think that's really what it is 
can actually have like a positive impact  

---------79:01----------
and what i'd encourage you to kind of think about 
is like you know these people that you kind of  

---------79:05----------
call snowflakes and stuff like that you know i 
don't know if there's an objective right here or  

---------79:10----------
an objective wrong you may think that there's an 
objective right i think that it's possible that  

---------79:14----------
your decisions are also your judgments are also 
emotional and then you know no amount of truth  

---------79:18----------
is going to change your mind what i'm saying is 
just like from a human perspective even if you can  

---------79:23----------
think they're ridiculous can you be kind to them 
too oh absolutely one one of one of the quotes

---------79:33----------
in the book of alcoholics anonymous says those 
we dislike you practice justice and courtesy  

---------79:41----------
so i mean you got to be fair with people and 
you got to be silly you know you got to try to  

---------79:46----------
be civil with them you know we really should 
fight fire with water you know quite often i  

---------79:52----------
gotta fight fire with fire yeah backwards but 
yeah yeah what do you think about that bro  

---------79:59----------
i get myself into some situations yeah so you know 
just one last thought and then you know david can  

---------80:08----------
talk or you can talk i'm kind of done with my 
spiel but you know just like you said like it  

---------80:12----------
sounds like a lot of times you fight fire with 
fire and the words came out of your mouth like  

---------80:16----------
some maybe you should think about using water from 
time to time bro oh yeah sometimes weather doesn't  

---------80:21----------
make sense when when you're dealing with somebody 
who's irrational and unreasonable no well i i  

---------80:29----------
look i'm not saying that fire isn't appealing 
but i'd i'd even argue that the more rational  

---------80:35----------
someone is the more water helps rather than 
fire i don't know if they're willing to listen

---------80:43----------
yep yeah i think it's tricky but you 
know i'm i'm hearing that maybe you're  

---------80:48----------
rethinking things a little bit but you know you 
came to use fire for a reason right because the  

---------80:53----------
water wasn't working well and at the same time 
maybe there's some exploration to have there  

---------81:00----------
i think with what i went through in my 
life i've turned down pretty goddamn good  

---------81:06----------
and i'm relatively happy so yeah yeah no problem 
with my life i i think i think you've done a good  

---------81:17----------
i'm about to say something that make you let 
me know if this is like a victim complex kind  

---------81:20----------
of thing but i would say given the hand of 
cards that you've been dealt you played a  

---------81:24----------
really good game of poker yeah maybe leave me 
i [ __ ] up along the way yeah learn more from  

---------81:32----------
fuck-ups to any kind of success trust me abs 
absolutely man i hear you failure is overrated

---------81:39----------
underrated can i ask a quick question jimmy you 
know when you when you and i started kind of uh  

---------81:47----------
i don't know about corresponding 
but when you started calling in  

---------81:50----------
there was a different sort of anger that i feel 
like in our interactions has dissipated over time  

---------81:57----------
where you and i have even communicated privately 
by email and i feel like it's a different jimmy  

---------82:03----------
than from maybe a couple years ago is that about 
something has changed for you over the last couple  

---------82:08----------
years or is that about your relationship with 
me specifically i would say lsd has helped me  

---------82:17----------
that's i honestly believe this 
may be happier yeah honestly  

---------82:21----------
now i get in arguments with these people online 
they say oh it taught me this it taught me that  

---------82:26----------
lsd it's a drug it ain't teaching you [ __ ] 
but it does seem to make me happier it does seem  

---------82:33----------
to make me want to take risks now like i i was 
afraid to start the youtube channel that i got  

---------82:39----------
and i was unconfident about it i don't know how 
to do this i don't know how to do that [ __ ] it  

---------82:44----------
i just did it i don't even know how to do this [ 
__ ] you guys help me right so i see somebody who  

---------82:51----------
doesn't know how to do something i'm willing 
to help them that's how it should work right  

---------82:55----------
so you just have to have the will to do something 
you don't necessarily have to understand it  

---------83:00----------
know how to do it you just move towards it 
right that's what i'm doing words to live by

---------83:08----------
wow and jimmy did i'm just curious and 
you don't if you don't want to answer that  

---------83:12----------
this obviously you don't 
have to do you own firearms  

---------83:16----------
i'm a felon i can't okay okay i wouldn't own one 
anyway i have no problem with people to do but i  

---------83:24----------
have no need for a gun oh is that right yeah i've 
you know i could defend myself but some people  

---------83:32----------
it's their right no they they have a 
right to do it i lost that right by being  

---------83:39----------
convicted so yeah well wow well jimmy 
listen you you've really said it all i  

---------83:45----------
mean i don't know about you dr k but this 
has been incredibly illuminating to me  

---------83:52----------
same i mean i i i really appreciated you 
know jimmy's honesty and his perspective and  

---------84:01----------
his cojones for coming on and and kind of maybe 
stepping a touch outside i had fun fellas yeah i  

---------84:07----------
hear you man yeah maybe that's my oh sorry 
dr k no no good i was just gonna say like  

---------84:12----------
jimmy you gotta you gotta talk to your doc 
about you know all the stuff you're using bro

---------84:19----------
okay

---------84:21----------
that was actually

---------84:24----------
no but jimmy what i was curious is during this 
hour and a half i think it's been consistent cool  

---------84:31----------
whip cigarettes and vaping the the entire time 
is this all day while you're up or are you maybe  

---------84:36----------
like understandably a little nervous about this 
conversation so you're doing it or is that all day  

---------84:41----------
well listen whippet gods were good to me  

---------84:44----------
they just delivered 600 150 
minutes before the stream started

---------84:51----------
no but what i'm asking jimmy is from the time 
you wake up till you go to sleep are you cool  

---------84:55----------
no no no no no i do hit these whippets a little 
hard i mean you know but not in the morning or not  

---------85:02----------
you know i mean okay and then absolute last thing 
just because aaa was such a prevalent thing are  

---------85:08----------
are you sober now from the standpoint of alcohol 
no but i don't drink as much okay i was knocking  

---------85:16----------
down two bottles of that whiskey a week i've had 
that for 10 days the bottle behind you yeah so  

---------85:23----------
i'll drink i'll drink um three strong beers nine 
or ten percent a night of course in five hours  

---------85:33----------
i'm not driving i'm doing a stream david i'm kind 
of curious what pushes you to ask questions to to  

---------85:43----------
uh fill about his i sorry jimmy about 
how much substances he's using well my  

---------85:50----------
i'm curious in my interactions with 
him how influenced by substance use  

---------85:54----------
they might be because i'm hearing you know 
i'm getting an email or hearing a voicemail  

---------85:59----------
and my instinct is it would help me maybe 
to frame the context a little bit if i know  

---------86:08----------
maybe what his state of mind is 
that's my kind of curiosity about it

---------86:16----------
well okay

---------86:19----------
jimmy any questions from your end yeah 
yeah i had a great time thanks fellas  

---------86:26----------
all right thank you let's do this

---------87:24----------
our bastard is a youtuber that eviscerates

---------87:30----------

---------87:37----------
hilarious david all right very good all right uh 
okay thanks so much guys dr k really appreciate  

---------87:43----------
it yeah thanks a lot for the opportunity jimmy it 
was nice to meet you man and nice to meet you take  

---------87:49----------
care thanks for setting this up all right david 
thank you all right we'll talk to everybody soon

---------87:56----------
now that was something else

---------88:00----------
chat what on earth okay

---------88:16----------
my favorite quotes you gotta fight fire with fire  

---------88:20----------
and beat them at their own game sometimes 
fire doesn't work you gotta use water  

---------88:28----------
jimmy was fantastic man you know it's so 
interesting because i i think a lot of times we um

---------88:36----------
oh maybe i need to go this way oh my god

---------88:41----------
so i think a lot of times man i

---------88:46----------
i don't even what did y'all think chad

---------89:00----------
um

---------89:09----------
like people are saying like it was i 
mean he was he was quite the character  

---------89:14----------
and and it's really interesting because i you know 
i i think it's like i don't know if y'all kind of  

---------89:18----------
caught this but at the very beginning like it was 
really hard to get him to talk about himself it's  

---------89:23----------
like any personal question you ask him becomes 
about propaganda and so like the media and like it  

---------89:31----------
becomes like an externalized issue and then once 
you start to like actually get him talking like  

---------89:36----------
you know i i think he's someone that really 
views the world is like you know he's had to  

---------89:43----------
i want you all to just think about this for 
a second so sometimes when people have very  

---------89:46----------
strong views they're incredibly rigid right like 
they're like super rigid with their thinking and  

---------89:52----------
it's good once you make an emotional judgment no 
nuclear bomb of truth will change your mind so  

---------89:59----------
sometimes i'll talk to people who have very very 
strong and rigid views and and you know it's not  

---------90:03----------
really my place to say what's logical or illogical 
it's not you know but i think what's really  

---------90:09----------
interesting is that if you listen to his life like 
my experience people i don't really know 100 with  

---------90:14----------
him but generally speaking when there are people 
who grow up in really difficult circumstances

---------90:22----------
the need to adapt and survive has 
to come with a ton of rigidity  

---------90:27----------
right like you you gotta wear a full plate armor 
in those kinds of situations like going to a court  

---------90:33----------
after being at a school and then like graduating 
from the school and wanting to go home  

---------90:38----------
and having your mom sit there and say he can't 
come home like you gotta build pretty big walls  

---------90:46----------
and we can kind of like note and i shared 
this with him i mean i i don't usually  

---------90:50----------
i not usually i almost never talk about people 
when they're not on stream but i feel it's okay  

---------90:54----------
because he was just there and i told it to his 
face but it's kind of interesting right because  

---------90:58----------
he has a peculiar absence of like certain 
emotions and what i've seen a lot in people  

---------91:04----------
who have traumatic upbringings especially men is 
that the most accessible emotion is like anger  

---------91:14----------
and we can kind of see that and and it's kind of 
interesting to hear him sort of talk about you  

---------91:18----------
know how angry he was and stuff like that and 
then underneath that so i kind of think about  

---------91:21----------
anger as an umbrella emotion which means that 
it's the emotion that covers all other emotions  

---------91:28----------
but you know i have to imagine i mean i don't 
really know but like you know if i had to put  

---------91:33----------
myself in his shoes and you know i did something 
right in terms of raising my daughter and she  

---------91:38----------
wound up at harvard of all places in spite of all 
of her circumstances i imagine i would feel pride  

---------91:46----------
i imagine i would feel shame i imagine i would 
feel angry at her for like not maintaining a  

---------91:52----------
relationship with me and allowing herself to be 
poisoned and then i imagine that in addition to  

---------91:57----------
feeling angry with her i would work really hard 
to devalue those feelings within myself right  

---------92:04----------
so i would try to convince myself that i wasn't 
angry with her because that's a crappy thing to do  

---------92:10----------
and we want the best for her and i don't really 
deserve it and it's not really her fault and all  

---------92:15----------
that kind of stuff right like and that's just kind 
of you know i don't i don't really know where i'm  

---------92:22----------
going with this but i think it was just really 
eye-opening to talk to him and i can sort of see  

---------92:26----------
now where a lot of like rigid beliefs sort of come 
from and what i've noticed with people who are  

---------92:33----------
very like politically charged and also like 
don't express a whole lot of compassion is that  

---------92:39----------
there is an immense amount of rigidity that these 
people often times like so i remember back in 2016  

---------92:45----------
um so when trump first won the election so i was 
at uh you know i was training at harvard medical  

---------92:51----------
school at the time and like i was in this like 
group therapy education thing so i was like in a  

---------92:59----------
classroom with like a bunch of my colleagues 
and like psychologists and stuff like that phd  

---------93:04----------
students and so people were talking about 
the election and and how it made them feel  

---------93:08----------
and so i sort of shared this idea i was like you 
know everyone's like i don't understand how anyone  

---------93:13----------
could vote for trump he's like so despicable and 
they kind of point out like all of like the the  

---------93:18----------
worst things in their mind about trump and so i 
sort of said because i'm from texas right so i've  

---------93:23----------
like talked to some of these people and i sort of 
said like you know i don't think people are voting  

---------93:27----------
for him because of those things i think y'all are 
missing like a big part of what he's appealing to  

---------93:34----------
and what trump is really appealing to is that like 
there are a lot of people who have been growing  

---------93:38----------
increasingly disenfranchised they're 
getting squeezed their life is getting worse  

---------93:43----------
and like year after year like all they see is like 
the sort of the easy life of the 80s and 90s kind  

---------93:50----------
of like decaying towards 2016. you know your house 
is in disrepair you've got like a truck on cinder  

---------93:59----------
blocks in your front yard um you know you can't 
afford health care and and all that kind of stuff  

---------94:06----------
and so what he was is like a 
great big screw you to the system  

---------94:11----------
and i just don't think that like people in the 
academic setting like i don't think they've spent  

---------94:15----------
time in like you know rural ohio or rural texas 
so they can't fathom what these people go through  

---------94:20----------
and what i found time and time and time again 
is that you know people who are very like rigid  

---------94:26----------
politically and also like trump kind of supporters 
is that their lives are like incredibly hard and i  

---------94:32----------
don't quite understand i'm not i don't mean to say 
i think it's actually like really kind of unfair  

---------94:36----------
to say that if your life sucks like that's why you 
support trump like people have their beliefs for a  

---------94:41----------
reason and we should respect that instead of you 
know assigning some kind of weird psychological  

---------94:46----------
reason but it's just a pattern that i've noticed 
that when people have really really hard lives  

---------94:52----------
you know sometimes it really galvanizes them 
and it sort of like really forms they have to  

---------94:57----------
form really rigid thinking almost to sort of 
survive how do you make sense of a world where  

---------95:03----------
each light each each time like the world gets like 
each year that goes by the world gets a little bit  

---------95:08----------
harder and a little bit harder and a little bit 
harder and a little bit harder and so i i think i  

---------95:14----------
don't you know it's something worth exploring it's 
just a pattern that i've seen and i think it's  

---------95:18----------
interesting because david even said he was like 
i'm not surprised to hear this story which makes  

---------95:22----------
you think right why is not even david surprised 
to hear this story i mean he has no training in  

---------95:27----------
psychology and i don't think it's necessarily 
a psychological thing i think sometimes our  

---------95:32----------
political beliefs have a lot to do with our 
upbringing which sort of makes sense right

---------95:39----------
um i think we see this a lot with like 
doomers and in cells and stuff like that  

---------95:43----------
too like the way that you believe that 
the world works is heavily influenced by  

---------95:50----------
the way that your brain interprets the world 
works and the really tricky thing there is  

---------95:54----------
that your experiences are a hundred percent real 
but your conclusions and the abstractions that  

---------96:01----------
you draw from the world are not 100 real and 
this is the really tricky thing is that when  

---------96:07----------
you talk with someone who believes their 
abstractions about the world are 100 real  

---------96:11----------
what you're really running up against is their 
experience which is absolutely 100 real so if  

---------96:16----------
i asked out three girls and i saw the three girls 
that i asked out ended up dating football players  

---------96:23----------
that experience can form a view of the world 
that is like very very rigid and we can't blame  

---------96:29----------
that person for believing that because like you 
know we all form beliefs about the world based on  

---------96:34----------
our experiences it's literally how our brain is 
designed it's how we learn how to walk it's why  

---------96:38----------
kids drop things on the floor when they're eating 
right they're like learning how gravity works  

---------96:44----------
and based on your individual experience you draw 
conclusions about okay this is how gravity works

---------96:52----------
so you know i'm actually pretty hopeful i think 
jimmy i i actually feel really hopeful for him  

---------96:58----------
in some ways um i think i don't know if you 
guys caught this but he was making a lot of  

---------97:03----------
contradictory statements towards the end you know 
just like a lot of like you know you gotta fight  

---------97:08----------
fight like the whole time it's like when someone 
wrongs you you can't it's not just payback it's  

---------97:13----------
like you gotta overdo it like if you fight like 
you wanna you wanna you know toss and match my  

---------97:18----------
way i'm gonna toss you know a torch your way 
and and so towards the end some of that stuff  

---------97:24----------
and i think he's really had some experiences 
where like you know hopefully he's one step  

---------97:30----------
closer to being compassionate and understanding 
and it sort of makes sense why he makes fun of  

---------97:33----------
people right because that's sort of like what 
happened like even his a sponsor made fun of him  

---------97:37----------
he was a funny guy so that's just 
you know it means a different thing

---------97:44----------
so so rl was saying he was more open-minded than 
i expected so this is my experience this is really  

---------97:50----------
important so i think most human beings are pretty 
open-minded the only challenge is that when you  

---------97:55----------
engage with them about a rigid thing and you 
try to argue with them they're not open-minded  

---------98:02----------
be someone being more open-minded than you 
expected has a lot to do with the way that  

---------98:09----------
i approach him so when you approach someone with 
a closed mind they are going to be close-minded  

---------98:15----------
when you approach someone with an open 
mind they're more likely to be open-minded  

---------98:20----------
and so like i see this a lot with especially 
political discussions and even fall victim  

---------98:23----------
to it myself where like sometimes if i have a 
belief and i start off like pretending to be  

---------98:28----------
open-minded by asking questions and listening 
to them like you can you can notice this  

---------98:32----------
thought process in your head where you can like 
ask a question but you don't really care what  

---------98:36----------
they say you're not really listening what they 
say you've already formed your own conclusion  

---------98:40----------
and you're just waiting for them to stop talking 
so that you can point out how they're wrong that  

---------98:45----------
person is going to be close-minded because 
you're approaching them in a closed-minded way  

---------98:50----------
right it's sort of like i'm going to trap you 
with my questions and what do you think about  

---------98:54----------
this i'm just using that as a facade to pretend 
i'm open-minded and therefore as soon as you're  

---------99:01----------
done talking i'm going to tell you how you're 
wrong if that's the way that you approach people  

---------99:06----------
you're going to be they're going to be 
close-minded because you're being close-minded  

---------99:11----------
so and this is we've seen this time and 
time and time again on stream right like  

---------99:15----------
we kind of joke that we haven't had a real incel 
on stream and like why is that it's because you  

---------99:20----------
know you know the the fire breathing angry incels 
that we see on the internet when you actually  

---------99:26----------
approach them with like compassion and an open 
mind like they all turn out to be relatively  

---------99:31----------
recent decent people and like well i mean i 
don't know about all but you know we've got  

---------99:34----------
a sample size of like two or three or whatever 
you know and that's been my experience so in in  

---------99:40----------
terms of y'all if you guys you know have political 
beliefs that you disagree with or someone who's  

---------99:44----------
super rigid even like parents who are narcissistic 
trying to understand them can go a really long way  

---------99:52----------
like and and sort of doing your best to sort 
of like recognize that this is a human being  

---------99:58----------
who believes what they believe 
for a reason they're not stupid  

---------100:01----------
and this is the other thing that happens with 
trump supporters right is like people call them  

---------100:04----------
stupid like that's not gonna work all you're 
gonna do is galvanize their beliefs cause them  

---------100:10----------
to dig their heels in more and double down on 
what they believe so you know i've had some um  

---------100:17----------
you know some interactions with folks 
who are like anti-vaxx and then like  

---------100:21----------
you know got sick and then you know telling 
them hey this is dumb you should you know this  

---------100:28----------
is your fault you deserve this is not an effective 
strategy that actually causes them to double down  

---------100:34----------
and sort of saying you know treating them like 
treating human beings who are sick with compassion  

---------100:38----------
is the right move irrespective of what their  

---------100:42----------
you know vaccine beliefs are you're allowed to 
feel frustrated you're allowed to think that  

---------100:46----------
it's incorrect that they believe that way but 
like i think they still deserve your compassion  

---------100:51----------
right i told you so is not a winning 
strategy to like open people's minds up

---------101:09----------
you
