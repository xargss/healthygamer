---------00:38----------
um i'm also on


---------00:41----------
youtube but


---------00:43----------
am i doing like description or shout out


---------00:45----------
and like just like talking about


---------00:50----------
i was just so so so i i was told when i


---------00:53----------
started streaming on twitch


---------00:55----------
i was given some instructions that when


---------00:57----------
you have a guest


---------00:58----------
you should give the guests the


---------01:00----------
opportunity to tell people where they


---------01:01----------
can find you and what kind of work that


---------01:03----------
that you do


---------01:05----------
okay okay


---------01:06----------
yeah what kind of streaming you do


---------01:08----------
oh yeah i mainly just shoot on twitch


---------01:09----------
and do uh


---------01:12----------
it i don't know how to explain it it's


---------01:14----------
somewhat variety gaming but i mainly get


---------01:16----------
like attached to one game so like that


---------01:19----------
initial game was league of legends


---------01:22----------
and then


---------01:23----------
around that i would do variety but


---------01:26----------
now valor ever since the valerian came


---------01:28----------
out that's the new addiction


---------01:31----------
and then everything kind of goes around


---------01:32----------
that


---------01:33----------
kind of just been inviting around that


---------01:34----------
game yeah yeah so it sounds like you're


---------01:36----------
a variety gaming streamer and if people


---------01:38----------
are addicted to riot games they should


---------01:40----------
check you out yeah awesome all right


---------01:43----------
about right


---------01:44----------
and um is there something in particular


---------01:46----------
that you want to talk about today


---------01:50----------
uh i couldn't really pinpoint one uh


---------01:54----------
i don't know if they go full circle i i


---------01:57----------
would be interested in diving into


---------02:00----------
um eating disorders um


---------02:02----------
the one i struggle with is


---------02:05----------
binge eating disorder


---------02:07----------
um


---------02:08----------
like that's that one i've been


---------02:09----------
struggling with since like maybe middle


---------02:11----------
school high school


---------02:12----------
i think high school became more


---------02:14----------
prevalent okay


---------02:16----------
um


---------02:19----------
or even


---------02:22----------
addictions in general


---------02:24----------
okay sure


---------02:25----------
um so just a couple of i


---------02:28----------
just a couple of ground rules uh you


---------02:30----------
know the first is that


---------02:32----------
so first of all


---------02:34----------
um i very much appreciate and i'm also


---------02:37----------
surprised by your ability to just state


---------02:40----------
that you want to talk about eating


---------02:41----------
disorders


---------02:42----------
like i don't think many people are able


---------02:44----------
to do that


---------02:46----------
um does that make sense like


---------02:49----------
i really applaud you for doing that uh


---------02:51----------
because i think it's something that


---------02:53----------
people don't talk about because there's


---------02:54----------
so much shame around it right


---------02:56----------
um oh yeah i think


---------02:58----------
yeah go


---------03:00----------
uh oh well i mainly just like the idea


---------03:02----------
of binge eating disorder like you said


---------03:04----------
it is very


---------03:06----------
shameful to bring up but


---------03:08----------
i kind of also understand


---------03:12----------
um i don't know the main reason like i


---------03:14----------
want to do this is like they don't feel


---------03:15----------
alone


---------03:16----------
like within dealing with that since a


---------03:18----------
lot a lot of


---------03:19----------
i think influencers don't talk about it


---------03:22----------
i don't know i feel like i could tap out


---------03:23----------
with that yeah so i and that's that's


---------03:26----------
what i really want to like applaud and


---------03:27----------
appreciate because i i do think you were


---------03:29----------
i mean hopefully we can help some people


---------03:31----------
a couple of other things that i'm just


---------03:33----------
gonna sort of lay out just to make sure


---------03:34----------
we're on the same page the first is that


---------03:37----------
um you know just because you're here to


---------03:38----------
talk about potentially eating disorders


---------03:40----------
it doesn't mean that you have to answer


---------03:42----------
any question that i'm gonna ask so if i


---------03:45----------
ask any question


---------03:46----------
you may feel at some point pressured to


---------03:48----------
answer it because you kind of opened the


---------03:51----------
door but you get to shut that door at


---------03:53----------
any point are we


---------03:55----------
you you cool with that


---------03:57----------
yeah


---------03:57----------
and the other thing just to clarify


---------03:59----------
which i i know we've already talked


---------04:01----------
about and stuff is that you know even


---------04:02----------
though i am a psychiatrist and i know a


---------04:04----------
lot about eating disorders i'm not going


---------04:05----------
to be providing you with any medical


---------04:07----------
advice or or anything like that we're


---------04:09----------
just going to kind of have an open


---------04:11----------
conversation about eating disorders yeah


---------04:14----------
if you do


---------04:15----------
um you know you you're welcome to dm me


---------04:18----------
after the stream if you have specific


---------04:20----------
medical questions or looking for like


---------04:22----------
guidance to find a mental health


---------04:23----------
provider in your area or something like


---------04:25----------
that you're welcome to dm me and we'll


---------04:26----------
try to support you to find someone if


---------04:28----------
you decide you need someone or want


---------04:30----------
someone or if you don't already have


---------04:31----------
someone so i'm just sort of saying that


---------04:33----------
there's kind of a boundary around


---------04:35----------
medical advice on stream but we're going


---------04:37----------
to do our best not to leave you hanging


---------04:39----------
if there are additional questions that


---------04:41----------
you have that are a little bit more


---------04:42----------
personal is that cool


---------04:44----------
yeah it's cool i appreciate that


---------04:46----------
um so


---------04:48----------
yeah so tell i mean tell me a little bit


---------04:50----------
about


---------04:53----------
when you say you've had you've struggled


---------04:55----------
with eating disorders what does that


---------04:56----------
mean


---------04:58----------
uh


---------05:00----------
uh mainly just binge eating disorder and


---------05:02----------
i guess


---------05:05----------
there's a period where like i just


---------05:06----------
forgot to eat


---------05:07----------
for probably like a year because they're


---------05:10----------
just so focused on streaming initial


---------05:12----------
streaming


---------05:13----------
um


---------05:15----------
i believe i dropped from a weight of


---------05:17----------
like


---------05:18----------
220 to


---------05:20----------
170 within like


---------05:23----------
eight months


---------05:26----------
okay


---------05:28----------
it was just pure


---------05:29----------
i felt like i had no time to eat because


---------05:32----------
leaving my pc meant


---------05:35----------
um


---------05:36----------
just down time but then like i slowly


---------05:38----------
like try to to think of uh brainstorming


---------05:41----------
ways to


---------05:43----------
kind of keep chat entertained or to to


---------05:45----------
kind of entertain themselves while i


---------05:46----------
went to go get food and like just


---------05:49----------
overall sustenance um by like having


---------05:51----------
them watch the stream have them be the


---------05:52----------
streamer and like look over people or


---------05:56----------
um i'll like randomly read a name and


---------05:58----------
like hey if someone types this you're


---------05:59----------
banned


---------06:01----------
something like that


---------06:02----------
um


---------06:03----------
so it got a little better but like


---------06:06----------
it was still something i didn't


---------06:10----------
look back on or reflect on


---------06:12----------
after it happened when you say it got a


---------06:14----------
little better what are you referring to


---------06:17----------
i'm back at like uh i would like hover a


---------06:20----------
healthier weight


---------06:21----------
with or like out not healthier like


---------06:23----------
healthier lifestyle


---------06:24----------
of eating


---------06:26----------
uh but i end up just going back to binge


---------06:28----------
eating


---------06:29----------
okay so what i'm hearing from you is


---------06:32----------
that


---------06:33----------
as a consequence of like sort of needing


---------06:36----------
to stream or not


---------06:40----------
that that there were


---------06:42----------
i mean you had to stream sort of is what


---------06:44----------
i'm getting the sense of like you


---------06:45----------
couldn't take a break from streaming and


---------06:47----------
as a consequence of not being able to


---------06:49----------
take a break from streaming you lost


---------06:51----------
about 50 pounds


---------06:53----------
over the course of a year


---------06:56----------
yeah pretty much


---------06:58----------
so i


---------07:00----------
i think i i don't know that seems to me


---------07:02----------
a little bit different from a binge


---------07:04----------
eating disorder


---------07:06----------
um


---------07:07----------
yeah no for sure i i'm not sure what to


---------07:09----------
label that one yep uh


---------07:12----------
we'll we'll get into it but i just want


---------07:14----------
to acknowledge and make sure we're on


---------07:15----------
the same page that that's not what


---------07:16----------
you're referring to when you mean binge


---------07:18----------
eating disorder right


---------07:19----------
uh no because you were asking i thought


---------07:21----------
you were asking me like what other been


---------07:23----------
uh what other eating disorders sure i


---------07:25----------
know


---------07:26----------
i thought you answered the question


---------07:27----------
really


---------07:28----------
well and and so then tell me a little


---------07:31----------
bit about the binge eating disorder


---------07:33----------
we'll call that the streamer eating


---------07:34----------
disorder


---------07:35----------
okay


---------07:37----------
i like that um


---------07:40----------
so


---------07:41----------
middle school high school comes around


---------07:46----------
and i would say like that's like my peak


---------07:50----------
of


---------07:51----------
gaming addiction


---------07:52----------
to the point where i wanted to min max


---------07:54----------
my eating


---------07:55----------
and i wanted to like hork down all the


---------07:58----------
food i could


---------07:59----------
during uh lunch towards or even dinner


---------08:02----------
time so i could get back to cueing or i


---------08:05----------
also like mid-max


---------08:06----------
foods that i could make very fast and


---------08:09----------
easily which ended up being


---------08:11----------
rice we called it cheesy rice which is


---------08:13----------
pretty much just instant mac and cheese


---------08:16----------
now that i think about it um


---------08:19----------
but is it rice


---------08:20----------
it's just rice and cheese okay and it


---------08:23----------
just it's pretty much just like instant


---------08:24----------
mac and cheese it feels like


---------08:27----------
um


---------08:28----------
so you were looking not for food but you


---------08:30----------
were looking for fuel


---------08:32----------
fuel pretty much yeah yeah i could just


---------08:34----------
play play more


---------08:35----------
um


---------08:37----------
time was lp so like yeah i was just like


---------08:38----------
eating oh like eating one meal at lunch


---------08:41----------
and dinner but then after


---------08:44----------
all of


---------08:45----------
the gaming and like stress that it comes


---------08:47----------
with like solo queuing


---------08:48----------
for


---------08:49----------
12 hours


---------08:50----------
14 hours i would just then like stress


---------08:53----------
eat at night


---------08:54----------
and then stress eat


---------08:58----------
uh depending on like


---------09:00----------
because like doing that it led a lot to


---------09:03----------
doing a lot of assignments last minute


---------09:07----------
so i would stress it while doing


---------09:08----------
homework or studying and then that also


---------09:11----------
lead to just stress eating if it was


---------09:12----------
like a bad night of solo queue as well


---------09:14----------
or like because like back then i'd say


---------09:18----------
middle school high school i was like the


---------09:19----------
first time i was getting like a lot of


---------09:20----------
just like threatening people just like


---------09:22----------
being pissed at you


---------09:24----------
what does that mean


---------09:27----------
who's threatening that sounds scary


---------09:29----------
or it's like


---------09:30----------
uh league of legends solo queue um


---------09:33----------
especially


---------09:34----------
i don't know about other rings but like


---------09:36----------
it felt like high diamond everyone just


---------09:38----------
like was so hungry to win


---------09:40----------
because it was just like it was really


---------09:42----------
hype in like season two and season three


---------09:45----------
um


---------09:46----------
[Music]


---------09:47----------
i i believe


---------09:48----------
season three i was diamond one


---------09:52----------
uh and yeah it was just like it just


---------09:54----------
felt like a lot of people were just


---------09:56----------
stressed as well and just like taking it


---------09:57----------
on others


---------09:58----------
i see so so but you mean like by


---------10:01----------
threatening people we're talking about


---------10:02----------
people playing league of legends not


---------10:04----------
like


---------10:04----------
some some dude who's like i'mma [ __ ] you


---------10:07----------
up like in in high school


---------10:10----------
no oh no no no no no no yeah and league


---------10:12----------
and league okay i said cause i was like


---------10:15----------
i didn't know if we're talking about


---------10:16----------
like a physical abuse situation or


---------10:19----------
bullying or like you know you gotta jump


---------10:21----------
or like what's okay sorry i just called


---------10:24----------
like a surfer chill like it was not that


---------10:26----------
bad so people are mauling at you on on


---------10:29----------
league and it sounds


---------10:30----------
i mean it sounds i don't mean to


---------10:32----------
downplay the stress that no one causes


---------10:36----------
but i just i was just confused for a


---------10:38----------
second


---------10:40----------
so so everyone everyone is like super


---------10:42----------
stressed out everyone's hungry to win on


---------10:44----------
league and like if they don't win like


---------10:46----------
they're maulding and they're gonna take


---------10:47----------
it out on you


---------10:49----------
yeah and it was very new to me because i


---------10:51----------
came from like mmos and


---------10:53----------
yeah i came from like mmorpgs and like


---------10:55----------
rhythm games so there's like a new space


---------10:57----------
because i never played cod so i'm sure


---------10:59----------
like everyone is used to like


---------11:01----------
yelling at each other but i'm like


---------11:03----------
taking everything personally like whoa


---------11:04----------
dude just let's calm down yeah and so


---------11:07----------
play the game


---------11:08----------
and and so you would try to say that but


---------11:10----------
i i'm hearing that it would actually


---------11:12----------
like kind of like the toxicity would


---------11:13----------
sort of affect you like it would get to


---------11:15----------
you oh no it went into me i be i became


---------11:17----------
one with the with the rage wow


---------11:21----------
about that through like


---------11:23----------
early or like uh end of middle school


---------11:25----------
and like early high school


---------11:27----------
um you just i don't know it's like


---------11:28----------
you're like engulfed


---------11:31----------
you're just you're you're just seeing


---------11:32----------
red


---------11:34----------
and then like


---------11:36----------
you just want to do like i feel like


---------11:39----------
what you've the pain you've been


---------11:40----------
inflicted with and also just the


---------11:42----------
frustrations it's so much easier just


---------11:44----------
like put on someone else than yourself


---------11:48----------
displacing the pain and rage


---------11:50----------
yeah but then like at the same time i'm


---------11:52----------
like if i can't take responsibility for


---------11:53----------
mistakes i make in game i can't imagine


---------11:55----------
like what i'm gonna be like in real life


---------11:57----------
so just kind of like


---------12:00----------
i feel like that anchored me off of it


---------12:02----------
or that took me off of it anchored you


---------12:04----------
off of it or or not anchored me off


---------12:07----------
that anchored me i guess


---------12:09----------
so so you're saying that that saying if


---------12:11----------
i can't take responsibility in the game


---------12:13----------
i won't be able to take responsibility


---------12:14----------
in life that thought was beneficial for


---------12:17----------
you


---------12:17----------
yeah okay


---------12:20----------
um


---------12:21----------
okay


---------12:23----------
so sounds like people are being toxic


---------12:25----------
towards you


---------12:26----------
on the one hand you kind of become one


---------12:29----------
with the rage and you see red can you


---------12:31----------
help me understand what's what that


---------12:33----------
looks like or what that feels like or


---------12:35----------
what's going on in your head when you


---------12:37----------
become one with it


---------12:43----------
you're just pissed i i feel like uh


---------12:47----------
any stereotype and like a


---------12:50----------
just thinking like tv shows or movies


---------12:51----------
like an abusive


---------12:56----------
like an abusive dude just like kind of


---------12:59----------
deflecting and like projecting


---------13:02----------
everything


---------13:03----------
it's all really doing that


---------13:06----------
and projecting what does that help me


---------13:08----------
understand what does that look like how


---------13:09----------
are you doing that


---------13:12----------
instead of just like


---------13:16----------
if you're losing the game


---------13:21----------
what games should you play


---------13:22----------
because i'm sure like you've experienced


---------13:23----------
it i'm just making sure sure sure if


---------13:25----------
you'd be experiencing it so so i i play


---------13:27----------
i play dota


---------13:29----------
more so than league


---------13:30----------
um so we're mortal enemies in that way


---------13:33----------
but


---------13:34----------
um


---------13:35----------
you know but i i absolutely i mean i


---------13:37----------
think i think league is a great game i


---------13:38----------
think valerian's a great game


---------13:40----------
um


---------13:41----------
never played cs go


---------13:44----------
uh it seems like arcane is way better


---------13:46----------
than dragon's blood


---------13:48----------
but i'm looking forward to watching it


---------13:49----------
oh yeah


---------13:50----------
so i i play primarily single player rpgs


---------13:53----------
dota


---------13:55----------
um


---------13:56----------
yeah


---------13:57----------
and then let me think about what else i


---------13:59----------
play like i like a lot of co-op


---------14:01----------
multiplayer games like deep rock


---------14:02----------
galactic


---------14:04----------
um


---------14:05----------
things like that but


---------14:07----------
if that helps you it in dota imagine the


---------14:09----------
dude


---------14:10----------
that is just going in is there a jungler


---------14:13----------
not really but if there is everyone's


---------14:16----------
raging let's put it that way yeah


---------14:18----------
it's not it's not supposed to be a role


---------14:20----------
but sometimes in games it becomes a role


---------14:23----------
i'm just trying to think of examples


---------14:25----------
there's times where like


---------14:28----------
i just randomly like throw it on bot


---------14:29----------
lane because they're just getting dope


---------14:30----------
but like that's the natural state of bot


---------14:32----------
lane which has always been like that


---------14:34----------
jungler's just getting out pathed and


---------14:36----------
then like i would have to point it out


---------14:38----------
because i'm just like frustrated at the


---------14:40----------
fact that he's getting out past but like


---------14:42----------
i could have easily helped him um


---------14:45----------
if the person was toxic back though


---------14:47----------
that's where like


---------14:49----------
i would always like match that energy


---------14:50----------
yeah if it's obvious


---------14:52----------
if he's open this level then i'm coming


---------14:54----------
in too like i'm going i'm going one step


---------14:56----------
above yeah


---------14:59----------
i'm almost noticing some amount of like


---------15:01----------
energy absorption and then energy


---------15:03----------
reflection


---------15:05----------
adaptive


---------15:07----------
yeah i mean it almost reminds me of like


---------15:09----------
altimeters from fighting games where


---------15:11----------
it's like the more damage you take like


---------15:13----------
they they think they're winning because


---------15:14----------
you're at 10 health they don't


---------15:16----------
understand that you're about to


---------15:18----------
ko them from 100 to zero with your alt


---------15:21----------
i'm about to dissect their stats and all


---------15:23----------
that yeah yeah you're gonna you know


---------15:24----------
there's there's no there's no winning


---------15:26----------
you and the harder they fight the more


---------15:28----------
they're gonna get destroyed


---------15:30----------
they just need to understand that


---------15:31----------
they're they're getting out passed or


---------15:33----------
whatever as a jungler


---------15:35----------
it well yeah it was it was a weird time


---------15:38----------
yeah pretty much though


---------15:40----------
and and so help me understand this this


---------15:42----------
term stress eating why do you call it


---------15:44----------
stress eating


---------15:47----------
uh because i always have just like


---------15:49----------
coping it's like


---------15:50----------
i am technically hungry my stomach is


---------15:53----------
if


---------15:54----------
it is growling it's like this pain like


---------15:57----------
i need a okay my stomach needs to be


---------15:58----------
filled up


---------15:59----------
um


---------16:02----------
and i would just eat so much


---------16:04----------
that i think i got to the point it was


---------16:05----------
like a normal to just be like so full


---------16:08----------
to somewhat


---------16:10----------
some points like almost throwing up but


---------16:11----------
like


---------16:12----------
i kind of got comfortable with that


---------16:13----------
feeling i feel like that's where the


---------16:15----------
binge eating sort of like was born or


---------16:17----------
they kind of settled


---------16:19----------
and and so you so when you call it a


---------16:21----------
binge eating disorder just to clarify


---------16:22----------
and by the way we're coming up on one of


---------16:24----------
the boundaries that you don't have to


---------16:25----------
answer i'm curious have you ever


---------16:27----------
actually been diagnosed by a


---------16:28----------
professional or this is just the way


---------16:30----------
that you describe it


---------16:32----------
oh no i was never diagnosed by a


---------16:33----------
professional i just think the way i


---------16:35----------
always


---------16:36----------
yeah like self-reflection okay


---------16:39----------
um


---------16:41----------
so


---------16:43----------
so and so you you would eat to the point


---------16:45----------
like what would you eat after like a


---------16:47----------
12-hour league binge


---------16:50----------
high school


---------16:51----------
it was a lot of rice rice was like the


---------16:53----------
big i think just carbs in general


---------16:55----------
i think i think carbs is the easiest way


---------16:56----------
to sum it up


---------16:58----------
pasta spaghetti


---------17:01----------
um


---------17:02----------
right like like paint me like if i


---------17:04----------
walked in so if you're playing league


---------17:06----------
for 12 hours i'm assuming that this is


---------17:08----------
like midnight


---------17:10----------
yeah midnight to him so if i was a


---------17:12----------
burglar


---------17:14----------
hiding in your house what would i see


---------17:17----------
john do


---------17:18----------
i just got a bowl of rice on my desk i'm


---------17:20----------
just doing whatever i need to do i'm


---------17:22----------
just like working it down


---------17:24----------
just eating straight up rice like just


---------17:26----------
uh just cheesy rice okay or just


---------17:30----------
uh marinara nothing like no angel hair


---------17:32----------
just like regular spaghetti pasta um


---------17:36----------
after streaming it came it turned like


---------17:38----------
some like mcdonald's sometimes even


---------17:39----------
pizza


---------17:40----------
but mainly just uh spaghetti


---------17:43----------
okay so and how would you i know it


---------17:45----------
sounds kind of weird but how would you


---------17:46----------
cook it like would you like go down to


---------17:48----------
the kitchen and you'd like boil water


---------17:50----------
and like make pasta and like


---------17:52----------
and then you've got like like a a jar of


---------17:54----------
marinara or something and


---------17:56----------
yeah maybe al dente


---------17:58----------
uh yeah uh


---------18:01----------
that could maybe be indicator if you see


---------18:03----------
like a pasta sauce in the fridge


---------18:05----------
uh but yeah


---------18:06----------
okay so so you'll you'll and but so it


---------18:08----------
sounds like there's actually like kind


---------18:09----------
of a


---------18:11----------
um you know there's like actually ramen


---------18:14----------
i forgot ramen was another one too


---------18:16----------
and and like how many packets of ramen


---------18:18----------
would you eat


---------18:19----------
that'd be like two on a like a really


---------18:21----------
stressful day they could be three


---------18:23----------
okay


---------18:24----------
and and do you have a sense of like how


---------18:27----------
many calories you would consume like in


---------18:30----------
in pasta or cheesy rice


---------18:32----------
in in high school i had no idea what


---------18:34----------
calories were


---------18:35----------
uh


---------18:36----------
it was until like i think senior year


---------18:37----------
that's like


---------18:38----------
i was like oh everything has stats on it


---------18:40----------
like okay cool


---------18:42----------
okay now i can like i can start studying


---------18:44----------
this that's cool


---------18:46----------
okay


---------18:47----------
all right so so yeah so remind me at the


---------18:50----------
end to give you we're going to talk


---------18:52----------
about the stats of food this is


---------18:54----------
brilliant


---------18:55----------
yeah um and there's a formula that i


---------18:57----------
think gamers should follow when trying


---------18:58----------
to pick the stats of their food


---------19:01----------
um so


---------19:03----------
but do you have a sense now in


---------19:04----------
retrospect like how many calories you


---------19:06----------
would eat


---------19:08----------
oh yeah uh oh


---------19:10----------
i'm not sure because i look at old


---------19:12----------
images of me and i thought it was 240


---------19:16----------
but i've reached 220 recently


---------19:19----------
and i definitely didn't look nearly the


---------19:21----------
same weight so like it i think i was


---------19:23----------
like 280


---------19:25----------
in


---------19:27----------
maybe junior year of high school how


---------19:29----------
tall are you john 5 10 and a half


---------19:33----------
and do you know what your bmi is


---------19:35----------
no


---------19:36----------
not nowadays


---------19:37----------
okay


---------19:39----------
um


---------19:40----------
and so okay so like when you say stress


---------19:43----------
eat what i'm really hearing is not


---------19:46----------
i know it sounds kind of weird so i'm


---------19:47----------
hearing that you're eating a large


---------19:49----------
quantity of food


---------19:51----------
yeah i'm not


---------19:53----------
understanding the word stress so like


---------19:55----------
sometimes when i think about binge


---------19:57----------
eating disorder and sometimes when i


---------19:59----------
think about stress eating


---------20:01----------
what i actually sort of think about is


---------20:03----------
pre-packaged calorie dense food or i


---------20:06----------
think about someone like you being super


---------20:08----------
stressed out so they go to the freezer


---------20:10----------
and they grab like a gallon of ice cream


---------20:12----------
and they just go to town on that


---------20:14----------
you know


---------20:15----------
i've also done that too though but like


---------20:16----------
that's like


---------20:18----------
those aren't the


---------20:20----------
the most common ones but i've for sure


---------20:22----------
done that just like randomly like i have


---------20:24----------
to eat some ice cream or something


---------20:25----------
okay and and how often does that like


---------20:28----------
you know pounding twinkies or or going


---------20:30----------
to town on the ice cream like how often


---------20:32----------
does that kind of thing happen


---------20:34----------
uh


---------20:40----------
it happens on like


---------20:45----------
i i think just stressful moments in


---------20:46----------
general uh


---------20:48----------
like during finals it'd pick up


---------20:51----------
recently it's like


---------20:53----------
if i look at my schedule and i only have


---------20:55----------
like maybe


---------20:58----------
one to two days to do uh like have john


---------21:00----------
time


---------21:02----------
um


---------21:04----------
i think that's where it becomes more


---------21:05----------
prevalent yeah


---------21:07----------
okay so so this is when you're truly


---------21:09----------
stressed out


---------21:11----------
yeah


---------21:12----------
okay i think it's just like coping time


---------21:15----------
in general


---------21:16----------
um okay


---------21:19----------
so


---------21:23----------
and and did you notice so when when


---------21:25----------
you're eating let's say like so it seems


---------21:26----------
like when you when you're talking about


---------21:28----------
binge eating what you're referring to is


---------21:30----------
cheesy rice or or you know two to three


---------21:33----------
packs of ramen that's what we're sort of


---------21:34----------
thinking about here is that fair to say


---------21:37----------
yeah okay


---------21:38----------
and and i


---------21:40----------
i know it's going to be kind of a weird


---------21:42----------
question


---------21:43----------
were you eating to not be hungry or were


---------21:47----------
you eating for other reasons


---------21:51----------
uh


---------21:53----------
i would say both


---------21:55----------
there there are times where like


---------21:58----------
thinking like six months ago i was


---------22:01----------
so tired but then like i randomly but i


---------22:04----------
was also so stressed going to sleep


---------22:06----------
and the hunger got so loud to the point


---------22:09----------
like i was lying in bed for like 40


---------22:11----------
minutes and i was just hungry the whole


---------22:12----------
time but i had already ate dinner


---------22:16----------
um


---------22:16----------
[Music]


---------22:18----------
i had a good lunch i had a good dinner


---------22:20----------
and usually that that will be just fine


---------22:22----------
but


---------22:24----------
uh


---------22:25----------
i just had had to get up and eat


---------22:27----------
okay can you tell me about that that's


---------22:29----------
very helpful to hear so like what would


---------22:31----------
you what would be your circumstances


---------22:33----------
like if you can actually paint me a


---------22:34----------
picture or tell me an actual time that


---------22:37----------
would be really really helpful for me so


---------22:39----------
like what's an actual time where you had


---------22:41----------
a decent lunch you had a decent dinner


---------22:43----------
you're laying in bed at night for 40


---------22:45----------
minutes and you're feeling like super


---------22:47----------
super like you got that gnawing hungry


---------22:49----------
feeling like what was going on can you


---------22:51----------
do you remember an actual instance oh


---------22:54----------
yeah like


---------22:55----------
i feel like even last night


---------22:57----------
great um tell me about it


---------23:00----------
uh


---------23:03----------
nothing to throw flame here it's just


---------23:05----------
like i i think i got stressed about like


---------23:06----------
coming on to how the gaming


---------23:08----------
it was something i tried putting off a


---------23:10----------
couple times because i didn't know if i


---------23:12----------
wanted to dive into it


---------23:14----------
sure uh


---------23:16----------
and then i just felt stressed to the


---------23:18----------
point where like


---------23:19----------
i wanted to over like i just wanted to


---------23:21----------
overcome it and i just like


---------23:23----------
we have like cookies in the kitchen i


---------23:25----------
got i grabbed like three of those


---------23:27----------
uh that we had some salami grab a few of


---------23:29----------
those with a


---------23:31----------
uh havarti


---------23:33----------
nice um


---------23:36----------
and then sparkling water because i'm


---------23:38----------
trying to like


---------23:39----------
again calories so i'm like okay zero


---------23:41----------
calories here we'll go with that


---------23:43----------
sometimes i'm more


---------23:45----------
uh


---------23:46----------
wary of what i'm eating


---------23:48----------
uh but some days just like i don't care


---------23:51----------
so so tell me a little bit about the so


---------23:53----------
what were you when you say you were


---------23:55----------
stressed and you were trying to like


---------23:57----------
almost like overcome something like i


---------23:59----------
should come on


---------24:01----------
but


---------24:02----------
if you're saying you should there's a


---------24:04----------
part of you that doesn't want to


---------24:06----------
right there's a part of me that's like


---------24:08----------
uncomfortable with it but it's also a


---------24:09----------
part of me like i want to get on my


---------24:10----------
shell


---------24:12----------
i also want to


---------24:14----------
be able to like share my experiences and


---------24:16----------
also just learn from it alongside of


---------24:18----------
other people that are struggling with


---------24:19----------
the same issues


---------24:21----------
yeah so i understand that you're


---------24:22----------
motivated to come on and we absolutely


---------24:24----------
appreciate that i still want to kind of


---------24:26----------
tunnel into what is your


---------24:29----------
that stress that you feel about coming


---------24:31----------
on today


---------24:33----------
what kind of thoughts do you have in


---------24:34----------
your head like what does that stress


---------24:37----------
look like if i had a window into your


---------24:38----------
mind what would i see


---------24:41----------
or your body


---------24:44----------
i guess just the unknown


---------24:46----------
doing things that i'm not comfortable


---------24:48----------
doing every day


---------24:49----------
like i can go on my stream every day


---------24:50----------
because i just know what's going to


---------24:51----------
happen or like i could have like a rough


---------24:55----------
prediction


---------24:57----------
i had like a good ballpark what would


---------24:58----------
happen on my stream if i did something


---------25:00----------
but on someone else's platform


---------25:03----------
uh


---------25:04----------
just the unknown okay and kind of swan


---------25:06----------
diving do do you have particular fears


---------25:10----------
like does your mind say like oh my god


---------25:12----------
what if this happens or is it just like


---------25:14----------
i don't know what's going to happen


---------25:16----------
i just don't know i don't know what's


---------25:17----------
going to happen


---------25:19----------
and then you start to feel hungry


---------25:21----------
yes


---------25:23----------
and


---------25:24----------
have you noticed a correlation between


---------25:26----------
not knowing what to expect and how


---------25:28----------
hungry you feel


---------25:30----------
is that common


---------25:33----------
i haven't really looked into it


---------25:36----------
i haven't looked into that close


---------25:38----------
to you and so you start to feel hungry


---------25:40----------
even though you've eaten enough food and


---------25:42----------
if for example you are not coming on


---------25:44----------
stream today do you think that last


---------25:45----------
night


---------25:46----------
if you weren't coming on stream


---------25:49----------
do you think you still would have eaten


---------25:50----------
cookies salami in havarti sounds


---------25:53----------
delicious by the way okay oh yeah that's


---------25:54----------
great


---------25:55----------
so uh once i don't think so and once you


---------25:58----------
ate the food how did you feel


---------26:00----------
great


---------26:02----------
how i was like telling oh i'm good uh


---------26:04----------
yeah i was like i felt like i was tucked


---------26:06----------
in i had like my teddy bear went to my


---------26:08----------
bed


---------26:09----------
uh


---------26:11----------
and just like put on some music and they


---------26:13----------
kind of went to sleep


---------26:14----------
okay


---------26:18----------
did you enjoy eating the food


---------26:22----------
there's always guilt with it i think


---------26:23----------
that's the thing


---------26:24----------
there's always going to be guilt with it


---------26:26----------
but yeah i i feel comfy i am like


---------26:29----------
comfortable at that point


---------26:31----------
okay yeah so i know it sounds kind of


---------26:33----------
weird


---------26:34----------
um i understand that you feel


---------26:36----------
comfortable


---------26:38----------
but do you enjoy eating the food


---------26:42----------
oh no no no it's just like all guilt i


---------26:44----------
am like this is no this is nothing for


---------26:47----------
nutritional it's just like pure


---------26:48----------
emotional


---------26:49----------
okay and what does it do for you


---------26:51----------
emotionally


---------26:54----------
simmers me down


---------26:57----------
okay


---------27:01----------
can i think for a second


---------27:03----------
yeah


---------27:05----------
also if it helps in past editions i


---------27:08----------
think during the the streaming phase


---------27:10----------
that's where also


---------27:11----------
uh there's like


---------27:13----------
for sure nicotine addiction and i think


---------27:15----------
that was the coping with stress


---------27:18----------
okay


---------27:20----------
and i think this is what and then it was


---------27:22----------
it was born again after i quit


---------27:25----------
it was what was born again then


---------27:28----------
uh the eating eating came back after


---------27:32----------
yeah i stopped smoking okay so um what


---------27:35----------
i'm sort of hearing is that you tend to


---------27:37----------
bounce around between addictions


---------27:40----------
oh yeah


---------27:41----------
okay so maybe there's something have you


---------27:43----------
ever thought that you have an addictive


---------27:44----------
personality


---------27:46----------
oh yeah


---------27:47----------
addictive uh gaming is always there for


---------27:49----------
addictions but everything else that


---------27:51----------
bounces around for sure


---------27:53----------
um help me understand


---------27:55----------
what what when you when i use the phrase


---------27:58----------
addictive personality and you say oh


---------27:59----------
yeah


---------28:00----------
what is that


---------28:02----------
what do you identify with there like


---------28:04----------
what do you what do you think about like


---------28:06----------
what is it like to have an addictive


---------28:07----------
personality


---------28:09----------
any


---------28:10----------
hobby anything i purchase anything i put


---------28:12----------
my time into anything that


---------28:15----------
gives


---------28:16----------
feels like a


---------28:17----------
dopamine rush anything i like


---------28:20----------
uh even drinking


---------28:21----------
um


---------28:23----------
all of those i have to second guess and


---------28:24----------
look at him like hey


---------28:27----------
is this addictive and like do i really


---------28:29----------
want to dive into this


---------28:30----------
um or should i keep at arm's length so i


---------28:33----------
know like i can't like i can't put


---------28:35----------
myself in a situation to get addicted to


---------28:37----------
let's say like building keyboards i


---------28:40----------
didn't want to buy too much stuff


---------28:42----------
to just like start hoarding


---------28:45----------
um


---------28:47----------
all these things like okay if i don't


---------28:49----------
buy a soldering kit


---------28:51----------
there's no point of me even building


---------28:52----------
keywords at all whereas like i could


---------28:54----------
rent i could rent soldering kits so i


---------28:56----------
know like i should go out of the way to


---------28:58----------
get it


---------28:59----------
uh which would then like slow me down on


---------29:01----------
getting keyboards and like stuff like


---------29:03----------
that


---------29:04----------
i'm almost hearing that you've got like


---------29:06----------
this caged beast


---------29:08----------
inside you


---------29:10----------
and if you


---------29:11----------
let it free


---------29:13----------
you're gonna like lose comp so you set


---------29:15----------
up like almost


---------29:17----------
environmental protections to keep your


---------29:20----------
addictions in check


---------29:22----------
yeah uh especially uh even with alcohol


---------29:24----------
i'd say i'm afraid of like buying too


---------29:26----------
much of that


---------29:28----------
uh or even leaving it like open because


---------29:31----------
like i'm like i don't know i'm afraid i


---------29:33----------
think in


---------29:34----------
in the past i for sure like


---------29:37----------
i dove into that as a coping


---------29:39----------
but then i just


---------29:40----------
i felt like [ __ ] so i kind of


---------29:43----------
uh weave off of that


---------29:45----------
uh


---------29:46----------
but even to now like just to make sure


---------29:48----------
it doesn't happen again i just i don't


---------29:50----------
like buying too much alcohol or leaving


---------29:51----------
too much


---------29:53----------
heartache all around


---------29:56----------
john i'm just beginning to notice that


---------30:01----------
you must be living life on high alert


---------30:07----------
like always have to think about


---------30:10----------
you know i'm just noticing that you


---------30:12----------
can't just like let go like you know you


---------30:14----------
can't be free


---------30:15----------
i mean maybe i'm i'm reading too much


---------30:18----------
into it but i'm just trying to put


---------30:19----------
myself in your shoes for a second and


---------30:21----------
like to always you know some people go


---------30:23----------
to the store and they just like buy a


---------30:24----------
six-pack or whatever they don't have to


---------30:26----------
worry about


---------30:27----------
buying too much or buying too little


---------30:30----------
you know some people like on steam you


---------30:32----------
just buy a game and you don't have to


---------30:33----------
think about


---------30:34----------
you know like am i going to lose


---------30:37----------
a year of my life in this like if i'm


---------30:39----------
purchasing a keyboard or i want to pick


---------30:41----------
up a hobby i don't have to think about


---------30:43----------
what if this goes too far like i'm


---------30:45----------
noticing that there's almost always some


---------30:48----------
part of you that


---------30:49----------
i don't know if it's almost always but


---------30:50----------
it feels to me like it's like


---------30:52----------
on guard


---------30:54----------
i see it as a good map awareness i don't


---------30:57----------
know


---------30:58----------
uh


---------30:59----------
but yeah it


---------31:01----------
that it does sound a lot stressful


---------31:04----------
thinking about it


---------31:05----------
so so i totally agree it's good map


---------31:07----------
awareness


---------31:08----------
right that's that's brilliant


---------31:10----------
the outside is a and at the same time is


---------31:13----------
it does it keep you from relaxing


---------31:18----------
that's a new realization i don't know


---------31:20----------
i've never thought about it


---------31:22----------
as like always


---------31:24----------
being tense


---------31:28----------
i'm wondering go ahead yeah


---------31:30----------
all right hearing the uh yeah just the


---------31:32----------
way you said it like someone picking up


---------31:33----------
a six-pack and not having to


---------31:34----------
second-guess it


---------31:36----------
uh the only way i've reflected on it is


---------31:38----------
like


---------31:40----------
people just eating in general


---------31:48----------
like not having the second guess of food


---------31:49----------
i feel like i have to second-guess it i


---------31:51----------
don't


---------31:57----------
i don't know


---------31:58----------
i lost that train of thought but yeah


---------32:01----------
do you ever wish you were different


---------32:07----------
recently no i've come to acceptance that


---------32:09----------
this is just


---------32:10----------
what it's like or what it is it is what


---------32:12----------
it is and i'm just kind of learning ways


---------32:15----------
to adapt around it


---------32:18----------
you say recently


---------32:20----------
yeah what about before


---------32:22----------
oh yeah i wanted it every other way


---------32:26----------
can you tell me about that


---------32:30----------
it was just the


---------32:31----------
i just wanted to be normal


---------32:35----------
the way i put it


---------32:39----------
and what what did normal look like to


---------32:41----------
you


---------32:47----------
uh not having to second guess like


---------32:49----------
eating


---------32:50----------
drinking


---------32:52----------
my environment uh


---------32:55----------
child proofing everything


---------32:57----------
addiction proofing yeah yeah


---------33:03----------
and do you think acceptance is a good


---------33:04----------
thing


---------33:08----------
from all the videos like i i watch a lot


---------33:09----------
of videos for my self-education and


---------33:13----------
it just feels like


---------33:15----------
the most recent one was like the monks


---------33:18----------
uh and it was so fascinating to me


---------33:20----------
um


---------33:23----------
uh and it just felt like acceptance


---------33:25----------
was the only way to


---------33:28----------
not move on but like


---------33:29----------
kind of improve that style that


---------33:31----------
lifestyle and like to grow from it


---------33:34----------
i think except maybe it's not that black


---------33:36----------
and white


---------33:37----------
when i hear that you've accepted this it


---------33:39----------
feels incredibly sad to me


---------33:44----------
what do you think about that


---------33:55----------
it doesn't feel that sad to me like i


---------33:56----------
said


---------33:58----------
uh


---------34:04----------
it does just feel like a lot of


---------34:09----------
it doesn't feel outside of me i feel


---------34:11----------
like


---------34:14----------
it always keeps me motivated to just


---------34:17----------
self-improve


---------34:19----------
and to kind of overcome


---------34:24----------
these hurdles


---------34:29----------
or just like not even hurdles like who i


---------34:31----------
am


---------34:32----------
overcome who you are


---------34:34----------
uh or no that was the same thing


---------34:37----------
uh just kind of


---------34:39----------
learn to


---------34:41----------
be neighbors with it or also just


---------34:44----------
no okay not being neighbors with eating


---------34:47----------
binge eating i want that gone but


---------34:51----------
learn different ways to cope


---------34:55----------
like knitting instead of like oh my i'm


---------34:57----------
so hungry just like start knitting like


---------34:59----------
really aggressively


---------35:00----------
some just some any way to uh calm me


---------35:02----------
down


---------35:04----------
okay


---------35:05----------
i've been looking up different ways for


---------35:07----------
that i i see it's it's clear to me john


---------35:10----------
that you


---------35:12----------
work really hard


---------35:14----------
when it comes to this


---------35:18----------
i'm curious how are you feeling


---------35:20----------
emotionally right now


---------35:24----------
uh


---------35:30----------
brain's like clogged with like


---------35:31----------
i feel like i open up a new pathway um


---------35:34----------
the way you worded with


---------35:36----------
uh uncaging like i'm caged something


---------35:38----------
within me is a caged


---------35:40----------
um


---------35:43----------
and


---------35:44----------
um


---------35:46----------
that like


---------35:48----------
the way my lifestyle is seems very


---------35:49----------
stressful because i always have to


---------35:51----------
second guess


---------35:52----------
what i get into um


---------35:56----------
and yeah uh those two have like very


---------35:58----------
much just


---------36:01----------
uh


---------36:02----------
made me feel a little more emotional but


---------36:04----------
also more


---------36:06----------
relief that i can put more definitions


---------36:07----------
to


---------36:10----------
john


---------36:10----------
do you know what kind of emotions you're


---------36:12----------
feeling


---------36:20----------
oh i don't want to see


---------36:21----------
not sadness just


---------36:24----------
relief maybe


---------36:26----------
that like i have more definitions to


---------36:30----------
i feel like i've been i haven't been


---------36:31----------
finding answers the past year it's more


---------36:33----------
so band-aids


---------36:36----------
i've found different size band-aids to


---------36:39----------
cover different wounds


---------36:42----------
uh


---------36:44----------
and they just keep falling off but like


---------36:46----------
now


---------36:48----------
not surgery but like we're finding just


---------36:50----------
new definitions to


---------36:52----------
what it is


---------36:53----------
yeah i get the sense of believing that


---------36:55----------
you're really tired


---------36:59----------
that you've been working at this for a


---------37:01----------
long time and actually what i hear is


---------37:03----------
acceptance this may sound kind of weird


---------37:05----------
is almost defeat


---------37:07----------
that for a long time you wanted to be


---------37:09----------
different and you kind of resigned


---------37:11----------
yourself that this is always going to be


---------37:13----------
the way that i am


---------37:14----------
even i thought map awareness was


---------37:16----------
brilliant man because map awareness is


---------37:17----------
something that's ingrained in you right


---------37:19----------
it's an awareness it's not something you


---------37:22----------
do


---------37:23----------
it's something that is almost like


---------37:25----------
and and you've lived with this for so


---------37:27----------
long that you've become


---------37:29----------
accustomed to it it is your way of life


---------37:32----------
so even map awareness doesn't even feel


---------37:34----------
stressful to you


---------37:37----------
yeah


---------37:38----------
you know


---------37:40----------
what do you think about that


---------37:47----------
and


---------37:49----------
even acceptance is sort of like


---------37:52----------
well might as well accept it because


---------37:53----------
that part of you that always wanted to


---------37:55----------
be different well you're [ __ ] there


---------37:58----------
because it's never going to be different


---------38:00----------
so might as well accept


---------38:02----------
it and you even catch yourself with some


---------38:05----------
of the health self-help terminology


---------38:07----------
because you're like because that's how


---------38:08----------
you move past it but oh no the monks say


---------38:10----------
you're not supposed to move past it


---------38:13----------
right i see what you're doing there


---------38:14----------
where you're trying really hard to


---------38:15----------
incorporate what they've taught you yeah


---------38:19----------
and i think you're doing it and you're


---------38:21----------
putting these band-aids on but there's


---------38:23----------
still that part of you that


---------38:25----------
is like


---------38:26----------
wounded


---------38:27----------
you're taking that bleed damage


---------38:31----------
i've been ignited


---------38:33----------
uh yeah it's so hard though because like


---------38:36----------
going into it you're hoping it's not a


---------38:38----------
band-aid or


---------38:39----------
you're diving into it as if it's not a


---------38:41----------
band-aid and then


---------38:43----------
you walk in the fog of wards like oh i


---------38:45----------
was a [ __ ] band-aid okay i'm going to


---------38:46----------
rip that off and try the next thing


---------38:48----------
uh


---------38:50----------
how many how many


---------38:52----------
how much


---------38:53----------
how many chances to blunt plunge into


---------38:55----------
the fog of war do you think you have


---------38:57----------
left


---------38:58----------
like how long can you i don't know


---------39:00----------
i'll keep frontlining i don't care uh


---------39:03----------
it just feels like


---------39:05----------
what else do i have to lose


---------39:08----------
at the moment


---------39:13----------
that's about it


---------39:15----------
i feel like i'd rather overcome this


---------39:17----------
than ignore it


---------39:19----------
of course


---------39:25----------
let me can i think for a second how are


---------39:27----------
you doing by the way we you is okay


---------39:29----------
oh it's strong it's powerful i'm just


---------39:31----------
i'm shaking it off you know okay let's


---------39:32----------
do a little stretching you can you can


---------39:34----------
think for a bit


---------39:35----------
let me know if you need a penis joke to


---------39:37----------
elevate the mood


---------39:38----------
i'll take one actually that sounds great


---------39:40----------
oh god now i gotta come up with a penis


---------39:42----------
joke okay


---------39:43----------
we'll come back to the penis stroke you


---------39:44----------
can you can do whatever you're thinking


---------39:46----------
about no i'm sure i've got one somewhere


---------39:48----------
in there you know uh


---------39:51----------
here's one there's a penis somewhere


---------39:52----------
inside me i just have to find it


---------40:09----------
yeah i'm gonna need a second


---------40:21----------
um


---------40:33----------
so i'm gonna just


---------40:35----------
i'm gonna switch gears in a second john


---------40:38----------
unless you have questions but i'm gonna


---------40:40----------
kind of leave us with just this


---------40:42----------
sentiment


---------40:44----------
what choice do i have


---------40:47----------
okay


---------40:48----------
right i i want to just highlight that


---------40:50----------
because i it feels really important to


---------40:52----------
me in terms of what drives you i think


---------40:54----------
there's


---------40:56----------
some amount of like


---------40:58----------
desperation isn't really the there's


---------41:00----------
some amount of inevitability


---------41:02----------
right because you don't want to you


---------41:04----------
don't want to give in to it


---------41:06----------
and yet


---------41:07----------
every time you you swan dive or invade


---------41:10----------
the fog of war


---------41:11----------
it turns out that their team is there


---------41:14----------
gg noob


---------41:16----------
you're you're making a you're making a


---------41:18----------
move to try to salvage the game and it's


---------41:19----------
like back to the fountain [ __ ]


---------41:22----------
thanks for trying and then you respawn


---------41:26----------
right and it's like oh let's try this


---------41:27----------
move and then it's like guess what


---------41:31----------
we're still here


---------41:32----------
gigi moved back to the fountain


---------41:36----------
and so there's something


---------41:38----------
you know there's there's something kind


---------41:40----------
of like tiring about that right there's


---------41:43----------
something


---------41:44----------
frustrating about


---------41:45----------
applying band-aid after band-aid after


---------41:47----------
band-aid and trying and trying and


---------41:49----------
trying and kind of like still


---------41:52----------
sort of going back to square one


---------41:54----------
i do think objectively it's clear you've


---------41:57----------
made a lot of progress i think you also


---------41:59----------
acknowledge i imagine that you've made a


---------42:01----------
lot of progress


---------42:02----------
like i think you probably have a lot to


---------42:04----------
be proud of or no


---------42:07----------
uh


---------42:09----------
the only progress i've kind of come to


---------42:11----------
or like been proud of identifying


---------42:14----------
like


---------42:19----------
identifying it and like catching it in


---------42:21----------
the moment like okay if i eat this it's


---------42:24----------
emotionally not for nutrition and like


---------42:27----------
okay and then like i start nomin but


---------42:30----------
okay good that's actually huge


---------42:32----------
so so this is the other thing john i


---------42:33----------
want to point out to you is like you


---------42:35----------
catch your words a lot


---------42:37----------
and i i think that's really important


---------42:39----------
because i think what you mean to i think


---------42:42----------
instinct there's a part of you that


---------42:43----------
really feels like


---------42:45----------
the only progress that i've been able to


---------42:47----------
come to terms with the only progress


---------42:48----------
that i've been able to convince myself


---------42:50----------
is progress


---------42:52----------
right does that make sense like i don't


---------42:54----------
think that that's uh it's not like it's


---------42:56----------
not like you're bad at english


---------42:59----------
right


---------43:00----------
well


---------43:01----------
uh


---------43:03----------
i'm all right no no you're


---------43:05----------
i think this is important because so


---------43:07----------
your neuro-linguistic circuits of the


---------43:10----------
brain


---------43:11----------
pick the appropriate words


---------43:14----------
and so when we're feeling a particular


---------43:16----------
way


---------43:17----------
right like when we're raging at our


---------43:18----------
jungler for like not being in the right


---------43:21----------
place at the right time it picks the


---------43:23----------
appropriate word that captures what we


---------43:25----------
feel whether it's right or wrong does


---------43:28----------
that make sense


---------43:29----------
so the language we use is an insight


---------43:32----------
into like how we actually feel


---------43:35----------
and what i'm hearing is


---------43:37----------
the kind of a thread is that you've been


---------43:41----------
watching all these monks for so long


---------43:43----------
that you're like you're trying to shape


---------43:45----------
your neural linguistic programming


---------43:47----------
oh okay monks is like a


---------43:50----------
it's been like a two-week thing now like


---------43:51----------
it's like a week wait but


---------43:54----------
you've been band-aiding this [ __ ] for a


---------43:55----------
while


---------43:56----------
yeah and and so i think it's that's why


---------43:59----------
i think actually it's huge progress to


---------44:01----------
recognize the emotional awareness so i


---------44:03----------
think the next step is to recognize


---------44:05----------
how do you authentically feel about this


---------44:07----------
and like


---------44:08----------
because i think that's gonna be how we


---------44:10----------
ultimately you know


---------44:12----------
suture the wound closed and i think


---------44:14----------
that's maybe what you're looking for


---------44:16----------
um sutures instead of band-aids


---------44:20----------
uh it's it's it is mostly that i would


---------44:22----------
say and you are right


---------44:24----------
there's also times where like i haven't


---------44:26----------
really


---------44:27----------
sat with the thought yet


---------44:29----------
um


---------44:31----------
and


---------44:32----------
i am putting it one way but i also


---------44:34----------
actually mean it a different way if that


---------44:36----------
makes sense okay yeah


---------44:37----------
i'll if you say that then i'll accept


---------44:39----------
that and not


---------44:40----------
overly


---------44:42----------
analyze what you're saying but


---------44:44----------
i do think you are right about the


---------44:47----------
coming to terms and catching that yeah


---------44:50----------
okay


---------44:52----------
so uh john can you tell me a little bit


---------44:53----------
about your upbringing


---------44:56----------
um


---------44:58----------
within birth or streaming


---------45:01----------
let's start with birth


---------45:02----------
okay and we'll get to streaming okay


---------45:07----------
um


---------45:08----------
i was born and raised in central


---------45:10----------
california uh slow county


---------45:13----------
[Music]


---------45:16----------
where is central california help me


---------45:17----------
understand what that means


---------45:19----------
uh well i ever talked about norcal socal


---------45:22----------
but


---------45:23----------
i'm central cali so like between


---------45:26----------
socal i'm like three hours away from san


---------45:27----------
francisco three hours away from l.a got


---------45:29----------
it like that area um


---------45:34----------
and


---------45:37----------
i went to a


---------45:39----------
christian school from kindergarten to


---------45:42----------
third grade


---------45:44----------
and then from fourth grade to sixth


---------45:47----------
grade i went to a catholic school


---------45:50----------
and then i went to a public school in


---------45:51----------
middle school


---------45:53----------
uh


---------45:54----------
and high school is also public as well


---------45:56----------
um okay


---------45:59----------
i have one older brother


---------46:01----------
my parents are still together


---------46:03----------
uh my mom and dad and


---------46:06----------
i


---------46:08----------
uh my grandma was around a lot she


---------46:10----------
actually moved in i believe


---------46:13----------
when i was in


---------46:14----------
seventh grade middle school


---------46:16----------
that's when she would been


---------46:19----------
and she would always cook for me


---------46:21----------
uh and i think that's where the ramen


---------46:23----------
comes in because she would always cook


---------46:24----------
me ramen


---------46:25----------
but she'd always put way too much butter


---------46:28----------
or olive oil she was italian


---------46:30----------
uh


---------46:31----------
just she just she was she loved olive


---------46:33----------
oil


---------46:35----------
um


---------46:39----------
do you remember how you how it would


---------46:41----------
feel in your stomach when you had ramen


---------46:43----------
with too much olive oil


---------46:47----------
uh


---------46:50----------
dense i don't know uh i didn't really i


---------46:53----------
never never felt stomach it was more so


---------46:55----------
like just mouth just like okay


---------46:57----------
the


---------46:58----------
just too much feel sick


---------47:03----------
no i i always just kind of sat with me


---------47:05----------
okay


---------47:06----------
i always settled and so it helped me


---------47:08----------
understand john what is your ethnicity


---------47:10----------
i'm japanese german and italian


---------47:14----------
and what are your parents


---------47:16----------
my mom's japanese and my dad is german


---------47:18----------
and italian but he recently did a dna


---------47:21----------
test and figured out he's like actually


---------47:22----------
30 french so i don't know


---------47:24----------
okay


---------47:25----------
okay too much now


---------47:27----------
um and what was growing up like for you


---------47:32----------
uh


---------47:34----------
um


---------47:37----------
older brother always had his friends


---------47:39----------
over


---------47:40----------
uh seven years difference


---------47:42----------
it was open door


---------47:44----------
uh i was very fortunate


---------47:46----------
um i was in a very fortunate house


---------47:50----------
and


---------47:51----------
it was two-story and the the bottom


---------47:54----------
floor the basement was like always


---------47:56----------
the cave area and all my brother and his


---------47:58----------
friends would always be in there playing


---------48:00----------
games


---------48:02----------
and i was just being smurfed on for like


---------48:06----------
18 years just trying to play games with


---------48:08----------
them but like i would just get [ __ ] on


---------48:10----------
but i'd always


---------48:12----------
grind the game that we were playing


---------48:14----------
until i was just as good but then


---------48:16----------
they would always swap games so i would


---------48:18----------
just kind of help with that it was just


---------48:20----------
always kind of that way


---------48:21----------
um


---------48:22----------
really fun house though


---------48:25----------
i had a great time


---------48:27----------
um so it sounds like


---------48:29----------
uh


---------48:31----------
what was what was like school grades


---------48:34----------
um


---------48:36----------
it was weird because since i hung out


---------48:37----------
with people seven years of uh with a


---------48:40----------
seven years difference my


---------48:42----------
sense of humor is very different from


---------48:44----------
kids in my into my grade


---------48:46----------
until around


---------48:48----------
fourth grade


---------48:50----------
um


---------48:52----------
i found that group of people that like


---------48:54----------
had the same sense of humor but it also


---------48:56----------
turned out


---------48:57----------
uh my best friend


---------48:59----------
uh he would also hang out with his older


---------49:00----------
cousin which was seven years difference


---------49:02----------
and that my brother


---------49:04----------
was actually going to school with his


---------49:05----------
cousin so it's kind of funny how that


---------49:06----------
worked out


---------49:08----------
girl


---------49:09----------
so


---------49:10----------
uh first kindergarten to third grade was


---------49:12----------
actually insane um i was heavily


---------49:14----------
inspired by my mom because she skipped


---------49:16----------
the second grade or if she skipped the


---------49:17----------
third grade i was like i want to be like


---------49:18----------
that i got to skip a grade now


---------49:20----------
um


---------49:21----------
i remember in the second grade i was


---------49:23----------
actually so fast at math i qualified for


---------49:25----------
a math tournament


---------49:26----------
and i feel like


---------49:27----------
that was the peak of my my school career


---------49:30----------
because as soon as gaming picked up


---------49:32----------
it went downhill


---------49:34----------
um i think even the math team i got like


---------49:36----------
fourth place i'd even get top three


---------49:38----------
but it i just remember my mom being so


---------49:40----------
like


---------49:41----------
my son's a genius like let's go um


---------49:45----------
bad gaming picked up and that's when


---------49:50----------
school got really hard


---------49:52----------
um


---------49:53----------
no stimulation


---------49:56----------
no compete it didn't feel like


---------49:57----------
competition


---------49:58----------
there's like no drive to improve in


---------50:00----------
school


---------50:01----------
uh mainly just to get by


---------50:03----------
uh how'd you feel about that


---------50:07----------
somewhat acceptance like she wants me to


---------50:08----------
be happy but also she wants me to do


---------50:10----------
well because i think


---------50:13----------
when you're raising a kid


---------50:16----------
from her generations like if they're not


---------50:18----------
doing well in school they're not


---------50:19----------
successful


---------50:21----------
but i feel like nowadays she's more so


---------50:22----------
acceptance with like happiness and just


---------50:24----------
health


---------50:25----------
i think she's adapted to that


---------50:27----------
okay


---------50:28----------
i'm wondering and this may be me reading


---------50:30----------
too much into it but it sounds to me


---------50:32----------
like she accepted your gaming the way


---------50:33----------
that you're doing whatever false


---------50:35----------
acceptance you're doing now


---------50:38----------
maybe because streaming ended up working


---------50:40----------
out but yeah sort of


---------50:42----------
accepting it accepting defeat but deep


---------50:45----------
down


---------50:46----------
maybe she came to terms with it


---------50:48----------
yeah


---------50:49----------
uh


---------50:50----------
i'm not yeah maybe


---------50:52----------
not sure um although it does sound like


---------50:55----------
she's she's able to be genuinely happy


---------50:57----------
for you now


---------50:59----------
oh yeah she she tunes in a lot my dad


---------51:02----------
randomly spams my chat


---------51:04----------
he just he's a one one man spammer i


---------51:06----------
have to kind of weird camp at him for


---------51:08----------
that but


---------51:09----------
i'm glad


---------51:11----------
i'm glad they enjoy it


---------51:12----------
what's it like having your parents and


---------51:14----------
and watch what you do


---------51:16----------
uh my parents have always been jokesters


---------51:18----------
mainly my dad my dad's from


---------51:21----------
uh he was a kearney growing up


---------51:23----------
my


---------51:24----------
grandpa was a foot juggler


---------51:25----------
uh


---------51:27----------
i have a circus family uh it was always


---------51:30----------
it's always been jokes um


---------51:32----------
my my fight with my dad's is always like


---------51:35----------
like


---------51:36----------
dad you did this wrong though he's like


---------51:38----------
oh yeah but you were adopted and then we


---------51:39----------
would walk away and then laugh at it


---------51:41----------
are you adopted


---------51:42----------
no oh my dad just likes to like


---------51:45----------
mess with me okay and stuff like that or


---------51:47----------
always joking around so what you're


---------51:48----------
telling me is that you have a genetic


---------51:50----------
advantage at


---------51:51----------
being a twitch streamer like you


---------51:53----------
literally have circus jeans


---------51:56----------
i i guess so i it's entertainment to my


---------51:58----------
family yeah that's it that's that's cool


---------52:01----------
man


---------52:03----------
and and so it seems like i mean were


---------52:05----------
they how would they feel when your


---------52:07----------
grades like how were your grades like in


---------52:09----------
let's say sixth grade fifth grade


---------52:10----------
seventh grade


---------52:17----------
it's so weird uh


---------52:19----------
think about it now i was in this higher


---------52:25----------
i think it was


---------52:27----------
fifth or sixth grade i was in like the


---------52:29----------
higher math


---------52:30----------
class


---------52:31----------
but i saw my best friends in the lower


---------52:33----------
math class i'm like this is this looks


---------52:35----------
way more fun why would i ever want to be


---------52:36----------
in this class i'm like


---------52:39----------
yeah i could do geometry in sixth grade


---------52:40----------
but this is boring as hell this teacher


---------52:42----------
is like so strict and the teacher and


---------52:44----------
they're like they're playing with like


---------52:46----------
cars and stuff i was like i want to go


---------52:47----------
in there


---------52:48----------
they're like talk they're actually


---------52:50----------
they're allowed to talk


---------52:51----------
like in my class i was not allowed to do


---------52:53----------
anything like


---------52:54----------
it was so boring to me and like i would


---------52:56----------
just like


---------52:58----------
i asked my parents like oh i went to my


---------53:00----------
parents like this is way too hard like


---------53:01----------
or like like the class is way too hard i


---------53:03----------
i can't do this and then


---------53:05----------
they talk to the teacher and let me just


---------53:07----------
hang out or not they didn't let me hang


---------53:09----------
out but they let me go to the lawyer


---------53:10----------
class um


---------53:12----------
do you remember i didn't have yeah go


---------53:14----------
ahead i i just did not understand the


---------53:16----------
importance of


---------53:18----------
uh the higher math class i'd say


---------53:20----------
i feel like i should just


---------53:22----------
found more transparency within that with


---------53:24----------
my family but yeah


---------53:25----------
i opted for fun


---------53:27----------
and did you have a sense of how your


---------53:29----------
parents felt about that


---------53:32----------
there's like oh it's too hard okay we


---------53:34----------
can work on that and they like


---------53:38----------
they just ended up working around it but


---------53:39----------
i feel like


---------53:41----------
as time went on my attention span got


---------53:44----------
lower lower and lower


---------53:47----------
uh to the point like in middle school i


---------53:49----------
had to start getting tutoring


---------53:51----------
but even when that even with that like


---------53:57----------
more restrictions just felt like


---------54:02----------
yes less fun but like also


---------54:06----------
i didn't get to


---------54:09----------
i there's always just less want for


---------54:10----------
school i always wanted there's just


---------54:13----------
i always felt like i wanted a more


---------54:14----------
competitive edge to schooling like i


---------54:16----------
wanted a ladder system really bad


---------54:19----------
in i think eighth grade i was like


---------54:23----------
i would rather just


---------54:24----------
it would have brought out the best part


---------54:26----------
of you


---------54:27----------
yeah i just feel like


---------54:28----------
it felt like i was doing it for nothing


---------54:30----------
um i felt like i was only doing it


---------54:32----------
because


---------54:33----------
social standards


---------54:35----------
for my family did you feel guilty at all


---------54:38----------
and disappointing your parents


---------54:41----------
uh yeah


---------54:43----------
knowing that i wasn't doing one school


---------54:48----------
was always guilty like just getting by


---------54:50----------
like i think it's just season b's but


---------54:52----------
like then my my


---------54:55----------
parents some semesters were like really


---------54:56----------
kicked down like if you don't get at


---------54:58----------
least bees this semester like


---------55:00----------
we at least you see 3.0 you just can't


---------55:03----------
do c's to get by like it's not


---------55:05----------
acceptable


---------55:06----------
uh i think that's where that's when


---------55:08----------
tutoring came in it's a little foggy in


---------55:10----------
the area


---------55:13----------
but


---------55:14----------
it didn't feel great


---------55:17----------
um


---------55:18----------
not getting


---------55:20----------
to the


---------55:22----------
educational standards they wanted


---------55:26----------
felt a bit guilty but my my dad always


---------55:28----------
seemed to understand


---------55:31----------
and actually my mom seemed to understand


---------55:35----------
yeah so


---------55:38----------
kind of a weird question but


---------55:40----------
what was it like to have understanding


---------55:43----------
and parents


---------55:51----------
there's a weird line of a definition of


---------55:53----------
understanding parents as well now i


---------55:55----------
think about it because there's there's a


---------55:56----------
lot of threats to breaking my pc if i


---------55:59----------
didn't get off because they knew i at


---------56:02----------
least had some assignment to do they


---------56:04----------
didn't know what it was like i know


---------56:05----------
there's an assignment somewhere


---------56:07----------
like just just pull it out like get like


---------56:09----------
get off


---------56:11----------
but i'm like the season just reset like


---------56:13----------
this is a big deal


---------56:16----------
big climb big lp gains um


---------56:21----------
uh


---------56:23----------
there's a lot of grounding


---------56:25----------
a lot of grounding


---------56:26----------
uh i think after the grounding and then


---------56:28----------
like i was able to like show hey i can


---------56:30----------
put my grades up


---------56:32----------
uh i got i got 3.0 here


---------56:34----------
uh


---------56:38----------
i guess more i guess i became a lot more


---------56:40----------
rebellious the more restrictions


---------56:42----------
that came around


---------56:45----------
um


---------56:46----------
i remember they took away my pc for


---------56:49----------
two weeks


---------56:51----------
and all i could play with was a rubik's


---------56:53----------
cube


---------56:54----------
uh or go outside


---------56:57----------
but in high school all my friends got


---------56:59----------
expelled due to like drugs or fighting


---------57:03----------
so


---------57:05----------
i didn't get to make closer friends


---------57:07----------
until like maybe junior senior year of


---------57:09----------
high school mm-hmm


---------57:12----------
i did junior year that's when i started


---------57:13----------
making closer friends


---------57:16----------
uh


---------57:18----------
did you feel i remember when the


---------57:20----------
restrictions happened though


---------57:22----------
do you get the sense that i know it's


---------57:24----------
gonna be so i'm going to ask you kind of


---------57:25----------
a leading question here and


---------57:28----------
you know feel free to say no


---------57:30----------
i'd say there's a 20 chance that there's


---------57:32----------
something to this did you feel like


---------57:34----------
guilty for having understanding parents


---------57:39----------
because or maybe not guilty but most


---------57:41----------
people think that having understanding


---------57:43----------
parents is a good thing


---------57:44----------
and leads to like positive emotions


---------57:47----------
i'm i'm wondering if you actually had


---------57:50----------
some kind of unusual opposite experience


---------57:52----------
where you actually felt bad in some way


---------57:54----------
because your parents were so


---------57:56----------
understanding


---------57:58----------
i think i'm explaining it wrong because


---------58:00----------
i definitely never felt like they were


---------58:01----------
understanding


---------58:02----------
they were like definite like outbursts


---------58:05----------
and it actually felt like gaming became


---------58:09----------
like an underground hidden thing like


---------58:12----------
i think


---------58:14----------
sophomore year


---------58:16----------
um


---------58:19----------
sophomore year i made friends with


---------58:22----------
people and like


---------58:24----------
that's when i started making close


---------58:25----------
friends online uh i didn't have a lot of


---------58:27----------
close friends in person maybe like


---------58:29----------
freshman year of high school and uh


---------58:32----------
the only time i could ever concentrate


---------58:33----------
or play games was actually when everyone


---------58:35----------
went to sleep so around 9pm that was the


---------58:38----------
only time i could play games


---------58:41----------
uh


---------58:42----------
it felt very hidden


---------58:43----------
at that point


---------58:45----------
um


---------58:46----------
but then my my parents always noticed i


---------58:48----------
was tired


---------58:49----------
what was it like hiding gaming


---------58:53----------
uh


---------58:56----------
thrilling i don't uh


---------58:58----------
always on edge like even though there


---------59:00----------
are no distractions there's always that


---------59:02----------
thing in the back of my head like like


---------59:03----------
what was that sound like oh it's just a


---------59:05----------
cat okay it's like a cat walking around


---------59:08----------
like that footstep on the staircase like


---------59:11----------
uh


---------59:12----------
like the fight or flight


---------59:14----------
they're just like hiding the game


---------59:16----------
hmm


---------59:18----------
i'm maybe i'm thinking of weekends


---------59:20----------
because weekdays it was actually like


---------59:25----------
i felt like i was on


---------59:27----------
i was always being watched


---------59:30----------
gaming was very restricted


---------59:33----------
i haven't like thought about it in a


---------59:35----------
long time so it's very it's like coming


---------59:37----------
it coming to me in waves


---------59:39----------
the memories


---------59:42----------
sounds like your parents were on guard


---------59:44----------
yeah


---------59:48----------
they didn't know how to restrict gaming


---------59:50----------
they all they knew was like


---------59:52----------
gaming is the issue get rid of it type


---------59:54----------
thing


---------59:56----------
uh


---------59:58----------
but it felt like i always needed to find


---------60:00----------
a way to play games i don't know if it's


---------60:02----------
like out of


---------60:03----------
spite i


---------60:04----------
remember like sneaking my ds and just


---------60:07----------
like


---------60:07----------
playing the garage


---------60:14----------
or even like finding a uh i would like


---------60:17----------
if i knew if i knew if my dad didn't


---------60:19----------
need to use his work laptop


---------60:21----------
um i would use that


---------60:24----------
internet restrictions happened as well


---------60:26----------
my dad is he works in it


---------60:29----------
and he would always find ways to like at


---------60:33----------
on my ip my designated pcip


---------60:36----------
a password would pop up if i opened up


---------60:38----------
any chrome extension or anything it


---------60:39----------
would just block up everything uh and


---------60:42----------
i'd have to that became a game of okay


---------60:44----------
what's the password


---------60:46----------
uh


---------60:48----------
oh my god dad i lost my phone can i use


---------60:50----------
yours to call it


---------60:52----------
because i knew he texted the password to


---------60:53----------
my brother so he could use the internet


---------60:55----------
because he has to work


---------60:58----------
oh my god like oh thank you and like i


---------61:00----------
like looked at the text i'm like oh your


---------61:02----------
password is blah blah blah and i call my


---------61:03----------
phone like oh i found it thank you so


---------61:05----------
much and then


---------61:06----------
8pm comes around i'm back on league


---------61:10----------
it became a game of cat and mouse


---------61:13----------
yeah i think my mom and dad yeah


---------61:17----------
i don't think they knew about that


---------61:18----------
but yeah it went to those extents


---------61:22----------
um john did anything you know anything


---------61:25----------
happen


---------61:26----------
to you that you feel is like emotionally


---------61:28----------
significant


---------61:30----------
like any kind of major things happen to


---------61:33----------
you like in terms of bullying or


---------61:35----------
um


---------61:36----------
you know anything happen around seventh


---------61:38----------
grade sixth grade fifth grade


---------61:41----------
uh that sort of it may not seem


---------61:43----------
significant to outside people but like


---------61:47----------
uh


---------61:48----------
trust issues came around middle school


---------61:50----------
i'd say


---------61:51----------
house bullying


---------61:53----------
i was the only asian school actually in


---------61:56----------
elementary school i was the only asian


---------61:57----------
school only asian guy at school


---------61:59----------
until high school and i met another


---------62:01----------
japanese guy


---------62:04----------
uh


---------62:06----------
uh people like dude like the typical


---------62:08----------
like i'm gonna blindfold you with dental


---------62:10----------
floss or stuff like that


---------62:12----------
uh i always thought there's jokes though


---------62:14----------
because i came from a joking family like


---------62:16----------
i'm like


---------62:17----------
oh i'm gonna sue you or something i


---------62:19----------
don't know i it was just i was a kid um


---------62:25----------
and then or like


---------62:29----------
it always seemed like a joking manner


---------62:30----------
because i doubled down with the jokes


---------62:32----------
the bullying didn't go further


---------62:35----------
yep


---------62:36----------
so you you you became the class clown to


---------62:39----------
protect yourself from the from the


---------62:40----------
bullies


---------62:41----------
sort of


---------62:43----------
maybe not class clown but like you know


---------62:45----------
actually yes though


---------62:47----------
there's a lot of that


---------62:49----------
yeah


---------62:49----------
but i feel like i became friends with


---------62:51----------
the bullies because of it


---------62:58----------
and what about uh you don't have to talk


---------63:00----------
about this if you don't want to i just


---------63:01----------
want to get a broad strokes kind of


---------63:03----------
approach can you tell me a little bit


---------63:04----------
about dating john


---------63:07----------
um


---------63:11----------
dating


---------63:12----------
[Music]


---------63:14----------
interesting girl started around middle


---------63:15----------
school


---------63:17----------
is always


---------63:19----------
uh i feel like i was always the least


---------63:21----------
interested in the group


---------63:24----------
uh


---------63:25----------
i think it was like the outcast the


---------63:27----------
minority


---------63:28----------
but


---------63:31----------
that was okay i didn't really care too


---------63:33----------
much about it when um


---------63:35----------
i had gaming to worry about anyways you


---------63:37----------
know you're about to say league right


---------63:39----------
i had lp on my mind uh


---------63:41----------
or even like i don't know when i'm


---------63:42----------
saying maple story i had like a mesos on


---------63:44----------
my mind guild wars wow like i was i was


---------63:47----------
chilling i i didn't really work too much


---------63:50----------
about it uh


---------63:53----------
i think middle school was like my first


---------63:55----------
instance of bullying even for my closest


---------63:57----------
friends they randomly outcasted me for


---------63:59----------
like a week


---------64:00----------
they threw my backpack


---------64:03----------
i just noticed like it was i don't even


---------64:04----------
know how to explain i don't even know


---------64:05----------
what happened i think it's just kids


---------64:07----------
like i think a rumor got around or


---------64:09----------
something and then they just agree they


---------64:10----------
decided to target me they threw my


---------64:13----------
backpack off a staircase that's like 40


---------64:15----------
steps might to the point where like my


---------64:17----------
binder broke


---------64:19----------
like everything collapsed


---------64:21----------
and that day i also happened to borrow


---------64:23----------
my brother's

amazing um


---------67:57----------
it's the most secure and


---------68:00----------
transparent like


---------68:02----------
confident i've ever felt in any


---------68:03----------

um


---------68:09----------
and john are you happy


---------68:14----------
as a whole i


---------68:17----------
i think so

---------68:19----------
definition to happiness


---------68:21----------
i like being busy


---------68:23----------
i like


---------68:24----------
where i'm at


---------68:26----------

---------68:28----------

---------68:52----------
i'm not satisfied sleep what are you


---------68:54----------
sleeping eating


---------68:55----------
um


---------68:59----------
i i just think i'm never gonna be


---------69:00----------
satisfied until like i get


---------69:02----------
a correct sleeping regiment and like


---------69:06----------
i finally


---------69:09----------
beat the eating


---------69:12----------
uh


---------69:13----------
like my binge eating ah


---------69:16----------
okay


---------69:17----------
um


---------69:18----------
any questions for me


---------69:24----------
how are you doing are you happy


---------69:27----------
how do you feel


---------69:31----------
i'm really enjoying talking to you


---------69:34----------
i appreciate that


---------69:35----------
um


---------69:37----------
yeah i'm happy


---------69:40----------
i


---------69:41----------
yeah


---------69:42----------
i think some things were different about


---------69:44----------
my life but for the most part i'm very


---------69:46----------
happy um


---------69:49----------
i'm glad you're that


---------69:51----------
i think uh yeah and and i think


---------69:53----------
especially in this moment i i


---------69:57----------
i think that yeah i'm really enjoying


---------70:00----------
talking to you and recently we haven't


---------70:01----------
been doing quite as many interviews


---------70:04----------
and i'm really remembering


---------70:06----------
talking to you is making me


---------70:08----------
really remember why i love talking to


---------70:11----------
other people


---------70:14----------
um so i'm i'm really happy about that


---------70:19----------
thank you and i'm happy to hear that


---------70:21----------
any other questions


---------70:25----------
um


---------70:28----------
no nothing's coming to mind


---------70:30----------
okay


---------70:31----------
so


---------70:32----------
i'd like to share some thoughts with you


---------70:33----------
if that's okay


---------70:35----------
okay


---------70:36----------
um


---------70:40----------
let me just think about where to start


---------70:42----------
so


---------70:43----------
you know if you want to get


---------70:45----------
evaluated for an actual eating disorder


---------70:48----------
i think that that's totally fine i think


---------70:50----------
it's not a bad idea


---------70:53----------
although what i'm hearing is


---------70:56----------
i think runs a little bit


---------70:59----------
not necessarily deeper but just


---------71:02----------
i don't think eating disorder captures


---------71:04----------
you very well


---------71:06----------
um generally speaking when evaluating


---------71:09----------
for eating disorders there are a bunch


---------71:10----------
of questions that clinicians would ask


---------71:12----------
which i'm sort of not asking almost on


---------71:14----------
purpose because that's really more of a


---------71:16----------
medical conversation


---------71:20----------
and and i think that what i'm really


---------71:22----------
hearing from you is


---------71:23----------
is and what i think we can talk about


---------71:25----------
today is like


---------71:27----------
what is a human being's relationship


---------71:29----------
with food


---------71:31----------
and i think that's a better way to kind


---------71:33----------
of describe it because i think there's a


---------71:35----------
lot going on here that may not be


---------71:38----------
as simple as an eating disorder


---------71:40----------
so part of what i don't like about the


---------71:42----------
psychiatric system is that it tends to


---------71:45----------
like bucket things i think which can be


---------71:47----------
very helpful in some ways but can also


---------71:49----------
be very restrictive


---------71:51----------
so for example if you get diagnosed with


---------71:53----------
an eating disorder


---------71:54----------
you may go through eating disorder


---------71:56----------
treatment


---------71:58----------
which is find it affecting


---------72:00----------
an eating disorder but there is more


---------72:03----------
going on i believe to your relationship


---------72:05----------
with food


---------72:07----------
that


---------72:09----------
i think needs to be explored


---------72:11----------
so


---------72:12----------
if anything i'm i'm sort of like an


---------72:14----------
addiction psychiatrist so like most of


---------72:16----------
my patients


---------72:17----------
over the last few years have been like


---------72:19----------
related to addictions


---------72:21----------
and this is where if you have an


---------72:22----------
addictive personality like


---------72:25----------
you can treat the eating disorder but i


---------72:27----------
don't know if that's going to fix


---------72:28----------
whatever else you get addicted to does


---------72:30----------
that matter


---------72:32----------
it's just going to go to something else


---------72:33----------
yeah so this is something i haven't gone


---------72:35----------
too into too much detail but it seems


---------72:36----------
like you play whack-a-mole with your


---------72:38----------
addictions


---------72:39----------
does that make sense


---------72:40----------
yeah i like that right so like it's


---------72:43----------
gaming then it's nicotine then it's food


---------72:45----------
there may be other things kind of rolled


---------72:47----------
in


---------72:47----------
and so this is where like we have to


---------72:49----------
have a high level sort of understanding


---------72:52----------
of like what role what is your


---------72:54----------
relationship with food


---------72:57----------
um and and so and also like what does


---------73:00----------
food do for you and then


---------73:03----------
we can start to think about


---------73:06----------
what is it that you need done does that


---------73:08----------
make sense


---------73:09----------
so like food does something for you and


---------73:12----------
that speaks to a need


---------73:14----------
but if you really want to get and then


---------73:15----------
that need gets managed by things besides


---------73:18----------
food so if you really want to overcome


---------73:20----------
this


---------73:22----------
i think it's about understanding what


---------73:24----------
are your core needs and also


---------73:27----------
what are the structures that you've put


---------73:29----------
in place


---------73:30----------
that


---------73:33----------
adapts


---------73:35----------
how can i say this


---------73:37----------
what are the macros that you've


---------73:39----------
programmed to deal with the fact that


---------73:41----------
you suck at something


---------73:44----------
right so like if i don't know how to


---------73:46----------
last hit like i'm going to use a macro


---------73:48----------
and i'm going to develop a macro


---------73:50----------
and and so it's sort of like instead of


---------73:52----------
dealing with the core of the problem


---------73:54----------
like as human beings we build like


---------73:56----------
adaptive structure


---------73:58----------
structures to protect us from it i see


---------74:02----------
so yeah i think that's a good


---------74:05----------
that's a great point instead of uh i


---------74:07----------
feel like i'm avoiding the stress and


---------74:08----------
rather


---------74:09----------
focusing on something


---------74:11----------
that's not the core issue it's if


---------74:13----------
anything just a part of it how do you do


---------74:15----------
that


---------74:17----------
so just tell me what's connecting i'm


---------74:18----------
seeing dots connecting for you so


---------74:20----------
vocalize those for the sake of everyone


---------74:22----------
else who's watching


---------74:23----------
um


---------74:26----------
it feels like uh a root which is the


---------74:29----------
next addiction root is now binge eating


---------74:31----------
to deal with the stress rather than


---------74:33----------
dealing with the core which is the


---------74:34----------
stress


---------74:35----------
i feel like i need to find a way to


---------74:37----------
rather deal with the stress rather than


---------74:38----------
deal with the binge eating because


---------74:39----------
that'll minimize the binge eating in the


---------74:40----------
long run


---------74:41----------
and also maybe


---------74:43----------
ways to cope


---------74:45----------
yeah so


---------74:47----------
and this is where things get a little


---------74:48----------
bit weird because


---------74:51----------
uh okay hold on


---------74:52----------
i just realized i was missing a question


---------74:55----------
that i just thought of go ahead say


---------74:56----------
something here


---------74:57----------
go oh no i was just wondering like if


---------74:59----------
that does that sound about about right


---------75:01----------
that's what we're dealing with yep yep


---------75:03----------
absolutely so i just had an insight john


---------75:05----------
wha what are you


---------75:07----------
has there been a time in your life where


---------75:11----------
so what i'm hearing i'm just going to


---------75:13----------
kind of like start the


---------75:15----------
the more psychological stuff so like


---------75:18----------
basically


---------75:19----------
who used to keep you in check


---------75:22----------
parents who keeps you in check now


---------75:27----------
uh


---------75:28----------
my friends


---------75:29----------
uh


---------75:30----------
myself yep


---------75:33----------
this is you always being on guard


---------75:36----------
right so you have started so like like


---------75:38----------
they used to do this for you


---------75:40----------
and now you've learned how to do it for


---------75:42----------
yourself


---------75:44----------
does that make sense


---------75:45----------
oh yeah


---------75:47----------
yeah that makes sense


---------75:49----------
right so you started doing they came up


---------75:51----------
with a strategy


---------75:53----------
that keeps john from falling apart


---------75:56----------
and that was the strategy that you


---------75:57----------
learned that was the meta in your


---------75:59----------
household


---------76:00----------
which is don't let john go off the rails


---------76:03----------
so they didn't teach restraint they


---------76:05----------
taught restriction


---------76:07----------
and so now in your mind you don't have


---------76:10----------
restraint so you have to use


---------76:13----------
restriction


---------76:14----------
can't get a soldering kit can rent one


---------76:19----------
holy


---------76:20----------
yeah


---------76:22----------
right because if the soldering kit is


---------76:23----------
there i don't know how to not use it


---------76:27----------
so i just need to limit


---------76:30----------
my access to soldering which i've of all


---------76:33----------
of the addictions i've ever heard of


---------76:35----------
you take the cake


---------76:37----------
for a brand new one


---------76:40----------
i've never had someone come into my


---------76:41----------
office and say


---------76:43----------
i'm addicted to making keyboards


---------76:45----------
it's buying uh retail therapy i don't


---------76:48----------
want to buy too much


---------76:51----------
whatever


---------76:52----------
you can call it something else if you


---------76:54----------
want to but you're [ __ ] soldering at


---------76:56----------
it


---------76:58----------
and and years from now


---------77:00----------
like you know your your girlfriend who


---------77:03----------
is then going to be your wife is going


---------77:04----------
to come into a psychiatrist's office and


---------77:06----------
is going to say


---------77:07----------
he was supposed to pick up the kids from


---------77:09----------
school


---------77:10----------
and i found out six hours later that he


---------77:12----------
was in the basement soldering the whole


---------77:14----------
time


---------77:16----------
it got me


---------77:18----------
right


---------77:19----------
so the first thing is that you


---------77:21----------
and so this is then then you come up


---------77:23----------
with the band-aid


---------77:24----------
and but the band-aid is built off of the


---------77:27----------
back of like yours your the meta that


---------77:30----------
you're trying to play with your


---------77:31----------
addictive


---------77:32----------
impulses


---------77:34----------
right so like if you can't if restraint


---------77:36----------
isn't an option and restriction is the


---------77:37----------
only thing now you're like looking for


---------77:39----------
other random [ __ ] but it's like it's


---------77:42----------
like piled on top of like a meta that is


---------77:45----------
formed does that make sense and i think


---------77:47----------
that's why it's not working like it'll


---------77:49----------
work a little bit but it's like


---------77:51----------
an adaptation to an adaptation


---------77:54----------
yeah


---------77:56----------
oh yeah


---------77:58----------
and at some point it's just like i feel


---------78:00----------
like it's diluted


---------78:01----------
or saturated


---------78:04----------
okay yeah what do you what do you mean


---------78:05----------
by that i i don't understand what you


---------78:07----------
meant but it sounds 100 correct


---------78:10----------
uh it just feels like all the band-aid


---------78:13----------
fixes


---------78:18----------
that


---------78:20----------
the power of each restriction feels less


---------78:22----------
and less


---------78:24----------
from this point on it feels like nothing


---------78:26----------
will be solving it it will only be


---------78:28----------
minimizing


---------78:30----------
right so this is where i think some of


---------78:32----------
like


---------78:33----------
this kind of goes back to this like i've


---------78:35----------
come to terms with it like acceptance is


---------78:37----------
the only way and that's [ __ ] sad bro


---------78:40----------
yeah


---------78:41----------
right like you feel that


---------78:43----------
like how


---------78:45----------
terrible like it's it's not acceptance


---------78:47----------
it's defeat


---------78:54----------
yeah


---------78:56----------
if you don't understand that or want to


---------78:58----------
push back you're more than welcome to


---------79:01----------
oh no i totally agree with you on that


---------79:03----------
yeah so it was just very hard like it


---------79:06----------
just


---------79:07----------
everything i like looked into it just


---------79:09----------
felt like it all ended up coming to


---------79:11----------
acceptance


---------79:12----------
because


---------79:13----------
without the acceptance it felt like


---------79:14----------
there's no


---------79:16----------
uh not happiness um


---------79:21----------
living a satisfying life


---------79:23----------
yeah so so and all that stuff is right i


---------79:25----------
think this is the challenge though of


---------79:27----------
like the self-help stuff


---------79:30----------
is that we don't really appreciate that


---------79:32----------
we filter that stuff through our


---------79:35----------
existing


---------79:36----------
meta


---------79:37----------
yeah


---------79:38----------
and so you're you're kind of like you're


---------79:40----------
in this place where like i i know that


---------79:43----------
you know acceptance will help you and


---------79:44----------
will get you to acceptance but this is


---------79:47----------
where like


---------79:48----------
there's there's a there's a


---------79:51----------
sinister amount of defeatism underneath


---------79:54----------
your acceptance there's resignation


---------79:57----------
there's nothing i can do so might as


---------79:59----------
well accept it


---------80:01----------
right it's not like actually empowering


---------80:03----------
it all it's like


---------80:05----------
sure it's a way forward but


---------80:07----------
it's a [ __ ] way forward and and i don't


---------80:09----------
blame you for taking it because that's


---------80:11----------
all we know because you're a smart guy


---------80:14----------
you clearly you know we're a math genius


---------80:17----------
you've succeeded at many different video


---------80:19----------
games you were grinding to the point


---------80:21----------
where


---------80:23----------
you were


---------80:24----------
playing against kids who were seven


---------80:25----------
years older than you which is ridiculous


---------80:28----------
and then they would move games because


---------80:29----------
like the second you get good they can't


---------80:31----------
lose to a kid who's like seven when


---------80:33----------
they're 14. so time to time to switch


---------80:35----------
games


---------80:37----------
right you've risen to become successful


---------80:39----------
as a streamer so you and you i think


---------80:41----------
it's clear that you've done your


---------80:42----------
homework and you try really hard so


---------80:44----------
you've got good stats


---------80:47----------
you've got a good work ethic


---------80:49----------
and and i think you've learned a lot i


---------80:51----------
think the challenge is that it's all


---------80:53----------
been through this existing structure of


---------80:56----------
like understanding


---------80:57----------
your problems which i think is off which


---------80:59----------
is why it feels like a band-aid and it


---------81:00----------
doesn't really work


---------81:02----------
with me


---------81:04----------
yeah so now let's dig into


---------81:06----------
what it is


---------81:08----------
my first question to you or maybe last


---------81:10----------
question to you


---------81:11----------
is has there been a time in your life


---------81:14----------
where you've really gone off the rails


---------81:16----------
and you've learned the price of going


---------81:18----------
off the rails


---------81:20----------
yeah uh


---------81:24----------
it was when i at my peak weight


---------81:26----------
uh i still don't know how much it was


---------81:30----------
but it was like my lowest


---------81:31----------
self-confidence i never wanted to go out


---------81:34----------
uh


---------81:35----------
i could even wear pants


---------81:38----------
i was wearing my is when i wore my dad's


---------81:40----------
shirt i was wearing my dad's


---------81:42----------
double xl


---------81:44----------
and that was like the only shirt that


---------81:45----------
felt comfortable to me


---------81:47----------
that's when i realized


---------81:50----------
that was the only time i let the rails i


---------81:51----------
went off the rails


---------81:54----------
how did it feel to be that person


---------82:00----------
uh i wasn't proud


---------82:03----------
i felt very


---------82:04----------
unhealthy um


---------82:10----------
eating just felt guilty


---------82:12----------
uh but i approached


---------82:17----------
my parents about it and then


---------82:19----------
uh i just learned to from there stop i


---------82:22----------
just stopped drinking calories and like


---------82:24----------
went on from there


---------82:27----------
how did it feel to approach your parents


---------82:31----------
it wasn't really approach it was more so


---------82:33----------
like a suggestion i was like hey


---------82:36----------
would you be open to like sugar-free


---------82:38----------
stuff zero calorie stuff


---------82:41----------
i don't think i ever


---------82:43----------
faced a head-on


---------82:44----------
what are these like i've always beat


---------82:45----------
around the bush


---------82:47----------
they're they're open to it because i


---------82:49----------
feel like we were no we were never the


---------82:51----------
healthiest family


---------82:53----------
um


---------82:55----------
a lot of processed foods not a lot of


---------82:57----------
whole foods until


---------82:59----------
like five years ago we did like a whole


---------83:02----------
food a whole foods diet together i think


---------83:03----------
that's when we learned a lot as a family


---------83:05----------
and that's when i learned a lot about


---------83:07----------
calories


---------83:09----------
okay


---------83:11----------
uh why do you think you beat around the


---------83:13----------
bush


---------83:16----------
uh


---------83:18----------
i just don't like bothering it i always


---------83:20----------
feel like i'm bothering people but


---------83:26----------
i just want to make it more stressful


---------83:28----------
than it is because i want to deal with


---------83:29----------
it i want to deal with the stress


---------83:32----------
and i want to battle it i don't uh


---------83:36----------
uh be a


---------83:38----------
withdrawal from the day


---------83:45----------
or a deposit


---------83:47----------
sorry


---------83:48----------
i'm hearing that you don't want to be a


---------83:50----------
burden


---------83:51----------
yeah


---------83:53----------
even if it takes a small amount i know


---------83:55----------
but


---------83:56----------
yeah i i just feel like i can i should


---------83:58----------
be able to face it


---------84:01----------
which is


---------84:03----------
hypocritical because then i want people


---------84:04----------
to approach me about their things


---------84:07----------
which i've also understood


---------84:09----------
but


---------84:11----------
yeah so


---------84:15----------
this


---------84:16----------
is worth exploring deeper


---------84:20----------
um


---------84:21----------
but this is the thing


---------84:24----------
so like when we talk about the root i


---------84:26----------
feel like this is


---------84:28----------
it so it's going to be weird i'll


---------84:31----------
explain this in a second because i want


---------84:32----------
to leave you with something a little bit


---------84:34----------
more concrete i feel like this is


---------84:36----------
opening a door that we may not have time


---------84:38----------
to open right this second


---------84:41----------
in terms of follow-up if you want to


---------84:43----------
work with a therapist to explore the


---------84:45----------
stuff more we can


---------84:47----------
um i'm wondering if i'm sort of miss


---------84:50----------
missing an opportunity here but i really


---------84:52----------
do think that


---------84:54----------
yeah i think that this is probably a


---------84:55----------
conversation for another day but i'm i'm


---------84:58----------
glad you gave it this much color because


---------84:59----------
i think there's a lot there


---------85:01----------
yeah so there there's a lot about and so


---------85:04----------
i think basically like the reason that


---------85:06----------
you're terrified to let yourself go


---------85:10----------
is because if we think about the way you


---------85:12----------
feel today


---------85:13----------
when we think about the way that you


---------85:15----------
felt wearing your dad's double xxl shirt


---------85:18----------
those are the polar opposites of your


---------85:20----------
life


---------85:23----------
there's like masa yoshi now


---------85:25----------
amazing girlfriend who feels secure


---------85:27----------
professionally successful eating healthy


---------85:30----------
and then there's that guy


---------85:32----------
there's john


---------85:35----------
and and what i'm getting the sense of is


---------85:37----------
that you are terrified of becoming that


---------85:39----------
person again you were resigned that


---------85:42----------
there may be nothing you can do to


---------85:43----------
prevent being that person again


---------85:45----------
and that all of those thoughts and


---------85:47----------
feelings are things that you beat around


---------85:49----------
the bush with


---------85:51----------
so you kind of keep them at arm's length


---------85:53----------
and so like there's some questions that


---------85:55----------
i'll ask


---------85:57----------
which will start to get at that and then


---------85:59----------
you'll start to feel like emotions


---------86:02----------
because there's something inside you


---------86:04----------
that you're just you're terrified of


---------86:05----------
like what so like if we think about why


---------86:07----------
does someone have to be on guard all the


---------86:09----------
time


---------86:10----------
right like why do you need map awareness


---------86:12----------
it's because you're gonna get ganked


---------86:14----------
yeah


---------86:15----------
and and what is what is getting ganked


---------86:18----------
for you


---------86:19----------
and so generally speaking human beings


---------86:21----------
don't randomly fear things


---------86:24----------
they learn to fear things


---------86:27----------
so your fear of


---------86:29----------
going off track comes from some


---------86:32----------
experience that you've had


---------86:34----------
maybe it's gaming


---------86:36----------
maybe it's going to community college


---------86:38----------
maybe it's not


---------86:40----------
living up to your mom's


---------86:42----------
expectations of a math genius


---------86:44----------
and there's a lot of beating around the


---------86:46----------
bush where it's like like even coming to


---------86:48----------
terms with it like your mom probably on


---------86:50----------
some level came to terms that her son is


---------86:52----------
never going to be this thing that for a


---------86:54----------
moment


---------86:55----------
she was like oh my god he's going to be


---------86:57----------
the chosen one and the rest of your life


---------86:59----------
you haven't been the chosen one and i'm


---------87:01----------
guessing that


---------87:03----------
it has been hurtful to be able to see


---------87:05----------
that in her


---------87:08----------
you know in and this is where things can


---------87:09----------
get super confusing because it's clear


---------87:11----------
she loves you it's clear she supports


---------87:13----------
you it's clear she's proud of you


---------87:16----------
so how can she also be disappointed in


---------87:19----------
you


---------87:20----------
it designated with me throughout school


---------87:22----------
i was very much disappointed that i


---------87:25----------
every time not every time but like in


---------87:27----------
the back of my head every time i went on


---------87:28----------
my pc uh she's like


---------87:31----------
i'm not


---------87:34----------
i'm not that kid my mom


---------87:38----------
uh was destined for or deserved okay not


---------87:41----------
dessert um like no dessert


---------87:44----------
nope yeah that's it


---------87:47----------
right and instead she got


---------87:51----------
john


---------87:52----------
yeah right and so that can hurt


---------87:56----------
and and i i don't think that you're


---------87:58----------
wrong when you saw


---------88:00----------
all of the times she was a little bit


---------88:02----------
disappointed in you


---------88:04----------
i think that's why if we talk about you


---------88:06----------
know the one feeling i've asked you


---------88:07----------
multiple times what you feel


---------88:09----------
and there's really only one feeling that


---------88:11----------
you've been able to articulate do you


---------88:13----------
know what it is


---------88:16----------
no guilt


---------88:18----------
everything else i get a brilliant gaming


---------88:20----------
analogy


---------88:21----------
so you understand what you feel you just


---------88:24----------
don't know how to describe it


---------88:27----------
right so you'll use like and that's


---------88:28----------
great i mean you your brain is coming up


---------88:31----------
with a gaming analogy to articulate like


---------88:33----------
what your experience is


---------88:35----------
so there's something going on here where


---------88:37----------
there's like there's some amount of like


---------88:39----------
and here's the thing you


---------88:41----------
you know even if we kind of talk about


---------88:43----------
why you don't want to be a burden to


---------88:44----------
people it's like you don't yeah you know


---------88:47----------
on a weird way like i don't think you


---------88:49----------
really mind too much [ __ ] yourself up


---------88:51----------
i think it's like what you're really


---------88:53----------
concerned about is like not


---------88:54----------
disappointing other people like not


---------88:56----------
letting other people down like the guilt


---------88:58----------
that you feel is not because of the way


---------89:00----------
that you are with yourself it's because


---------89:02----------
of the way that


---------89:03----------
you don't want to inconvenience other


---------89:05----------
people


---------89:07----------
yeah


---------89:08----------
self-sabotage it's definitely that's a


---------89:11----------
hobby of mine


---------89:12----------
what do you mean like that or it just


---------89:14----------
seems like it seems like self-sabotage


---------89:16----------
how so


---------89:19----------
uh


---------89:21----------
having those expectations of myself that


---------89:23----------
i don't


---------89:24----------
um


---------89:26----------
be a burden to others but


---------89:28----------
when people come to me it's not a burden


---------89:29----------
at all i want people to feel comfortable


---------89:31----------
and


---------89:32----------
be open enough


---------89:34----------
yeah


---------89:35----------
so if we kind of look at this like why


---------89:38----------
can't you relax


---------89:39----------
and i think it's because


---------89:41----------
this is where like it all kind of starts


---------89:43----------
to tangle together or come together


---------89:45----------
is like the reason you can never relax


---------89:47----------
is because you never want anyone else to


---------89:50----------
be responsible for keeping you in check


---------89:53----------
so you've never got a safety valve


---------89:55----------
you've never got support you've never


---------89:57----------
got backup you can't call for a lane


---------90:00----------
rotation you're playing league of


---------90:02----------
legends 1v5


---------90:03----------
you can't count on anyone else or you


---------90:06----------
can count on them you just don't want to


---------90:09----------
because then you'll be a burden


---------90:11----------
and then you're you're left like dealing


---------90:13----------
with all this crap on your own


---------90:15----------
like does your girlfriend know that you


---------90:17----------
struggle with eating


---------90:20----------
uh i'm letting her know more and more


---------90:22----------
about it


---------90:23----------
right so if we think about what is that


---------90:26----------
process like for you i think it's a sign


---------90:28----------
of real growth


---------90:29----------
that you're letting her know more and


---------90:31----------
more but i would guess that


---------90:34----------
every bit that you let her know feels


---------90:36----------
like


---------90:37----------
walking through lava


---------90:40----------
that you're going against every instinct


---------90:43----------
or fiber of your being to let her


---------90:44----------
understand that


---------90:47----------
this is something that


---------90:49----------
you're working on


---------90:53----------
because and i would also guess that you


---------90:55----------
feel guilty when you tell her


---------90:58----------
i don't like


---------91:01----------
mentioning why there's alfredo in the


---------91:03----------
fridge


---------91:04----------
or like an open jar of alfredo or like i


---------91:08----------
i


---------91:08----------
even in this new place i've like


---------91:10----------
purposely hid


---------91:11----------
not hid but like in a higher spot


---------91:13----------
because


---------91:14----------
she's a little shorter uh but like in a


---------91:16----------
higher spot like so i didn't have to


---------91:17----------
explain it it's like it's a me thing


---------91:21----------
yeah


---------91:22----------
right so it's a me thing that i'm


---------91:24----------
working on


---------91:25----------
and and that's hard


---------91:28----------
and so i think this is where like i i


---------91:30----------
don't know exactly how this stuff comes


---------91:32----------
together but as we talk about the


---------91:34----------
addictive personality like i think by


---------91:36----------
the way a lot of your eating disorders i


---------91:38----------
mean i don't know it's an eating


---------91:39----------
disorder is is really like gamer eating


---------91:41----------
disorder as opposed to like binge eating


---------91:43----------
disorder i haven't like formally


---------91:44----------
evaluated you but i think there's just


---------91:46----------
like physiologic stuff going on


---------91:49----------
so for example when you play league of


---------91:51----------
legends for 12 hours


---------91:54----------
so this is it's it's interesting so


---------91:56----------
there's even a physiologic like


---------91:58----------
barrier here that's really important so


---------92:00----------
if you game for eight hours you're fine


---------92:04----------
if you game for more than eight hours


---------92:06----------
you're likely your tendency to binge eat


---------92:09----------
is gonna go astronomically higher


---------92:12----------
there's a very simple physiologic reason


---------92:13----------
for this


---------92:15----------
so our liver has this uh stuff called


---------92:19----------
glycogen and glycogen is a carbohydrate


---------92:22----------
store that supplies our body with


---------92:24----------
glucose


---------92:25----------
over


---------92:27----------
over like when we're living so glucose


---------92:29----------
is really really important because it's


---------92:30----------
one of the two


---------92:32----------
um fuel sources that our brain can use


---------92:35----------
yeah and so like we want to preserve


---------92:37----------
glucose it's part of the reason why we


---------92:38----------
love eating carbohydrates because


---------92:40----------
carbohydrates give us glucose so we've


---------92:41----------
evolved to be very sensitive to glucose


---------92:44----------
now the interesting thing about the


---------92:45----------
glycogen stores in your liver is that


---------92:48----------
your body can only store about eight


---------92:50----------
hours of glycogen at a time


---------92:53----------
so if we don't eat for eight hours we'll


---------92:55----------
be fine


---------92:57----------
and then once we cross that eight hour


---------92:59----------
mark our body starts to go into a


---------93:01----------
catabolic phase where we start breaking


---------93:04----------
down muscle and we start entering


---------93:06----------
literally like the first stage of


---------93:07----------
starvation like that's like how it's


---------93:09----------
physiologically described i'm a little


---------93:11----------
bit rusty on this so if there's you know


---------93:13----------
a dietitian or someone out there they


---------93:14----------
may adjust correct me but basically once


---------93:17----------
you cross the eight hour mark your body


---------93:19----------
is literally starving


---------93:21----------
so the the drive to eat changes very


---------93:24----------
drastically after an eight hour period


---------93:27----------
and so yeah


---------93:29----------
yeah so when you're


---------93:30----------
it makes a lot of sense and so i don't i


---------93:32----------
don't even know necessarily that you've


---------93:35----------
a binge eating disorder i think you do


---------93:37----------
binge eat but i think there's a lot of


---------93:39----------
physiology and it's a pattern i see with


---------93:42----------
gamers a lot which is if you play for


---------93:44----------
eight hours without eating anything then


---------93:46----------
like you're gonna feel like famished


---------93:48----------
because your body's literally in


---------93:50----------
starvation and then the signals to eat


---------93:52----------
physiologically and like neurochemically


---------93:55----------
start to change after the eight-hour


---------93:56----------
mark


---------93:58----------
i i think during streamer


---------94:01----------
was it streaming eating disorder


---------94:03----------
i think that was but


---------94:05----------
even last night i had


---------94:07----------
uh for lunch burrito dinner


---------94:10----------
chicken mashed potato broccoli


---------94:12----------
come


---------94:13----------
four to six hours later because i have


---------94:14----------
to go to bed the


---------94:16----------
stress


---------94:17----------
and the the scream for hunger came in


---------94:19----------
yeah so you have that [ __ ] too so this


---------94:22----------
is like they're there this is


---------94:24----------
multi-factorial


---------94:25----------
so okay there's the physiologic thing


---------94:28----------
there's the cheesy rice that you had as


---------94:30----------
an eighth grader


---------94:31----------
right there's that thing going on and


---------94:34----------
there is absolutely an emotional


---------94:36----------
component to eating


---------94:38----------
where there it may even be like a


---------94:40----------
physiologic component there too so this


---------94:42----------
is kind of interesting but when you eat


---------94:44----------
high levels of carbohydrate your insulin


---------94:46----------
level goes up


---------94:48----------
insulin is a hormone that causes you to


---------94:50----------
absorb uh glucose from the blood


---------94:54----------
and the other interesting thing is that


---------94:55----------
insulin is an anabolic hormone which


---------94:57----------
means that it causes you to produce


---------94:59----------
things it's sort of like we're in


---------95:01----------
production mode versus like


---------95:04----------
uh breaking down mode there's anabolism


---------95:06----------
and catabolism so one is like we're


---------95:08----------
storing energy the other was we're using


---------95:10----------
energy


---------95:11----------
so when the other interesting thing is


---------95:13----------
that insulin makes people sleepy so when


---------95:15----------
we eat food and we have a insulin spike


---------95:18----------
we'll get into a food coma so i think


---------95:21----------
that you're physiologically eating


---------95:24----------
salami cookies and havarti


---------95:27----------
to trigger a physiologic response


---------95:30----------
that slows down the thoughts in your


---------95:32----------
head and like literally reduces your


---------95:34----------
stress because that's the effect of like


---------95:37----------
insulin on your mind is that it's gonna


---------95:39----------
kind of like slow things down


---------95:41----------
so there's also a physiologic element to


---------95:43----------
your as you put it stress eating


---------95:46----------
and you've got the more traditional like


---------95:48----------
addictive personality where the way that


---------95:50----------
you manage your emotions is through


---------95:52----------
certain


---------95:54----------
dopaminergic or reinforcing activities


---------95:58----------
um so this can be nicotine it can be


---------96:00----------
food whatever so there's like the more


---------96:02----------
standard like people stress eat which


---------96:03----------
you occasionally do but i think there's


---------96:06----------
actually way more going on with you


---------96:08----------
physiologically than you give yourself


---------96:10----------
credit for i don't think you're just


---------96:12----------
like an addict


---------96:13----------
there's a lot of really interesting


---------96:15----------
physiologic components to your story


---------96:16----------
which kind of stand out to me


---------96:19----------
um


---------96:20----------
thoughts


---------96:21----------
questions that was beautiful that that


---------96:23----------
everything you just said right there was


---------96:24----------
art that was


---------96:27----------
i'm probably have to rewatch the vod to


---------96:29----------
like really let it set in but


---------96:32----------
well said that was


---------96:34----------
very intriguing


---------96:36----------
good i'm glad you you found that


---------96:38----------
beneficial so like that's the


---------96:39----------
physiologic component which is i think


---------96:41----------
part of the downside to self-diagnosis


---------96:43----------
is that there are oftentimes things


---------96:45----------
going on which i don't i don't think


---------96:46----------
you're wrong actually about anything so


---------96:48----------
that's one thing so now so that's just


---------96:50----------
to


---------96:51----------
keep that in mind is that if your stress


---------96:53----------
level is high


---------96:55----------
the coping mechanism that you've learned


---------96:58----------
is


---------96:59----------
to eat food because


---------97:02----------
that's how you sort of calm yourself


---------97:04----------
down physiologically


---------97:05----------
now this is where um let me just think


---------97:08----------
for a second i'm gonna try to tie


---------97:08----------
together a couple of other things so


---------97:10----------
there's like the physiologic component


---------97:12----------
and then there's like the addictive


---------97:13----------
personality thing which may also be like


---------97:16----------
somewhat genetically determined like you


---------97:18----------
may have a sensitivity to dopamine have


---------97:20----------
you ever been evaluated for adhd


---------97:23----------
yeah


---------97:25----------
do you know if you have it or i got i


---------97:27----------
got diagnosed with an adhd combination


---------97:31----------
okay so that doesn't surprise me at all


---------97:33----------
as well because i think the way that you


---------97:35----------
describe your addictive personality


---------97:38----------
is actually a neuroscientific difference


---------97:41----------
that exists in the brains of people with


---------97:43----------
adhd


---------97:44----------
so people with adhd are literally more


---------97:47----------
sensitive to dopamine


---------97:49----------
so


---------97:50----------
the ability of dopamine to swing your


---------97:53----------
behavior one way or the other way


---------97:56----------
like is variable depending on whether


---------97:58----------
you have adhd or not


---------98:01----------
that makes a lot of sense


---------98:02----------
right so you just get


---------98:04----------
you swing very easily like yeah


---------98:08----------
and and so i'm not surprised that you


---------98:10----------
have adhd because the the story that


---------98:13----------
you're describing reminds me of the


---------98:16----------
people that i work with who have adhd


---------98:19----------
so there's a neuroscience component to


---------98:21----------
your quote-unquote addictive personality


---------98:24----------
which has nothing to do with psychology


---------98:26----------
it's not about oh like feelings and


---------98:27----------
guilt and oh my god desperation


---------98:29----------
restraint and it's like it's like


---------98:31----------
literally like the way that your brain


---------98:34----------
it's like an amplification of the


---------98:35----------
dopamine signal


---------98:37----------
compared to the average human being


---------98:40----------
then so there's the physiologic


---------98:42----------
component there's the neuroscientific


---------98:44----------
vulnerability due to adhd and then


---------98:46----------
there's the psychological component


---------98:48----------
which i'm going to circle back to now


---------98:50----------
somewhere along the way


---------98:52----------
you know your parents sort of


---------98:54----------
discovered that the way to keep john in


---------98:56----------
check is like not by understanding his


---------98:59----------
problem because they never asked you


---------99:01----------
right they never were like john like why


---------99:03----------
don't you do your homework


---------99:05----------
like they may have said why don't you do


---------99:06----------
your homework as an expression of


---------99:08----------
frustration yeah but they never sat you


---------99:10----------
down because it seems like you also have


---------99:12----------
a very beat around the bush family


---------99:14----------
communication style where you guys joke


---------99:16----------
about things and you refer to things


---------99:19----------
like your parents know hey what do y'all


---------99:21----------
think about cutting out sugary soda your


---------99:23----------
parents know that they're like oh my son


---------99:25----------
like realizes he's fat


---------99:27----------
but we're not gonna ever tell him that


---------99:29----------
yeah and he's not gonna say that he's


---------99:31----------
not gonna say like i'm losing


---------99:33----------
self-confidence like i'm wearing a shirt


---------99:35----------
and i feel pathetic


---------99:36----------
you're gonna show up and you're gonna be


---------99:38----------
like and then your dad is even gonna


---------99:39----------
crack a joke to make you feel better


---------99:42----------
yeah you know and so that's your thumbs


---------99:44----------
it all up


---------99:45----------
that's your communication style so what


---------99:47----------
that sort of means is that your ability


---------99:49----------
to like actually understand what's going


---------99:52----------
on within you


---------99:54----------
is like sort of not developed and that's


---------99:57----------
not your it's not anyone's fault it's


---------99:59----------
just like you're you're that's not how


---------100:01----------
you all communicated every family


---------100:03----------
communication style has advantages and


---------100:05----------
disadvantages


---------100:06----------
so the upside of your family's


---------100:08----------
communication style for example is that


---------100:10----------
your family is actually very resilient


---------100:12----------
so if people are like super authentic


---------100:14----------
and bad [ __ ] happens it can be like too


---------100:17----------
much


---------100:18----------
so you need the joking ability like


---------100:20----------
joking gives you like trauma resistance


---------100:22----------
for example


---------100:24----------
um but it it may you know it gives you


---------100:27----------
like


---------100:28----------
an introspection debuff and it gives you


---------100:30----------
like trauma resistance


---------100:33----------
so so and this is where there's


---------100:34----------
something going on psychologically where


---------100:36----------
you don't want to feel like a burden you


---------100:38----------
don't feel good about yourself you're


---------100:39----------
terrified of becoming a 280 pound


---------100:42----------
whatever


---------100:44----------
and so those kinds of fears you don't


---------100:46----------
really know like how to


---------100:48----------
meet them head on and so you start to


---------100:50----------
like find random ass solutions on the


---------100:52----------
internet


---------100:53----------
about acceptance


---------100:55----------
but like you're not accepting the right


---------100:57----------
thing you're not accepting what needs to


---------100:59----------
be accepted within yourself you're just


---------101:01----------
like accepting what you're accepting is


---------101:03----------
that you're going to be powerless and


---------101:04----------
you've got to restrict yourself in gg


---------101:05----------
noob


---------101:06----------
right you're you're like resigning


---------101:08----------
yourself to just like losing mmr which


---------101:10----------
is like the wrong thing to accept which


---------101:11----------
is why acceptance isn't working and this


---------101:13----------
is the whole problem with like the


---------101:14----------
acceptance movements people like accept


---------101:16----------
but it's like accept what


---------101:18----------
and if you accept the wrong [ __ ]


---------101:20----------
thing like you're not gonna get better


---------101:25----------
damn that's so true yeah


---------101:27----------
so it's like i don't even know like what


---------101:29----------
are you


---------101:31----------
the acceptance movement is like the


---------101:33----------
perfect wording for it


---------101:35----------
it like everything i do come across as


---------101:37----------
it boils down to acceptance but but what


---------101:39----------
are you like i'm asking not rhetorically


---------101:41----------
not philosophically like when you say


---------101:44----------
like i'm ex i'm trying to be more like


---------101:46----------
what are you accepting what is it that


---------101:47----------
you're accepting what


---------101:49----------
the idea is like i'm accepting john


---------101:52----------
like we're


---------101:53----------
mostly changed shaking hands as the way


---------101:55----------
you put it


---------101:56----------
if there were are you accepting john


---------101:59----------
yeah like working together you know


---------102:01----------
like hey i i uh


---------102:04----------
i'm introverted and i like recharge when


---------102:06----------
i'm alone like we're just working


---------102:08----------
together


---------102:08----------
i'm like okay we can do that we can go


---------102:10----------
we can go hang out and like not


---------102:13----------
maybe play games because i'm afraid of


---------102:14----------
uh let's do a little bit of a dopamine


---------102:16----------
detox let's like just chill out for a


---------102:17----------
bit stare look at look at the window


---------102:20----------
like all right yeah we could do that


---------102:22----------
yes


---------102:24----------
okay so that sounds actually pretty


---------102:26----------
healthy so i think you're actually on


---------102:27----------
the right track and i would say that you


---------102:29----------
know when you talk to your girlfriend


---------102:31----------
that feels to me like the right kind of


---------102:33----------
acceptance


---------102:36----------
does that make sense to you


---------102:38----------
yeah


---------102:39----------
she's giving me the space to talk about


---------102:41----------
talk about pretty much anything it's


---------102:42----------
just like a matter of do i have the


---------102:44----------
strength or


---------102:46----------
to do it yeah the strength good so so


---------102:47----------
here's the reason i think that's really


---------102:49----------
good because


---------102:50----------
in order to tell your girlfriend


---------102:52----------
something you have to accept it first


---------102:54----------
right you're telling her hey this is how


---------102:56----------
it is


---------102:58----------
you with me and so you can't say this is


---------103:01----------
how it is


---------103:02----------
you there would be no conversations that


---------103:04----------
induced guilt with your girlfriend if


---------103:05----------
you were in denial


---------103:07----------
does that make sense so like a


---------103:09----------
prerequisite to talking to your


---------103:11----------
girlfriend is


---------103:13----------
the acceptance and when you say you're


---------103:15----------
letting her know little bit by little


---------103:18----------
bit


---------103:18----------
you're not letting her know a little bit


---------103:20----------
by a little bit you are accepting little


---------103:22----------
bit by little bit because every time you


---------103:24----------
tell her you're actually owning a piece


---------103:26----------
of it


---------103:30----------
wow yeah


---------103:32----------
that makes sense


---------103:33----------
right because like that's when you're


---------103:35----------
like hey this is how it is


---------103:38----------
that is what acceptance means


---------103:40----------
it's like


---------103:42----------
now


---------103:42----------
the the


---------103:44----------
okay


---------103:44----------
questions with me so far


---------103:46----------
yeah yeah okay so going forward for you


---------103:50----------
john i think that um if you want to get


---------103:52----------
a tackle on your eating behaviors


---------103:56----------
it's going to be an appreciation of the


---------103:57----------
physiology which i think you've managed


---------103:59----------
to shortcut right because when you have


---------104:01----------
lunch when you have dinner you're not


---------104:02----------
going into that first stage of


---------104:04----------
starvation anymore engorging yourself on


---------104:06----------
cheesy rice you know you were also


---------104:08----------
saying that even though you eat cheesy


---------104:09----------
rice you feel almost like throwing up so


---------104:12----------
why wouldn't your body stop it's because


---------104:14----------
it's got a starvation mechanism going on


---------104:17----------
and in starvation what your body is


---------104:19----------
doing is like they don't want to stop


---------104:20----------
when you're full


---------104:22----------
they want to stop


---------104:24----------
when


---------104:25----------
they want to go as far as we can without


---------104:28----------
throwing up even if you feel


---------104:29----------
uncomfortable because come tomorrow


---------104:31----------
there's going to be another famine


---------104:33----------
so what your body is doing in terms of


---------104:35----------
how it determines how much to eat is


---------104:37----------
it's like there's going to be famine


---------104:38----------
tomorrow there's going to be famine


---------104:40----------
tomorrow there's going to be famine


---------104:41----------
tomorrow we go 12 hours without a meal


---------104:43----------
so we we got to pack in as much as we


---------104:46----------
can


---------104:48----------
and like you're eating a [ __ ] bowl of


---------104:50----------
cheese and rice like that's not


---------104:52----------
that's not binge eating psychology


---------104:54----------
that's like my body is starving


---------105:00----------
right


---------105:01----------
but it feels weird because like i've


---------105:03----------
already had full meals


---------105:05----------
prior to all to everything but this i'm


---------105:08----------
talking about this is like seventh grade


---------105:11----------
you where you wouldn't eat for 12 hours


---------105:13----------
right


---------105:15----------
yeah i


---------105:16----------
or whenever you wouldn't eat for 12


---------105:18----------
hours and would eat cheese yeah maybe


---------105:19----------
that's good to would stop if i would


---------105:20----------
snack


---------105:21----------
or i feel like i'd drink calories but


---------105:23----------
maybe yeah that doesn't count as meals


---------105:25----------
yeah that makes sense


---------105:26----------
so yeah there's there's physiologic


---------105:28----------
stuff if you're describing a scenario


---------105:29----------
where you go past the glycogen window in


---------105:31----------
the liver and then you go for hours


---------105:33----------
after that your body is literally in the


---------105:35----------
first stage of starvation and your food


---------105:38----------
drivers your consumption drivers are


---------105:40----------
going to change drastically


---------105:42----------
especially if this is a pattern that


---------105:44----------
gets repeated over and over and over


---------105:45----------
again because then it's almost like


---------105:47----------
intermittent fasting where your body


---------105:49----------
like knows


---------105:51----------
that we're not gonna get food tomorrow


---------105:53----------
so we get a better pile up today


---------105:56----------
wow that's crazy


---------105:58----------
so what you're perceiving is an


---------106:00----------
addiction you call it an addiction


---------106:02----------
because it's really hard to kick


---------106:04----------
but it's not an addiction it's a


---------106:06----------
survival mechanism which is absolutely


---------106:08----------
hard to kick because that's how your


---------106:10----------
body has


---------106:11----------
evolved to survive starvation


---------106:19----------
it's a crazy realization to come to


---------106:21----------
terms with


---------106:23----------
because like


---------106:24----------
i thought i had identified with this


---------106:26----------
because there's so many like


---------106:28----------
similarities


---------106:32----------
almost one to one but


---------106:33----------
that makes so much sense because like i


---------106:36----------
i was like this feels like a habit like


---------106:38----------
or like i this feels like a habit rather


---------106:40----------
than a


---------106:41----------
instinct at this point


---------106:43----------
yeah and i so just to appreciate that so


---------106:46----------
the first thing is as long as you


---------106:47----------
continue eating healthy amounts of food


---------106:49----------
i don't think the cheesy rice will come


---------106:51----------
back


---------106:52----------
on the flip side there is definitely the


---------106:54----------
psychological stuff so i think you've


---------106:55----------
just learned how to physiologically use


---------106:57----------
food to calm down your mind which is


---------106:59----------
part of the reason that people get into


---------107:02----------
that's why binge eating is managed by


---------107:04----------
psychiatrists because there's


---------107:06----------
psychological drivers right they're


---------107:08----------
mental drivers and then of course


---------107:10----------
there's the coping kind of mechanism


---------107:12----------
stuff component which we haven't really


---------107:14----------
talked about which is that if you eat


---------107:16----------
food sometimes you like dopamine and


---------107:18----------
like you just feel good mentally it's


---------107:20----------
not the physiologic insulin stuff it's


---------107:21----------
like the other stuff as well so i think


---------107:24----------
you've got kind of all of the above and


---------107:26----------
the short answer is that i think as long


---------107:28----------
as you continue having conversations


---------107:30----------
with your girlfriend


---------107:31----------
and you acknowledge that like restraint


---------107:34----------
is possible


---------107:36----------
and and i think the more that you sort


---------107:38----------
of start to like give yourself the


---------107:40----------
opportunity to


---------107:41----------
go off the rails a little bit and


---------107:43----------
recognize that the more that you can


---------107:45----------
trust people like your girlfriend to


---------107:48----------
rotate to your lane when you're getting


---------107:50----------
ganked like if she's gonna tp to your


---------107:52----------
lane and you can count on her


---------107:53----------
then there's this cosmic sense of like


---------107:56----------
being on guard which will start to like


---------108:00----------
come down


---------108:02----------
and then you're gonna feel amazing like


---------108:04----------
once you're actually able to understand


---------108:07----------
that there are people in this life that


---------108:09----------
don't have to that i can count on to


---------108:11----------
keep me in check


---------108:13----------
and you're able to not feel guilty for


---------108:15----------
recruiting them to like keep you in


---------108:17----------
check then you'll be able to relax and


---------108:20----------
enjoy food in a way that like i'm sure


---------108:23----------
you do on some level already but


---------108:25----------
and that's really what i envision for


---------108:27----------
you which is i understand you have a lot


---------108:28----------
to be grateful for but like i want you


---------108:30----------
to be able to like


---------108:32----------
you know not need map awareness i want


---------108:34----------
you to be able to count on other people


---------108:37----------
i want you to be able to like not feel


---------108:39----------
guilty and burdened all the time


---------108:41----------
and i want you to like understand that


---------108:43----------
you don't actually like you don't have


---------108:45----------
to accept defeat when it comes to this


---------108:47----------
thing


---------108:48----------
it's not like an endless slog of war


---------108:52----------
against this caged beast you can


---------108:55----------
actually let the beast out and it'll


---------108:57----------
like play with you and you don't have to


---------108:59----------
worry about it going haywire


---------109:09----------
that makes sense


---------109:14----------
questions thoughts


---------109:18----------
fascinated uh


---------109:21----------
that's my thought questions


---------109:24----------
i got nothing


---------109:25----------
i just got stuff to sit with and like or


---------109:28----------
think about that's


---------109:32----------
wow yeah


---------109:34----------
that's powerful


---------109:35----------
cool


---------109:38----------
um i normally ask people if they want to


---------109:41----------
meditate


---------109:42----------
do you meditate


---------109:44----------
i've tried


---------109:46----------
uh


---------109:47----------
i forgot the app


---------109:48----------
i did like guided meditation i've also


---------109:51----------
i have watched your i've watched a lot


---------109:53----------
of your videos in the past as well and


---------109:54----------
i've tried your um the point on the


---------109:57----------
forehead and just thinking about that


---------110:00----------
uh


---------110:02----------
that's as far as i've gone though and so


---------110:04----------
some sort of breathing exercises when


---------110:06----------
you say you've tried


---------110:08----------
this could be an over interpretation on


---------110:10----------
my end but does that mean that it hasn't


---------110:12----------
really worked for you


---------110:14----------
um


---------110:19----------
until like i dive a month into it it


---------110:21----------
doesn't feel like i've really


---------110:23----------
experienced it it doesn't feel like i've


---------110:25----------
gotten the most of it or like i can't


---------110:26----------
really have an opinion on it


---------110:28----------
until i do it for at least a month


---------110:32----------
so give me just a second would you like


---------110:33----------
to learn something today


---------110:35----------
yeah i'd love to


---------110:37----------
let me just think about what kind of


---------110:39----------
meditation will be geared for what you


---------110:41----------
need


---------110:50----------
okay


---------110:51----------
are you hungry right now


---------110:54----------
uh


---------110:57----------
no but i usually take make a smoothie


---------111:00----------
uh for lunch


---------111:01----------
okay breakfast


---------111:03----------
have you had anything to eat since


---------111:05----------
waking up nope


---------111:08----------
okay


---------111:09----------
i was gonna make a smoothie after this


---------111:10----------
yeah or oatmeal


---------111:13----------
um let me just think for a second okay


---------111:16----------
so what i'd like to do john i don't this


---------111:18----------
may be the third meditation technique


---------111:21----------
that you do but i'm going to teach it a


---------111:22----------
little bit prematurely


---------111:26----------
and so


---------111:27----------
i would definitely encourage you to like


---------111:29----------
practice like a simple like breathing


---------111:31----------
meditation like alternate nostril


---------111:33----------
breathing or something like that for a


---------111:34----------
month


---------111:35----------
um and then what i would want you to do


---------111:37----------
is do like a more regular meditation for


---------111:40----------
like maybe 10 minutes and then do this


---------111:42----------
for like five minutes afterward so if


---------111:45----------
you think about a 15 minute daily


---------111:47----------
meditation practice


---------111:48----------
you should do like regular stuff


---------111:51----------
and then but this is the practice that's


---------111:53----------
like actually a little bit for you


---------111:57----------
okay


---------111:58----------
okay so it's going to be a little bit


---------112:00----------
more


---------112:01----------
inquisitive


---------112:02----------
it's going to be a little bit more


---------112:04----------
awareness oriented


---------112:06----------
and what i really want this technique to


---------112:08----------
do remember how we were saying that like


---------112:09----------
your your family is like taught you or


---------112:11----------
you've learned how to beat around the


---------112:14----------
bush and sort of like address things


---------112:16----------
kind of like


---------112:17----------
tangentially as opposed to like things


---------112:20----------
head-on


---------112:22----------
and and you've also talked about you


---------112:23----------
know how john is meeting masayoshi


---------112:25----------
you're actually on this journey of like


---------112:28----------
understanding who you are


---------112:31----------
and so what i'd like to do is give you a


---------112:33----------
practice that really tunnels that down


---------112:35----------
and uses


---------112:37----------
eating and hunger


---------112:39----------
to give you an authentic insight into


---------112:42----------
like what you are and how you work


---------112:46----------
okay so okay i want you to sit up


---------112:48----------
straight i know it's kind of weird


---------112:50----------
it's gonna be


---------112:52----------
both easier and harder than it sounds i


---------112:54----------
want you to sit up straight your back


---------112:55----------
should be straight


---------112:58----------
my back's a little or my chair the back


---------112:59----------
of my chair's a little far back yeah


---------113:01----------
yeah so uh do you have something you can


---------113:03----------
sit on on top of your chair like do you


---------113:06----------
have a cushion or something that you can


---------113:08----------
i grab a pillow yeah


---------113:11----------
gaming chairs are the worst for


---------113:12----------
meditation


---------113:17----------
boom


---------113:18----------
all right okay so i'm gonna


---------113:19----------
okay so doing like a lumbar narrower


---------113:23----------
we're gonna this is great we're gonna


---------113:24----------
teach you this okay so how does that


---------113:26----------
feel


---------113:27----------
oh it feels great okay so now i'm gonna


---------113:29----------
ask you to do something else what i want


---------113:32----------
you to do is take the bottom 30 of the


---------113:34----------
pillow


---------113:35----------
and like


---------113:37----------
bend it


---------113:38----------
so that you're sitting on it on your


---------113:40----------
butt


---------113:41----------
i want you to oh


---------113:42----------
okay so so like the top half of the


---------113:44----------
pillow should be


---------113:46----------
yes very good pillow fitting yep yep yep


---------113:49----------
all right now sit sit on yeah sit on the


---------113:52----------
pillow yeah all right


---------113:54----------
cool now see how that feels


---------113:59----------
i'm gonna shift it over to the right a


---------114:01----------
bit


---------114:04----------
what helps you sit up more easily


---------114:08----------
uh


---------114:10----------
the other one other way okay then go


---------114:12----------
ahead and move it back to the way it was


---------114:14----------
all right


---------114:16----------
okay so back should be straight neck


---------114:18----------
should be straight as well okay


---------114:21----------
okay i want you to close your eyes


---------114:23----------
and i'm gonna kind of guide you through


---------114:25----------
this okay so this is gonna be a


---------114:26----------
meditation


---------114:28----------
to help you understand


---------114:31----------
what hunger is


---------114:33----------
and the different ways in which hunger


---------114:36----------
and the satisfaction of hunger affects


---------114:38----------
you


---------114:41----------
okay so


---------114:42----------
we're gonna start off but i want you to


---------114:44----------
notice how hungry you feel


---------114:48----------
all right and just notice like where is


---------114:52----------
the hunger


---------114:54----------
right like what is the actual sensation


---------114:56----------
like if i was an alien


---------114:59----------
and i was inhabiting your body


---------115:02----------
for


---------115:03----------
30 seconds


---------115:06----------
what would i feel so where is it what is


---------115:09----------
the quality of it


---------115:11----------
is it gnawing is it sharp


---------115:14----------
is it empty


---------115:17----------
do i feel it only in my stomach


---------115:20----------
or do i also feel it in my limbs


---------115:24----------
it feels dull


---------115:27----------
okay


---------115:28----------
there's not much urge to eat it's just a


---------115:30----------
dull hunger beautiful


---------115:33----------
nothing to do


---------115:35----------
excellent you're one step


---------115:37----------
you're one step ahead of the game


---------115:38----------
because now the next step


---------115:41----------
is notice that this is a physical


---------115:42----------
sensation


---------115:45----------
but an urge is something else


---------115:49----------
right an urge is now a mental driver


---------115:53----------
so there is a physical sensation


---------115:55----------
which at some point will manifest


---------115:59----------
is a mental desire


---------116:02----------
and you may even notice that as the urge


---------116:05----------
arises that the urge is for particular


---------116:08----------
things


---------116:13----------
and so what i want you to do


---------116:16----------
is


---------116:18----------
notice the relationship between the


---------116:20----------
physical sensation of hunger


---------116:24----------
and like


---------116:26----------
why it isn't an urge yet


---------116:29----------
and when will it cross into becoming an


---------116:32----------
urge


---------116:35----------
so like let's let my uh thoughts wander


---------116:38----------
in terms of like


---------116:40----------
when would i want to eat or just kind of


---------116:42----------
sit with the hunger


---------116:43----------
yeah so sit with the hunger and what i


---------116:45----------
really want you to do is notice


---------116:47----------
so it may not be able to be done now so


---------116:49----------
that's why i'm saying this is like kind


---------116:50----------
of a more advanced meditation technique


---------116:53----------
but i want you to watch your hunger as


---------116:56----------
it becomes an urge and notice that like


---------116:58----------
the quality of it changes


---------117:01----------
and then as you watch it become an urge


---------117:06----------
what do you think it will be an urge for


---------117:14----------
okay


---------117:15----------
and then as you see it become an urge


---------117:17----------
then you can satisfy it so you can do


---------117:20----------
this today with your smoothie whereas


---------117:22----------
you have your smoothie i want you to


---------117:24----------
drink it how quickly do you drink it


---------117:27----------
i'm a fast eater i know so how quickly


---------117:30----------
uh


---------117:33----------
pb is probably like


---------117:35----------
if i'm really in a rush i could i just


---------117:37----------
hork it down and then just wash in the


---------117:38----------
sink if i'm uh


---------117:40----------
not too much of it in a rush i just like


---------117:42----------
sit on my desk


---------117:43----------
so like you think you can finish it in


---------117:45----------
three minutes on average


---------117:48----------
is harder to get down faster than


---------117:50----------
hurricanes like five seconds


---------117:52----------
yeah so i'm gonna give you like three


---------117:54----------
minutes


---------117:55----------
so when you have your smoothie today i


---------117:56----------
want you to drink it with your eyes


---------117:58----------
closed over a three minute time span


---------118:01----------
you could take longer if you feel like


---------118:02----------
it like but minimum of three minutes


---------118:05----------
okay


---------118:06----------
and what i want you to do is pay


---------118:08----------
attention to what is changing within you


---------118:11----------
so the physical sensation of hunger will


---------118:13----------
change but also the urge will be


---------118:16----------
satisfied


---------118:17----------
and this is the really key thing if you


---------118:19----------
want to overcome the binge eating


---------118:21----------
when you eat you must have awareness of


---------118:24----------
which urges are being satisfied


---------118:27----------
because you're satisfying urges that are


---------118:29----------
not physical


---------118:32----------
and once you start to eat you'll start


---------118:34----------
to be able as you do this practice


---------118:35----------
you'll start to be able to differentiate


---------118:37----------
out the physical sensation from the


---------118:40----------
psychological urge


---------118:42----------
and as you gain


---------118:43----------
awareness of the psychological urge


---------118:46----------
that will then give you the foundation


---------118:49----------
of what you should accept


---------118:53----------
am i able to open my eyes yes


---------118:55----------
okay it's hard for me to concentrate my


---------118:57----------
mind just wondering


---------118:58----------
okay yeah so that's also common thing so


---------119:01----------
i'm glad you mentioned that so people


---------119:03----------
with adhd sometimes


---------119:05----------
uh


---------119:08----------
concentrate better with their eyes open


---------119:10----------
so when you


---------119:12----------
when you drink your smoothie actually


---------119:13----------
you can have your eyes open if you want


---------119:16----------
just have to hear it like something


---------119:18----------
just have your whatever allows you to


---------119:20----------
focus on the sensation of hunger


---------119:23----------
the crossing from hunger to an urge


---------119:25----------
which if you can catch that that would


---------119:26----------
be beautiful but it may happen over like


---------119:29----------
a longer period of time


---------119:31----------
and then as you drink the smoothie


---------119:33----------
notice the sensation of hunger as it


---------119:35----------
changes and notice what you're


---------119:37----------
satisfying and then you should do this


---------119:38----------
with more than a smoothie


---------119:40----------
so the next time that you're you know


---------119:42----------
it's 2 a.m and you've stayed up too late


---------119:44----------
and it's way past dinner and you feel


---------119:46----------
like eating something then you'll be


---------119:47----------
able to sit with the hunger and the urge


---------119:49----------
and there are two discreet things as you


---------119:51----------
eat a cookie the hunger what changes


---------119:53----------
with the hunger and the urge


---------119:55----------
and what's getting satisfied


---------119:58----------
and once you understand what it is that


---------120:01----------
food satisfies for you then you'll


---------120:03----------
understand what is the root of your


---------120:05----------
problem and what needs to be fixed and


---------120:07----------
as you fix that the binge eating will


---------120:09----------
fall apart


---------120:12----------
that's fascinating


---------120:18----------
yeah


---------120:19----------
i like that


---------120:21----------
cool


---------120:22----------
it's hard


---------120:23----------
yeah it doesn't sound easy but


---------120:27----------
i for sure want to give that a go i'll


---------120:29----------
get back to you on that


---------120:30----------
awesome man


---------120:33----------
well thank you very much john for coming


---------120:36----------
on today


---------120:37----------
it was a pleasure


---------120:38----------
uh it was a lot of fun talking to you


---------120:41----------
and getting to meet you um


---------120:43----------
thanks for having me on i appreciate it


---------120:44----------
yeah man i really appreciate it i think


---------120:46----------
you talked about something that um we


---------120:48----------
actually haven't spent a whole lot of


---------120:49----------
time talking about so i'm really happy


---------120:51----------
that i mean i'm supposed to say i'm


---------120:53----------
really happy you have a binge eating


---------120:55----------
[Laughter]


---------120:57----------
you know so i'm really happy that you


---------120:59----------
chose to talk about that and i think


---------121:00----------
especially talking to you has helped


---------121:03----------
um really reinforce for me like how


---------121:05----------
complex


---------121:06----------
our relationship with food is and i


---------121:09----------
think it's sometimes way more than just


---------121:11----------
a binge eating disorder which you may or


---------121:13----------
may not have


---------121:14----------
and you know if you want to get


---------121:15----------
evaluated by someone you should


---------121:16----------
absolutely do that but


---------121:19----------
that's not like a nice ease of mind yeah


---------121:21----------
no thank you so much it's really good


---------121:23----------
yeah you too


---------121:25----------
bye later


---------121:38----------
you
