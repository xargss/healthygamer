---------00:00----------
not good enough is not a reason to keep


---------00:03----------
from acting


---------00:05----------
you got to start somewhere like if you


---------00:06----------
end up with a 4.0 great


---------00:09----------
but if you open if you never crack the


---------00:12----------
book


---------00:13----------
because you're saying to yourself


---------00:14----------
whatever i do today is not going to be


---------00:16----------
good enough that's a self-fulfilling


---------00:18----------
prophecy


---------00:19----------
okay so let's get on to the meat and


---------00:21----------
bones of the training all right


---------00:23----------
so um


---------00:27----------
so the first thing that we're going to


---------00:28----------
try to do is explain a little bit about


---------00:30----------
how motivation like how we can


---------00:32----------
understand motivation


---------00:34----------
so if you look at motivation they're


---------00:36----------
actually a bunch of different


---------00:37----------
disciplines that like will talk about


---------00:39----------
motivation and behavior so for example


---------00:41----------
there's neuroscience there's psychology


---------00:43----------
there's even behavioral economics


---------00:45----------
there's spirituality even like the


---------00:47----------
system of psychotherapy has its own


---------00:49----------
tradition about understanding motivation


---------00:51----------
they're also like these more novel


---------00:54----------
approaches to motivation so there's like


---------00:55----------
the self-help section right of like the


---------00:58----------
bookstore where people are sort of


---------00:59----------
talking about personal experiences and


---------01:01----------
motivation and my most most recent


---------01:03----------
favorite one is like they're all the


---------01:05----------
life hacks right so you have like in our


---------01:07----------
society when you look at motivation


---------01:10----------
there are a lot of different disciplines


---------01:11----------
and approaches that people will take to


---------01:14----------
actually like figuring out okay what is


---------01:16----------
my motivation like how does motivation


---------01:18----------
work like how do i fix this problem


---------01:20----------
so then the question becomes okay if


---------01:22----------
we're coaches and we're here to help


---------01:23----------
clients sort of fix this problem how are


---------01:26----------
we going to approach it


---------01:28----------
and so what we're going to start with as


---------01:30----------
we do with most things in healthy gamers


---------01:32----------
we're actually going to start with sort


---------01:33----------
of the yogic approach and then what


---------01:35----------
we're going to do is sprinkle in i think


---------01:37----------
key findings from psychology and


---------01:39----------
neuroscience


---------01:40----------
and also some things from like


---------01:41----------
psychotherapy and stuff you'll find that


---------01:43----------
a lot of this stuff is actually baked


---------01:45----------
into


---------01:46----------
the curriculums that y'all have already


---------01:47----------
gone through but we're going to kind of


---------01:49----------
take a step back and think about it so


---------01:51----------
like i was saying earlier there's no


---------01:53----------
sanskrit word for motivation because


---------01:55----------
motivation is actually an umbrella term


---------01:57----------
so what do y'all think are the


---------01:58----------
components of motivation like what do


---------02:00----------
you think determines whether someone is


---------02:02----------
motivated or not


---------02:08----------
intrinsic value


---------02:10----------
what does that mean


---------02:12----------
when they sort of have


---------02:14----------
a purpose that they care about that they


---------02:16----------
can work and commit towards working


---------02:20----------
okay


---------02:22----------
so a sense of value


---------02:26----------
what else what do you think like what


---------02:27----------
goes into like come on like when y'all


---------02:28----------
are motivated towards something or not


---------02:30----------
motivated towards something what goes


---------02:31----------
into that


---------02:38----------
let's start with steven


---------02:40----------
ease of access is a big one like how


---------02:43----------
likely am i to get that thing okay


---------02:47----------
what i was going to say desire for the


---------02:49----------
outcome


---------02:50----------
desire for the outcome sure right so


---------02:52----------
there's like outcome orientation there's


---------02:54----------
like likelihood of success


---------02:56----------
great


---------02:58----------
what else like feel about it like your


---------03:00----------
emotional like sort of attitude towards


---------03:02----------
it okay your emotional attitude towards


---------03:04----------
it right so let's say that


---------03:06----------
all i have to do is go to class and


---------03:09----------
i'll get the points for attendance right


---------03:11----------
likelihood of success is very high and


---------03:14----------
yet


---------03:15----------
my emotional attitude can keep me from


---------03:16----------
going to class right


---------03:19----------
brian what did you say


---------03:26----------
can you all hear him or is it just me no


---------03:28----------
no we can't hear oh you can hear me


---------03:30----------
there you


---------03:33----------
okay yeah i was saying is um


---------03:36----------
like


---------03:36----------
just like


---------03:38----------
like fulfilling a purpose


---------03:40----------
or like okay


---------03:41----------
yeah my analogy is like just like


---------03:43----------
filling up a hole like that you just dug


---------03:44----------
over something like that that's how i


---------03:46----------
am okay great


---------03:50----------
willingness to suffer


---------03:52----------
uh what do you mean by that


---------03:54----------
i mean like what level of tolerance do


---------03:57----------
you have for going through whatever


---------03:59----------
adversity you're gonna have to go


---------04:01----------
through for this goal right so like


---------04:03----------
the adversity to getting a snack might


---------04:05----------
be walking up the stairs that's not a


---------04:06----------
lot of adversity i can go through that


---------04:08----------
but


---------04:09----------
maybe to getting a


---------04:11----------
phd the adversity is years of struggle


---------04:14----------
and sacrificing having fun so i can


---------04:16----------
study and


---------04:19----------
yeah that might be a lot more


---------04:21----------
so spot on so this is where uh crap my


---------04:23----------
ipad is pooping out hold on


---------04:26----------
okay so the first thing that i kind of


---------04:27----------
want to point out is that um


---------04:30----------
if we look at motivation y'all are


---------04:32----------
coming up with like a lot of different


---------04:34----------
things right there's like what's the


---------04:36----------
likelihood of success there's like how


---------04:37----------
you feel about it what the outcome is


---------04:39----------
how important it is to you um there are


---------04:42----------
lots of different


---------04:44----------
attributes that we can kind of think of


---------04:46----------
when it comes to


---------04:48----------
like what goes into motivation so this


---------04:50----------
is the first problem with motivation is


---------04:52----------
that when people say that they're


---------04:53----------
unmotivated


---------04:54----------
they don't know like which of these


---------04:56----------
things is the problem


---------04:57----------
you know am i not engaging in the action


---------05:00----------
because i believe that the likelihood of


---------05:02----------
success is low so let's take a step back


---------05:04----------
for a second and imagine that i have an


---------05:06----------
ahamkar that views me as a failure who


---------05:09----------
wants to explain real quick for the


---------05:10----------
people who are streaming what an aham


---------05:12----------
god is


---------05:16----------
the ego it's the part of your mind


---------05:18----------
that's trying to prevent you from you


---------05:20----------
know incurring any damage just trying to


---------05:21----------
like


---------05:22----------
you know sort of ease you into like or


---------05:24----------
not really ease but it's trying to


---------05:26----------
protect you from anything that's like


---------05:27----------
kind of unusual or uncomfortable or like


---------05:29----------
you know undesirable yep so if i have an


---------05:32----------
identity or ego as a failure what do you


---------05:35----------
think that does to my calculation of the


---------05:37----------
likelihood of success of taking an


---------05:39----------
action


---------05:41----------
it's gonna say that you're gonna fail so


---------05:43----------
so don't do it in the first place


---------05:45----------
exactly right


---------05:46----------
so like if we think about this as


---------05:48----------
coaches like this is kind of interesting


---------05:49----------
because someone says oh i'm not


---------05:51----------
motivated to do something


---------05:53----------
whereas the reason they're not motivated


---------05:55----------
is because the calculation in their mind


---------05:57----------
sets the likelihood of success is very


---------05:59----------
low and therefore it's not worth doing


---------06:02----------
and so if we think about like this is


---------06:03----------
kind of tricky because when this client


---------06:05----------
comes in


---------06:06----------
and they say i want to


---------06:08----------
you know i want to i want to find a


---------06:10----------
romantic partner but i can't because i'm


---------06:12----------
ugly


---------06:13----------
like how would you work with that person


---------06:15----------
as a coach


---------06:20----------
help them explore where they got the


---------06:21----------
idea of


---------06:23----------
how they are ugly and like what is their


---------06:26----------
perspective on that perfect right so so


---------06:28----------
like this is and this is the real


---------06:29----------
challenge that we have as coaches is


---------06:31----------
that a lot of times what will happen is


---------06:33----------
that coaches will come in with a


---------06:34----------
particular goal


---------06:36----------
but like if they want to find a romantic


---------06:38----------
partner and then what they'll do is


---------06:39----------
they'll go to like pick up artists or


---------06:40----------
like you know whatever to learn


---------06:42----------
particular skills whereas like that's


---------06:45----------
the treatment that the the solution that


---------06:47----------
the client is coming up with is actually


---------06:50----------
based on like a false formulation of


---------06:52----------
where their problem is


---------06:53----------
so instead like by understanding


---------06:55----------
concepts like a hum car and you sort of


---------06:56----------
realize like oh the problem is like you


---------06:58----------
can learn as many pick up skills as you


---------07:00----------
want to but as long as you are you know


---------07:03----------
asking someone out and you feel like


---------07:05----------
you're not worth dating and that you're


---------07:06----------
a failure that's going to come across as


---------07:09----------
unattractive become a self-fulfilling


---------07:10----------
prophecy and then like you know they'll


---------07:12----------
reject you oh i'm more of a failure and


---------07:14----------
the next person that you ask out you're


---------07:16----------
kind of like


---------07:17----------
like you're kind of like exuding that


---------07:19----------
like loser musk right and that makes you


---------07:22----------
like less attractive and then you kind


---------07:24----------
of fail again and so what we try to do


---------07:26----------
in coaching is once we understand oh


---------07:28----------
this is actually a problem of a hum car


---------07:29----------
where they think going into the


---------07:31----------
interaction that they're doomed to


---------07:33----------
failure so once we sort of decompress


---------07:35----------
that ahamkar we start to ask them hey


---------07:36----------
where did you get the idea that you're a


---------07:38----------
failure to begin with once we kind of


---------07:39----------
sit with them and work with them and as


---------07:41----------
that identity goes down like what we'll


---------07:43----------
observe and this is i'm sure you all


---------07:44----------
have seen this


---------07:45----------
you know where like you're working with


---------07:46----------
a client and they seem like super stuck


---------07:48----------
and you're sitting there week after week


---------07:49----------
like helping them understand themselves


---------07:51----------
and then like the next week they just go


---------07:53----------
and like do what they were supposed to


---------07:54----------
do you all had that experience before


---------07:57----------
yeah so everyone's nodding because


---------07:58----------
people can't see that who here wants to


---------08:00----------
share an experience not really violating


---------08:02----------
privacy or anything like that but who


---------08:04----------
here wants to share an experience about


---------08:05----------
that with a client like has anyone can


---------08:07----------
anyone say something like where you


---------08:09----------
thought you were doing a terrible job it


---------08:11----------
didn't seem like y'all were getting


---------08:12----------
anywhere and then all of a sudden


---------08:16----------
anyone feel like sharing


---------08:19----------
yeah i'll share what oh go ahead david


---------08:22----------
um yeah i had a client and i'm going to


---------08:25----------
talk slow just to make sure that i'm not


---------08:28----------
sort of violating anything um but i had


---------08:30----------
a client


---------08:32----------
um for about 16 weeks um


---------08:35----------
and we sort of just kept exploring and


---------08:37----------
understanding and


---------08:38----------
um sort of there


---------08:40----------
they kept talking about their goals and


---------08:42----------
didn't really feel like they were


---------08:43----------
getting anywhere um


---------08:46----------
and then you know i i felt like i wasn't


---------08:48----------
doing anything um they never sort of


---------08:50----------
reported back any like progress or


---------08:52----------
anything


---------08:53----------
and then


---------08:54----------
i think i think it was before 16 weeks


---------08:56----------
probably like 12 or 13.


---------08:58----------
they just sort of had this story of yeah


---------09:00----------
they went out and did everything that


---------09:02----------
they had wanted to do


---------09:04----------
and up until that point i'm like i i'm


---------09:06----------
like i'm doing nothing i don't know what


---------09:07----------
i'm doing i like brought the case to


---------09:09----------
like supervision a bunch um


---------09:11----------
and then yeah like they just turned


---------09:12----------
around like oh yeah this has been super


---------09:14----------
helpful like i have a great


---------09:15----------
understanding of everything


---------09:16----------
thanks and it was it was good after that


---------09:20----------
great yeah so i think that's where it's


---------09:22----------
it's interesting but even in psychiatry


---------09:23----------
we have a saying that all boats rise


---------09:26----------
together


---------09:27----------
and so i think a big part of what we do


---------09:28----------
in coaching is helping people like and


---------09:30----------
people do this in therapy as well i mean


---------09:32----------
it's like a general observation of


---------09:33----------
humans that a lot of times you know


---------09:36----------
there's some fundamental things that


---------09:37----------
hold us that keep us from like moving


---------09:40----------
forward in multiple dimensions of our


---------09:42----------
lives


---------09:43----------
and so i i think part of the key thing


---------09:44----------
did somebody else want to share before


---------09:46----------
we move on


---------09:51----------
i have a success case if i'm sure go for


---------09:54----------
it um i had a client who


---------09:56----------
we spent like maybe like four or five


---------09:59----------
weeks really trying to get him like


---------10:00----------
outside of his house he like spent a


---------10:01----------
whole bunch of time indoors um and like


---------10:05----------
could never really get there and then


---------10:07----------
he really wanted to go for a walk down


---------10:09----------
the street to get some like some


---------10:10----------
breakfast and one day he did or so like


---------10:13----------
we had our session he had his week he


---------10:16----------
had he then later told me that on the


---------10:18----------
first day he went out and did it


---------10:20----------
realized it actually wasn't too bad and


---------10:22----------
like went like another three or four


---------10:24----------
times and went to the gym twice that


---------10:26----------
week and like all of a sudden just


---------10:28----------
crushed all his goals it was really


---------10:30----------
now he's a crusher


---------10:31----------
yeah so so i know it sounds kind of


---------10:33----------
weird but what we're gonna explain to


---------10:35----------
y'all over the next four days is why


---------10:38----------
that happens


---------10:40----------
okay we're gonna start to talk a little


---------10:42----------
bit about like so we've we've figured


---------10:43----------
this out so on the back end at hg what


---------10:46----------
we've done is like done all these


---------10:47----------
calculations it goes into the way that


---------10:49----------
y'all like the curriculum that we put


---------10:51----------
you all through and so y'all are already


---------10:53----------
doing it and now we're going to kind of


---------10:55----------
bump you all up to the next level by


---------10:56----------
teaching you all how that happens and


---------10:58----------
why that happens so the first thing that


---------11:00----------
i want to share about motivation is that


---------11:02----------
it's an emergent property and so what i


---------11:04----------
mean by that is if we listen to what


---------11:05----------
y'all are saying y'all are saying okay


---------11:07----------
there's like emotions involved there's


---------11:08----------
like likelihood of success involved


---------11:10----------
there are all these different variables


---------11:12----------
that go into motivation and the


---------11:14----------
challenge with like um issues of


---------11:15----------
motivation is that


---------11:17----------
when a client feels like they're not


---------11:19----------
motivated like


---------11:20----------
what they see is an emergent property


---------11:22----------
right so what we're gonna see from from


---------11:24----------
eli's case for example is someone who's


---------11:26----------
doing all their things from david's case


---------11:28----------
it's someone who's crushing it on all


---------11:29----------
levels and then the question kind of


---------11:31----------
becomes like well


---------11:33----------
how do i duplicate that so when we look


---------11:35----------
at so motivation is a term and this is


---------11:37----------
why i don't think there's a sanskrit


---------11:38----------
word for motivation


---------11:39----------
it's a term that is


---------11:41----------
designed from external observation so if


---------11:44----------
you look within yourself you won't find


---------11:47----------
motivation you'll find emotions you'll


---------11:49----------
find desires you'll find things that you


---------11:52----------
care about


---------11:53----------
but motivation is something when i look


---------11:55----------
at someone who's crushing it on the


---------11:57----------
outside and i look at them and i make a


---------11:59----------
judgment from the outside i call them


---------12:01----------
motivation


---------12:02----------
so motivation is almost like this


---------12:04----------
emergent property that people see from


---------12:06----------
the outside and if you go and you talk


---------12:08----------
to someone who goes to the gym every day


---------12:10----------
i know it sounds kind of weird but they


---------12:12----------
won't say that they're highly motivated


---------12:14----------
it's not like they get up every day and


---------12:16----------
are like filled with like passion and


---------12:17----------
like yeah like i'm gonna go to the gym


---------12:19----------
it's just like they're like no it's just


---------12:20----------
kind of like what i do now you know i


---------12:22----------
just it makes me feel better but there's


---------12:24----------
sort of this idea of like


---------12:26----------
of motivation which is built from people


---------12:28----------
standing on the outside and watching


---------12:30----------
someone else and saying oh wow that


---------12:32----------
person must be like intrinsically driven


---------12:34----------
in some deep and profound way that i


---------12:36----------
don't feel and the reason that they make


---------12:38----------
that conclusion is because on the inside


---------12:40----------
what they feel is something deep and


---------12:42----------
profound that keeps them stuck


---------12:44----------
so as we kind of understand motivation


---------12:46----------
what we're going to try to do is unpack


---------12:48----------
like what are all of the things that go


---------12:50----------
into it and as we unpack all of the


---------12:52----------
different variables of motivation my


---------12:54----------
hope is that y'all as coaches will be


---------12:56----------
able to help their clients figure out


---------12:58----------
like what's the problem here and this is


---------13:00----------
also why we have a a gigantic motivation


---------13:03----------
like industry we have tons of


---------13:05----------
information about motivation and we have


---------13:07----------
the least motivated generation like in


---------13:10----------
the history of humanity i don't know if


---------13:11----------
that's actually factually true or not


---------13:13----------
that's how it feels


---------13:14----------
and so it's kind of interesting because


---------13:16----------
how can we account for sort of like this


---------13:17----------
discrepancy between all the information


---------13:19----------
that's out there and how unmotivated


---------13:21----------
people are and we'll kind of get to that


---------13:22----------
i think the issue is that


---------13:24----------
you know when i look at a life hack or i


---------13:26----------
look at like a success youtuber


---------13:29----------
they're not going to be able to like


---------13:31----------
tailor what they say to me right there's


---------13:33----------
no process of like interaction where we


---------13:36----------
can figure out okay which advice is


---------13:38----------
actually the advice that i should follow


---------13:39----------
so we have people like consuming all


---------13:41----------
this advice and like not making changes


---------13:42----------
in their life so the real advantage and


---------13:45----------
this is where i think this is your duty


---------13:46----------
as a coach is to understand all these


---------13:48----------
different dimensions and help a client


---------13:50----------
figure out okay what are we dealing with


---------13:52----------
here is this an issue of a hump god is


---------13:54----------
this an issue among us is this an issue


---------13:56----------
where like you feel too much emotion or


---------13:57----------
negative shame is this an issue where


---------13:59----------
there are people around you who are like


---------14:02----------
you know preventing you from being your


---------14:04----------
best self like do you have like you know


---------14:06----------
your gamer buddies like


---------14:08----------
messaging you you know at 5 p.m every


---------14:11----------
day and want you to get on and like play


---------14:12----------
games with them like how does that


---------14:14----------
impact your motivation the next day


---------14:16----------
so as a coach really the key thing here


---------14:18----------
is that as we teach you this model like


---------14:20----------
you need to take this model and apply it


---------14:22----------
to your clients so that you can guide


---------14:24----------
them in a more specific manner there's


---------14:25----------
also other advantages to that which


---------14:27----------
we'll kind of get to


---------14:28----------
questions about that


---------14:33----------
okay so kind of the analogy that i'd use


---------14:35----------
about motivation just to kind of wrap up


---------14:37----------
is remember i kind of called it an


---------14:38----------
emergent property and so the thing about


---------14:41----------
emergent properties is that any


---------14:42----------
individual component


---------14:44----------
does not appear to be like irresponsible


---------14:47----------
for what we see


---------14:48----------
and just like you know you can look at a


---------14:50----------
um a uh


---------14:54----------
just like you can look at


---------14:56----------
like a bird right and you can look at


---------14:58----------
the property of flight it's not the


---------15:00----------
muscle that creates flight it's not the


---------15:02----------
bone that creates flight it's not the


---------15:04----------
the wing that creates light and what


---------15:06----------
happens is we have clients that look


---------15:07----------
around and they see other birds flying


---------15:09----------
and they themselves don't see themselves


---------15:11----------
flying and so then what happens is they


---------15:14----------
just


---------15:14----------
end up basically like um


---------15:16----------
uh


---------15:19----------
you know they end up trying to figure


---------15:20----------
out why can't i fly and it's your job as


---------15:23----------
a coach to basically help them figure


---------15:25----------
out okay what's what's the part of your


---------15:27----------
wing that's busted


---------15:31----------
okay


---------15:37----------
okay so


---------15:39----------
um next thing that we're gonna do


---------15:42----------
is so any questions about that


---------15:48----------
okay


---------15:48----------
so now we're gonna get started with goal


---------15:50----------
setting and motivation


---------15:56----------
um let me just go ahead and screen share


---------15:57----------
this with y'all


---------16:01----------
um


---------16:03----------
and then


---------16:06----------
let's see here


---------16:10----------
give me one second so let's


---------16:13----------
go to screen share and change


---------16:17----------
okay


---------16:18----------
and then


---------16:24----------
let's go here okay


---------16:25----------
so our model for goal setting


---------16:28----------
and motivation is built on a couple of


---------16:30----------
core concepts okay


---------16:32----------
the first is that um


---------16:35----------
not all people are the same


---------16:39----------
so your job as a coach


---------16:42----------
is to help people find a customizable


---------16:44----------
solution to their individual or to their


---------16:47----------
problems okay


---------16:48----------
the second thing is that good


---------16:55----------
good diagnosis


---------16:57----------
precedes good treatment


---------17:00----------
and if we look at the efficacy of a


---------17:02----------
coach


---------17:04----------
um you know you aren't diagnosing or


---------17:05----------
treating anything


---------17:06----------
but


---------17:07----------
your efficacy as a coach and why we help


---------17:10----------
clients is because like they're actually


---------17:12----------
not good diagnosticians they will look


---------17:14----------
at themselves and they won't actually


---------17:16----------
accurately diagnose where their


---------17:18----------
motivational problems are


---------17:20----------
um


---------17:21----------
and then the third thing is going to be


---------17:23----------
a little bit contradictory but while


---------17:25----------
personalized approaches are important


---------17:27----------
like a big part of what we do at


---------17:28----------
healthygamer is that we can rely on


---------17:30----------
disciplines


---------17:33----------
to give us framework


---------17:34----------
frameworks


---------17:36----------
uh to give frameworks so what we're


---------17:39----------
gonna do is we're gonna teach all some


---------17:41----------
things from neuroscience psychology


---------17:43----------
spirituality and things like that and


---------17:45----------
the key thing here is that if we kind of


---------17:47----------
think about okay could and


---------17:49----------
like couldn't anyone do this and the


---------17:50----------
answer is yes anyone can do this but


---------17:53----------
what we're going to do is by giving you


---------17:54----------
guys these key like takeaways from


---------17:56----------
different disciplines you'll be able to


---------17:58----------
help a client faster and to a greater


---------18:00----------
degree than they would be able to do on


---------18:02----------
their own because we're going to kind of


---------18:03----------
give you all the information sure and


---------18:05----------
anyone out there could go and read about


---------18:07----------
neuroscience about psychology about


---------18:08----------
behavioral economics about spirituality


---------18:11----------
and if they do enough of that self-study


---------18:12----------
that like they'll be able to figure out


---------18:14----------
you know what works for them eventually


---------18:16----------
what we try to do as coaches those we we


---------18:18----------
have all of the rel not all but you know


---------18:20----------
we give you guys the most relevant


---------18:21----------
information and it's your job as a coach


---------18:24----------
to apply that information when necessary


---------18:26----------
with your client any questions about


---------18:27----------
that


---------18:31----------
okay so now we're gonna have kind of an


---------18:33----------
interesting uh question so here's the


---------18:36----------
basic premise under which we're gonna


---------18:38----------
understand motivation so who knows what


---------18:42----------
this equation is


---------18:44----------
anyone know


---------18:48----------
look familiar


---------18:50----------
is that


---------18:51----------
voltage equals current over resistance


---------18:54----------
very good steven bonus points because my


---------18:57----------
handwriting is so bad so who here


---------18:59----------
understands does anyone know what


---------19:01----------
voltage means


---------19:04----------
like what is voltage


---------19:08----------
it's like a measure of electricity right


---------19:09----------
like how how strong it is


---------19:12----------
uh it is it is involved in electricity


---------19:14----------
so this is ohm's law for people who are


---------19:16----------
curious


---------19:18----------
okay


---------19:19----------
so let's let's move on to another


---------19:20----------
variable what is the i


---------19:29----------
current okay


---------19:32----------
so we've got twitch chat helping us out


---------19:33----------
so ohm's law says basically that voltage


---------19:36----------
like steven said equals current


---------19:40----------
over resistance


---------19:42----------
okay


---------19:43----------
so if we think about current current is


---------19:46----------
what we put into the circuit


---------19:49----------
it's the energy input okay resistance


---------19:53----------
is like what's resistance


---------20:01----------
you could you're controlling the amount


---------20:03----------
of current


---------20:04----------
it gets


---------20:05----------
uh yeah so it's kind of it's the


---------20:07----------
resistance right so it's like what takes


---------20:09----------
away


---------20:10----------
uh how can i say this is like what takes


---------20:13----------
away


---------20:14----------
whatever you're trying to do so the


---------20:16----------
other way we can think about current law


---------20:18----------
takes away is a terrible definition hold


---------20:19----------
on let me think about what's a better


---------20:21----------
definition for this


---------20:22----------
um


---------20:24----------
you know it's it's the force that


---------20:27----------
our current has to act against let's


---------20:29----------
call it that


---------20:31----------
uh


---------20:32----------
before it's a force opposing what we're


---------20:34----------
trying to do


---------20:36----------
okay


---------20:37----------
and then the voltage is sort of the


---------20:39----------
potential difference and the potential


---------20:41----------
difference is like where you start and


---------20:42----------
where you end up so i'll give you all


---------20:44----------
kind of another analogy let's say i have


---------20:46----------
a pipe


---------20:48----------
that is flowing from the second floor


---------20:51----------
to the first floor


---------20:52----------
right so the potential difference like


---------20:55----------
this is a measure of voltage is like the


---------20:57----------
gravitational potential from here to


---------20:59----------
here is what causes water to move this


---------21:01----------
way are we good on that does that make


---------21:03----------
sense right because that's a


---------21:04----------
gravitational potential energy so when


---------21:06----------
you look at something like a battery


---------21:08----------
that voltage across the battery this may


---------21:10----------
not be an accurate term but if you look


---------21:12----------
at like why electrons move from one


---------21:14----------
point like the cathode to the er sorry


---------21:16----------
from the anode to the cathode there's an


---------21:18----------
electrical potential there like a


---------21:20----------
voltage that causes things to move in a


---------21:22----------
particular direction so this is where we


---------21:25----------
start


---------21:27----------
and this is where we end


---------21:30----------
okay


---------21:31----------
and so i'm going to ask you also if we


---------21:33----------
think about you know how can i get more


---------21:35----------
water over here what are the different


---------21:37----------
things that i can do to increase the


---------21:38----------
water flow that's on this side


---------21:46----------
put more water in the pipe yep so you


---------21:48----------
can add more water right so that's


---------21:50----------
current we can pump more water and what


---------21:51----------
else can we do


---------21:54----------
and uh reduce the resistance yep so we


---------21:57----------
can widen the pipe


---------21:58----------
right


---------22:00----------
so resistance in in terms of flow


---------22:02----------
mechanics is like


---------22:03----------
the width of the pipe so anyone who's


---------22:05----------
you know had bubble tea with a bubble


---------22:06----------
tea straw versus like a tiny little


---------22:09----------
straw like you get more liquid if the


---------22:11----------
straw is wider right we can reduce the


---------22:12----------
resistance


---------22:15----------
what else can we do


---------22:19----------
we can put our pipe like this


---------22:22----------
does that make sense


---------22:24----------
so we can


---------22:25----------
activate that gravitational energy like


---------22:27----------
even better


---------22:28----------
right we can increase the strength of


---------22:30----------
the cathode or the anode so i know it


---------22:31----------
sounds kind of weird but i think this is


---------22:34----------
a fantastic equation to even understand


---------22:37----------
psychological resistance


---------22:39----------
so there's the goal


---------22:41----------
right and like where you want to go


---------22:48----------
there's the energy we put in


---------22:54----------
or the intent


---------22:56----------
and then there's the resistance


---------23:00----------
right so these are things like shame


---------23:02----------
emotions


---------23:05----------
okay aham god is here too yeah


---------23:08----------
it's v equals ir


---------23:12----------
uh


---------23:12----------
multiplication not division


---------23:16----------
oh interesting okay


---------23:20----------
uh yeah so that


---------23:22----------
tanks particular things but let's stick


---------23:24----------
with this for now


---------23:25----------
we can talk about the current instead


---------23:27----------
yeah so i think it's it's still fine


---------23:29----------
so just turn resistance into a negative


---------23:33----------
yeah let me think about that


---------23:35----------
a bunch of nerds um


---------23:38----------
let me think about that let me think


---------23:39----------
about that okay i'll get back to y'all


---------23:40----------
on that


---------23:41----------
so let's kind of keep going for now just


---------23:43----------
because we're in this already um so


---------23:47----------
so this is where so as we kind of think


---------23:50----------
about this in terms of like coaching


---------23:51----------
what we want to do


---------23:52----------
is actually think about it this way so


---------23:54----------
when we think about a behavior there's


---------23:55----------
the intent that people put in


---------23:58----------
okay


---------23:59----------
then there's the resistance that they


---------24:00----------
have to overcome


---------24:03----------
and then there's the action that they


---------24:04----------
take towards the end


---------24:06----------
all right so these are the three


---------24:07----------
dimensions that we're going to be


---------24:09----------
exploring and in my experience the


---------24:12----------
problem that most people have with goal


---------24:13----------
setting and motivation is that like they


---------24:15----------
don't understand that all three of these


---------24:17----------
things can be acted on okay


---------24:19----------
so


---------24:20----------
what a lot of people will sometimes do


---------24:22----------
let's just talk about willpower for a


---------24:23----------
second


---------24:24----------
so i think like i think about willpower


---------24:26----------
is like a limited mana pool


---------24:29----------
that you can use to kind of like power


---------24:31----------
through this equation so i can just


---------24:33----------
expend a certain amount of willpower to


---------24:35----------
like overcome this resistance hump and


---------24:36----------
take an action


---------24:38----------
one time


---------24:39----------
and then you know i can do that again


---------24:41----------
and each time that i like sort of drain


---------24:43----------
my willpower battery oh damn it


---------24:48----------
what'll happen is like i can take


---------24:50----------
actions but it's not sustainable so we


---------24:52----------
see this pattern a lot with students who


---------24:54----------
are not happy with the kind of um


---------24:59----------
how can i say this


---------25:00----------
we see this a lot with students who are


---------25:02----------
not like happy with being students so


---------25:04----------
they'll start the semester off with like


---------25:06----------
a fully charged battery and they'll use


---------25:08----------
willpower to like study for the first


---------25:10----------
month


---------25:11----------
they'll like dig real deep and study for


---------25:12----------
the first the second month and then like


---------25:14----------
by the end of it they're like burnt out


---------25:16----------
and they don't really like enjoy what


---------25:17----------
they're doing they never enjoyed what


---------25:19----------
they were doing it was a slog from day


---------25:20----------
one it's just they were relying on


---------25:22----------
willpower to get there


---------25:24----------
so as coaches what we're going to kind


---------25:25----------
of focus on is understanding intent


---------25:28----------
resistance and action okay


---------25:31----------
these are the three major components


---------25:33----------
so


---------25:34----------
what do i mean by intent


---------25:36----------
so so a lot of times people will say


---------25:38----------
like like i know it sounds kind of weird


---------25:40----------
but when your clients have a goal like


---------25:42----------
where does that goal come from


---------25:44----------
what do you all think


---------25:49----------
usually like desires like that are


---------25:52----------
external or like you know uh what's the


---------25:54----------
word uh in three is right


---------25:57----------
okay desires from the indireas


---------26:01----------
good


---------26:02----------
indriyas are sense organs


---------26:05----------
what else where else do does when


---------26:07----------
someone says i have a goal


---------26:09----------
i want to do something where is that


---------26:11----------
intent coming from why do they want to


---------26:12----------
do it


---------26:13----------
sometimes they it's a desire


---------26:17----------
what else could it be


---------26:26----------
could be pressure from like culture


---------26:29----------
family excellent


---------26:32----------
okay so i'm gonna call this should


---------26:35----------
right so like this is something i want


---------26:37----------
to do that's a desire


---------26:38----------
this is something i should do


---------26:41----------
what else


---------26:43----------
what else can drive someone to action


---------26:46----------
do people do things that they don't want


---------26:48----------
to do and that they should


---------26:50----------
do people do things that they don't want


---------26:51----------
to do and that they shouldn't do


---------26:56----------
absolutely yes


---------26:58----------
right so this is where we look at other


---------27:00----------
things i'm going to kind of call so yeah


---------27:03----------
okay pressure was fine so i'd say that


---------27:05----------
we also do things because we're driven


---------27:07----------
by our values so like what drives what


---------27:09----------
we want to do our values and our duty


---------27:13----------
so these are kind of the four things


---------27:14----------
that i kind of think of when i think


---------27:16----------
about what goes into intent the other


---------27:19----------
key thing about uh so when we think


---------27:21----------
about these four things the goal of this


---------27:22----------
as a coach is like a lot of times people


---------27:25----------
don't realize that


---------27:27----------
the goals they set for themselves aren't


---------27:29----------
truly their goals and so the ability to


---------27:32----------
get energy up and engage in those goals


---------27:34----------
when this is something that i should do


---------27:36----------
versus something that i actually like


---------27:38----------
care about so we see this a lot like


---------27:39----------
with you know second generation indians


---------27:42----------
is that like everyone wants to be a


---------27:43----------
doctor


---------27:45----------
and


---------27:46----------
very few of us actually want to be


---------27:47----------
doctors most of us like should be


---------27:49----------
doctors and there's like societal


---------27:51----------
pressure to do a particular thing


---------27:53----------
we also see this a lot with our clients


---------27:55----------
who um for example like we don't you


---------27:56----------
know not all of our clients


---------27:58----------
are


---------27:59----------
d gens


---------28:00----------
right so some of our clients are


---------28:01----------
actually like you know they have jobs


---------28:03----------
and things like that a lot of our


---------28:04----------
clients do so sometimes we see this with


---------28:06----------
clients who


---------28:08----------
um for example


---------28:09----------
like they have a job that is very


---------28:12----------
successful like they're successful but


---------28:14----------
they feel unfulfilled and how do i like


---------28:16----------
how do i manage that right because i


---------28:19----------
should stay in my job because this is a


---------28:20----------
good job to have


---------28:22----------
why isn't this


---------28:33----------
my pen busted


---------28:35----------
weird okay hold on


---------28:38----------
um let me just go go to this in a second


---------28:42----------
so they may have like a particular thing


---------28:44----------
that they feel like they should do or


---------28:45----------
it's dumb to not do this thing there we


---------28:48----------
go


---------28:50----------
but


---------28:51----------
what they really care about is something


---------28:52----------
else what they value is something else


---------28:54----------
so like i may be a successful programmer


---------28:56----------
at google but what i care about is like


---------28:59----------
running d campaigns and telling stories


---------29:02----------
and so oftentimes what keeps clients


---------29:04----------
stuck is that their intent is not


---------29:06----------
clarified so there's a conflict of


---------29:08----------
intent


---------29:12----------
and this is why they stay stuck


---------29:14----------
and so the key thing that we want to do


---------29:16----------
here as coaches is help them clarify


---------29:18----------
like okay what is a desire what's


---------29:19----------
something that you want


---------29:21----------
what's something that you should do what


---------29:22----------
do you care about and what are you what


---------29:24----------
are you duty bound to do what's your


---------29:26----------
obligation


---------29:28----------
and it's interesting but just even


---------29:29----------
having this conversation and helping


---------29:31----------
people realize that oh this is something


---------29:33----------
that you should do but it's not


---------29:34----------
something that you want to do


---------29:36----------
do you all think once someone


---------29:37----------
understands that are they more likely or


---------29:39----------
less likely to engage in the behavior


---------29:48----------
more likely


---------29:49----------
why do you say that eli


---------29:54----------
they're not trying to fight their


---------29:55----------
emotions anymore they can validate how


---------29:57----------
they feel about it and it kind of


---------29:59----------
naturally


---------30:01----------
like reduces the intensity of that


---------30:03----------
perfect so this is this i know it's kind


---------30:05----------
of weird but like i'm going to give you


---------30:07----------
all like a scenario okay i'm curious i'm


---------30:09----------
sure you all have heard this from your


---------30:10----------
clients but okay i need to do x


---------30:16----------
i can't


---------30:18----------
do x


---------30:20----------
therefore


---------30:21----------
i'm


---------30:22----------
an idiot


---------30:24----------
so we see this a lot in people with adhd


---------30:28----------
i should be able to do x


---------30:34----------
and then let me ask you something


---------30:37----------
what do you think this statement


---------30:40----------
does to their ability to like engage in


---------30:43----------
action and how does that affect their


---------30:44----------
motivation


---------30:48----------
it strengthens the hum car and makes it


---------30:51----------
harder to act because now your identity


---------30:53----------
is like you know i suck at doing stuff


---------30:55----------
so how can i ever do it exactly


---------30:58----------
so


---------30:58----------
this is the key thing so another key


---------31:00----------
thing that we're going to do in terms of


---------31:01----------
intent we can clarify these intents but


---------31:03----------
remember that when people are stuck


---------31:05----------
oftentimes they're ambivalent


---------31:08----------
right can someone explain what


---------31:09----------
ambivalence


---------31:15----------
means about one thing on the fence


---------31:19----------
what did you say stephen


---------31:21----------
just thought you were feeling two ways


---------31:22----------
about one thing yeah feeling two ways


---------31:25----------
right so this is the other thing so when


---------31:26----------
when human beings don't engage in a


---------31:28----------
behavior


---------31:29----------
right they're


---------31:30----------
conflicted there's like a pro side and a


---------31:33----------
con side and one of the biggest


---------31:35----------
challenges that our clients recognize is


---------31:37----------
that they never see the con side they're


---------31:39----------
blind to it so i'll give you all an


---------31:41----------
example like they say oh i should study


---------31:43----------
instead of playing games all day


---------31:45----------
so they don't see like


---------31:47----------
it's one dimensional for them this is


---------31:49----------
gonna sound kind of abstract but all


---------31:51----------
they see is what they should do like


---------31:52----------
they have their eyes set on the goal and


---------31:54----------
that's all they're focused on


---------31:56----------
what they don't see is what they gain by


---------32:00----------
playing games all day


---------32:01----------
they don't see the other side of the


---------32:03----------
equation and so this is what creates


---------32:05----------
this kind of this mentality over here


---------32:08----------
this is this is a thought process that's


---------32:09----------
created from blindness


---------32:11----------
it's a thought process that people don't


---------32:14----------
realize that they can't do x for a very


---------32:17----------
good reason there's something within


---------32:19----------
them that is keeping them from doing x


---------32:21----------
right and it's not just that they're


---------32:23----------
undisciplined it's that they may have


---------32:24----------
some kind of fear or they have this id


---------32:26----------
like this this identity which is telling


---------32:29----------
them and we'll get to this in a second


---------32:31----------
like an identity that's telling them oh


---------32:33----------
you're gonna fail so don't bother and


---------32:35----------
that's the reason that they can't do it


---------32:36----------
is because there's literally a br a part


---------32:38----------
of their brain


---------32:40----------
that is calculating the likelihood of


---------32:41----------
success so there's a there's a part of


---------32:44----------
our brain that continually makes a


---------32:45----------
calculation that is like what is what


---------32:47----------
are the pros what are the cons what's


---------32:49----------
the risk what's the benefit or what's


---------32:50----------
the what's the benefit what's the cost


---------32:53----------
and what's the likelihood of success


---------32:54----------
it's sort of like benefit


---------32:58----------
minus cost


---------33:01----------
times


---------33:04----------
likelihood of success


---------33:08----------
is a calculation that our mind is always


---------33:10----------
doing


---------33:12----------
anytime we're like doing anything and


---------33:14----------
then that sort of results in behavior or


---------33:16----------
not behavior


---------33:17----------
and so what people don't recognize is


---------33:19----------
that there's like actually a benefit to


---------33:21----------
being unmotivated


---------33:23----------
so a big part of what we do here in


---------33:25----------
terms of how we deal with intent we're


---------33:26----------
going to spend a whole day on this is


---------33:27----------
we're going to talk about clarifying


---------33:29----------
desires you know shoulds values and


---------33:32----------
duties


---------33:33----------
and when we do this with clients like


---------33:34----------
they'll be i don't it's like magic


---------33:36----------
they'll just be like more prone to


---------33:39----------
um


---------33:40----------
engage in the right behavior


---------33:42----------
and it's hard to describe but when you


---------33:44----------
give human beings


---------33:46----------
an open-ended or like sort of an honest


---------33:49----------
assessment of what something will cost


---------33:51----------
them they're more likely to pay that


---------33:54----------
cost for the benefit so by clarifying


---------33:57----------
for people like oh if you stop playing


---------33:58----------
video games and you start going to class


---------34:01----------
you're gonna be behind you're gonna feel


---------34:03----------
behind you're gonna no matter how hard


---------34:06----------
you study you won't be able to get an a


---------34:09----------
and if you kind of think about it like


---------34:10----------
that's devastating for your motivation


---------34:12----------
and by helping clients understand that


---------34:14----------
no matter how hard you work now the


---------34:16----------
highest grade you can get as a b you can


---------34:19----------
get a hundred percent on every single


---------34:20----------
test from here on out and the best you


---------34:22----------
can get as a bee


---------34:24----------
that crushes people subconsciously it


---------34:26----------
keeps them from ever engaging in the


---------34:28----------
behavior but when you make that cost


---------34:31----------
transparent to them once they really


---------34:33----------
understand and digest that cost


---------34:35----------
they are much more likely to engage in


---------34:37----------
the behavior


---------34:38----------
and so this kind of hidden cost that


---------34:40----------
they don't realize is also where their


---------34:42----------
ambivalence comes from because there's a


---------34:44----------
subconscious part of their mind that


---------34:45----------
doesn't want to pay that cost and we


---------34:47----------
know from from evidence-based


---------34:49----------
motivational interviewing that


---------34:50----------
clarifying ambivalence leads people in


---------34:53----------
the right direction right so there have


---------34:54----------
been lots of studies we teach all some


---------34:56----------
motivational interviewing techniques how


---------34:58----------
you play with that ambivalence and this


---------35:00----------
is the really interesting thing i had a


---------35:01----------
really cool case from


---------35:04----------
uh someone presented a case in case


---------35:06----------
review where someone had a client who is


---------35:07----------
doing something incredibly idiotic like


---------35:10----------
just making terrible decision after


---------35:12----------
terrible decision after terrible


---------35:13----------
decision is it related to a particular


---------35:15----------
relationship


---------35:16----------
and so the coach like was tearing their


---------35:18----------
hair out and they're like this is a


---------35:19----------
terrible idea you just need to go no


---------35:22----------
contact with this person and cut this


---------35:23----------
person out of your life and every time


---------35:26----------
that their client tells


---------35:28----------
this story to their friends their


---------35:30----------
friends say the same thing you need to


---------35:31----------
go no contact with this person go no no


---------35:33----------
contact with this person this person is


---------35:34----------
toxic


---------35:35----------
and then the coach was like i have no


---------35:37----------
idea how to get my client to see


---------35:40----------
that this is a terrible relationship


---------35:42----------
that you're engaging in and you should


---------35:43----------
go no contact with them


---------35:45----------
but interestingly enough they resisted


---------35:47----------
that impulse they didn't play into the


---------35:49----------
the drama that the client was recruiting


---------35:51----------
them in because


---------35:52----------
what do you think happens so


---------35:55----------
if if your client tells you something


---------35:57----------
that you think is idiotic and you tell


---------35:58----------
them it's idiotic how is that going to


---------36:00----------
affect their behavior are they going to


---------36:02----------
keep doing it or are they going to


---------36:03----------
listen to you and stop doing it


---------36:06----------
they're probably going to double down


---------36:08----------
absolutely right and that's the key


---------36:10----------
thing i know it sounds bizarre that's


---------36:11----------
the key learning from motivational


---------36:13----------
interviewing


---------36:14----------
so when you you know when you try to


---------36:16----------
push someone in a particular direction


---------36:18----------
in terms of behavior there's a decent


---------36:20----------
chance that the the if you're kind of


---------36:22----------
pushing this way


---------36:24----------
and they're ambivalent about it oh you


---------36:26----------
need to stop [ __ ] smoking like it's


---------36:27----------
terrible for me you're gonna die and


---------36:28----------
like everyone hates it you're so bad at


---------36:31----------
smoking oh my god like stop the smoking


---------36:32----------
oh my god what they're gonna do is


---------36:34----------
they're gonna double down and push back


---------36:36----------
twice as hard


---------36:38----------
so this is where reflective listening


---------36:40----------
and sort of playing with that


---------36:41----------
ambivalence and even holding the side


---------36:44----------
of oh it sounds like you know you this


---------36:46----------
person must mean a lot to you because


---------36:48----------
it's clear that they're like really


---------36:49----------
screwing with your life so the


---------36:51----------
relationship must be really important to


---------36:52----------
you in some way when you say something


---------36:55----------
like that like what is the client gonna


---------36:56----------
say


---------36:57----------
you guys seen this play out before in


---------36:58----------
coaching


---------37:01----------
yeah usually like some amount of


---------37:03----------
confusion and just like thinking about


---------37:05----------
it like oh [ __ ] like huh you know that


---------37:08----------
kind of thing exactly right so when you


---------37:10----------
kind of say oh like it sounds like this


---------37:12----------
relationship is really important to you


---------37:13----------
because they're super toxic and


---------37:15----------
everyone's telling you to go no contact


---------37:16----------
with them they must be like super


---------37:17----------
amazing and then they're like kind of


---------37:19----------
confused because that's not usually what


---------37:20----------
they hear and then they start thinking


---------37:22----------
about it and when they start thinking


---------37:25----------
about it that's when the change begins


---------37:27----------
to happen


---------37:28----------
right it's really interesting


---------37:31----------
so this is the intent so what we're


---------37:32----------
going to do is we're going to work with


---------37:33----------
ambivalence which you guys should be


---------37:34----------
pretty familiar with we're going to


---------37:36----------
teach you guys how to clarify your


---------37:38----------
client's intent


---------37:40----------
and for some people like this is the


---------37:41----------
problem like they're just


---------37:43----------
their intent is confused the next thing


---------37:45----------
in terms of resistance


---------37:48----------
so when someone has a clear intent and


---------37:50----------
they try to engage in a in a um you know


---------37:53----------
a problem so it's a v equals ir right


---------37:55----------
oops


---------37:56----------
so there's resistance over here


---------37:58----------
and so you know the the greater the


---------38:00----------
resistance the less likely they are to


---------38:03----------
engage in um the behavior right


---------38:07----------
so the two main contributions of


---------38:09----------
resistance are manas or emotions


---------38:13----------
and ahamkar or in our ego


---------38:17----------
okay what do y'all think about that


---------38:29----------
i mean that's straight facts yeah


---------38:31----------
that's not a lot to say so we'll go into


---------38:33----------
more detail you know so we have a whole


---------38:35----------
day about this


---------38:36----------
so the other interesting thing is that


---------38:38----------
resistance manifests


---------38:42----------
as stuck behaviors


---------38:45----------
okay


---------38:47----------
so what this means is like when people


---------38:49----------
are like watching youtube all day


---------38:51----------
when they're doing drugs when they're


---------38:53----------
gaming all day


---------38:55----------
you know when they're procrastinating


---------38:57----------
like all these things are like


---------38:58----------
manifestations of resistance so if you


---------39:01----------
kind of think about like why do our


---------39:02----------
clients like watch youtube all day like


---------39:04----------
what does that do for them


---------39:08----------
keeps them in the present


---------39:10----------
absolutely right


---------39:12----------
what's another way to put it


---------39:14----------
steven here also mindfulness chad


---------39:19----------
it just kind of looks like i mean


---------39:22----------
the youtube and drugs and all that stuff


---------39:23----------
shuts off a lot of the mundus and active


---------39:26----------
hum car and things like that absolutely


---------39:28----------
right so the youtube so the other way to


---------39:30----------
look at is we can look at neuroscience


---------39:32----------
articles about on internet addiction


---------39:35----------
and if we do an fmri study


---------39:38----------
which is a study of blood flow to the


---------39:40----------
brain what we can what we discover from


---------39:42----------
these like various you know articles on


---------39:44----------
internet addiction is that fmri studies


---------39:47----------
demonstrate that these activities


---------39:49----------
shut down negative emotions circuits


---------39:55----------
so what they're essentially doing is


---------39:56----------
actually self-medicating against this


---------39:59----------
crap over here


---------40:00----------
and oftentimes i'm sure you all


---------40:02----------
understand this as well like what is


---------40:04----------
arguing with strangers on the internet


---------40:06----------
due to your ahamkar


---------40:13----------
it's like really fun


---------40:15----------
fantastic it really feeds into it boosts


---------40:18----------
the ahamka and remember that the ahamkar


---------40:20----------
becomes active when


---------40:23----------
what activates the ahamkar what does it


---------40:25----------
do


---------40:27----------
it's like a threat that protects you so


---------40:29----------
if i feel like a failure


---------40:34----------
and i go argue and school some noob on


---------40:37----------
the internet how do i feel


---------40:41----------
you feel good that you're like pumping


---------40:42----------
yourself up yeah right i'm owning these


---------40:45----------
noobs


---------40:46----------
who cares that i'm 28 years old and


---------40:48----------
living in my mom's basement i'm owning


---------40:50----------
noobs on the internet i'm on the libs


---------40:53----------
you know


---------40:55----------
i'm i'm owning the conservatives i'm a


---------40:57----------
strong social justice warrior and i do


---------40:58----------
lots of virtue signaling


---------41:01----------
signaling or


---------41:02----------
i i'm owning the libs like it goes


---------41:05----------
either way like whatever it is it's all


---------41:06----------
a hum card


---------41:07----------
and so what people will do is like the


---------41:09----------
worse they feel about themselves the


---------41:11----------
more they'll engage with these kinds of


---------41:12----------
things and this is what's great like so


---------41:14----------
this is where it gets really devastating


---------41:15----------
but you know there are platforms like


---------41:17----------
twitter and youtube and stuff that like


---------41:19----------
recognize that engaging people involves


---------41:22----------
like activating their own god


---------41:24----------
you know so people get pissed off on


---------41:26----------
twitter so much like why is that it's


---------41:28----------
because no one can make like a fair or


---------41:30----------
nuanced argument it's all just


---------41:31----------
emotionally charged crap that people are


---------41:33----------
reacting to


---------41:34----------
right there's no way to have a


---------41:36----------
discussion over twitter you can have an


---------41:38----------
argument over twitter


---------41:40----------
you know like but like


---------41:41----------
you know i don't know if you all saw the


---------41:43----------
jimmy from philly interview but like


---------41:44----------
jimmy from philly interview is


---------41:45----------
impossible to have over twitter you have


---------41:47----------
to like actually have a conversation you


---------41:49----------
can argue with jimmy from philly


---------41:51----------
you could tell him he's dumb and he can


---------41:52----------
tell you that you're dumb


---------41:54----------
that works great so it's kind of


---------41:56----------
interesting but all of these things that


---------41:57----------
we see in this generation like we need


---------42:00----------
to understand these principles and as a


---------42:02----------
coach it's your job to help them


---------42:04----------
overcome their resistance


---------42:06----------
and kind of work through some of these


---------42:08----------
behaviors and get them in the direction


---------42:09----------
that they want to go


---------42:11----------
i would say that resistance is probably


---------42:13----------
the biggest blind spot for our clients


---------42:15----------
and this is why oftentimes we'll do


---------42:17----------
things that clients will be kind of


---------42:19----------
confused about and they'll say like is


---------42:20----------
this something i should be talking to


---------42:21----------
our my therapist about because you're


---------42:23----------
kind of focusing on negative emotions


---------42:25----------
and you can absolutely talk to the


---------42:26----------
therapist about it this is where it


---------42:27----------
comes back to what the goals are because


---------42:29----------
what everyone in our community knows is


---------42:32----------
they know what they need to do


---------42:34----------
they just don't understand why they


---------42:35----------
can't do it and why they can't do it so


---------42:37----------
like i know i have a clear intent i need


---------42:40----------
to do this thing so it's this part over


---------42:43----------
here that they're blind to


---------42:45----------
and so that's what we have to help them


---------42:46----------
overcome


---------42:47----------
so the way that we practically are going


---------42:49----------
to do that is you know we're going to


---------42:51----------
use like reflective listening and be


---------42:52----------
compassionate and authentic and all that


---------42:54----------
good stuff we're going to call them out


---------42:55----------
on their bs


---------42:56----------
right when we sort of sniff it out


---------42:58----------
sometimes but we're gonna do it for the


---------42:59----------
purpose of growth


---------43:01----------
and as we kind of explore this stuff


---------43:03----------
with them as we sort of decompress them


---------43:04----------
on us as they no longer feel ashamed no


---------43:07----------
longer feel afraid you know their ego no


---------43:09----------
longer needs to activate and once their


---------43:10----------
ego gets out of the way what's left


---------43:12----------
what's running the show afterward anyone


---------43:14----------
remember


---------43:18----------
what's the third part of the mind that


---------43:19----------
we want to be operating from


---------43:21----------
intellect


---------43:23----------
yep


---------43:25----------
and this is the big problem if you guys


---------43:28----------
um you know have watched dr k's guide


---------43:30----------
hopefully people will understand this


---------43:31----------
concept


---------43:32----------
but the the big problem is that everyone


---------43:34----------
thinks that they're they're operating on


---------43:36----------
intellect all the time but oftentimes


---------43:38----------
it's a god controlling the internet the


---------43:41----------
in intellect


---------43:43----------
and so what happens is they have a lot


---------43:44----------
of uh


---------43:46----------
biases right they think that they're


---------43:48----------
behaving perfectly logically and the


---------43:50----------
person they're arguing with thinks


---------43:52----------
they're behaving perfectly logically as


---------43:53----------
well everyone's perfectly logical


---------43:55----------
because it's my mind is logical right


---------43:57----------
i'm not irrational everyone else is


---------43:58----------
irrational but as long as the ahamkar is


---------44:00----------
controlling the buddhi the conclusions


---------44:03----------
of the buddha are going to be incorrect


---------44:05----------
so this is the problem is that they all


---------44:07----------
think they're operating well and this is


---------44:09----------
why it's tricky as a coach but helping


---------44:11----------
them recognize their blind spots in


---------44:12----------
terms of emotion is how you're going to


---------44:14----------
overcome the resistance we'll give you


---------44:16----------
all more techniques and more details on


---------44:17----------
that


---------44:18----------
later


---------44:21----------
and this is also what's kind of


---------44:22----------
frustrating for a lot of a lot of our


---------44:24----------
clients is when they have resistance


---------44:26----------
it's kind of like a blocked pipe and so


---------44:28----------
then what they do is they're pumping


---------44:30----------
more stuff into this end right


---------44:33----------
and like this is what leads to burnout


---------44:36----------
and frustration


---------44:38----------
because they're kind of focusing on like


---------44:40----------
building up motivation and dumping


---------44:42----------
energy into the system and they dump


---------44:44----------
more energy and they dump more energy


---------44:45----------
and more energy whereas all it really


---------44:47----------
takes is an elegant solution of reducing


---------44:50----------
this resistance clearing that blockage


---------44:52----------
and then suddenly the amount of energy


---------44:54----------
they need to put in the system is


---------44:55----------
actually less and they get more output


---------44:58----------
and this is where if we go back to the


---------44:59----------
cases that we heard earlier people were


---------45:01----------
like it wasn't they weren't doing


---------45:02----------
anything they weren't doing anything


---------45:03----------
they weren't doing and suddenly they're


---------45:04----------
crushing all their goals like how the


---------45:06----------
[ __ ] does that work it's because y'all


---------45:07----------
are removing that resistance in the


---------45:09----------
middle and then suddenly they it starts


---------45:11----------
flowing and it feels natural and this is


---------45:13----------
the thing because when people think


---------45:14----------
about motivation they think like oh my


---------45:16----------
god it's like i have to like work really


---------45:17----------
hard uh no true motivation is like feels


---------45:20----------
very natural it actually feels


---------45:21----------
effortless and that's what we want to


---------45:23----------
shoot for with our clients


---------45:25----------
okay


---------45:26----------
um another thing that i should mention


---------45:29----------
so oftentimes this resistance is also a


---------45:31----------
sum scott


---------45:32----------
i guess that goes without saying with


---------45:33----------
y'all but you know just for the sake of


---------45:35----------
completeness


---------45:36----------
and then we get to the third dimension


---------45:38----------
which is action


---------45:40----------
so this is probably the area healthy


---------45:41----------
gamer that we've been the least


---------45:43----------
supportive of y'all with


---------45:45----------
we really could have done a better job


---------45:46----------
and that's actually the main thing


---------45:48----------
around this um


---------45:50----------
uh you know this training is a big part


---------45:52----------
of that so at the end of the day


---------45:54----------
setting the right kind of goals is like


---------45:57----------
really really important for our clients


---------45:58----------
so we've got a couple of steps here


---------45:59----------
first is understand the person


---------46:03----------
so i'm going to ask you all a couple of


---------46:04----------
questions


---------46:06----------
how do your clients decide what goal to


---------46:08----------
pick


---------46:13----------
where do their goals come from


---------46:19----------
when they want to change them


---------46:22----------
okay should do go ahead ken


---------46:24----------
when they want to change something about


---------46:25----------
themselves but how do they know that


---------46:27----------
that's something that they should change


---------46:29----------
or in what way they're going to change


---------46:30----------
it


---------46:34----------
they look around a lot and see


---------46:36----------
other people doing stuff or being things


---------46:40----------
all right so what what games y'all play


---------46:43----------
games


---------46:45----------
what do y'all play


---------46:48----------
league


---------46:49----------
okay league noob okay


---------46:51----------
so like you know this is kind of


---------46:52----------
interesting because but like


---------46:54----------
so what you know if i i let's say i


---------46:56----------
watch a video on league and i see some


---------46:58----------
pro player like owning with this hero or


---------47:00----------
champion right and then i'm like oh like


---------47:03----------
if i want to own games


---------47:05----------
and climb and gain gain mmr like i need


---------47:07----------
to play that hero how effective is that


---------47:10----------
is a strategy to like win at league


---------47:16----------
terrible


---------47:18----------
why


---------47:19----------
but your character choice isn't why


---------47:21----------
you're winning or


---------47:22----------
losing but no pax dude i saw this guy he


---------47:25----------
was crushing with his hero


---------47:29----------
yeah well maybe if you were more of a


---------47:30----------
sigma male you would have like won with


---------47:32----------
that character


---------47:33----------
okay


---------47:34----------
right so it's interesting so like this


---------47:36----------
happens all the time in dota 2 where


---------47:38----------
like you know you'll look at what other


---------47:40----------
people are owning with and you're like


---------47:41----------
oh like i just happens all the time so i


---------47:43----------
don't know if you guys have had this


---------47:44----------
experience where you get owned by a


---------47:46----------
particular hero in a game and it's like


---------47:48----------
next like that's so easy it's so broken


---------47:50----------
oh my god it's so op in the next game


---------47:52----------
when you queue up you're like i'm gonna


---------47:53----------
pick that op hero it's gonna be an easy


---------47:55----------
win it's so broken what happens


---------48:00----------
you get crushed


---------48:01----------
absolutely right so i want you all to


---------48:03----------
think about this because this is this is


---------48:04----------
legit okay


---------48:06----------
that's literally how our community picks


---------48:09----------
their goals they look at some random ass


---------48:12----------
person and they say look at what that


---------48:14----------
person did to be successful let me just


---------48:15----------
mimic what they did and then i will be


---------48:17----------
successful and then they get crushed


---------48:20----------
because steven's spot on they look


---------48:22----------
around for their goals


---------48:25----------
okay one of my first coaching clients


---------48:27----------
ever


---------48:28----------
got out of jail


---------48:30----------
and i was like


---------48:31----------
he's like i need to find a job and i was


---------48:33----------
like how are you like what kind of job


---------48:34----------
do you want and he's like well


---------48:36----------
i have a buddy who works at a car wash


---------48:39----------
so i guess i'll work there and it's like


---------48:41----------
hold on a second bro take a big step


---------48:43----------
back


---------48:44----------
you know you've got two weeks of like


---------48:46----------
stuff where you have to find a job


---------48:47----------
before you start working at the car wash


---------48:49----------
let's think about like what all of your


---------48:51----------
options are so after talking to him for


---------48:53----------
a long time and like working through


---------48:55----------
stuff he started to get a job at a car


---------48:56----------
wash but he also like started getting


---------48:58----------
into emt training became an emt started


---------49:01----------
working as an emt for a while then like


---------49:04----------
went into the med tech field and then is


---------49:06----------
now like a


---------49:07----------
like a medical device rep or something


---------49:09----------
like that


---------49:11----------
but most of what where our clients goals


---------49:13----------
come from is just like what they see


---------49:15----------
other people doing oh it worked for this


---------49:17----------
person


---------49:18----------
it worked for you know reading one book


---------49:19----------
a day is how this person made a million


---------49:21----------
dollars so i'm going to start reading


---------49:22----------
one book a day


---------49:24----------
so the first thing that we want to do in


---------49:25----------
terms of setting the right at the right


---------49:27----------
goals is understand the person and a lot


---------49:29----------
of times like they don't do this step


---------49:31----------
right they focus on they look outside of


---------49:33----------
themselves to try to figure out what the


---------49:35----------
right goal is this can be very


---------49:36----------
frustrating for our clients because


---------49:38----------
they're coming the first week and


---------49:39----------
they'll be like how do i fix my life


---------49:40----------
give me the plan


---------49:42----------
but we can't give them the plan yet we


---------49:43----------
have to understand who they are first


---------49:45----------
then we can worry about the plan okay


---------49:48----------
so


---------49:50----------
um


---------49:51----------
you know understand the person the


---------49:52----------
second thing is set appropriate goals


---------49:54----------
and there are a couple of techniques


---------49:55----------
here that we're going to teach all


---------49:59----------
right so so it's not going to be you set


---------50:01----------
the goal for them it's the two y'all are


---------50:02----------
going to like work together to set the


---------50:03----------
right goal and then you know you're


---------50:05----------
going to develop an action plan


---------50:08----------
they're going to try it and when they


---------50:09----------
try what's going to happen


---------50:12----------
they going to do it


---------50:16----------
they're going to fail


---------50:18----------
they're going to fail excellent then


---------50:20----------
what's your job as a coach


---------50:24----------
provide compassion through their trial


---------50:26----------
and error


---------50:27----------
excellent


---------50:29----------
because here's the big thing


---------50:31----------
right so when i when i set a goal for


---------50:34----------
myself and i fail like that creates all


---------50:36----------
the crap


---------50:37----------
mana sahamkar all that sort of stuff so


---------50:39----------
as a coach we're going to help them pick


---------50:41----------
pick themselves up off the ground dust


---------50:43----------
themselves off and try again right so


---------50:45----------
we're going to provide emotional support


---------50:47----------
and we're also going to provide feedback


---------50:49----------
so we're going to be a lens because in


---------50:50----------
that mindset like it's hard to be


---------50:52----------
objective right so we're going to be


---------50:53----------
objective for them and we're going to


---------50:55----------
try to figure things out and then


---------50:57----------
essentially


---------50:58----------
our you know


---------51:00----------
our goal setting and like accountability


---------51:02----------
uh you know approach as coaches is


---------51:04----------
iterative


---------51:05----------
who knows what this word means


---------51:12----------
means you have to iterate which means


---------51:15----------
each time something goes wrong you


---------51:16----------
change one thing and you keep doing that


---------51:18----------
until you find something that works yep


---------51:21----------
perfect right


---------51:22----------
so we want to set appropriate so as a


---------51:24----------
goal we want to set uh as coaches we


---------51:26----------
want to set appropriate goals


---------51:32----------
these goals should


---------51:34----------
factor in


---------51:36----------
strengths and weaknesses


---------51:40----------
of the client


---------51:43----------
right


---------51:45----------
next thing that we need to do


---------51:47----------
support them when they screw up


---------51:54----------
and then fourth thing is iterate


---------51:56----------
how can we okay how can we do it better


---------51:58----------
next time


---------52:00----------
and so in my experience when y'all do


---------52:02----------
this


---------52:03----------
okay when you clarify intent when you


---------52:06----------
work with their resistance when you set


---------52:07----------
appropriate goals


---------52:09----------
this is how you help someone change


---------52:11----------
their life


---------52:12----------
questions


---------52:17----------
yeah i had one question about the um


---------52:20----------
you said your first client you know he


---------52:21----------
got out of jail and then you know he was


---------52:23----------
like okay i should start working at the


---------52:24----------
car wash because my friend is there the


---------52:26----------
way you told the story it sounds like


---------52:28----------
you know you kind of immediately kind of


---------52:31----------
like he said that and then you were like


---------52:33----------
well hang on like let's think about this


---------52:35----------
um


---------52:36----------
i don't know if that's how it actually


---------52:38----------
panned out or if that was just like the


---------52:39----------
summary version because you know my


---------52:40----------
understanding is like sometimes like you


---------52:42----------
know it kind of depends on where you're


---------52:43----------
at with like the relationship sometimes


---------52:44----------
like


---------52:45----------
putting the brakes on something


---------52:47----------
you know like those that kind of


---------52:48----------
assumption is like


---------52:50----------
you know you kind of have to like let it


---------52:51----------
ride for a little bit first before you


---------52:53----------
can like actually explore alternatives


---------52:54----------
but it sounds like the way you told it


---------52:55----------
was like you went straight to there


---------52:57----------
yeah so i'll tell you what i did i think


---------52:59----------
you all would handle this


---------53:00----------
you all would have done the same


---------53:01----------
basically um so i basically asked him


---------53:04----------
help me understand


---------53:06----------
or let me ask you so if your client


---------53:08----------
let's see if y'all's


---------53:09----------
i'll just say so i asked him like help


---------53:11----------
me understand like how you came to the


---------53:13----------
conclusion to work at the car wash


---------53:15----------
right


---------53:16----------
and then i asked like you know simple


---------53:18----------
open-ended questions that made him


---------53:19----------
realize that he had like huge errors in


---------53:21----------
his thought process and catalyzed change


---------53:23----------
which is what else did you consider


---------53:27----------
and he was like


---------53:29----------
i didn't consider anything else that's


---------53:31----------
not what he said he's like i don't know


---------53:35----------
right so like people don't so this is


---------53:37----------
the big problem this is why y'all are


---------53:39----------
useful to be blunt is because people


---------53:42----------
don't they're blind to their own blind


---------53:44----------
spots


---------53:46----------
right that's the biggest problem so if


---------53:47----------
we think about like why people stay


---------53:49----------
stuck like human beings are smart


---------53:51----------
especially our community


---------53:53----------
like if they understand a problem


---------53:55----------
correctly they will fix it themselves so


---------53:57----------
by definition the problems that people


---------53:59----------
get stuck on are the ones that are


---------54:00----------
misdiagnosed this is a concept that


---------54:02----------
started with carl jung and he kind of


---------54:04----------
said like everyone has a shadow and the


---------54:07----------
most growth that a human being can have


---------54:09----------
is in looking at the shadow because the


---------54:11----------
shadow is the part of yourself that by


---------54:13----------
definition you neglect to look at


---------54:16----------
and so like most of the things like if


---------54:17----------
there's one part of the world that's


---------54:19----------
like forbidden


---------54:20----------
that's where there's the most


---------54:21----------
opportunity for discovery


---------54:26----------
does that make sense facts


---------54:28----------
oh for sure


---------54:30----------
right so so like in terms of how i


---------54:32----------
worked with this person so i asked him


---------54:33----------
like what else did you consider and he's


---------54:34----------
like


---------54:35----------
what


---------54:36----------
that's not how he operates right he


---------54:39----------
doesn't like he doesn't think about


---------54:41----------
approaching his life in a systematic way


---------54:44----------
he just kind of like does what he sees


---------54:45----------
other people doing which is how most of


---------54:47----------
us do it


---------54:48----------
it's how our brain let's monkey see


---------54:49----------
monkey do right that's how like you


---------54:50----------
think about how you learn slang


---------54:53----------
like how does that happen there's no


---------54:54----------
intent


---------54:56----------
there are like circuits in your brain


---------54:57----------
that are literally designed


---------54:59----------
to adjust your behavior based on what


---------55:02----------
you see and shape your behavior


---------55:04----------
i don't know if you all have ever like


---------55:05----------
lived in a different country where there


---------55:06----------
was like a social custom that like


---------55:09----------
people there didn't do


---------55:11----------
so for me it's like shaking hands


---------55:14----------
it's like i went to india and i'd like


---------55:15----------
shake people's hands and they were like


---------55:17----------
confused


---------55:18----------
because they don't do that there and


---------55:19----------
after a while i kind of stopped


---------55:22----------
right so i just like and so there's like


---------55:24----------
literally a part of my brain that's like


---------55:26----------
constantly adjusting how i


---------55:28----------
view situations


---------55:32----------
and then over time i started asking


---------55:33----------
questions like what do you care about


---------55:35----------
you know like do you are you passionate


---------55:37----------
about car washes like do you want to be


---------55:38----------
an entrepreneur do you want to open up


---------55:39----------
your own car wash one day he's like no


---------55:42----------
and he's like what he cared about was


---------55:43----------
excitement so his options were like join


---------55:45----------
the military or like do something else


---------55:47----------
that's exciting


---------55:49----------
so i would ask him like what do you find


---------55:50----------
exciting he's like i think combat would


---------55:51----------
be cool


---------55:52----------
i was like okay what else


---------55:55----------
and he's like well like


---------55:57----------
maybe like being a police officer


---------55:59----------
and like we kind of stumbled on empty


---------56:01----------
and i was like okay like maybe if you


---------56:02----------
want to you know go into combat


---------56:04----------
maybe emt training would be helpful and


---------56:06----------
he hated school like he hates he hated


---------56:08----------
emt training but he was totally fine


---------56:10----------
doing gave it 100 because like oh


---------56:13----------
like this is going to be useful for me


---------56:14----------
even though i detest doing it going to


---------56:16----------
school for the purpose


---------56:18----------
of like it's good for me is not a good


---------56:21----------
motivator


---------56:22----------
even doing school that you detest doing


---------56:24----------
because he wants to live an exciting


---------56:26----------
life he doesn't want to sit in a


---------56:27----------
classroom somewhere and telling him hey


---------56:28----------
if you like wind up in combat somewhere


---------56:31----------
maybe it'll be useful to get emt skills


---------56:33----------
and he's like yeah i can get behind that


---------56:35----------
and then he's motivated


---------56:37----------
right and then you do like further work


---------56:39----------
with him you ask him you know why are


---------56:40----------
you craving excitement things like that


---------56:41----------
you kind of get deeper and deeper and


---------56:42----------
then eventually he ends up with one of


---------56:44----------
the most boring jobs in the universe or


---------56:46----------
maybe it's exciting i don't know


---------56:47----------
he's a medical device rep


---------56:50----------
he likes his job he's happy


---------56:54----------
has the added benefit of you know lower


---------56:56----------
chance of casualty


---------57:01----------
other questions


---------57:03----------
yeah i'm curious where like focus or


---------57:05----------
attention comes into play like


---------57:07----------
motivation or like the intent resistance


---------57:09----------
action


---------57:10----------
the focusing of attention


---------57:13----------
yeah like focus attention stuff like


---------57:15----------
that


---------57:16----------
so we'll get into that so there's stuff


---------57:18----------
um that there's a lot of stuff that has


---------57:20----------
to do with motivation which is a little


---------57:22----------
bit outside the scope of coaching but


---------57:25----------
when we think about that intent so focus


---------57:28----------
is there is what i would put on the


---------57:30----------
intent side so if we think about like if


---------57:32----------
check out i don't know if you all have


---------57:33----------
watched if you all watch the video on


---------57:35----------
daruna the origin of motivation and dr


---------57:37----------
k's guide


---------57:38----------
you'll gone through that


---------57:40----------
yep


---------57:41----------
so


---------57:42----------
you know there's a lot of stuff there


---------57:44----------
but basically if we think about how do


---------57:46----------
you sustain motivation i recognize that


---------57:49----------
we just sort of said motivation isn't


---------57:50----------
one thing but i'd say that


---------57:53----------
focusing your attention is like the


---------57:55----------
major way of doing it and where does


---------57:57----------
attention


---------57:59----------
fit into that graph it fits into the


---------58:01----------
intention side it's the energy that you


---------58:04----------
put in so the more focused your mind is


---------58:07----------
the more like cognitive energy you can


---------58:10----------
leverage into a particular thing


---------58:15----------
wouldn't it also come into play into


---------58:16----------
action to keep yourself like focused on


---------58:18----------
what you're doing


---------58:20----------
yes you could definitely put it there


---------58:22----------
um


---------58:23----------
that has probably more to do with the


---------58:25----------
way that i'm defining action which is


---------58:27----------
like around appropriate goal setting


---------58:29----------
and adjusting expectations and things


---------58:31----------
like that so it's absolutely a part of


---------58:33----------
like physically what they have to do yes


---------58:36----------
absolutely but in terms of and so this


---------58:38----------
is what's a little bit different about


---------58:39----------
talking about motivation in general and


---------58:41----------
talking about it as a coach


---------58:43----------
so what we're doing here is trying to


---------58:45----------
help you


---------58:46----------
figure out how can you like essentially


---------58:48----------
like increase you know the gravity of


---------58:51----------
their situation so that


---------58:53----------
the the potential difference between


---------58:54----------
where they want to go and where they are


---------58:56----------
where they are and where they want to go


---------58:58----------
is like easy for them that's your goal


---------59:00----------
as a coach


---------59:01----------
right so an example of that is you know


---------59:03----------
you all know the the you know the half


---------59:04----------
of half rule in terms of goal setting


---------59:07----------
you guys have picked this up yet


---------59:09----------
so in terms of goal setting what we


---------59:11----------
recommend is think about where you are


---------59:13----------
think about where you want to go cut


---------59:14----------
that in half and then cut that in half


---------59:16----------
again that should be your first target


---------59:19----------
so that's something that the parent


---------59:21----------
program


---------59:22----------
was very successful because of like that


---------59:24----------
principle because all these parents like


---------59:26----------
have this idea that they want they want


---------59:28----------
to transform their kids into like you


---------59:30----------
know 4.0 valedictorians who are playing


---------59:32----------
sports and you know


---------59:34----------
learning a musical instrument just like


---------59:35----------
ain't going to happen


---------59:37----------
you got to like adjust your expectations


---------59:40----------
and start small


---------59:41----------
and then like over time like it's


---------59:43----------
interesting because we can get 100 of


---------59:45----------
the way there like it's absolutely


---------59:47----------
possible


---------59:48----------
we just want to start in a particular


---------59:50----------
way as a coach you want to help your


---------59:51----------
client set a goal for themselves that


---------59:54----------
they can achieve and then like build on


---------59:56----------
that success


---------59:58----------
and then the challenge we'll get to this


---------59:59----------
in the goal setting but


---------60:01----------
the challenge with that is that they're


---------60:02----------
going to say like what is a client going


---------60:03----------
to say if they say oh i want to like i


---------60:05----------
need to like you know get a 4.0 and you


---------60:08----------
tell them like why don't you start with


---------60:09----------
a 2.0 what's their resistance going to


---------60:12----------
be that's not good enough exactly right


---------60:16----------
so that's where you do the work as a


---------60:18----------
coach of helping them let go of that


---------60:20----------
idea


---------60:21----------
like not good enough is not a reason to


---------60:24----------
keep from acting


---------60:26----------
you got to start somewhere like if you


---------60:28----------
end up with a 4.0 great


---------60:31----------
but if you open if you never crack the


---------60:34----------
book


---------60:35----------
because you're saying to yourself


---------60:36----------
whatever i do today is not going to be


---------60:38----------
good enough that's a self-fulfilling


---------60:40----------
prophecy which is why they believe it in


---------60:42----------
the first place


---------60:43----------
because what they've tried in the past


---------60:45----------
has not been enough


---------60:47----------
so you got to get underneath that and


---------60:49----------
like help them dismantle the idea of


---------60:50----------
like not good enough it's not a thing


---------60:53----------
there's only action


---------61:02----------
you
