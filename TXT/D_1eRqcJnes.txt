---------00:15----------
over the past few years I've had the


---------00:18----------
chance to work with dozens of gamers and


---------00:21----------
the more I work with gamers the more I


---------00:24----------
started to wonder like what's actually


---------00:25----------
going on in these people's brains in my


---------00:29----------
Dave job I'm an addiction psychiatrist


---------00:31----------
so I tend to work with people who have


---------00:33----------
problems with alcohol or opiates or


---------00:36----------
marijuana and one of the things that I


---------00:38----------
have always found really helpful is to


---------00:40----------
understand how do these substances


---------00:42----------
actually affect the chemistry in


---------00:45----------
someone's brain and so the more I work


---------00:48----------
with gamers the more I realized that


---------00:50----------
gaming certainly has effects in people's


---------00:53----------
brains but those effects tend to be a


---------00:55----------
little bit more subtle than what happens


---------00:57----------
with biological addictions like alcohol


---------01:00----------
alcohol for example directly stimulates


---------01:03----------
certain receptors in your brain that


---------01:05----------
give you feelings of euphoria and


---------01:07----------
disinhibition and kind of slowed you


---------01:09----------
down a little bit


---------01:11----------
whereas gaming affects your brain in in


---------01:13----------
slower ways it's not like we're it's not


---------01:15----------
an actual chemical or physical substance


---------01:18----------
that's entering your bloodstream and


---------01:20----------
directly activating parts of your brain


---------01:22----------
the way that games affect your brain


---------01:24----------
tend to be in smaller ways and they tend


---------01:28----------
to affect different parts of your brain


---------01:30----------
at the same time so the first kind of


---------01:33----------
circuitry that I wanted to talk about


---------01:35----------
today is your reward circuitry or your


---------01:37----------
dopamine circuitry and dopamine is the


---------01:40----------
primary neurotransmitter that regulates


---------01:43----------
pleasure in the brain so in there's this


---------01:46----------
part of the brain called the nucleus


---------01:47----------
accumbens and when dopamine activity


---------01:49----------
happens there it's one of the ways in


---------01:52----------
which we feel pleasure it's like the


---------01:54----------
pleasure center of our brain if we look


---------01:57----------
at a lot of drugs of abuse like cocaine


---------01:59----------
and amphetamines and things like that


---------02:01----------
those stimulant medication are those


---------02:04----------
stimulant drugs tend to directly


---------02:06----------
increase dopamine in our brain which


---------02:08----------
makes us feel good and euphoric


---------02:11----------
videogames usually start out that way so


---------02:14----------
if you stop and think about why is a


---------02:16----------
video game fun like what makes it fun


---------02:19----------
it's because there's something going on


---------02:21----------
with your with the way that you're


---------02:22----------
interacting with the game and there's


---------02:24----------
some degree of engagement that causes


---------02:27----------
this dopamine release to happen


---------02:29----------
in your brain and so that's what makes a


---------02:32----------
game fun the interesting thing is the


---------02:34----------
more I work with gamers and you guys may


---------02:36----------
feel like this is this happened to you


---------02:37----------
too there are three discrete phases that


---------02:41----------
a gamer goes through when they play a


---------02:42----------
game


---------02:43----------
the first phase tends to be when the


---------02:46----------
game is actively fun like the more you


---------02:48----------
play you're actually enjoying yourself


---------02:49----------
it's a lot of fun you want to keep


---------02:51----------
playing it and then over time we're


---------02:53----------
talking more like months or years not


---------02:56----------
days as you continue to game regularly


---------03:00----------
your brain starts to adapt to that


---------03:03----------
steady degree of dopamine release and


---------03:05----------
our brain has a very normal mechanism


---------03:07----------
called homeostasis where it tries to


---------03:11----------
maintain kind of a balanced state so one


---------03:14----------
of the ways that homeostasis manifests


---------03:16----------
is a biological principle we call


---------03:19----------
tolerance so if you think about someone


---------03:21----------
who drinks for the first time the


---------03:23----------
alcohol really like they can get drunk


---------03:26----------
really quick but if you start to drink


---------03:28----------
on a regular basis your body develops


---------03:30----------
tolerance to the alcohol it takes more


---------03:34----------
and more alcohol to make you feel like


---------03:36----------
you're drunk because what's happening is


---------03:38----------
your body is starting to make itself


---------03:41----------
less sensitive to the effects of alcohol


---------03:43----------
and gaming is actually no different so


---------03:46----------
in the first phase of gaming our body


---------03:48----------
really hasn't acclimatized to that


---------03:50----------
dopamine release so it starts to feel


---------03:52----------
really really fun in the second phase we


---------03:55----------
start to develop tolerance to that


---------03:57----------
constant stream of dopamine and so what


---------04:00----------
happens is the game starts to be less


---------04:02----------
fun when you're playing the game you're


---------04:04----------
not having as much fun as when you used


---------04:06----------
to in the second phase it doesn't really


---------04:09----------
give us a high but it can still remove a


---------04:12----------
low so some people when they game when


---------04:14----------
they start to first when they first


---------04:15----------
start gaming they feel like they're


---------04:17----------
having fun they feel like it's kind of


---------04:19----------
like a high and then in the second phase


---------04:21----------
even though you don't feel the high if


---------04:23----------
you're feeling bad and you start to game


---------04:26----------
you can make those negative feelings go


---------04:28----------
away so if you're feeling stressed out


---------04:30----------
if you're feeling frustrated if you're


---------04:32----------
feeling pissed off then there's a chance


---------04:34----------
that when you play the game those


---------04:35----------
feelings will kind of go into the


---------04:36----------
background and we'll talk a little bit


---------04:38----------
more about emotions so in the first


---------04:40----------
phase it's kind of giving you a positive


---------04:43----------
motion in the second phase it's getting


---------04:45----------
rid of a negative emotion if people


---------04:48----------
continue to game what actually happens


---------04:51----------
is they enter this third phase which is


---------04:52----------
which is also true biological addictions


---------04:55----------
where it doesn't even take away the


---------04:57----------
negative emotions and some of you guys


---------04:59----------
feel like you're kind of trapped in your


---------05:01----------
gaming it's not even fun for you anymore


---------05:04----------
but you somehow don't know how to stop


---------05:06----------
doing it you don't even have fun with it


---------05:08----------
but it's like you can't you just can't


---------05:09----------
do anything else and it's not like you


---------05:12----------
actually enjoy your gaming it's just you


---------05:14----------
can't stop


---------05:15----------
and if you've reached that point where


---------05:17----------
the game doesn't even if you play a game


---------05:19----------
for 12 hours a day and you actually stop


---------05:21----------
and think you're not even having fun


---------05:22----------
during those 12 hours that's really when


---------05:25----------
you've started to develop a biological


---------05:27----------
addiction and so what does that actually


---------05:30----------
mean what's going on in your brain so it


---------05:32----------
starts off with when you're playing a


---------05:34----------
game it releases dopamine in this area


---------05:36----------
called the nucleus accumbens and as the


---------05:39----------
brain gets used to that dopamine release


---------05:41----------
it actually starts to decrease its


---------05:45----------
sensitivity to receive that dopamine


---------05:47----------
signal so it's kind of like turning the


---------05:49----------
volume down on you know like a radio


---------05:53----------
where the strength of the signal of the


---------05:55----------
radio is the same no matter whether the


---------05:57----------
volume is up or the volume is down but


---------05:59----------
you can change the way that that signal


---------06:01----------
is manifested by adjusting the volume so


---------06:05----------
it's like your brain is actually turning


---------06:06----------
down the volume on your dopamine


---------06:08----------
circuitry because it's getting so much


---------06:10----------
dopamine all the time overtime this


---------06:13----------
leads to this state called dopamine


---------06:15----------
exhaustion where your body is so


---------06:18----------
chronically used to having that high


---------06:20----------
level of dopamine from the game that the


---------06:23----------
volume is turned way down and that


---------06:25----------
causes huge problems for gamers because


---------06:28----------
other things that you would normally


---------06:30----------
find fun start to become less fun


---------06:33----------
because your dopamine tolerance is so


---------06:36----------
high and you've hit this point of


---------06:37----------
dopamine exhaustion when I work with


---------06:40----------
gamers and you guys let me know if you


---------06:42----------
feel the same way a lot of what they


---------06:44----------
tell me is that the game actually isn't


---------06:45----------
as fun as it used to be but if they try


---------06:49----------
to do other things they don't find those


---------06:51----------
other things as fun as well it's like


---------06:53----------
things that like going out to front with


---------06:56----------
for dinner is like kind of fun or they


---------06:58----------
used to do other things like they used


---------07:00----------
to maybe play like pickup football or


---------07:02----------
they used to watch more movies or


---------07:05----------
something like that but that even other


---------07:07----------
activities outside of gaming become less


---------07:10----------
fun and that's really really dangerous


---------07:13----------
because when gamers when you try to stop


---------07:16----------
gaming what you have to do is you have


---------07:18----------
to do something else instead so you're


---------07:20----------
getting out of the house more but the


---------07:22----------
problem is that when you get out of the


---------07:23----------
house and you try to do something that


---------07:25----------
other people consider fun you may find


---------07:28----------
that you actually don't feel like that


---------07:30----------
activity is fun and at that point the


---------07:32----------
gamer concludes oh I don't like X Y or Z


---------07:35----------
I don't like going to an art museum


---------07:37----------
because it isn't as fun as the game I


---------07:39----------
don't like going for a hike or I don't


---------07:41----------
like hanging out with these other people


---------07:43----------
because it's just not as fun what you


---------07:46----------
need to realize as a gamer is that when


---------07:49----------
you feel like it's not as fun there's


---------07:51----------
actually a change in your neuro


---------07:53----------
chemistry that's going to make it so


---------07:55----------
that any activity that you do that you


---------07:58----------
would normally find enjoyable is gonna


---------08:00----------
be dulled because of the way that games


---------08:02----------
have exhausted your dopamine circuitry


---------08:05----------
and so what you really have to do and


---------08:07----------
this is why it's so hard to quit gaming


---------08:09----------
is give yourself time away from the game


---------08:11----------
and then your body will reset its


---------08:15----------
homeostasis to have kind of a normal


---------08:18----------
dopamine level and once that reset


---------08:20----------
happens and that can take somewhere


---------08:22----------
between probably three weeks and two


---------08:24----------
months to be completely honest you


---------08:27----------
should start to get some change within


---------08:29----------
one week but like by three weeks you


---------08:30----------
should have a decent change and by two


---------08:32----------
months you should have it kind of be


---------08:33----------
completely back to normal during that


---------08:36----------
period of time you just have to


---------08:38----------
recognize that anything else that you do


---------08:40----------
may be less fun because of the way that


---------08:42----------
your dopamine neurocircuitry has been


---------08:44----------
changed and so when you're thinking


---------08:46----------
about gaming first ask yourself did you


---------08:50----------
go through these phases did I first find


---------08:52----------
that games were a lot of fun did I then


---------08:55----------
find that games weren't as fun but if I


---------08:58----------
was having a bad day they still kind of


---------09:00----------
made me feel better and then the third


---------09:02----------
phase is if you've hit the point where


---------09:04----------
you're playing games and you don't even


---------09:06----------
know why you're playing them anymore you


---------09:07----------
don't even find them fun but you can't


---------09:09----------
stop


---------09:09----------
then chances are you've got this


---------09:12----------
dopamine circuitry exhaustion problem


---------09:13----------
and then understand that when you try to


---------09:16----------
go out into the real world and find


---------09:18----------
alternatives to gaming because of the


---------09:21----------
way that your dopamine circuits have


---------09:22----------
been exhausted you're not going to find


---------09:24----------
that stuff as fun and if you actually


---------09:27----------
give yourself a couple of weeks or a


---------09:29----------
couple of months you'll start to enjoy


---------09:31----------
activities in a different way that has


---------09:33----------
nothing to do with your preferences or


---------09:36----------
your likes or your dislikes it all has


---------09:38----------
it has everything to do with what your


---------09:40----------
brain is actually capable of in terms of


---------09:43----------
feeling enjoyment
