---------00:00----------
and so then when i ask you the question


---------00:01----------
like is your dad proud of you and you're


---------00:02----------
like i don't know what difference that


---------00:03----------
would make dude it's going to make all


---------00:05----------
the difference


---------00:07----------
i think i'd know how to process that


---------00:09----------
even if he did


---------00:11----------
say it you're damn right you don't which


---------00:14----------
is the entire problem


---------00:17----------
right because like how do you process


---------00:19----------
that which you've never heard before


---------00:26----------
uh yeah oh hey hey man


---------00:31----------
yeah that um last interview was march of


---------00:34----------
last year


---------00:35----------
actually okay so so and we are following


---------00:38----------
up with you right i have the right


---------00:39----------
asriel


---------00:40----------
yes okay yeah so i was gonna say like


---------00:43----------
now that i i see the face i remember so


---------00:45----------
we talked about


---------00:46----------
social anxiety or something or


---------00:48----------
confidence


---------00:50----------
i think we talked about overthinking


---------00:53----------
okay


---------00:54----------
so you know when i have to do something


---------00:57----------
and then like i'll generate all these


---------00:59----------
thoughts about what could go wrong


---------01:01----------
okay so can you fill us in a little bit


---------01:04----------
about um


---------01:05----------
in a little bit more detail about what


---------01:07----------
we covered last week


---------01:08----------
i mean last our last year


---------01:12----------
um i don't know it's a long time ago


---------01:16----------
i think we talked a lot about sort of


---------01:19----------
success and failure


---------01:21----------
and like feeling destined to succeed or


---------01:24----------
fail


---------01:25----------
okay um there was


---------01:30----------
i don't know okay so tell us


---------01:33----------
how have you been over the last year and


---------01:35----------
a half it's been about 15 months right


---------01:40----------
something like that um i don't know


---------01:42----------
there's been a lot that's going on


---------01:44----------
so i've done coaching okay and i


---------01:48----------
you know i think i mentioned last stream


---------01:50----------
that like i was switching majors to


---------01:52----------
physics


---------01:53----------
i ended up dropping out of physics and


---------01:56----------
switching back to marine biology


---------01:58----------
okay and then with the help of the


---------02:00----------
therapist


---------02:01----------
i actually managed to finish second year


---------02:04----------
a few months ago okay and


---------02:08----------
i got back into coaching a few months


---------02:11----------
ago in the high performance group


---------02:15----------
okay cool so so it sounds like you've


---------02:17----------
been and how do you feel about


---------02:20----------
how do you feel about stuff


---------02:24----------
um so it was definitely


---------02:28----------
very rough in the beginning i think i


---------02:32----------
like like just so much has happened that


---------02:36----------
i'm definitely feeling a lot better now


---------02:38----------
than i was


---------02:40----------
um i don't know it's i've been focusing


---------02:44----------
a lot on self-improvement and just


---------02:47----------
getting better


---------02:48----------
and improving myself and you know


---------02:51----------
feeling my emotions and trying to


---------02:56----------
you know take action in my life so


---------03:00----------
that's for you man yeah so


---------03:03----------
this you want to say something go ahead


---------03:07----------
um yeah so i'm kind of if i remember


---------03:10----------
because it has been a while


---------03:11----------
um i if i remember correctly you were


---------03:14----------
very


---------03:15----------
externally concerned like your mind


---------03:18----------
would think about what would happen


---------03:21----------
yeah right so like you can do


---------03:24----------
does that ring i mean can you share with


---------03:26----------
us because like remind me a little bit


---------03:28----------
if you remember because i know it's been


---------03:29----------
like over a year but


---------03:30----------
like if i'm just remembering like notes


---------03:33----------
of the conversation about like


---------03:35----------
you know you'd be concerned that this


---------03:36----------
would happen and it wouldn't go well and


---------03:38----------
like you may not do well and things like


---------03:40----------
that


---------03:42----------
yeah um sort of like i'm very i was very


---------03:47----------
outcome oriented where it was like


---------03:51----------
you know i'm trying to put my best


---------03:54----------
quality


---------03:54----------
work and like i got to do my best and


---------03:58----------
everything


---------03:59----------
and um


---------04:02----------
yeah so i think there's a lot of anxiety


---------04:05----------
that i can build up


---------04:07----------
about doing a particular task and making


---------04:10----------
it


---------04:11----------
you know work and something that i can


---------04:14----------
be proud of um i think there is a lot of


---------04:17----------
fear


---------04:18----------
around how other people perceive me if i


---------04:21----------
mess up or fail


---------04:23----------
um so i have social anxiety as well


---------04:27----------
um not online it's only like in real


---------04:30----------
life which is


---------04:31----------
interesting so okay


---------04:35----------
um and and so has that changed for you


---------04:37----------
at all asriel about being


---------04:39----------
outcome oriented or


---------04:42----------
yeah so when i was in coaching and in


---------04:46----------
therapy


---------04:47----------
i started to get my life together and it


---------04:49----------
was interesting because


---------04:52----------
you know all these things were sort of


---------04:54----------
you know i was doing school


---------04:56----------
i was taking better care of myself but


---------04:59----------
the emotions did not change i still felt


---------05:02----------
terrible for a long time and


---------05:06----------
sort of like well this isn't working i


---------05:08----------
don't know what's going on i've done


---------05:10----------
everything and i think i realized that


---------05:14----------
problem was that i wasn't addressing the


---------05:16----------
underlying


---------05:17----------
sort of emotions and what i was feeling


---------05:20----------
i was just sort of trying to push past


---------05:22----------
it


---------05:23----------
to do what i needed to do


---------05:27----------
and what what kind of emotion was


---------05:30----------
underlying can you


---------05:31----------
help us understand that


---------05:35----------
well i think there was definitely fear


---------05:38----------
uh hopelessness


---------05:39----------
uh loneliness sadness um


---------05:43----------
frustration frustration at like feeling


---------05:47----------
all those things


---------05:48----------
um yeah


---------05:51----------
just uh yeah all sorts of stuff


---------05:55----------
and asriel forgive do you prefer asriel


---------05:59----------
by the way or do you want me to call you


---------06:00----------
something else


---------06:05----------
i guess it's up to you azrael or thomas


---------06:08----------
what do you prefer whatever you prefer


---------06:11----------
my dude


---------06:12----------
all right well online i usually just go


---------06:15----------
by azrael


---------06:16----------
okay so asriel i'm going to play devil's


---------06:20----------
advocate for a second okay


---------06:22----------
all right so you're saying that like so


---------06:25----------
you started to put your life together


---------06:28----------
right you you went into coaching you got


---------06:30----------
into therapy


---------06:31----------
um so it sounds like you did one batch


---------06:33----------
of coaching one round of therapy


---------06:35----------
and then a second batch of coaching yeah


---------06:38----------
and so


---------06:39----------
the funny thing there is that like


---------06:40----------
you're saying that like you started


---------06:41----------
putting your life together so you were


---------06:43----------
like back in school maybe you were like


---------06:44----------
doing stuff


---------06:45----------
but internally you still felt awful


---------06:49----------
and so like my question to you is is it


---------06:51----------
the point of going to therapy that it's


---------06:53----------
supposed to fix the


---------06:54----------
internal stuff like how does that work


---------06:56----------
that externally things are going well


---------06:58----------
and internally like don't you go to


---------07:00----------
therapy and doesn't that fix the


---------07:01----------
internal


---------07:02----------
stuff isn't that how it works


---------07:08----------
well i i don't know it was


---------07:12----------
when i was in therapy it was


---------07:15----------
you know i told my therapist what my


---------07:17----------
goals were to


---------07:18----------
finish school and everything and they


---------07:20----------
were gonna help me with that


---------07:22----------
um i don't know i found therapy it was


---------07:25----------
um so we only had like half an hour


---------07:28----------
every week to talk


---------07:30----------
and i found it was mostly just me


---------07:34----------
recapping what happened that week and


---------07:36----------
then the therapist would provide


---------07:38----------
occasional input


---------07:41----------
but it was mostly just and then they


---------07:44----------
would validate


---------07:45----------
or talk about whatever i was feeling and


---------07:48----------
like maybe


---------07:49----------
point out thought distortions and all


---------07:51----------
that


---------07:52----------
and i think i used that to sort of


---------07:55----------
help me progress but i didn't use it to


---------07:59----------
sort of address the underlying feelings


---------08:02----------
necessarily


---------08:04----------
and so once you had that realization


---------08:06----------
which is a big one


---------08:08----------
how do you feel about your therapy


---------08:09----------
experience are you kind of happy with it


---------08:11----------
or


---------08:14----------
so when i finished school i felt like i


---------08:18----------
got everything i needed out of therapy


---------08:20----------
like you know we discussed everything


---------08:23----------
that i thought i was ever


---------08:24----------
really going to need from it so i it was


---------08:27----------
getting expensive and i


---------08:29----------
basically quit um


---------08:32----------
[Music]


---------08:34----------
yeah what was the question again i was


---------08:36----------
just curious about whether you were


---------08:37----------
happy with your therapy experience


---------08:42----------
uh mixed feelings so i definitely think


---------08:45----------
it helped


---------08:47----------
i don't think it did everything that i


---------08:50----------
thought it would do


---------08:51----------
okay and can you help me understand um


---------08:55----------
well so let's start what what did you


---------08:57----------
want it to do that it didn't do


---------09:01----------
i think i wanted to


---------09:07----------
i don't know just be more


---------09:10----------
at peace with myself maybe uh less


---------09:13----------
stressed less anxious


---------09:16----------
i think it did help with that it's just


---------09:19----------
that


---------09:19----------
because it was only for five months


---------09:22----------
there was only so much


---------09:23----------
progress that we could have made um


---------09:28----------
it was interesting because when i was in


---------09:30----------
therapy we were talking about how like


---------09:33----------
you know i'm working so hard i'm doing


---------09:34----------
all this stuff and it's not enough


---------09:36----------
and my therapist was like oh wait a


---------09:39----------
minute this is insane you're


---------09:41----------
you're thriving in a pandemic when most


---------09:43----------
of my clients are like


---------09:45----------
fish out of water it's like


---------09:48----------
so i think part of therapy was just


---------09:52----------
recognizing when i was pushing myself


---------09:55----------
too hard or not


---------09:56----------
acknowledging you know what i had


---------09:58----------
accomplished and just


---------10:01----------
looking at how far i've come so maybe


---------10:05----------
one of the thought distortions


---------10:07----------
yeah i guess so and i think we also had


---------10:11----------
um


---------10:12----------
uh i have a lot of shits so like i


---------10:14----------
should be doing this i should be doing


---------10:16----------
that so he discussed that


---------10:20----------
yeah so asriel it sounds like you've


---------10:23----------
come a long way


---------10:26----------
yeah i'd say so okay so you would own


---------10:30----------
that


---------10:30----------
as opposed to definitely


---------10:34----------
okay um and can you help me understand


---------10:36----------
what the experience of coaching was like


---------10:39----------
versus therapy and and how the two


---------10:42----------
are different or similar


---------10:47----------
so with coaching um the first


---------10:50----------
um coaching i did it was


---------10:53----------
you know me and a group of other people


---------10:55----------
that maybe we were


---------10:57----------
unfamiliar with our emotions we didn't


---------10:59----------
really know what we were doing in life


---------11:01----------
and we were just trying to figure things


---------11:03----------
out i think


---------11:06----------
coaching was very good at


---------11:11----------
i'd say it's actually like um because


---------11:14----------
coaching got me into therapy


---------11:16----------
where we discussed you know how our week


---------11:19----------
was going and


---------11:20----------
again i am devaluing all the stuff that


---------11:23----------
i did that week and


---------11:25----------
they would stop me and say hey actually


---------11:27----------
that's pretty amazing like good job


---------11:29----------
and i'd be like can't do anything like


---------11:32----------
what are you talking about


---------11:34----------
so i don't know i think we worked


---------11:36----------
through that there was


---------11:38----------
definitely some practical skills like


---------11:40----------
reflective listening


---------11:42----------
um recognizing


---------11:46----------
you know emotions um


---------11:50----------
stuff like that and then that got me


---------11:52----------
into therapy which is more


---------11:54----------
one-on-one um i had


---------11:58----------
someone for better help and they were


---------12:01----------
very good at


---------12:03----------
what's it called the


---------12:08----------
i i had it now i forgot


---------12:11----------
the cognitive behavioral therapy i think


---------12:14----------
it's called okay yeah


---------12:15----------
cbt sounds like it with thought


---------12:17----------
distortions


---------12:19----------
yeah and so i think that was sort of a


---------12:23----------
continuation


---------12:24----------
of you know where i left off with


---------12:27----------
coaching


---------12:29----------
and then once therapy was too expensive


---------12:32----------
when i finished school and


---------12:34----------
i still felt like i needed to talk to


---------12:36----------
people so i got back into coaching


---------12:38----------
in the high performance group because i


---------12:40----------
felt like i


---------12:42----------
sort of progressed past the regular


---------12:45----------
coaching by that point


---------12:47----------
sure and what's that experience are you


---------12:49----------
still doing the


---------12:50----------
high performance group yeah and how's


---------12:53----------
that going


---------12:55----------
that's pretty good i think i feel um


---------12:58----------
in the group and we've discussed this is


---------13:02----------
that


---------13:02----------
you know i'm the youngest member i'm


---------13:05----------
still in school


---------13:06----------
most of them have jobs and so maybe i


---------13:09----------
just feel a little bit


---------13:12----------
i i asreel i've i've heard about you


---------13:16----------
i'm now i heard about the group that


---------13:18----------
you're in


---------13:19----------
if i remember correctly so i heard that


---------13:21----------
there was someone in one of the high


---------13:22----------
performance groups that was really


---------13:24----------
confused about what they were doing


---------13:26----------
there


---------13:27----------
is that you that's probably me and how


---------13:30----------
do you feel about it now


---------13:33----------
my is pretty good actually yeah


---------13:36----------
i'm hap i'm really happy to hear that so


---------13:38----------
i i if i could just share this so i


---------13:40----------
i heard so i i sort of hear about i


---------13:43----------
i don't know if you guys uh know this


---------13:44----------
but you know i work


---------13:46----------
we do have like a model where i work


---------13:49----------
with your coaches


---------13:50----------
on a weekly basis and so i i hear about


---------13:53----------
you know challenges or situations


---------13:54----------
in the different groups and i'll kind of


---------13:56----------
like weigh in so i heard there was one


---------13:58----------
group that you know has like ceos and


---------14:00----------
people who like have real careers and


---------14:02----------
there was one person who's very young


---------14:04----------
who was really confused about what they


---------14:06----------
were doing i don't know if that was you


---------14:07----------
or if that you know maybe every group


---------14:08----------
has


---------14:09----------
one person that feels like they don't


---------14:10----------
belong um


---------14:12----------
but i you know so i did sort of hear


---------14:14----------
about that and and what do you think


---------14:16----------
about being in the group now


---------14:20----------
it's um it's a pretty good experience um


---------14:26----------
i like it i i have a lot to contribute


---------14:29----------
even if i'm the youngest member um


---------14:33----------
and it's going to just share my opinion


---------14:38----------
yeah do you feel like the other group


---------14:40----------
members respect you


---------14:44----------
yeah i think so so that that makes me


---------14:47----------
really happy to hear asriel because i i


---------14:50----------
think the


---------14:50----------
goal of group is to have someone like


---------14:54----------
you and come in


---------14:55----------
and feel like like that's exactly what


---------14:58----------
we're here to work on right like so you


---------14:59----------
come into a situation you're like oh


---------15:01----------
all of these people are better than me


---------15:03----------
and the goal of group


---------15:04----------
is like we're gonna work on you in the


---------15:07----------
group until you no longer feel that way


---------15:09----------
you can honestly acknowledge that yes


---------15:11----------
these people are actually objectively


---------15:14----------
further along in life than i am and yet


---------15:17----------
it's okay for me to be here that i can


---------15:19----------
still make meaningful contributions that


---------15:21----------
something about my experience can still


---------15:23----------
help other people


---------15:24----------
that i can still help them and they can


---------15:26----------
still help me and so if you feel like


---------15:28----------
you belong there like i'm really happy


---------15:30----------
to hear that because i don't think i


---------15:31----------
ever got an update i just stopped


---------15:32----------
hearing about it so i just


---------15:33----------
sort of assumed that things had gotten


---------15:35----------
better but if you know if you


---------15:37----------
anyway if you do have challenges feel


---------15:39----------
free to bring them up in the group and


---------15:40----------
then i i think i'll


---------15:41----------
wind up hearing about them if there's a


---------15:43----------
you know concern or problem


---------15:45----------
um all right but


---------15:49----------
yeah go ahead i think more recently with


---------15:52----------
me trying to find a job this summer


---------15:54----------
uh i don't know i it brought up a lot of


---------15:57----------
feelings of sort of inadequacy


---------15:59----------
like they all have jobs and here i am i


---------16:02----------
had an


---------16:02----------
emotional breakdown like in front of the


---------16:05----------
job site and it's like i can't even get


---------16:07----------
a job and i'm in this group


---------16:09----------
so yes it brought up some of those


---------16:11----------
feelings again


---------16:13----------
yeah so it sounds like once again the


---------16:15----------
feelings are down there sorry i didn't


---------16:16----------
mean to laugh but i was just


---------16:18----------
you know despite all the progress we


---------16:20----------
just talked about i really commend you


---------16:22----------
for saying


---------16:22----------
but by the way it's not entirely fixed


---------16:26----------
and yes you know azrael just to say like


---------16:29----------
that's how


---------16:30----------
growth happens you know it's sort of


---------16:31----------
like when i think about


---------16:33----------
you know even like playing a game like


---------16:35----------
do you do you play games or


---------16:38----------
yeah absolutely yeah what do you play


---------16:40----------
minecraft


---------16:41----------
i've done a lot of star blasts dot io


---------16:44----------
which


---------16:46----------
yeah it's uh sort of you know you're a


---------16:49----------
spaceship and you go around and mine


---------16:51----------
asteroids and upgrade your spaceship


---------16:53----------
and there's different game modes you can


---------16:55----------
play in a team


---------16:56----------
survival mode um capture the flag all


---------16:59----------
sorts of stuff


---------17:00----------
interesting um yeah it's just an online


---------17:03----------
browser game so


---------17:05----------
so when i kind of think about games you


---------17:07----------
know when you're


---------17:10----------
playing a game like you may not master


---------17:12----------
something right away right like there's


---------17:13----------
the first time you learn how to do


---------17:14----------
something


---------17:16----------
and then you screw up a couple times and


---------17:18----------
then like you do it again


---------17:20----------
and then you screw up fewer times and


---------17:22----------
then you do it again and then you screw


---------17:23----------
up maybe once and then you do it again


---------17:25----------
and then eventually like you have it


---------17:27----------
down and what i'm hearing from you is


---------17:29----------
almost a similar pattern within group


---------17:31----------
where


---------17:32----------
like you're gonna feel an inferior


---------17:35----------
right and there are objective reasons


---------17:37----------
why


---------17:38----------
i don't think you should feel inferior


---------17:40----------
as a human but in terms of experience


---------17:43----------
like


---------17:43----------
you may be the least experienced person


---------17:45----------
in the group but someone's got to be the


---------17:46----------
least experienced person in the group


---------17:48----------
and at the same time you know how can


---------17:50----------
you


---------17:52----------
grow and understand that and then also


---------17:55----------
like you're going to have breakdowns in


---------17:57----------
front of the the job hunting page like


---------17:58----------
that's totally like normal


---------18:00----------
actually right no it wasn't the job


---------18:03----------
hunting page i actually got a job


---------18:05----------
i just never showed up oh my goodness


---------18:09----------
yeah i went to i went to the area where


---------18:12----------
the job was and then i was supposed to


---------18:14----------
contact someone but i never did


---------18:17----------
um i don't know i feel a little bit


---------18:20----------
guilty about it


---------18:23----------
and like it was weird because like


---------18:25----------
nobody even


---------18:26----------
called me or asked me where i was and


---------18:28----------
it's been


---------18:29----------
a few weeks now i showed up like like


---------18:33----------
two other times but i never actually was


---------18:36----------
able


---------18:38----------
to get into the job so


---------18:41----------
it was a general labor job and i think i


---------18:44----------
just have doubts about


---------18:45----------
whether or not i'll be able to handle it


---------18:48----------
and maybe


---------18:49----------
about working with other people there


---------18:52----------
especially because i've shown up in a


---------18:54----------
few days


---------18:55----------
so yeah


---------18:58----------
when were you supposed to start your job


---------19:03----------
um


---------19:03----------
[Music]


---------19:06----------
today is the 25th


---------19:13----------
[Music]


---------19:15----------
okay so yeah it's been a long time


---------19:18----------
and no one's even contacted me to like


---------19:21----------
fire me or ask me where i am


---------19:23----------
so i'm just looking for another job now


---------19:28----------
have you contacted them


---------19:31----------
no do you want to work there


---------19:35----------
not anymore


---------19:38----------
what's changed


---------19:45----------
i i don't know i just feel like i messed


---------19:48----------
up


---------19:49----------
i don't think they'd want me back after


---------19:51----------
not showing up for a few weeks


---------19:55----------
um i feel like they probably moved on


---------19:58----------
and found someone else by now


---------20:01----------
so i don't see a reason to show to go


---------20:04----------
back there


---------20:08----------
i think um that i can find


---------20:12----------
different work something maybe i'll be


---------20:15----------
better


---------20:16----------
able to manage are you concerned about


---------20:20----------
being able to manage this job


---------20:25----------
yeah i think so it's full time so


---------20:29----------
i think it's 10 hours a day and so it's


---------20:32----------
a big commitment


---------20:33----------
and you know i'm not sure


---------20:36----------
if i'm ready for that okay


---------20:42----------
i tried at least like i tried to


---------20:46----------
show up and everything sounds like it


---------20:49----------
was a bit too much for you


---------20:51----------
maybe i'm good at pushing myself past my


---------20:54----------
boundaries though


---------20:56----------
that's i'm happy to hear you say that


---------21:01----------
like showing up there was definitely


---------21:04----------
pushing my boundaries already


---------21:07----------
yep i completely agree man


---------21:10----------
so sometimes i'll work with people about


---------21:13----------
going to the gym


---------21:14----------
you know they'll want to go to the gym


---------21:16----------
and like there are different ways to not


---------21:19----------
go to the gym


---------21:21----------
there's the oh i'd wish i want to go and


---------21:23----------
then never signing up for anything then


---------21:25----------
they're signing up for stuff


---------21:27----------
then there's waking up the morning of


---------21:28----------
and not going then there's actually


---------21:30----------
getting in your car and then deciding


---------21:32----------
[ __ ] this


---------21:33----------
and getting out of your car and there's


---------21:35----------
getting in your car


---------21:36----------
driving to the parking lot waiting in


---------21:38----------
the parking lot for five minutes with an


---------21:40----------
existential crisis


---------21:42----------
and then driving home and then there's


---------21:44----------
walking in and feeling like an idiot if


---------21:46----------
you walk out so you might as well just


---------21:48----------
like


---------21:48----------
check in completely because the person


---------21:51----------
behind the desk is like who is this


---------21:52----------
person who's walking in the door turns


---------21:54----------
around and walks out


---------21:55----------
and then the embarrassment is going with


---------21:56----------
you and then you kind of like enter the


---------21:58----------
gym and then you're like


---------22:00----------
it would be dumb to just turn around and


---------22:01----------
walk out now so i might as well like


---------22:03----------
work out a little bit


---------22:05----------
there are various phases you know we


---------22:07----------
kind of think about going to the gym or


---------22:08----------
not going to the gym is like binary


---------22:10----------
right


---------22:11----------
but the truth is that there's actually


---------22:13----------
like a progress bar


---------22:14----------
in terms of like getting a job and even


---------22:18----------
in terms of like not showing up for the


---------22:20----------
job


---------22:20----------
there's so many ways you cannot show up


---------22:22----------
you cannot apply you cannot interview


---------22:25----------
you can show up on your first day have


---------22:27----------
an existential crisis turn around and


---------22:29----------
leave


---------22:30----------
you know and i know it sounds weird but


---------22:33----------
like that's honestly how it works


---------22:36----------
i wish it was simpler i wish it was less


---------22:38----------
painful but


---------22:39----------
you know yeah


---------22:44----------
i don't know i've had a lot of those


---------22:46----------
types of experiences


---------22:50----------
i don't know since two years ago


---------22:54----------
since second year university um


---------22:58----------
just trying to figure out everything


---------23:01----------
with


---------23:01----------
living on my own doing university


---------23:05----------
in a pandemic trying to feed myself


---------23:08----------
trying to


---------23:09----------
you know figure out income money


---------23:14----------
um all that stuff so


---------23:17----------
it's been a lot of work yeah man


---------23:21----------
i i it sounded like your therapist felt


---------23:24----------
like you were thriving


---------23:26----------
in a pandemic yeah i think i made a lot


---------23:29----------
of progress for sure


---------23:31----------
i i can certainly i don't really


---------23:33----------
remember a lot of the details of our


---------23:35----------
conversation as


---------23:36----------
real but i certainly rem i don't


---------23:37----------
remember


---------23:39----------
seeing this degree of confidence in you


---------23:43----------
like there are certain statements that


---------23:45----------
you've made where i really get the sense


---------23:47----------
that you kind of acknowledge where you


---------23:49----------
are


---------23:50----------
you accept how far you've come because i


---------23:52----------
i get the impression that you used to


---------23:54----------
make statements that would like devalue


---------23:56----------
your progress


---------23:59----------
like you have to say you know like like


---------24:01----------
you just made a statement a little while


---------24:03----------
ago that i'm good at pushing past my


---------24:04----------
boundaries


---------24:05----------
whereas i feel like a year ago you would


---------24:07----------
have said i need to be better at pushing


---------24:11----------
past my boundaries or i don't push


---------24:13----------
myself past my boundaries enough


---------24:16----------
i think even back then i was pushing


---------24:19----------
myself


---------24:20----------
a lot that's why i was sort of


---------24:24----------
well like even getting on stream and


---------24:26----------
stuff that was


---------24:27----------
pushing myself past my boundaries back


---------24:29----------
then


---------24:30----------
it was a lot


---------24:34----------
um


---------24:37----------
i i don't know i guess


---------24:41----------
the difference is just that i've had


---------24:43----------
more time to actually do that


---------24:45----------
and figure out what i'm good at what i'm


---------24:48----------
not good at


---------24:50----------
how everything works yeah


---------24:54----------
it sounds like you've been doing a lot


---------24:56----------
of self-reflection and understanding


---------24:57----------
yourself quite a bit yeah


---------25:00----------
absolutely i've been you know watching


---------25:02----------
your videos like


---------25:04----------
pretty much every single one since


---------25:08----------
like since reckful


---------25:12----------
have those been helpful yeah absolutely


---------25:16----------
um i don't know you get a lot of um


---------25:22----------
all sorts of people with


---------25:25----------
going through all their own struggles


---------25:26----------
and just listening to it all


---------25:28----------
and figuring out how it applies to me


---------25:31----------
and


---------25:32----------
trying to integrate that into how i


---------25:35----------
approach


---------25:36----------
my problems i find it very helpful


---------25:40----------
i'm happy to hear that i'm happy to hear


---------25:41----------
it's been helpful you know i never


---------25:43----------
really know


---------25:45----------
i'm pretty sure i feel pretty confident


---------25:47----------
about the person that i talk to but i'm


---------25:49----------
i've always been curious


---------25:51----------
just as a clinician because i've seen


---------25:53----------
impact when i work with people


---------25:55----------
individually


---------25:56----------
i've always just been like a little bit


---------25:58----------
curious about


---------25:59----------
how much benefit you can get from


---------26:01----------
watching a youtube video


---------26:03----------
or like watching like real benefit you


---------26:05----------
know like sure you can get entertained


---------26:07----------
maybe you can pick up a little bit of


---------26:08----------
like


---------26:09----------
neat information here or there but can


---------26:11----------
you actually change your life


---------26:13----------
and i find myself being skeptical


---------26:17----------
hey yes uh and i mean it hasn't just


---------26:20----------
been you i mean


---------26:22----------
you know i follow one other twitch


---------26:24----------
streamer


---------26:25----------
wyover and um you know if i ever need a


---------26:28----------
place to go to just


---------26:30----------
you know hang out and chill and have fun


---------26:32----------
i can go there and


---------26:33----------
given that's just a huge difference


---------26:37----------
and more recently even in the healthy


---------26:40----------
gamer discord i'm in


---------26:42----------
talking with people in chill chat and


---------26:44----------
it's nice to get out of my head


---------26:46----------
sometimes


---------26:47----------
yeah why uber is fantastic dude i love


---------26:49----------
what he does on twitch


---------26:52----------
yeah um so asriel can you tell me a


---------26:55----------
little bit you said that for a long time


---------26:57----------
you were like doing stuff


---------26:58----------
outwardly and like actually making


---------27:00----------
progress in your life but you were sort


---------27:02----------
of not


---------27:03----------
recognizing or acknowledging emotions


---------27:06----------
how did you can you tell me a little bit


---------27:08----------
about that


---------27:10----------
yeah so when i am doing something


---------27:15----------
um if it's outside my comfort zone what


---------27:19----------
i'll notice


---------27:20----------
is you know a bunch of emotions her eyes


---------27:23----------
there'll be fear anxiety


---------27:25----------
social anxiety worry you know whatever


---------27:29----------
and then how i actually deal with that


---------27:32----------
is to overcome


---------27:36----------
all those emotions with frustration i


---------27:39----------
can use that to sort of


---------27:41----------
suppress everything and just push


---------27:43----------
through


---------27:45----------
and the problem with that is that you


---------27:47----------
know it provides a temporary buff


---------27:50----------
at that time but then you got to deal


---------27:52----------
with all that stuff later


---------27:54----------
so interesting so so it sounds like


---------27:57----------
you've gotten good at pushing yourself


---------27:59----------
past your comfort zone but it's still a


---------28:02----------
push


---------28:03----------
it's not easy it requires like a lot of


---------28:05----------
effort


---------28:06----------
and i'm also hearing it has a cost


---------28:10----------
yeah absolutely um


---------28:14----------
i think that's where the devaluing comes


---------28:16----------
in it's like


---------28:17----------
you know i i should be capable of doing


---------28:20----------
this by now


---------28:21----------
like why am i so bad um


---------28:24----------
and sort of using that to overcome those


---------28:28----------
emotions and just


---------28:30----------
you know i think that's the sort of


---------28:32----------
toxicity


---------28:33----------
of maybe toxic productivity


---------28:37----------
uh mindset where you know i'm just


---------28:40----------
beating myself up to get


---------28:42----------
something done yeah idea


---------28:45----------
you really have been watching a lot of


---------28:47----------
stuff and learning


---------28:48----------
as well um


---------28:51----------
yeah so where are you i mean is that


---------28:55----------
something that you want to talk about


---------28:56----------
today or potentially something we can


---------28:58----------
work on or did you have


---------29:00----------
thoughts about you know how how this


---------29:03----------
conversation or go is


---------29:04----------
something i can help you with today


---------29:11----------
oh i think what i wanted to take away


---------29:14----------
hopefully was just how to


---------29:18----------
maybe make that process a little easier


---------29:20----------
on myself


---------29:21----------
that i'm not constantly struggling


---------29:24----------
so much with everything


---------29:27----------
that maybe be a little bit easier


---------29:31----------
um maybe just to be more at peace with


---------29:34----------
my decisions not get so stressed out


---------29:39----------
okay can i just collect my thoughts for


---------29:42----------
a second


---------29:44----------
sure


---------29:48----------
i would really love to help you navigate


---------29:51----------
that asriel let me just think about


---------29:53----------
how to do that


---------30:13----------
okay let me just toss a couple things


---------30:17----------
out okay you let me know if we're kind


---------30:18----------
of on the same page or not


---------30:22----------
so there's some kind of emotion let's


---------30:23----------
say fear


---------30:25----------
um lack of confidence something like


---------30:27----------
that excuse me


---------30:33----------
i made the mistake of having pizza for


---------30:35----------
lunch i've been eating healthier


---------30:37----------
but today


---------30:40----------
so you know you have some kind of


---------30:43----------
emotion


---------30:44----------
right some kind of lack of confidence


---------30:46----------
and then what happens


---------30:48----------
is you practice


---------30:51----------
some kind of frustration or


---------30:54----------
self-loathing


---------30:55----------
you start beating yourself up you're


---------30:56----------
saying oh i should be better than this


---------30:59----------
and the interesting thing is that's


---------31:00----------
somewhat of a double-edged sword because


---------31:02----------
like


---------31:02----------
if you feel ashamed you can actually use


---------31:05----------
shame as motivation


---------31:08----------
you say like why am i so bad at this i


---------31:09----------
should just i should be able to do it


---------31:11----------
and so then you force yourself you push


---------31:14----------
through


---------31:15----------
that pile of emotion you there's one


---------31:17----------
negative emotion that


---------31:18----------
is keeping you from doing it and then


---------31:20----------
you kind of


---------31:21----------
you know fill up your engines with shame


---------31:24----------
and then you use that shame to overcome


---------31:26----------
and then you end up actually making


---------31:27----------
progress in your life which is great


---------31:29----------
but but there's something incredibly


---------31:32----------
like not peaceful about that


---------31:34----------
right and this is where the toxic


---------31:36----------
productivity comes in because when you


---------31:38----------
use


---------31:39----------
negative emotions to fuel your


---------31:41----------
productivity like


---------31:42----------
there's a toxic feel to it


---------31:46----------
um so


---------31:49----------
you know i think what we can try to talk


---------31:51----------
about today is like trying to


---------31:53----------
understand how to disarm that negative


---------31:56----------
emotion


---------31:57----------
in to begin with so the interesting


---------32:01----------
thing is


---------32:01----------
you may be able to cultivate better


---------32:03----------
sources of motivation


---------32:05----------
but if we think about you need shame to


---------32:08----------
succeed right now


---------32:09----------
you need it right and it's it's


---------32:12----------
necessary to


---------32:13----------
overcome that hump of


---------32:16----------
whatever the negative emotion is so if


---------32:17----------
we can process


---------32:19----------
and get rid of what's underneath you'll


---------32:23----------
need shameless


---------32:26----------
and so you can learn an alternate


---------32:28----------
fueling strategy


---------32:29----------
or what you can do is require less fuel


---------32:32----------
by like making the challenge a little


---------32:33----------
bit better


---------32:34----------
and i do think that you're you've


---------32:37----------
clearly worked hard as real and you're


---------32:38----------
pretty insightful so i think that maybe


---------32:40----------
like that's something that we could work


---------32:42----------
on today what do you think


---------32:45----------
for sure and i'd also like to add um


---------32:49----------
when i do disarm that sort of shame


---------32:53----------
it just means that i don't really do


---------32:55----------
anything that's where the


---------32:57----------
thoughts of like you know what's the


---------32:59----------
point why bother


---------33:00----------
start coming up yep right so like you're


---------33:03----------
saying like when i


---------33:04----------
empty my engines i don't move anywhere


---------33:08----------
and we're like


---------33:08----------
absolutely man so it's tough it's tough


---------33:10----------
okay


---------33:11----------
so the first thing that i just want to


---------33:13----------
acknowledge is that


---------33:15----------
if you keep doing what you're doing


---------33:17----------
asriel i think you'll continue doing


---------33:19----------
fine and you will eventually feel better


---------33:21----------
so like i do think that


---------33:22----------
emotionally it sounds like you actually


---------33:24----------
made a lot of progress


---------33:26----------
and so the first thing that i kind of


---------33:28----------
want to point out to everyone is


---------33:29----------
sometimes people ask like


---------33:32----------
despite making progress why does it


---------33:34----------
continue to be hard


---------33:37----------
and so this is where like i'm going to


---------33:38----------
use like an online matchmaking analogy


---------33:41----------
despite getting better at the game why


---------33:43----------
is my win rate still close to 50


---------33:48----------
right so the challenge here asriel is


---------33:50----------
that you're getting better


---------33:52----------
but you're also like dealing with more


---------33:58----------
so as you like you know start doing well


---------34:01----------
in school and now you're looking for a


---------34:02----------
job and like now you're doing therapy


---------34:04----------
and like even like


---------34:05----------
you know you're actually like the


---------34:07----------
challenges that you're leveling up but


---------34:08----------
like


---------34:09----------
the monsters you're fighting or like


---------34:11----------
leveling up with you


---------34:13----------
and it's not actually that they're


---------34:14----------
leveling up with you it's just that


---------34:15----------
you're going


---------34:16----------
deeper and deeper into the game of life


---------34:19----------
where things get


---------34:20----------
harder and harder so you're actually


---------34:21----------
like objectively making progress


---------34:25----------
and like you're climbing that mountain


---------34:28----------
right so like the better you get it


---------34:29----------
climbing


---------34:31----------
the higher you go the thinner the air


---------34:33----------
gets and


---------34:34----------
what it feels like is like you're making


---------34:36----------
no progress


---------34:38----------
so that's just the first thing to


---------34:39----------
understand okay so like


---------34:42----------
you know anyway so at some point you'll


---------34:45----------
equilibriate out because i mean either


---------34:47----------
you'll


---------34:48----------
you know climb towards i don't know what


---------34:51----------
but generally speaking at some point


---------34:53----------
like you'll have you know like a job


---------34:55----------
hopefully you'll have like a good


---------34:56----------
relationship hopefully you'll have a


---------34:58----------
good social circle


---------34:58----------
and then you kind of chill and then you


---------35:00----------
like look back on your life and you're


---------35:01----------
like wow i've made a lot of progress and


---------35:02----------
actually i'm pretty happy


---------35:04----------
and even if we hear you talk it sounds


---------35:05----------
like in a lot of ways you feel like


---------35:07----------
really


---------35:07----------
like confident in yourself you can


---------35:09----------
accept yourself and be proud of some of


---------35:11----------
your accomplishments


---------35:12----------
and there's a bunch of crap still


---------35:14----------
lingering down there so we're going to


---------35:15----------
get to that i just wanted to


---------35:17----------
share that does that make sense yeah i


---------35:20----------
think that makes sense


---------35:21----------
so the reason it feels like we're


---------35:23----------
constantly struggling not making


---------35:25----------
progress


---------35:26----------
is actually because we are progressing


---------35:31----------
um so let me ask you when it comes to


---------35:34----------
the job


---------35:36----------
okay when you were when they


---------35:41----------
i'm gonna toss something out i'm gonna


---------35:44----------
guess that the fact that no one


---------35:46----------
called you may have been the worst part


---------35:48----------
of the experience


---------35:50----------
what do you think about that


---------35:54----------
yeah i i agree there was no input i


---------35:56----------
couldn't


---------35:57----------
gauge the situation it was hard to tell


---------36:01----------
you know if they were mad or if they


---------36:03----------
were concerned


---------36:04----------
if they even cared about me


---------36:09----------
i don't know i felt like maybe i wasn't


---------36:11----------
actually that important


---------36:14----------
yeah and so


---------36:22----------
what what do you what do you how do you


---------36:24----------
understand that


---------36:30----------
uh


---------36:34----------
i don't know it's just


---------36:39----------
i don't think i am necessarily


---------36:43----------
particularly important to anyone but


---------36:46----------
myself really i mean


---------36:49----------
i would be a little bit selfish to think


---------36:52----------
that


---------36:53----------
anyone else really cares about me i mean


---------36:56----------
maybe my family i guess


---------36:58----------
but maybe some people online


---------37:02----------
but it's mostly just me so


---------37:05----------
how does it feel to be unimportant to


---------37:08----------
the rest of the world


---------37:12----------
i mean it sort of sucks i guess


---------37:16----------
maybe i feel a little sad and lonely


---------37:20----------
like nothing i do is gonna change that


---------37:23----------
i think that's sort of where the


---------37:25----------
feelings of


---------37:27----------
hopelessness comes from yeah and i think


---------37:30----------
also that feeds into


---------37:34----------
i have nihilistic thoughts


---------37:37----------
um so


---------37:40----------
sort of the belief that like you know


---------37:42----------
what's the point of doing anything if


---------37:44----------
i'm just gonna die and


---------37:45----------
no one's gonna care right


---------37:50----------
yeah so i think somewhere along the way


---------37:52----------
people


---------37:53----------
my understanding is that people have


---------37:55----------
lost a big part


---------37:56----------
of nihilism whereas i i thought the


---------37:59----------
point of nihilism is that


---------38:01----------
that you can't rely on


---------38:05----------
an external objective standard for


---------38:08----------
meaning and purpose


---------38:11----------
so it doesn't mean that there isn't any


---------38:13----------
meaning and purpose it means that


---------38:15----------
you have to sort of carve it out


---------38:17----------
yourself


---------38:20----------
and that like there isn't like a like


---------38:21----------
there isn't like a you know


---------38:23----------
omnipotent god that is going to give you


---------38:26----------
meaning


---------38:28----------
and that yeah yeah i agree um


---------38:32----------
but i don't know i don't think i'd want


---------38:35----------
anyone to


---------38:37----------
i don't know i don't like the idea of


---------38:38----------
some


---------38:40----------
higher being controlling my life


---------38:44----------
so before we get you know down the road


---------38:46----------
of philosophy which if you want to go


---------38:47----------
down we can


---------38:48----------
i'm going to ask you though asriel how


---------38:50----------
long have you felt how long have you


---------38:52----------
been


---------38:58----------
unimportant


---------39:03----------
i don't know like


---------39:09----------
forever maybe fourth grade i guess


---------39:13----------
why do you have fourth grade


---------39:18----------
well might have been before that too but


---------39:21----------
in


---------39:21----------
fourth grade that was when my parents


---------39:25----------
split up um and then


---------39:30----------
it's the weirdest thing my dad was


---------39:32----------
driving me to school one day and like


---------39:35----------
you know we show up to school and


---------39:37----------
they're like oh you're not registered at


---------39:39----------
this school anymore


---------39:40----------
and it turns out that my mom had just


---------39:42----------
changed my school


---------39:45----------
so we had to show up at a different


---------39:46----------
school tonight


---------39:48----------
i had no idea my dad had no idea


---------39:52----------
and i don't know i feel like from


---------39:56----------
that point onward things were different


---------39:59----------
so i was living between you know both


---------40:01----------
parents switching houses


---------40:04----------
um i


---------40:08----------
my mom was trying to find someone new


---------40:11----------
and


---------40:13----------
you know my dad was always busy with


---------40:15----------
work um


---------40:18----------
you know i had siblings and they were


---------40:20----------
always


---------40:21----------
better than me at everything so they


---------40:23----------
always got credit


---------40:25----------
um my mom eventually found someone new


---------40:28----------
but they you know they were dealing with


---------40:32----------
their own problems


---------40:33----------
and they had a lot of


---------40:38----------
maybe bad coping mechanisms


---------40:41----------
so like you know they drink and they


---------40:43----------
take out their frustration on


---------40:45----------
us which wasn't


---------40:49----------
very nice um i don't know


---------40:53----------
i just i felt like i had to prove myself


---------40:57----------
that i had to do


---------40:58----------
everything just to get noticed


---------41:02----------
and i didn't really feel too important


---------41:06----------
in the chaos that turned out to be


---------41:10----------
growing up


---------41:14----------
how does it feel to talk about this


---------41:15----------
stuff


---------41:18----------
um


---------41:22----------
i don't know it's i can definitely feel


---------41:26----------
there's an emotion down there of sadness


---------41:28----------
maybe


---------41:31----------
i don't know it's difficult i sort of


---------41:34----------
learned to


---------41:35----------
do everything on my own and i haven't


---------41:38----------
really had anyone to help me along the


---------41:40----------
way which just


---------41:46----------
sucks


---------41:48----------
yeah i'm i'm sort of feeling an immense


---------41:50----------
amount of pity


---------41:53----------
what do you think about that


---------41:58----------
oh how would you describe pity


---------42:04----------
great question


---------42:12----------
so i feel sorrow for


---------42:15----------
the person that you the kid that you


---------42:17----------
used to be


---------42:23----------
yeah i think so


---------42:26----------
so when you say sadness


---------42:29----------
is that sadness for yourself or sadness


---------42:33----------
for your former self


---------42:39----------
well listen to sort of both because


---------42:42----------
my former self shaped who i am today


---------42:46----------
yeah and in a sense it's sort of like


---------42:49----------
i'm still you know walking that path


---------42:56----------
so


---------42:58----------
so can you hmm


---------43:04----------
can you tell me okay hold on


---------43:09----------
i'm i'm trying to decide if i can do


---------43:10----------
something a little bit unorthodox with


---------43:12----------
you asriel because


---------43:15----------
you've watched stream so much so let's


---------43:16----------
let's let's


---------43:18----------
try to be a little bit unorthodox okay


---------43:20----------
can i


---------43:21----------
i'm gonna need your help because this


---------43:23----------
may fail miserably


---------43:25----------
okay so we'll fail together so


---------43:29----------
when you started talking about you said


---------43:31----------
your mom started looking for someone


---------43:34----------
and then you mentioned the person and


---------43:36----------
then the first thing that you said about


---------43:38----------
them is they had their own


---------43:39----------
struggles


---------43:43----------
what are you doing yeah


---------43:52----------
maybe


---------43:54----------
see maybe i'm deflecting the blame


---------43:57----------
absolutely right so you've watched


---------43:59----------
stream a fair amount


---------44:01----------
so when someone comes on and says oh


---------44:03----------
they had their own struggles


---------44:05----------
life was hard they were addicted to


---------44:08----------
alcohol


---------44:10----------
what does that person what do we what do


---------44:13----------
we know about that situation what can we


---------44:15----------
infer about that situation


---------44:16----------
when someone comes on stream and starts


---------44:21----------
saying things like that protecting


---------44:23----------
someone


---------44:26----------
am i allowed to protect them a little


---------44:29----------
more


---------44:30----------
yeah so i don't think they were


---------44:33----------
addicted to alcohol i just think when


---------44:36----------
they were in a bad mood they had a


---------44:37----------
tendency to drink a lot


---------44:40----------
okay does that make things better or


---------44:42----------
worse for you


---------44:46----------
well i think it's just how i was able to


---------44:49----------
tell whether


---------44:51----------
you know whether i should be careful or


---------44:53----------
not when i got home


---------44:56----------
how do you feel about blaming them


---------45:05----------
well it's hard because like you know


---------45:09----------
they can be abusive sometimes but then


---------45:12----------
sometimes you know


---------45:13----------
they're sort of a great person like that


---------45:18----------
is a mixed


---------45:20----------
mixed bag i guess so it's hard to blame


---------45:23----------
them when they


---------45:24----------
i can recognize that they're


---------45:30----------
that they're not all bad right


---------45:33----------
if they were pure evil then it'd be easy


---------45:38----------
one would think


---------45:41----------
um and so i know this sounds kind of


---------45:44----------
weird as real but like


---------45:45----------
you know in my experience there's a


---------45:47----------
certain amount of blame


---------45:50----------
there's like almost like you know 100


---------45:52----------
points of blame


---------45:53----------
in people's lives and generally speaking


---------45:57----------
it gets distributed right so i think


---------46:01----------
some people who are like narcissistic


---------46:04----------
will put a hundred points of the blame


---------46:07----------
on other people


---------46:09----------
and then you know where i'm going with


---------46:12----------
this


---------46:14----------
you're put 100 points on myself what do


---------46:17----------
you think


---------46:21----------
accurate right


---------46:24----------
and it's kind of interesting because


---------46:26----------
like i think when we think about like


---------46:28----------
a lack of like you know how long have


---------46:30----------
you felt not


---------46:31----------
valuable well like where does that


---------46:33----------
feeling of not being valuable


---------46:35----------
com like how does that you know that


---------46:37----------
feels to me very similar to the way that


---------46:40----------
you


---------46:42----------
if you've been blaming yourself every


---------46:44----------
time you do that you decrease your


---------46:46----------
internal value


---------46:48----------
and then when someone doesn't call you


---------46:50----------
after you don't show up for a job


---------46:51----------
interview what your mind tells you is


---------46:52----------
like see they didn't care about you


---------46:54----------
anyway like you're not even worth it


---------46:55----------
they don't give a [ __ ]


---------46:57----------
it doesn't matter what like i am i have


---------47:00----------
no impact on the outside world


---------47:02----------
they're gonna live their lives and


---------47:04----------
whether i'm there or not there whether i


---------47:06----------
exist or not exist


---------47:07----------
the world doesn't really care no one


---------47:09----------
really cares


---------47:11----------
i'm insignificant that's what your mind


---------47:13----------
tells you


---------47:16----------
yeah it's um


---------47:21----------
pretty much yeah


---------47:24----------
so i think they're how do you feel right


---------47:27----------
now you feeling okay


---------47:31----------
yeah i think i think i'm all right


---------47:36----------
okay


---------47:38----------
let me know okay if we're pushing past


---------47:41----------
your boundaries


---------47:42----------
if we get to that point we're like oh my


---------47:44----------
god i'm so weak


---------47:45----------
i should be able to have another session


---------47:47----------
with dr k


---------47:50----------
you let me know if you start thinking


---------47:51----------
that way okay


---------47:54----------
all right can i trust you there bro


---------47:59----------
i think so okay good all right let's


---------48:02----------
keep going


---------48:04----------
so tell me a little bit about


---------48:08----------
do you know why your parents split up


---------48:12----------
yeah i talked to my mom a little bit


---------48:14----------
about it i think


---------48:17----------
for her she just didn't feel like she


---------48:19----------
was getting


---------48:20----------
[Music]


---------48:24----------
like there were there was no


---------48:27----------
sort of emotional connection so maybe


---------48:30----------
she felt a little emotionally neglected


---------48:32----------
cause my dad was always busy with work


---------48:34----------
and you know he is a very practical


---------48:38----------
type of person um get things done


---------48:42----------
all that um so maybe


---------48:47----------
he's very busy i'd say i mean he runs


---------48:50----------
his own


---------48:50----------
engineering company and that's a lot of


---------48:53----------
work in itself


---------48:55----------
you know he had a family um


---------48:58----------
he was a scout leader um


---------49:02----------
so yeah


---------49:06----------
he just does a lot and maybe he didn't


---------49:08----------
have as much


---------49:09----------
time to spend with her and


---------49:12----------
maybe that made her feel


---------49:17----------
a little bit neglected


---------49:22----------
so i notice you're providing reasoning


---------49:28----------
again


---------49:30----------
right so you're you're hypothesizing why


---------49:32----------
he wasn't able to meet her emotional


---------49:34----------
needs


---------49:39----------
i see that accurate i'm sure it's


---------49:41----------
accurate


---------49:42----------
i don't is that what do you ever think


---------49:45----------
about


---------49:47----------
did you feel like your dad was there for


---------49:48----------
you emotionally


---------49:52----------
no and why not


---------50:01----------
hard to describe it's like


---------50:05----------
like he wasn't he wasn't


---------50:08----------
like he's always busy of course he cares


---------50:17----------
like if i had a problem let's say i'm


---------50:19----------
doing badly in school there was no


---------50:21----------
understanding there was no connection it


---------50:23----------
was just like you need to do better like


---------50:26----------
get get your work done like this is


---------50:29----------
unacceptable


---------50:30----------
you know smart enough


---------50:35----------
i think there was no understanding there


---------50:40----------
i guess


---------50:44----------
and what do you think about that


---------50:53----------
well i know that i'm going to provide


---------50:56----------
reasons


---------50:57----------
why you know


---------51:00----------
and then deflect the blame but i just


---------51:03----------
don't want to blame him for it because


---------51:08----------
don't know why don't you want to blame


---------51:10----------
him good


---------51:11----------
so let's you're doing well asriel i'm


---------51:14----------
not gonna force you to blame him


---------51:15----------
do you feel like i'm bashing your dad


---------51:19----------
no okay


---------51:22----------
i don't know i just i respect him he


---------51:25----------
does


---------51:25----------
i may be a tiny bit but


---------51:30----------
yeah he does a lot of stuff


---------51:33----------
and he's a very hard worker


---------51:38----------
and it's hard to blame him he's doing


---------51:40----------
everything he can


---------51:48----------
where does that leave you that he's


---------51:50----------
doing everything that he can but tells


---------51:52----------
you to smarten up when you're struggling


---------51:56----------
yes i just learned to deal with it


---------52:00----------
and how did you learn to deal with it


---------52:05----------
by getting things done


---------52:09----------
yeah right pushing through setting aside


---------52:11----------
your feelings who cares


---------52:13----------
your emotions have no value asriel


---------52:16----------
smarten up


---------52:17----------
push through screw your boundaries


---------52:23----------
sound familiar the same philosophy he


---------52:26----------
applies to himself


---------52:28----------
he pushes himself a lot too


---------52:32----------
and i'm noticing that it can be quite


---------52:36----------
so i think there's a lot of not


---------52:38----------
confusion but


---------52:39----------
there's a lot of complexity which you're


---------52:42----------
able to appreciate right when it comes


---------52:44----------
to your


---------52:44----------
sounds like your stepfather


---------52:48----------
uh my actual father yeah i know but


---------52:50----------
earlier we were talking about your


---------52:51----------
stepfather the the one who


---------52:53----------
drinks sometimes yeah yeah right so like


---------52:56----------
you can


---------52:57----------
your mind does a really good job of like


---------52:59----------
noticing the good and the bad which is


---------53:01----------
actually healthy


---------53:02----------
right you're not gonna like say like oh


---------53:04----------
this guy was a complete [ __ ] and


---------53:06----------
and the devil incarnate there were times


---------53:08----------
where it sounds like he was like a cool


---------53:10----------
dude and


---------53:11----------
and maybe did care about you or


---------53:13----------
something like that


---------53:14----------
and then when it comes to your dad it's


---------53:16----------
like you know that's


---------53:17----------
like he did a lot of good stuff he


---------53:19----------
pushed through a lot of things you know


---------53:21----------
like he worked really hard he like built


---------53:23----------
an engineering company


---------53:24----------
there's a lot here that i can honestly


---------53:26----------
respect


---------53:29----------
and you're also able to acknowledge


---------53:31----------
though that like


---------53:33----------
did he care about you yes


---------53:36----------
did he love you obviously


---------53:40----------
was he there for you not really


---------53:45----------
what do you how does it you want to push


---------53:48----------
back against that or what do you think


---------53:49----------
about what i just said


---------53:52----------
i think that's pretty accurate


---------53:56----------
you said he was a scout leader


---------53:59----------
yeah what does that mean a scout leader


---------54:02----------
like um


---------54:04----------
in america it's boy scouts but in canada


---------54:07----------
it's


---------54:07----------
all-inclusive i think um


---------54:12----------
and sort of the reason he did that was


---------54:15----------
you know he wanted us to


---------54:17----------
get into scouting and learn it because


---------54:19----------
you know it


---------54:20----------
provides a lot of value for growth


---------54:24----------
and learning um so i think that was part


---------54:28----------
of it


---------54:29----------
and nike was doing it for us


---------54:34----------
but at the same time when you're a scout


---------54:36----------
leader you can't


---------54:37----------
you know have favoritism over your kids


---------54:40----------
because that's just bad for the group


---------54:42----------
so no i wasn't treated like everyone


---------54:44----------
else


---------54:46----------
okay too busy asriel what are you what


---------54:49----------
are you doing


---------54:50----------
so you do this thing right you're just


---------54:52----------
talking about scouts and what do you say


---------54:58----------
i wasn't important that he didn't


---------55:01----------
it wasn't there for me yep


---------55:06----------
let's back up a little bit and connect


---------55:08----------
those dots i think that's where we were


---------55:10----------
going


---------55:11----------
but so you're good you've been watching


---------55:13----------
paying attention i don't know if


---------55:14----------
if chat was able to follow but let's


---------55:17----------
think through this right so


---------55:19----------
i'm gonna ask you now be careful because


---------55:21----------
like you started talking about scouts


---------55:22----------
and you were like he's not allowed to


---------55:24----------
show favoritism


---------55:26----------
[ __ ] where does that come from what does


---------55:27----------
that have to do with anything


---------55:30----------
right it's what you told yourself when


---------55:33----------
what happened


---------55:37----------
no he told that to me okay oh


---------55:40----------
interesting


---------55:42----------
and how did it feel having your dad as a


---------55:44----------
scout leader you are presumably


---------55:46----------
in scouts yeah


---------55:50----------
right because um


---------55:57----------
i don't know um i think i just sort of


---------56:00----------
accept it as reality


---------56:02----------
i don't really think about what it's


---------56:04----------
like


---------56:06----------
i was pretty cool actually i mean


---------56:09----------
pretty cool that have as a scout leader


---------56:15----------
um so so maybe he there there wasn't any


---------56:17----------
negative emotion there i'm curious did


---------56:19----------
you ever feel


---------56:20----------
jealous when you were in scouts


---------56:27----------
no okay so you didn't have because


---------56:30----------
sometimes people like


---------56:31----------
will have these kinds of thoughts or


---------56:32----------
feelings where you know if they didn't


---------56:34----------
feel this way


---------56:34----------
you know don't say yes but sometimes you


---------56:37----------
know i can imagine


---------56:38----------
that you're a kid who feels maybe a


---------56:40----------
little bit undervalued and so that your


---------56:42----------
mind would notice things


---------56:44----------
which actually may have been completely


---------56:45----------
fair right he's not supposed to give you


---------56:48----------
more or less attention


---------56:50----------
but if your mind was kind of hungry for


---------56:52----------
attention from your dad that maybe you


---------56:53----------
noticed he was like supporting


---------56:55----------
other kids and like you wanted him to


---------56:57----------
support you the same way


---------57:00----------
though i think it was very much


---------57:04----------
like equal like


---------57:08----------
yeah so you thought it was equal and


---------57:11----------
fair and you felt like emotionally okay


---------57:13----------
with that


---------57:15----------
yeah i accepted it for what it was and


---------57:18----------
what was it


---------57:20----------
it was just being a leader and


---------57:24----------
you know helping


---------57:27----------
the group uh learn and grow and


---------57:30----------
learn new skills and i was part of the


---------57:33----------
group


---------57:34----------
yeah absolutely it sounds like you're


---------57:36----------
very proud of your dad


---------57:39----------
yeah for sure also sounds like maybe you


---------57:42----------
felt proud of being your dad's son


---------57:52----------
i can imagine that it it can be hard or


---------57:54----------
confusing to


---------57:55----------
even now it sounds like you respect your


---------57:57----------
dad a lot and you feel proud of him


---------58:01----------
do you feel do you feel proud to be his


---------58:03----------
son


---------58:07----------
yeah sure i never thought about it but


---------58:11----------
yeah i guess so


---------58:16----------
okay i'm a little bit confused by your


---------58:18----------
response because you seem pretty


---------58:20----------
like i can imagine like you sort of


---------58:22----------
hinted at like you know you


---------58:24----------
like everyone in the troop knew that


---------58:26----------
your dad was pretty cool because he was


---------58:27----------
a scout leader and he knew all this


---------58:29----------
stuff


---------58:30----------
so actually i'm feeling like a sense of


---------58:32----------
pride there


---------58:34----------
when i ask you now what i'm hearing is a


---------58:36----------
logical answer


---------58:40----------
okay does that make sense like


---------58:43----------
i can i can i can almost feel the pride


---------58:46----------
that you felt as a kid


---------58:49----------
like you guys are out doing scout stuff


---------58:51----------
and you're like yeah that's my dad


---------58:54----------
i'm i'm not i'm not hearing that same


---------58:57----------
thing i i definitely hearing a lot of


---------58:58----------
respect for what he's built


---------59:00----------
for sure right an understanding and an


---------59:04----------
appreciation of the challenges that he's


---------59:06----------
faced and how he's like


---------59:07----------
continued to persevere through those


---------59:09----------
challenges absolutely


---------59:12----------
is he proud of you


---------59:17----------
yeah i think so um i


---------59:20----------
don't think i ever thought


---------59:24----------
that he was proud of me until recently


---------59:27----------
oh it's sort of like i left for a


---------59:29----------
university and then


---------59:32----------
you know things just changed


---------59:35----------
what changed


---------59:38----------
i don't know um i was the youngest


---------59:42----------
child in the family so once i left


---------59:46----------
you know he sort of you know he stopped


---------59:49----------
being a scout leader


---------59:51----------
um he started looking for a wife or


---------59:55----------
not a wife but a girlfriend someone else


---------59:57----------
to live with


---------59:59----------
and then


---------60:02----------
i don't know as he's being a lot more


---------60:06----------
supportive


---------60:07----------
and less


---------60:12----------
sort of aggressive like aggressive


---------60:14----------
towards


---------60:16----------
me and my achievements um


---------60:19----------
though he doesn't


---------60:22----------
i've talked to him and i it's weird


---------60:25----------
because he


---------60:25----------
doesn't seem to acknowledge that


---------60:27----------
anything has changed


---------60:29----------
yeah can i try to interpret what i heard


---------60:34----------
maybe try to string together a couple of


---------60:36----------
those dots


---------60:38----------
so i'm almost hearing that like maybe


---------60:39----------
your dad like


---------60:43----------
like his role as father was like almost


---------60:45----------
like a grind for him


---------60:47----------
it was like a duty you know he had to


---------60:49----------
make sure


---------60:50----------
that you guys got to a certain point


---------60:54----------
it's almost like he didn't have the


---------60:55----------
space to be like


---------60:57----------
proud and chill


---------61:01----------
it's like we got to get asriel to


---------61:03----------
college we got to do this we got to do


---------61:04----------
this like


---------61:06----------
it's about like getting them to where


---------61:07----------
they need to go


---------61:09----------
in a very objective sense and like


---------61:10----------
feelings are like


---------61:12----------
no room for feelings yeah


---------61:15----------
i think he sacrificed a lot for us


---------61:21----------
and now that there's space for it


---------61:25----------
he's kind of chilling a little bit maybe


---------61:27----------
feels more proud of


---------61:37----------
i you i don't know


---------61:40----------
maybe has he ever has he ever said to


---------61:42----------
you that he's proud of you


---------61:47----------
no not openly what would it be like to


---------61:51----------
hear that


---------61:58----------
uh


---------62:02----------
i don't know if that's


---------62:08----------
i don't know if that would actually do


---------62:09----------
anything


---------62:14----------
okay what makes you think that


---------62:22----------
i just like great he's proud of me now


---------62:26----------
what


---------62:30----------
it doesn't solve anything


---------62:34----------
what are we trying to solve


---------62:37----------
what's the my life and what aspects of


---------62:41----------
your life


---------62:44----------
me failing at everything do you fail at


---------62:47----------
everything


---------62:49----------
absolutely that's how it


---------62:52----------
that's my approach i i just brute force


---------62:56----------
it and i fail like


---------62:58----------
every time and you know i just do it


---------63:01----------
enough times eventually i'll get through


---------63:04----------
you know i just power through everything


---------63:11----------
okay i'm a little bit


---------63:14----------
confused um


---------63:17----------
would you could you ever ask your dad if


---------63:21----------
he was proud of you


---------63:30----------
i don't think so like why would i do


---------63:33----------
that


---------63:34----------
that's just looking for validation


---------63:38----------
that's feeding a particular beast is it


---------63:42----------
not


---------63:47----------
give me a second asriel


---------63:51----------
i think i think we've stumbled upon a


---------63:53----------
big problem


---------63:55----------
but give me just a second because i i


---------63:57----------
trust that


---------63:58----------
you're a smart dude and i trust you're


---------64:00----------
familiar with these concepts so i got to


---------64:02----------
figure out


---------64:07----------
okay here's where i'm coming from okay


---------64:09----------
bro


---------64:10----------
i don't think you're i don't i think


---------64:12----------
you're doing well on the outside world


---------64:15----------
like the whole premise of this


---------64:16----------
conversation is like you're making


---------64:17----------
outward progress


---------64:19----------
but internally it still feels bad


---------64:23----------
so like the first thing that's weird is


---------64:24----------
like i think we've run into some kind of


---------64:31----------
you know like when you're playing a game


---------64:33----------
and like the boss is at 20


---------64:34----------
health and they like develop some kind


---------64:38----------
of combo breaker super shield kind


---------64:40----------
of thing where you're like you're on


---------64:42----------
your way there and then like something


---------64:44----------
pops up and then they like


---------64:45----------
turn into some other boss and they've


---------64:47----------
like morphed i feel like that's what


---------64:49----------
just happened


---------64:50----------
because i thought the whole premise of


---------64:52----------
this conversation i realized we're being


---------64:53----------
intellectual so this may not be helpful


---------64:55----------
but like i


---------64:56----------
want you to notice this with me that


---------64:57----------
like i thought the premise of this


---------64:58----------
conversation is that


---------65:00----------
outside as your therapist puts it you're


---------65:02----------
thriving in a pandemic


---------65:05----------
i mean are you you know have you started


---------65:07----------
a billion dollar company


---------65:09----------
sounds like no and at the same time you


---------65:11----------
get there one day


---------65:12----------
absolutely man so like you'll you'll


---------65:14----------
you'll like you're you're


---------65:16----------
back in school you know you


---------65:19----------
have gotten gotten through the way in


---------65:22----------
which you failed to find a job is


---------65:24----------
progressing right you got a job you


---------65:26----------
didn't you know it was hard so like


---------65:28----------
you're still like


---------65:28----------
you're working on actually i'm not


---------65:29----------
worried about the outside world


---------65:32----------
what i think this conversation is about


---------65:35----------
is this unshakable feeling


---------65:37----------
that you have that you are not worth and


---------65:39----------
think


---------65:43----------
right that like you're not valuable


---------65:48----------
i think i have value it's what i can


---------65:52----------
accomplish and do for people around me


---------65:57----------
um no it isn't


---------66:00----------
so i know this sounds perplexing but


---------66:03----------
you have intrinsic value


---------66:06----------
you don't have to believe me you don't


---------66:08----------
have to disagree it's just what i


---------66:09----------
believe it's a belief


---------66:11----------
so i think what you were taught


---------66:15----------
is that like your value is like


---------66:17----------
dependent on your accomplishments


---------66:20----------
right that like your dad like when you


---------66:22----------
didn't do a good job like


---------66:24----------
he didn't like demonstrate to you that i


---------66:26----------
still care about you in a very like


---------66:29----------
explicit


---------66:29----------
way right he was like you need to do


---------66:31----------
better then i shall love you


---------66:34----------
there's a part of you that knows that


---------66:36----------
isn't true but like there are some


---------66:37----------
signals that he sent you that sort of


---------66:39----------
like


---------66:40----------
created that complex does that make


---------66:41----------
sense i mean you even say it when you


---------66:43----------
talk about your siblings you're like you


---------66:45----------
know i had to work so much harder to get


---------66:47----------
recognized because they were better than


---------66:48----------
i was


---------66:49----------
there's a lot of like conditionality to


---------66:52----------
like the


---------66:53----------
love right so like your value as a


---------66:56----------
person


---------66:56----------
even when it comes to your stepdad like


---------66:58----------
fluctuated


---------67:00----------
if your dad was in a bad mood there's no


---------67:04----------
intrinsic value


---------67:05----------
actually and so like the the way that


---------67:08----------
your your stepdad treated you actually


---------67:10----------
taught you that there's no


---------67:11----------
constant sense of value right like the


---------67:14----------
way you get treated


---------67:15----------
fluctuates depending on all kinds of


---------67:17----------
external things does that make sense


---------67:20----------
uh a little confused about


---------67:24----------
you are talking about how it fluctuates


---------67:27----------
with my stepdad


---------67:31----------
i think i always recognize that what he


---------67:33----------
was doing was wrong and it just became


---------67:36----------
like a 40 chess game 40 social chess


---------67:39----------
game


---------67:39----------
trying to get him to not you know get


---------67:42----------
set off


---------67:43----------
um i


---------67:46----------
i think i recognized that that was sort


---------67:49----------
of an abusive


---------67:51----------
toxic relationship and that


---------67:54----------
you know i don't think i was


---------67:57----------
i based my value on what he thought


---------68:03----------
thank you very much for clarifying that


---------68:04----------
so let me let me take a different angle


---------68:07----------
so like if we go back to your fourth


---------68:09----------
grade school example


---------68:12----------
right like the what i really interpreted


---------68:15----------
there was that your mom


---------68:16----------
sort of didn't care like she didn't


---------68:19----------
think about


---------68:20----------
your inconvenience and embarrassment


---------68:25----------
well i think the idea was that my


---------68:27----------
brother was going to the other school


---------68:29----------
because he got in the gifted program and


---------68:32----------
i didn't


---------68:33----------
and then she was sort of thinking well


---------68:35----------
why don't i just go to that school too


---------68:37----------
but she never really told anyone and


---------68:41----------
that part of that is probably because


---------68:43----------
she was


---------68:44----------
pretty probably emotional


---------68:47----------
at the time and what are you doing


---------68:56----------
you're right you can't you can't help it


---------68:58----------
so it's it's i'm not i'm not telling you


---------69:00----------
to stop


---------69:01----------
i i think it's just it's what your mind


---------69:02----------
is doing so


---------69:04----------
you're you're absolutely right man like


---------69:06----------
it's it's like a very reasonable thing


---------69:08----------
for your mom to do that right she's like


---------69:09----------
let's have my two kids together


---------69:12----------
one kid got into the gifted program so


---------69:13----------
i'm gonna move the other kid totally


---------69:15----------
fine like i don't think it's any


---------69:16----------
like moving you s to another school is


---------69:18----------
completely logical i have no issue with


---------69:20----------
that


---------69:22----------
the question is how did you feel the day


---------69:25----------
that you showed up at your old school


---------69:32----------
i think i just accepted that this is my


---------69:34----------
life now


---------69:35----------
i go to a new school and i gotta


---------69:38----------
figure out how to fit in


---------69:42----------
yep so i think acceptance is absolutely


---------69:45----------
right because what i'm hearing there


---------69:46----------
honestly and you can push back if you


---------69:48----------
want to i may be wrong


---------69:50----------
right so by all means correct me but


---------69:51----------
like what i'm hearing is that like


---------69:53----------
you're kind of an afterthought


---------69:57----------
right like it's one thing to move you


---------69:58----------
like even if we say like okay your


---------70:00----------
brother got into the gifted and talented


---------70:02----------
program we're gonna move you anyway but


---------70:04----------
like at least let you know


---------70:07----------
like i could just i'm just trying to put


---------70:08----------
myself in the shoes of a fourth grader


---------70:10----------
who shows up at their class


---------70:12----------
and their teacher is like you're no


---------70:13----------
longer a student here like can you


---------70:15----------
like that sounds so


---------70:18----------
devastatingly embarrassing to me


---------70:23----------
like it sounds like bewildering in like


---------70:26----------
clueless


---------70:28----------
now i don't even know if you went into


---------70:30----------
the classroom and you got told by your


---------70:31----------
teacher or like you know someone met you


---------70:32----------
like i don't know but like


---------70:33----------
what i'm what i'm kind of noticing is


---------70:35----------
like inconsiderateness


---------70:37----------
it's like they don't even think about


---------70:38----------
you it's almost like like your mom


---------70:40----------
didn't like think to tell you hey by the


---------70:42----------
way like she


---------70:43----------
there's no space in her mind like for


---------70:45----------
i'm not trying to be brutal here


---------70:47----------
but like you know what i'm sort of


---------70:48----------
noticing it's almost like the same thing


---------70:50----------
at work it's like does that even


---------70:52----------
anyone even notice if i don't show up


---------70:57----------
it's like a lack of noticing right like


---------70:59----------
it's a lack of like


---------71:01----------
like i'm getting the sense as real i can


---------71:03----------
see you're getting maybe a little bit


---------71:05----------
emotional but


---------71:06----------
i i like what i'm getting is like you


---------71:07----------
were taught this lesson that like


---------71:11----------
you're not worth thinking about


---------71:20----------
yeah i think that's a common theme


---------71:25----------
right and it's like it's amazing to see


---------71:28----------
you progress like especially in the high


---------71:30----------
performance group where it's like i


---------71:31----------
don't belong here


---------71:32----------
it's like objectively like you know you


---------71:34----------
can make a good argument for that but


---------71:36----------
you


---------71:36----------
absolutely belong there and the


---------71:38----------
objectivity of it doesn't matter and


---------71:40----------
like you've been able to see like you


---------71:41----------
know even though there's like


---------71:42----------
there are people who are quite advanced


---------71:44----------
in their careers here who are very


---------71:46----------
successful


---------71:47----------
like i can still make a meaningful


---------71:48----------
contribution


---------71:51----------
like that's intrinsic value


---------71:55----------
right that like no matter what your


---------71:56----------
circumstances are no matter who you're


---------71:58----------
around whether the successful


---------71:59----------
unsuccessful


---------72:00----------
you have value


---------72:05----------
and so i think what we're working on


---------72:07----------
here is not


---------72:08----------
anything to do with the outside success


---------72:10----------
because i think that you're doing


---------72:12----------
you've learned how to push through like


---------72:13----------
you're crushing it bro good


---------72:15----------
you have a ways to go absolutely but are


---------72:17----------
you making progress absolutely


---------72:20----------
what we're talking about here is that


---------72:22----------
like feeling on the inside at least


---------72:24----------
that's what i


---------72:24----------
that's what i'm focusing on it's your


---------72:26----------
you tell me otherwise


---------72:28----------
but and and this is where like i think


---------72:30----------
it's gonna be tricky because i think


---------72:31----------
what's what i'm detecting is a sense of


---------72:33----------
like


---------72:33----------
lack of intrinsic value right the first


---------72:37----------
question i think i asked you is how long


---------72:38----------
have you felt like


---------72:40----------
i don't know exactly what it was that


---------72:42----------
you weren't worth much


---------72:44----------
right you say forever so it's something


---------72:46----------
you carry with you


---------72:50----------
we can go through these different


---------72:51----------
stories about you know now that your dad


---------72:53----------
and so then when i ask you the question


---------72:54----------
like is your dad proud of you and you're


---------72:56----------
like i don't know what difference that


---------72:57----------
would make dude it's going to make all


---------72:58----------
the difference


---------73:03----------
i think i'd know how to process that


---------73:06----------
even if he did


---------73:07----------
say it you're damn right you don't which


---------73:10----------
is the entire problem


---------73:14----------
right because like how do you process


---------73:16----------
that which you've never heard before


---------73:18----------
and if we think about like what's the


---------73:20----------
problem here it's that like i know it


---------73:21----------
sounds kind of weird but like


---------73:23----------
you know this is sometimes what happens


---------73:25----------
when kids aren't told that


---------73:28----------
you're proud of them as they carry this


---------73:31----------
thing where you're just not


---------73:33----------
sure what your intrinsic value was and


---------73:34----------
you're like how can words make a


---------73:36----------
difference


---------73:37----------
and i'm not sure i mean i just and this


---------73:40----------
is where i think i think you're


---------73:41----------
incredibly frightened of asking him too


---------73:49----------
yeah i think so and so if we think about


---------73:52----------
that like we can see that sort of


---------73:53----------
doesn't


---------73:55----------
if you if what he says doesn't matter


---------73:57----------
why on earth are you scared of asking


---------73:59----------
him


---------74:02----------
maybe i just don't want to look like a


---------74:05----------
fool


---------74:09----------
yep i think you're afraid


---------74:12----------
of two things one is that he's gonna say


---------74:14----------
no


---------74:16----------
and probably more likely is he's not


---------74:19----------
gonna know how to answer the question


---------74:24----------
what do you think about that


---------74:33----------
what do you mean when like you say he


---------74:36----------
won't know how to answer it


---------74:39----------
so in the same way that you don't know


---------74:41----------
how to process


---------74:43----------
his answer he may not know how to


---------74:46----------
process the question


---------74:47----------
because it sounds like that's not


---------74:51----------
you know a scout badge that you guys


---------74:54----------
ever got


---------74:56----------
right like emotional discussions between


---------74:58----------
father and son about like what he


---------75:00----------
what you mean to him is like just


---------75:02----------
something that you guys aren't familiar


---------75:08----------
with


---------75:11----------
i think he has expressed that he cares a


---------75:14----------
lot about me


---------75:16----------
um ah that's completely different though


---------75:25----------
right i know it sounds similar but let's


---------75:27----------
be clear


---------75:30----------
i can care a lot about someone


---------75:33----------
but being proud of them is completely


---------75:36----------
different


---------75:39----------
okay there's a reason i'm not asking


---------75:43----------
about love right i'm not asking does


---------75:45----------
your dad love you because i know he


---------75:46----------
loves you you know he loves you


---------75:49----------
that's clear like he's done a good job


---------75:50----------
with that he's sacrificed for you


---------75:53----------
you know you mean a lot to him like i'm


---------75:55----------
not hearing that at all


---------75:57----------
i know it sounds weird but like you know


---------75:58----------
so for some people that's that's the


---------76:00----------
issue


---------76:00----------
but for you i think it's about pride


---------76:02----------
it's about value it's about worth


---------76:08----------
you know like like at the end of the day


---------76:12----------
when you strip away


---------76:13----------
all of your accomplishments is like are


---------76:15----------
you are you worth something


---------76:22----------
hmm i guess i'd say


---------76:26----------
not really yeah


---------76:29----------
i i think i i can see that you believe


---------76:32----------
that


---------76:35----------
and so when it comes to like nihilism


---------76:38----------
and when it comes to like


---------76:39----------
you know using frustration as fuel like


---------76:42----------
i think as long as you feel that way


---------76:44----------
like


---------76:46----------
that's gonna be tough


---------76:54----------
sorry


---------76:57----------
i think also because i had a


---------77:00----------
conversation with him recently


---------77:03----------
and like that was


---------77:07----------
you know i i explained that i was having


---------77:10----------
a rough time


---------77:11----------
whatever and in the past


---------77:15----------
but like this time i was sort of talking


---------77:17----------
about


---------77:18----------
you know how i always feel i need to


---------77:20----------
accomplish everything and


---------77:22----------
like with the job how i didn't show up


---------77:25----------
and he was just like


---------77:26----------
dude it's a summer job like are you


---------77:29----------
being so hard on yourself


---------77:32----------
and then he sort of met up my dad


---------77:35----------
okay and then it was sort of like like


---------77:38----------
where did i go wrong like where did i


---------77:41----------
mess up that


---------77:42----------
you know you ended up this way


---------77:46----------
is that what he said to you


---------77:50----------
yeah and then i was like


---------77:53----------
no i don't think you messed up i think


---------77:56----------
you know that was just me learning to


---------78:02----------
be me and


---------78:05----------
i think it was something that i taught


---------78:06----------
myself


---------78:11----------
i think i was just deflecting the blame


---------78:21----------
help me understand how you interpret


---------78:24----------
that interaction with your dad


---------78:38----------
um


---------78:47----------
well it was just


---------78:55----------
i don't know i guess it was a little bit


---------78:56----------
relieving


---------78:58----------
maybe that you know he didn't


---------79:03----------
you know push me like you know


---------79:07----------
i was the only one pushing myself that


---------79:10----------
he's not


---------79:11----------
really pushing me anymore to succeed or


---------79:14----------
whatever


---------79:16----------
no okay it's nice to let that go


---------79:20----------
i guess sort of


---------79:27----------
okay asriel i need a minute okay


---------79:31----------
all right


---------79:42----------
okay i'm gonna ask you to take a step


---------79:43----------
back from that like let's really pay


---------79:45----------
attention to what was said okay


---------79:47----------
and and i'm noticing that maybe i'm


---------79:50----------
trying to bludgeon you


---------79:51----------
into believing something does it feel


---------79:53----------
that way to you


---------79:58----------
um i don't think you can bludgeon me


---------80:00----------
into believing anything if i don't want


---------80:02----------
to


---------80:04----------
i completely agree but does it feel like


---------80:06----------
you're being bludgeoned


---------80:09----------
not saying it's working i'm asking what


---------80:11----------
it feels like


---------80:16----------
i don't know what you're trying to get


---------80:18----------
me to believe


---------80:20----------
great do you feel like i'm getting you


---------80:22----------
to believe anything i'm like pushing you


---------80:23----------
to believe something


---------80:27----------
maybe something about intrinsic value


---------80:30----------
and that


---------80:31----------
my dad is proud of me or something


---------80:37----------
okay okay okay good all right so like i


---------80:40----------
like let's listen to that statement okay


---------80:42----------
so like i'm just gonna tell the story


---------80:44----------
back as i heard it because it was a


---------80:45----------
surprising story to me so you


---------80:47----------
didn't show up for your summer job you


---------80:49----------
go to your dad and you say hey


---------80:51----------
by the way i didn't show up for my


---------80:52----------
summer job fair enough so far


---------80:55----------
or then he's like


---------80:58----------
where did i screw up with you


---------81:02----------
no what did he say tomorrow like


---------81:06----------
well it was i didn't show up you know


---------81:09----------
i've


---------81:10----------
i felt you know incredibly you know i


---------81:13----------
had an emotional breakdown


---------81:16----------
you know i was incredibly nervous and he


---------81:19----------
was like


---------81:20----------
you know why are you pushing yourself so


---------81:22----------
hard


---------81:23----------
um it's just a summer job like


---------81:26----------
it's only so much you can do um


---------81:31----------
and then you know where did i go wrong


---------81:34----------
with you


---------81:34----------
or like no i mentioned you know how i


---------81:37----------
have this


---------81:38----------
performance versus growth mindset and


---------81:41----------
trying to get out of the performance


---------81:43----------
mindset he's like i never taught you


---------81:46----------
that like


---------81:47----------
you know where do you learn that


---------81:51----------
where is i go wrong


---------81:56----------
okay what do you what do you how do you


---------81:58----------
understand the statement where did i go


---------82:00----------
wrong with you


---------82:06----------
thank you


---------82:10----------
trying to put the blame on himself maybe


---------82:13----------
and then i'm not allowing that yeah


---------82:16----------
so i completely agree so here's what


---------82:19----------
like


---------82:19----------
i think is problematic so i think this


---------82:21----------
is like some weird stuff okay so asriel


---------82:24----------
what i'm about to say there are multiple


---------82:26----------
interpretations of number one


---------82:28----------
interpretation is that


---------82:31----------
i've got something in my mind and i'm


---------82:34----------
not willing to let that go or change


---------82:35----------
that


---------82:36----------
so i could be wrong here so i'm going to


---------82:38----------
just toss this out because like this


---------82:39----------
story is


---------82:41----------
is becoming is getting a little bit more


---------82:44----------
and more unexpected


---------82:45----------
so like i think there's there's


---------82:47----------
something very supportive


---------82:49----------
about that and also like


---------82:53----------
something incredibly damning


---------82:57----------
so like like on the supportive side is


---------83:01----------
the reason you're screwed up is because


---------83:03----------
it's my fault and i wasn't good enough


---------83:04----------
of a dad


---------83:06----------
and that's better than the reason you're


---------83:08----------
screwed up is because of something that


---------83:10----------
you did


---------83:13----------
the the problem though and this is like


---------83:15----------
what i'm trying to


---------83:16----------
bludgeon you to understand is that


---------83:20----------
irrespective of who's to blame


---------83:23----------
there's a fundamental assumption that


---------83:25----------
you're screwed up


---------83:27----------
like do you see that it's like where did


---------83:30----------
i go wrong that my son


---------83:31----------
ended up like this like that is the


---------83:33----------
opposite of pride


---------83:37----------
right so like like is is he like growing


---------83:39----------
and doing better and like trying to be


---------83:40----------
like


---------83:41----------
compassionate and understanding and like


---------83:43----------
is he not


---------83:44----------
so he's grown right like so he's doing


---------83:46----------
better because he's not just saying


---------83:48----------
just be better bro he's like


---------83:51----------
where did i go wrong


---------83:54----------
so i i get what you're saying and i do


---------83:56----------
think it's like growth on his part i


---------83:57----------
don't think your dad is a bad dude by


---------83:58----------
any means


---------84:00----------
it's just like i want you to think about


---------84:02----------
when when a parent


---------84:03----------
thinks that way about a child even if


---------84:05----------
they accept responsibility for it


---------84:07----------
what does it signal to the child about


---------84:09----------
their intrinsic worth


---------84:16----------
that's a feedback loop


---------84:19----------
so it's sort of confirming


---------84:23----------
right and so that that what yeah that i


---------84:26----------
messed up


---------84:27----------
maybe yep


---------84:31----------
and so if we think about what do you use


---------84:32----------
toxic productivity to get over


---------84:34----------
it's that you're messed up


---------84:41----------
right and and like i don't think your


---------84:44----------
dad is


---------84:44----------
honestly i don't think he's a bad dude


---------84:45----------
like it's clear to me that he loves you


---------84:47----------
a lot he's made a lot of sacrifices


---------84:49----------
it's clear to me that you love him like


---------84:52----------
you know we haven't


---------84:52----------
gotten to your mom or your siblings


---------84:55----------
and what it's like to have siblings who


---------84:57----------
are in the gifted and talented


---------84:59----------
program and you're not and things like


---------85:00----------
that right so like there are a lot of


---------85:02----------
reasons like


---------85:03----------
asriel i think the problem is not that


---------85:05----------
you're stupid i think the problem is


---------85:06----------
that you're smart


---------85:08----------
the problem is that like you look around


---------85:10----------
at the world and you see older siblings


---------85:12----------
who are in the gifted and talented


---------85:13----------
program and you see yourself


---------85:15----------
and you're not the problem is that you


---------85:17----------
look around at the world and you see


---------85:19----------
like


---------85:19----------
other people who are able to do things


---------85:22----------
that you're not able to do


---------85:24----------
and the problem is that your parents see


---------85:27----------
that too


---------85:29----------
and that's a given in their mind and i


---------85:31----------
think it's those


---------85:32----------
little statements which if he's saying


---------85:35----------
that now like i'm curious what did he


---------85:37----------
say to you in high school what did he


---------85:39----------
say to you before


---------85:40----------
you know it sounds like he said push


---------85:42----------
through push through push through


---------85:44----------
but what i'm really not hearing is that


---------85:45----------
like he's been proud of what you've


---------85:47----------
accomplished


---------85:50----------
whereas i am hearing that like you're


---------85:52----------
starting to be proud in what you've


---------85:54----------
accomplished like you're not comparing


---------85:55----------
yourself to other people what i'm


---------85:56----------
hearing you learned in group


---------85:58----------
is people like even when you are not


---------86:00----------
proud of yourself


---------86:01----------
they are proud for you


---------86:05----------
does that make sense and so how do you


---------86:08----------
learn


---------86:08----------
pride in yourself it's because like when


---------86:10----------
you don't feel proud of yourself but you


---------86:12----------
have done something


---------86:13----------
to be proud of other people are proud


---------86:15----------
for you and when they said that to you


---------86:17----------
like for the first time asriel


---------86:19----------
how did you feel


---------86:26----------
i think i denied it absolutely


---------86:32----------
because your entire life you've been


---------86:34----------
taught


---------86:36----------
that you're not someone to be proud of


---------86:41----------
and you're a smart kid so you learned


---------86:43----------
that lesson


---------86:46----------
and now you carry it with you


---------86:49----------
and it takes time and effort like you've


---------86:52----------
already started to put your


---------86:53----------
life together but it's i think you


---------86:55----------
really like it's hard to learn how to be


---------86:57----------
proud of yourself


---------86:58----------
because when you say your dad doesn't


---------86:59----------
know how to respond to that statement


---------87:01----------
neither do you it's like a foreign


---------87:02----------
concept


---------87:05----------
like asriel is a good human being who


---------87:07----------
makes the world a better place


---------87:09----------
is like a foreign concept


---------87:12----------
i can logically give you a thousand


---------87:15----------
reasons


---------87:16----------
maybe even convince you


---------87:19----------
like i could say that like like asriel


---------87:22----------
do you sometimes wonder if the world


---------87:25----------
wouldn't not necessarily be a better


---------87:27----------
place but just that if you


---------87:28----------
cease to exist the world would not bat


---------87:30----------
an eyelash


---------87:32----------
do you ever think that way


---------87:35----------
yes yeah i think so right so like


---------87:40----------
watch for it so like you showed up here


---------87:45----------
in march of 2020 and you took


---------87:50----------
the waste of space that is asriel you


---------87:51----------
showed up we had a conversation


---------87:54----------
and i could say that thousands or tens


---------87:58----------
of thousands or hundreds of thousands of


---------88:00----------
people


---------88:01----------
benefited from you showing up there


---------88:04----------
and that you're showing up today and


---------88:07----------
you're being


---------88:08----------
waste of space asriel and thousands or


---------88:11----------
tens of thousands or hundreds of


---------88:12----------
thousands of people


---------88:14----------
who have had parents like yours who have


---------88:16----------
loved them but never been proud of them


---------88:19----------
are beginning to realize this they're


---------88:21----------
beginning to realize that like oh my god


---------88:23----------
the way that i think about myself is


---------88:25----------
because


---------88:26----------
even though my parents loved me like


---------88:29----------
their disappoint


---------88:30----------
their disappointment in me was a given


---------88:33----------
and if i were to tell you that you have


---------88:35----------
made all of their lives a tiny bit


---------88:38----------
better


---------88:39----------
in the same way that every person who


---------88:41----------
has come on stream has made your life a


---------88:42----------
tiny bit better


---------88:43----------
what would you say to that


---------88:58----------
i don't know i i guess that's a good


---------89:02----------
thing


---------89:04----------
okay guess it's a good thing yes it is


---------89:08----------
and who made that good thing possible


---------89:14----------
you see how hard it is it's so [ __ ]


---------89:17----------
hard isn't it


---------89:18----------
you're like


---------89:22----------
you're trying so hard not to admit it


---------89:24----------
even though like logically you're


---------89:26----------
trapped in a corner it's like


---------89:31----------
you feel that it's like you can't


---------89:34----------
have value


---------89:43----------
like tell me i'm wrong


---------89:46----------
if that's what you want to tell me tell


---------89:48----------
me i'm wrong


---------89:51----------
explain it to me give me all the reasons


---------89:54----------
why those people are benefiting


---------89:55----------
why every person on stream has helped


---------89:58----------
you and that help has been real


---------89:59----------
but you are incapable of helping anyone


---------90:01----------
in the audience tell me


---------90:03----------
say what you ever like say whatever you


---------90:04----------
want don't let me bludgeon you fight


---------90:07----------
back


---------90:17----------
i don't i know really have anything to


---------90:21----------
fight back with


---------90:22----------
okay good


---------90:27----------
it's just hard to


---------90:31----------
comprehend maybe yeah


---------90:34----------
so that's that's that's good asriel


---------90:37----------
that's really good actually you can


---------90:39----------
fight back if you feel like it if your


---------90:40----------
mind is telling but when i fight back i


---------90:42----------
mean like


---------90:42----------
if your mind is saying things to you


---------90:44----------
that you're like dismissing


---------90:46----------
you can share those things but is it


---------90:48----------
saying things to you


---------90:52----------
no okay how did it feel


---------90:56----------
how did it feel to hear me say that


---------91:01----------
that you are making a world the world a


---------91:04----------
better place


---------91:04----------
by being you in showing up here


---------91:11----------
to be honest i try not to think about it


---------91:14----------
that just makes me nervous


---------91:17----------
that's really healthy


---------91:21----------
it seemed to me like you got a little


---------91:22----------
emotional while i was you know


---------91:24----------
talking yeah i i guess it just came out


---------91:29----------
what emotion was that i had trouble


---------91:31----------
telling if that was a bad emotion or a


---------91:33----------
good emotion


---------91:40----------
i don't know just


---------91:47----------
i um i don't know


---------91:51----------
okay i think it was good


---------91:54----------
yeah so i i think that's just never had


---------91:58----------
anyone do that before


---------92:00----------
do what before


---------92:05----------
maybe


---------92:11----------
uh um validate my experience


---------92:16----------
or like you know show me


---------92:21----------
you know what i'm actually doing that it


---------92:23----------
matters


---------92:25----------
yeah so my hope is that it was a good


---------92:28----------
emotion i think it was a good emotion


---------92:29----------
and i understand why it may have been


---------92:31----------
confusing to you


---------92:33----------
because that is what feeling valued


---------92:36----------
feels like


---------92:40----------
so if i i don't really know i'm not i


---------92:42----------
mean i can't see your emotions but like


---------92:44----------
generally speaking what i was doing in


---------92:47----------
that moment


---------92:48----------
was like appreciating you for who you


---------92:50----------
are


---------92:52----------
and being like grateful that like you


---------92:54----------
exist


---------92:57----------
and and it's it's kind of sad but like


---------93:01----------
sometimes people don't know what that


---------93:03----------
feels like


---------93:04----------
right so it can be confusing the first


---------93:06----------
time we feel emotional i don't know if


---------93:07----------
that's actually what you felt or not but


---------93:09----------
like in this moment i'm


---------93:11----------
deeply grateful that you are the person


---------93:14----------
that you are


---------93:16----------
i don't want you to be better i don't


---------93:17----------
want you to be worse


---------93:20----------
i don't want you to be smarter i don't


---------93:22----------
want you to be anything except for what


---------93:24----------
you are


---------93:25----------
because what you are is like absolutely


---------93:27----------
enough like that's the premise


---------93:29----------
of what we do here is that you can be as


---------93:32----------
broken or as perfect as you want to be


---------93:34----------
you can be a gigantic streamer or you


---------93:36----------
can be


---------93:37----------
someone from our community and you can


---------93:40----------
come here and what you are


---------93:41----------
can make the world a better place


---------93:48----------
uh i wanna


---------93:52----------
i don't think it's that i make the world


---------93:56----------
a better place if i


---------93:57----------
just come here and i don't do anything


---------93:59----------
like i have to


---------94:02----------
do something talk about something i


---------94:05----------
agree


---------94:06----------
that's what i appreciate


---------94:10----------
like i appreciate what you showed up


---------94:12----------
here like how you showed up here and


---------94:14----------
that you haven't been afk for the last


---------94:16----------
hour and a half


---------94:19----------
right like if you had been afk like it's


---------94:21----------
been hard dude like you've come here and


---------94:22----------
you've done something hard


---------94:26----------
that's what i appreciate like i don't


---------94:29----------
care about i mean have you achieved a


---------94:31----------
good result i think


---------94:32----------
so but even if you hadn't i think it's


---------94:34----------
the showing up that matters


---------94:43----------
what do you help me understand where you


---------94:46----------
are mentally right now


---------94:51----------
uh i don't


---------94:54----------
i mean i'm understanding you but i


---------94:58----------
don't feel anything about it that's okay


---------95:04----------
i think that's that's all we can hope


---------95:06----------
for actually so i think you felt


---------95:08----------
something a little while ago


---------95:11----------
and i think that's enough so here's what


---------95:14----------
i'd say


---------95:15----------
do you have questions asriel


---------95:22----------
uh


---------95:23----------
[Music]


---------95:26----------
now i can't think of anything right now


---------95:31----------
okay so um would it


---------95:35----------
is it okay if i try to summarize i mean


---------95:37----------
we can


---------95:38----------
in my mind i think we've reached a good


---------95:40----------
stopping point how do you feel


---------95:46----------
uh what time is it well i mean we still


---------95:50----------
have time we've got


---------95:51----------
we've got about 15 20 minutes left oh


---------95:56----------
what that went fast


---------96:01----------
yeah we've been at this for an hour and


---------96:02----------
a half


---------96:05----------
okay um i i i


---------96:08----------
if if it's okay with you i'd like to


---------96:09----------
kind of summarize why i feel this is a


---------96:12----------
good stopping point and maybe like try


---------96:14----------
to share with you what my experience of


---------96:15----------
this conversation is


---------96:17----------
and then i definitely want you know if


---------96:19----------
there are things that we didn't get to


---------96:20----------
i want to give you the space to say hey


---------96:23----------
what about this this or this or


---------96:24----------
i still want to know about this okay is


---------96:26----------
that cool


---------96:29----------
okay so first of all you showed up here


---------96:33----------
in march of 2020


---------96:36----------
and you were struggling you were


---------96:39----------
overthinking a lot you were very outcome


---------96:41----------
oriented you didn't have a whole lot of


---------96:43----------
confidence in yourself


---------96:45----------
you didn't really know how to take


---------96:46----------
action it sounds like you've


---------96:48----------
made immense pro you've spent a lot of


---------96:52----------
time and energy


---------96:53----------
in growing as a person you did coaching


---------96:57----------
seems like that was good coaching helped


---------96:59----------
you get into therapy so it sounds like


---------97:01----------
maybe you had some concerns about going


---------97:03----------
to therapy and things like that


---------97:05----------
and and maybe coaching helped you kind


---------97:07----------
of overcome those which is one of the


---------97:08----------
outcomes of coaching that we're actually


---------97:10----------
studying now is helping people get into


---------97:12----------
therapy


---------97:13----------
you did therapy for a while it sounds


---------97:15----------
like you found like a pretty good cbt


---------97:17----------
therapist but that your sessions were a


---------97:19----------
little bit


---------97:20----------
short they helped you you came in with a


---------97:22----------
goal they helped you kind of accomplish


---------97:24----------
that goal


---------97:25----------
but it also sounds like some of the


---------97:27----------
emotional work that you were hoping to


---------97:28----------
do you really didn't get a chance to do


---------97:30----------
in therapy


---------97:35----------
yeah i think part of that was just that


---------97:37----------
i


---------97:39----------
didn't because it was about the


---------97:44----------
like finishing school and all that more


---------97:46----------
than it was about


---------97:48----------
yes it was about feeling better as well


---------97:52----------
i don't know i mean i'll let you guys go


---------97:55----------
yes like like i said


---------97:56----------
you've said several times that the the


---------97:58----------
goals of the therapy that you set out


---------98:00----------
for were accomplished


---------98:02----------
and at the same time i'm noticing that


---------98:05----------
maybe you wanted something a little bit


---------98:07----------
more but that financial


---------98:09----------
constraints also kind of limited what


---------98:12----------
you were able to do in therapy so you


---------98:14----------
came back to us you found yourself in


---------98:17----------
the high performance group and being a


---------98:19----------
little bit confused


---------98:21----------
and maybe feeling out of sorts but that


---------98:23----------
you've learned


---------98:24----------
how to be confident essentially right


---------98:26----------
like


---------98:27----------
and recognize that like even though


---------98:29----------
objectively you may not fit in some ways


---------98:32----------
that you have value in the group and you


---------98:35----------
can make meaningful contributions


---------98:37----------
even though you're still a student and


---------98:38----------
some people in there


---------98:40----------
have started companies with you


---------98:44----------
so now when we when you came on here we


---------98:46----------
were talking about this pattern right


---------98:48----------
that you've actually started to make a


---------98:50----------
lot of progress


---------98:51----------
in your outward life you're actually in


---------98:54----------
the process of putting your life


---------98:55----------
together


---------98:56----------
in a very real way you finished two


---------98:58----------
years of college


---------99:00----------
you are trying to get a job or you got a


---------99:03----------
job you didn't show up and


---------99:04----------
and whatnot that's okay once again you


---------99:07----------
know you're on your journey


---------99:09----------
um and the main


---------99:13----------
thing that maybe you could use help with


---------99:15----------
is that even though you've started to


---------99:17----------
push aside some of those negative


---------99:18----------
feelings


---------99:19----------
you actually through your own


---------99:20----------
introspective work have discovered


---------99:23----------
that you have some degree of toxic


---------99:25----------
productivity that you kind of like


---------99:27----------
push past some of those feelings and you


---------99:28----------
actually use shame and like a sense of


---------99:31----------
like oh i'm so pathetic to drive


---------99:32----------
yourself forward


---------99:34----------
in a very like outward way but that


---------99:35----------
there's still this internal stuff that


---------99:37----------
like


---------99:38----------
is hard to deal with although i'm


---------99:40----------
hearing that on a day-to-day mood


---------99:42----------
basis that you're actually feeling like


---------99:44----------
somewhat better than a year ago


---------99:47----------
so i yeah can i


---------99:51----------
add like um i was wondering you


---------99:55----------
mentioned at the beginning that there


---------99:56----------
was another way to overcome that hump


---------99:59----------
without the shame i was just wondering


---------100:02----------
you know what that was


---------100:04----------
yeah so there's alternate coping


---------100:07----------
mechanisms to overcome


---------100:10----------
the negative emotion and there is


---------100:13----------
lowering the burden of negative emotion


---------100:16----------
okay so the alternate coping mechanisms


---------100:18----------
would be like


---------100:19----------
let me just think of an example so like


---------100:22----------
a simple like so when we talk about


---------100:23----------
dharma right like you can do


---------100:25----------
things out of dharma or you can do them


---------100:30----------
out of toxic productivity okay


---------100:33----------
so that's sort of like you know you show


---------100:35----------
up to the job and you just see what you


---------100:37----------
can do


---------100:38----------
type of thing yeah so that i think is


---------100:41----------
more action orientation but not see what


---------100:43----------
you can do


---------100:44----------
that's a step in the right direction


---------100:46----------
that's moving away from an outcome


---------100:47----------
orientation to an action orientation i


---------100:49----------
would say dharma is like when you show


---------100:51----------
up


---------100:52----------
like you're showing up for like a reason


---------100:55----------
besides toxic productivity


---------100:58----------
so like this is where this is where like


---------101:00----------
you know you show up and then you kind


---------101:02----------
of say to yourself


---------101:03----------
i'm not saying you should say this it's


---------101:05----------
just the only thing that comes to your


---------101:06----------
mind


---------101:06----------
let's say hypothetically you're going to


---------101:08----------
come on stream one year later


---------101:11----------
and then like what you're saying is like


---------101:12----------
i need to like learn how to do this


---------101:14----------
so that when i share things with people


---------101:16----------
who are like where i was i can like help


---------101:18----------
them


---------101:19----------
understand what this process is like i


---------101:22----------
have to learn how to be okay in this job


---------101:25----------
so that if i ever meet someone else


---------101:27----------
who's like struggling like i can help


---------101:29----------
them


---------101:30----------
like i get that you want to be a marine


---------101:31----------
biologist but let's say like you decided


---------101:33----------
you wanted to become a psychologist and


---------101:34----------
if you want to help people who's


---------101:36----------
you know who are struggling with that


---------101:38----------
like you you have some broader


---------101:40----------
like purpose that matters to you so you


---------101:43----------
can say like okay i need to make money


---------101:45----------
so that i can support xyz


---------101:50----------
so their motivations besides toxic


---------101:52----------
productivity basically


---------101:55----------
okay and then what we did today was


---------101:59----------
um talking about sort of how i haven't


---------102:03----------
felt pride and then


---------102:04----------
that would be dealing with the bump that


---------102:07----------
i have to overcome


---------102:09----------
absolutely right so like what is that


---------102:10----------
emotional energy that you have to


---------102:12----------
overcome


---------102:14----------
with toxic productivity and that i think


---------102:17----------
is


---------102:17----------
is so you mentioned a bunch of emotions


---------102:19----------
right you said sadness i realize that


---------102:21----------
there's sadness and there's


---------102:22----------
fear and there's you know shame but


---------102:25----------
based on talking to you what i'm really


---------102:27----------
hearing is that like somewhere like


---------102:29----------
really at the core of it


---------102:30----------
i think asriel is like just the sense


---------102:32----------
that you're not worth much


---------102:35----------
you know and and i think that there have


---------102:37----------
been times in your life and it didn't it


---------102:38----------
didn't take you long


---------102:40----------
to kind of say how long have you felt


---------102:41----------
that way fourth grade and i think that's


---------102:43----------
when it start


---------102:43----------
like that's like the first time that i


---------102:46----------
don't think you understood that then but


---------102:47----------
when i ask you the question now like


---------102:49----------
you're able to go back to fourth grade


---------102:51----------
and kind of say


---------102:52----------
this is the first time that like i


---------102:54----------
really felt like someone didn't


---------102:56----------
bother to think about me


---------102:59----------
i think it was the first time i think it


---------103:01----------
was just


---------103:03----------
a more extreme example yeah okay so


---------103:06----------
that's


---------103:06----------
even more devastating right because that


---------103:08----------
means it happened before that


---------103:11----------
and and so then we kind of got to


---------103:13----------
talking a little bit about like you know


---------103:14----------
how did you come to believe that you


---------103:17----------
[Music]


---------103:20----------
aren't worth being proud of


---------103:24----------
and so this is where we got into the dad


---------103:26----------
bashing once again i don't i'm not


---------103:28----------
trying to bash your dad it's just i


---------103:29----------
think sometimes as parents


---------103:31----------
we all do this like i do this to my kids


---------103:33----------
we say things to them that have


---------103:34----------
psychological impacts because no one is


---------103:36----------
a perfect parent


---------103:39----------
and and the psychological impacts


---------103:41----------
despite the love


---------103:43----------
despite the caring despite the sacrifice


---------103:45----------
because it sounds like objectively your


---------103:46----------
dad was a really good dad


---------103:48----------
you respect him a lot you love him a lot


---------103:50----------
it sounds like he started to like


---------103:52----------
reshape his life and even put his


---------103:55----------
romantic interests aside


---------103:57----------
to care for you guys


---------104:01----------
and you know we're not even gonna get to


---------104:03----------
like what he thought about your stepdad


---------104:05----------
and whether he heard about that and all


---------104:07----------
that kind of crap


---------104:08----------
but well i i


---------104:12----------
he definitely thought that you know my


---------104:15----------
stepdad was a bit of a meathead


---------104:17----------
yeah so i'm hearing that your dad really


---------104:20----------
put his life on hold and made a lot of


---------104:22----------
sacrifices


---------104:23----------
to try to help you guys as much as


---------104:25----------
possible and he's actually a really good


---------104:27----------
dad


---------104:29----------
and he never told you he was proud of


---------104:30----------
you


---------104:32----------
and that even though he blames himself


---------104:36----------
it's still sort of like he still kind of


---------104:38----------
believes that you're kind of like


---------104:40----------
you know you're in the bargain bin of


---------104:43----------
children


---------104:44----------
which is like such a devastating thing


---------104:46----------
to feel right there's the gifted and


---------104:47----------
talented siblings and then there's you


---------104:51----------
and so like i think that like it's it's


---------104:54----------
devastating it makes me feel like an


---------104:56----------
[ __ ] saying that phrase i've never


---------104:58----------
said that before but it feels so


---------105:00----------
devastating


---------105:01----------
and if that's what you kind of grew up


---------105:03----------
with that's why you believe that about


---------105:05----------
yourself


---------105:07----------
right you've been conditioned and now


---------105:09----------
hopefully through group and some of


---------105:11----------
these other experiences you can learn to


---------105:13----------
actually recognize and like


---------105:14----------
even when i sort of said like asriel


---------105:16----------
like you are making the world a better


---------105:18----------
place by existing


---------105:19----------
i mean not just by existing because like


---------105:21----------
you're doing more than existing


---------105:23----------
right even if you may not have become


---------105:25----------
quote unquote


---------105:26----------
overwhelmingly successful the fact that


---------105:29----------
you are on


---------105:30----------
this journey in the fact that you do put


---------105:31----------
yourself outside of your comfort zone


---------105:33----------
and like you do genuinely enrich and


---------105:37----------
and improve the world around you and


---------105:40----------
it's not because of performance it's


---------105:42----------
like because you just show up


---------105:44----------
and you give it all you've got and


---------105:46----------
that's all


---------105:47----------
the world needs from you it's just for


---------105:48----------
you to be you and give it all you've got


---------105:51----------
the world doesn't need you to be you and


---------105:53----------
give it nothing


---------105:56----------
right then you really are like not


---------105:59----------
delivering value well when i show up and


---------106:03----------
i give it all i got


---------106:04----------
um you know i i often feel like it's not


---------106:08----------
enough


---------106:10----------
yeah that's the intrinsic value isn't it


---------106:14----------
absolutely well perfect


---------106:17----------
right because like because you're


---------106:20----------
starting from a basis


---------106:22----------
of like i'm in the bargain bin


---------106:26----------
and and so like no matter like how good


---------106:29----------
of a find you get in the bargain bin


---------106:31----------
as long as you remember oh i got this


---------106:33----------
from the bargain bin you're gonna


---------106:35----------
actually like


---------106:37----------
you know it's like a little bit scuffed


---------106:40----------
got it on discount whereas no like


---------106:43----------
it's a steal dude it's like worth every


---------106:46----------
penny and worth way more than i paid for


---------106:48----------
it


---------106:48----------
your value is actually far above what


---------106:51----------
you estimate it to be


---------106:54----------
and so going forward i i encourage you


---------106:57----------
to really like


---------106:58----------
you know ask yourself when you as you


---------106:59----------
start to introspect and you start to


---------107:01----------
feel these negative emotions like


---------107:03----------
does this come back to you know i'm not


---------107:06----------
valuable


---------107:11----------
and and to try to see and this is going


---------107:13----------
to be the really hard part is like there


---------107:15----------
are going to be times in your life where


---------107:16----------
you


---------107:17----------
are valuable because and i think you've


---------107:18----------
started to discover this


---------107:20----------
but even if i tell you you're gonna push


---------107:22----------
back like when you show up


---------107:24----------
in group like you help people


---------107:29----------
what do you think about that


---------107:37----------
i don't


---------107:40----------
it's so hard oh my god you told me


---------107:43----------
earlier in this conversation that i


---------107:45----------
realize now that i can still make


---------107:46----------
contributions


---------107:49----------
yeah but it's but yeah right i don't


---------107:52----------
know if those contributions help


---------107:54----------
necessarily yes beautiful right i make


---------107:57----------
contributions but oh they're not as


---------107:59----------
valuable as other people's


---------108:03----------
it's so hard to just be like no you're


---------108:07----------
you do good damn you


---------108:11----------
and that's me bludgeoning you so it's


---------108:14----------
it's gonna take time so be patient with


---------108:16----------
yourself faster be patient okay


---------108:18----------
like it's fine to have that voice it's


---------108:19----------
fine to like no matter what we send it


---------108:21----------
just see how it's like always gonna like


---------108:24----------
contort and twist and just like devalue


---------108:27----------
like because like that


---------108:28----------
it just doesn't compute in your mind


---------108:30----------
right like it doesn't compute in your


---------108:32----------
mind that you could show up somewhere


---------108:33----------
like have an impact on another human


---------108:35----------
being


---------108:36----------
it's like um it's like i'm in the matrix


---------108:39----------
i'm neo-dodging the bullets


---------108:41----------
absolutely dude and just like the matrix


---------108:44----------
it's completely op


---------108:46----------
it's like boston it's completely unfair


---------108:49----------
to those of us who are sending you the


---------108:51----------
bullets of appreciation


---------108:54----------
it's like we don't stand a chance


---------108:56----------
against that man


---------108:59----------
yeah you're dodging you're really good


---------109:00----------
and i i think you know you you do this a


---------109:02----------
lot right so then the last thing that


---------109:04----------
i'll kind of leave you with


---------109:06----------
is this sort of idea of like what amount


---------109:09----------
to blame


---------109:11----------
and just be careful about where you


---------109:13----------
assign it and how you protect people


---------109:15----------
because like


---------109:15----------
dude come on man like i i'm pretty sure


---------109:18----------
that so chad is learning this blows my


---------109:19----------
mind


---------109:20----------
i'm pretty sure that when when you


---------109:22----------
literally said that your stepdad


---------109:24----------
you know had a lot of challenges like


---------109:26----------
everyone knew that abuse was coming


---------109:31----------
like you know like we've heard it enough


---------109:33----------
times


---------109:35----------
right like let's not even get started on


---------109:37----------
your mom and like we just had an


---------109:38----------
interview like on wednesday about you


---------109:41----------
know


---------109:42----------
blaming the good parent for


---------109:46----------
or trying really hard not to hold the


---------109:48----------
good parent responsible for like


---------109:50----------
letting the bad parent do things to you


---------109:55----------
and just to add to that i think in the


---------109:57----------
end she did


---------109:58----------
start to stand up for us you know


---------110:02----------
um there was a breakup and then he moved


---------110:05----------
out for a bit


---------110:06----------
and then they went to a therapist and


---------110:08----------
tried to work through it


---------110:10----------
and they got back together and so


---------110:13----------
there's definitely growth on her part


---------110:15----------
too yeah


---------110:16----------
yeah good what does that mean for you


---------110:24----------
don't know right so yes i'm still here


---------110:27----------
yeah so like there's a part of me that


---------110:28----------
wants to say too little too late


---------110:31----------
but you'll push back against that right


---------110:35----------
i think you said that last time too


---------110:39----------
what was i talking about your mom nope


---------110:42----------
well you're talking about


---------110:43----------
that relationship same thing okay pretty


---------110:47----------
much


---------110:48----------
anyway we don't have to get into it but


---------110:50----------
that's that's where like i think so


---------110:51----------
asriel i think like dude you're well on


---------110:53----------
your journey it sounds like you've made


---------110:55----------
a lot of external change


---------110:57----------
and and what i really think is that


---------111:00----------
something tells me that i don't know if


---------111:03----------
you're interested in a romantic


---------111:04----------
relationship if you're in a romantic


---------111:06----------
relationship but like this is the kind


---------111:08----------
of thing that as you start to work on i


---------111:09----------
think a romantic relationship will


---------111:11----------
become


---------111:12----------
more available and also like easier to


---------111:15----------
exist within


---------111:19----------
yeah but but i think when it comes to


---------111:21----------
dating like if people who


---------111:23----------
feel intrinsically like they have very


---------111:25----------
little value have a lot of trouble


---------111:27----------
in dating because it's very confusing


---------111:30----------
when someone seems to be genuinely


---------111:31----------
interested in them


---------111:33----------
and then they're just like they don't


---------111:34----------
know like like you know that when i tell


---------111:36----------
you something and you like you just


---------111:37----------
can't


---------111:38----------
you just gotta say button and like so


---------111:41----------
that


---------111:42----------
so so this is the kind of thing where i


---------111:43----------
think like continue growing man and just


---------111:45----------
kind of notice this like


---------111:47----------
you know continue making the world a


---------111:48----------
better place as you are


---------111:50----------
and like you know learn how to be proud


---------111:53----------
of yourself


---------111:55----------
and then if one day you know


---------111:58----------
if you grow a pair you can ask your dad


---------112:00----------
if he's proud of you


---------112:04----------
and it may be a hard question that asks


---------112:06----------
and it may be a hard question to answer


---------112:08----------
but we'll get there one day


---------112:14----------
i was joking about growing a pair i


---------112:15----------
think you're actually very brave


---------112:19----------
is it was a twitch memeing i just wanted


---------112:22----------
to clarify i wasn't sure if


---------112:24----------
i would be interpreted the wrong way


---------112:25----------
because it just occurred to me that


---------112:26----------
maybe with the way that you interpret


---------112:28----------
things


---------112:29----------
you know thoughts


---------112:32----------
questions before we wrap up


---------112:36----------
i think that's about it in regards to


---------112:39----------
their relationships


---------112:40----------
i'm not i don't have one and i'm not


---------112:42----------
currently looking


---------112:44----------
i think there's definitely a lot of


---------112:47----------
fear and confusion around that as well


---------112:49----------
so yeah i think you're right


---------112:51----------
yep so i i think as you work through


---------112:54----------
this


---------112:54----------
the relationship will come


---------112:58----------
so don't don't worry about it just keep


---------113:00----------
walking what you're walking and i'm


---------113:01----------
confident


---------113:02----------
that you'll end up happy


---------113:05----------
and in a place where you're you know


---------113:08----------
you're good


---------113:11----------
all right do you want to meditate


---------113:18----------
we can try it i've done some of your


---------113:21----------
meditations on previous streams but


---------113:23----------
i haven't noticed it have much effect on


---------113:26----------
me


---------113:28----------
would you can you help me understand


---------113:31----------
what your experience of those


---------113:32----------
meditations


---------113:33----------
is


---------113:38----------
i think uh sometimes maybe i feel


---------113:42----------
something a little bit but it's


---------113:46----------
like like i know sometimes chat mentions


---------113:49----------
you know they had this crazy experience


---------113:51----------
and for me it's like


---------113:53----------
i don't know nothing really changed that


---------113:55----------
much i still


---------113:56----------
feel the same way okay maybe my thoughts


---------113:59----------
are a little less


---------114:00----------
but what what usually happens when you


---------114:04----------
meditate what's your experience of


---------114:06----------
meditating


---------114:08----------
i think maybe i get a little bit calmer


---------114:11----------
um


---------114:14----------
maybe a little more relaxed but nothing


---------114:20----------
no


---------114:23----------
do you think when you meditate


---------114:31----------
sometimes i guess it depends on the


---------114:34----------
meditation


---------114:38----------
all right let me think


---------114:46----------
i was thinking um if you had anything to


---------114:50----------
say


---------114:52----------
when i get extremely anxious or


---------114:53----------
something something that could like


---------114:55----------
ground me


---------114:56----------
in that moment so i don't get carried


---------115:02----------
away


---------115:04----------
what happens when you get extremely


---------115:07----------
anxious


---------115:08----------
tell me about that


---------115:12----------
i think i just like my mind wanders i


---------115:15----------
start thinking about everything


---------115:17----------
you know i try to prepare as much as i


---------115:19----------
can i get really stressed


---------115:22----------
um that's where


---------115:25----------
you know i have that nervous meltdown in


---------115:27----------
front of the job site


---------115:30----------
that's where i try to suppress it with


---------115:32----------
frustration towards myself


---------115:35----------
um okay have you tried


---------115:38----------
practicing kapalbhati or the rapid


---------115:41----------
exhalations


---------115:42----------
have you done that before


---------115:46----------
yeah i think so so


---------115:50----------
i would say and how many


---------115:53----------
okay so let's for people for whom


---------115:55----------
meditation hasn't really worked on


---------115:57----------
stream let's just go through a couple of


---------115:59----------
basics okay


---------116:00----------
the first is that meditation is a skill


---------116:03----------
that sometimes requires practice


---------116:06----------
so what we try to do on stream so


---------116:09----------
the reason we teach different meditation


---------116:11----------
techniques on stream is because


---------116:13----------
different people will naturally


---------116:15----------
hopefully have a good experience in


---------116:17----------
meditation


---------116:18----------
using a particular technique the


---------116:21----------
challenge is that


---------116:22----------
um you know when it comes to the scope


---------116:24----------
of techniques that i teach


---------116:26----------
i teach probably like 10 to 15 percent


---------116:29----------
of what i would use


---------116:31----------
with people that i work with on a


---------116:32----------
regular basis


---------116:34----------
and that's because these are the


---------116:35----------
techniques which are like easy


---------116:38----------
accessible and you can't really screw up


---------116:41----------
they also so there there's like a whole


---------116:43----------
host of other techniques which are


---------116:45----------
you know more dangerous but are also


---------116:48----------
more powerful


---------116:49----------
there's a whole host of techniques that


---------116:51----------
require more guidance


---------116:53----------
or like subsequent amounts of teaching


---------116:55----------
to really anchor people into practice so


---------116:57----------
we're really kind of handicapped


---------116:59----------
in some ways um


---------117:03----------
so what i would say for


---------117:06----------
you is that we should practice


---------117:10----------
kapalbhati again let's give it another


---------117:12----------
shot


---------117:13----------
i'll actually guide you through it so


---------117:16----------
it's going to be rapid exhalations and


---------117:17----------
that's mainly because


---------117:19----------
it's a physiologic technique so like


---------117:22----------
when you're feeling


---------117:22----------
anxious like that your sympathetic


---------117:24----------
nervous system is going to be active


---------117:26----------
so you're going to have adrenaline and


---------117:27----------
things like that so there's a really


---------117:29----------
interesting way to rein in your


---------117:31----------
sympathetic nervous system which is to


---------117:33----------
become actually


---------117:34----------
temporarily hypocarbic so what we're


---------117:38----------
going to do is rapidly exhale


---------117:40----------
which is going to decrease the co2 level


---------117:43----------
and when your co2 level drops that


---------117:45----------
actually is going to change your


---------117:46----------
respiratory drive and really slow you


---------117:48----------
down


---------117:51----------
so hopefully it'll kind of crack the


---------117:54----------
overthinking cycle


---------117:56----------
by like literally sort of like shutting


---------117:58----------
off your mind


---------118:01----------
over time yeah go ahead that's like the


---------118:05----------
one where it's sort of like


---------118:07----------
hyperventilating


---------118:08----------
you know isn't it yes exactly have you


---------118:11----------
done that one before


---------118:13----------
sounds like you have yeah yeah i didn't


---------118:16----------
think


---------118:17----------
once or twice so so the other thing for


---------118:19----------
whatever reason i don't know why this is


---------118:21----------
actually i do know why this is but it's


---------118:23----------
so people will say like even when they


---------118:25----------
watch meditation on stream


---------118:27----------
and then when i actually do it with them


---------118:29----------
on stream that sometimes it has a


---------118:31----------
differential effect


---------118:33----------
not quite sure why that is i have


---------118:34----------
theories or things written in ancient


---------118:37----------
texts


---------118:38----------
um but you know for now let's just give


---------118:41----------
it a shot because i think and i would


---------118:42----------
just encourage you to practice the


---------118:44----------
technique because it's sort of like


---------118:45----------
you know swimming isn't great exercise


---------118:47----------
the first time you get in the water you


---------118:48----------
have to like learn how to swim


---------118:50----------
and then it can be a very healthy form


---------118:52----------
of exercise


---------118:56----------
long term what i would strongly


---------118:59----------
recommend asriel is you probably need to


---------119:01----------
do some kind of


---------119:02----------
sun gulp oriented meditation so i would


---------119:05----------
say if you have a set of prayer beads


---------119:07----------
fantastic if not get one


---------119:10----------
and like this is one of those things


---------119:12----------
where you need to start like internally


---------119:14----------
wiring


---------119:17----------
you're like rewiring like the way that


---------119:19----------
you think about yourself


---------119:22----------
okay um


---------119:24----------
[Music]


---------119:25----------
and i'm trying to think about so there's


---------119:27----------
some kind of sun gulp around worth


---------119:30----------
but let me just think about


---------119:47----------
let me just think


---------119:55----------
yeah i i'm gonna have to think about


---------119:57----------
what that sun gulp will be


---------119:59----------
i may dm you if it comes to all right


---------120:04----------
yeah i am i do have a bracelet i can't


---------120:08----------
there it is it's not really


---------120:13----------
it's not really a prayer beads


---------120:16----------
i don't know get through here get prayer


---------120:19----------
bees


---------120:21----------
all right yeah let me just think about


---------120:25----------
let's do kapalbhati today and let me


---------120:26----------
just give me just like 30 seconds to try


---------120:28----------
to come up with some cup and then i'll


---------120:35----------
that's not it


---------120:47----------
yeah i i can't think of anything in this


---------120:48----------
moment but sometimes i


---------120:50----------
i think of these things actually when i


---------120:52----------
meditate


---------120:53----------
it it's just


---------121:02----------
yeah let me just i'm drawing a blank


---------121:05----------
it's like right at the edge


---------121:08----------
i feel it it's just not coming to so


---------121:10----------
let's stick with kaupalpathi okay


---------121:12----------
let me just send you a random dm at some


---------121:14----------
point though


---------121:15----------
um all right so


---------121:18----------
so with kapalbhati you may want to blow


---------121:20----------
your nose


---------121:22----------
we've got boogies and stuff if not gg


---------121:26----------
all right one sec


---------121:56----------
okay so sit up straight


---------122:00----------
and remember we're gonna do abdominal


---------122:03----------
breathing


---------122:04----------
so do you remember how to do so for


---------122:06----------
people who need a guide what we're going


---------122:08----------
to do is


---------122:08----------
as we inhale we're going to push the


---------122:10----------
stomach out


---------122:12----------
so expand your abdomen


---------122:16----------
and as you exhale pull the abdomen in


---------122:21----------
contract good so breathe in and pull the


---------122:24----------
abdomen out


---------122:28----------
big big belly and then exhale


---------122:32----------
and then let the abdomen come in


---------122:37----------
okay now we're going to do the


---------122:40----------
kapalbhati part so we're going to take a


---------122:42----------
deep breath and it's going to be


---------122:43----------
rapid exhalations i'll demonstrate for


---------122:46----------
about nine rounds okay so i'll take a


---------122:48----------
deep breath


---------122:48----------
in


---------122:50----------
[Laughter]


---------122:57----------
okay and when you do it what i want you


---------122:59----------
to do is focus on your stomach


---------123:01----------
and you can like almost like spasm that


---------123:04----------
stomach and push that air out


---------123:06----------
okay so let's have you do it let me just


---------123:10----------
observe you so deep breath in and do


---------123:11----------
like nine breaths


---------123:22----------
good perfect okay so now we're gonna do


---------123:25----------
it together we're gonna do


---------123:28----------
let's start with 15 okay so it's going


---------123:30----------
to be 15 breaths


---------123:31----------
there's going to be a period of silence


---------123:34----------
where you're going to just


---------123:35----------
let your breathing do what it wants to


---------123:38----------
don't necessarily


---------123:39----------
try to think but also don't get too


---------123:42----------
tense about


---------123:43----------
you know pushing thoughts out of your


---------123:44----------
head just let them come and let them go


---------123:46----------
and just sit


---------123:46----------
in the space post meditation okay we'll


---------123:49----------
do 15 breaths we'll sit for about 30


---------123:51----------
seconds


---------123:52----------
i'll bring you back after that okay so


---------123:55----------
take a deep breath in and begin


---------124:37----------
all right you can leave your eyes closed


---------124:39----------
now we're going to go to


---------124:41----------
20 so 20 breaths


---------124:44----------
followed by a period of silence deep


---------124:48----------
breath in


---------124:50----------
and begin


---------125:52----------
okay now we're gonna go up to


---------126:48----------
when you're ready go ahead come on back


---------126:59----------
of course what was that like for you


---------127:08----------
i didn't notice that uh maybe i got a


---------127:12----------
little lightheaded at the end


---------127:15----------
which i guess was the point


---------127:19----------
um i don't know i feel calmer


---------127:25----------
yeah so i'd practice i'd say 33 breaths


---------127:30----------
three times so you want to work your


---------127:33----------
way up to like 33 exhalations maybe a


---------127:36----------
minute


---------127:37----------
or two in between for a total of like


---------127:39----------
somewhere around five to seven minutes


---------127:41----------
of practice


---------127:43----------
okay i might have um


---------127:46----------
messed up the beginning because i


---------127:48----------
thought you meant like 15 like


---------127:50----------
breathe in and do the out nine times


---------127:53----------
four or fifteen times oh that's fine


---------127:57----------
i mean yeah that wasn't that wasn't what


---------127:59----------
i was saying but you know that's a lot


---------128:01----------
which is fine yeah so like i'd say 33


---------128:04----------
exhalations for


---------128:05----------
one set and do three sets


---------128:08----------
like raps and sets so 33 reps


---------128:12----------
one is one set and then you know if


---------128:15----------
you're starting to


---------128:16----------
have like help if you're starting to


---------128:18----------
feel anxious


---------128:20----------
you know if you find yourself once again


---------128:21----------
at like that job kind of situation i'd


---------128:23----------
start with kapalbhati


---------128:25----------
you can add on alternate nostril


---------128:27----------
breathing afterward for about five to


---------128:29----------
seven minutes and hopefully that'll calm


---------128:31----------
you down unless you're having like a


---------128:32----------
truly clinical panic attack


---------128:34----------
in which case that may be insufficient


---------128:36----------
but it still helps


---------128:38----------
okay and then just you know calm it down


---------128:41----------
and then by the time you get your prayer


---------128:42----------
beads i will hopefully have something


---------128:44----------
for you


---------128:47----------
so go find some and if it takes you six


---------128:49----------
months then i've got six months if it


---------128:50----------
takes you


---------128:51----------
a month then that's how long i've got


---------128:54----------
okay uh what are the requirements for


---------128:57----------
the prayer beads like would i need


---------128:59----------
actual ones


---------129:00----------
or yeah so i would get some kind of


---------129:04----------
set of like any religious tradition


---------129:07----------
prayer beats so like if you


---------129:10----------
have a catholic background you can get a


---------129:13----------
rosary


---------129:14----------
if you don't i would recommend something


---------129:16----------
from like the meditative traditions so


---------129:18----------
like buddhism or hindu or whatever you


---------129:20----------
can get like amala from


---------129:22----------
you know wherever um


---------129:26----------
you know be careful about the


---------129:27----------
fashionable ones


---------129:29----------
so i know it's kind of hard but try to


---------129:30----------
get something that feels a little bit


---------129:32----------
authentic ideally if there's actually


---------129:34----------
like


---------129:34----------
i don't know where you live but if


---------129:35----------
there's like a buddhist monastery or


---------129:37----------
temple somewhere near you


---------129:40----------
i would call them and say hey do you


---------129:41----------
guys have like a place that i can get


---------129:43----------
some prayer beads


---------129:45----------
um maybe we just need to


---------129:48----------
note to self okay


---------129:54----------
gotta think about getting those for


---------129:56----------
y'all but


---------129:57----------
um but that's that's what i would


---------130:00----------
recommend


---------130:04----------
yeah i yeah


---------130:08----------
and then you can abduct me into the


---------130:09----------
cults yeah


---------130:11----------
we will induct it the abduction comes


---------130:15----------
for the people who are not willing to be


---------130:17----------
inducted


---------130:18----------
so you're okay the abduction comes for


---------130:21----------
your siblings


---------130:26----------
abduction and induction very different


---------130:29----------
very different


---------130:29----------
right so asriel thanks a lot for coming


---------130:32----------
