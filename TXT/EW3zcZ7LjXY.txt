---------00:00----------
how would you help high achieving people


---------00:01----------
like pre-meds pre-law pre farm who


---------00:03----------
struggle with self-worth is a certain


---------00:05----------
meditation you would describe I got


---------00:07----------
drunk with a lot of pre meds that we


---------00:08----------
could go and they were telling these


---------00:09----------
stories of therapy drugs with not


---------00:11----------
success they were happy with they were


---------00:13----------
struggling with their issues okay so


---------00:20----------
here's the thing so a lot of times so I


---------00:23----------
had a buddy who went to Harvard Law


---------00:28----------
School and I asked him like after his


---------00:31----------
first semester at Harvard Law School


---------00:32----------
like how he was enjoying it and he


---------00:34----------
actually said like it's kind of crappy


---------00:35----------
and I said like what makes what makes


---------00:38----------
Harvard Law School so crappy and he's


---------00:40----------
like one of the work like the people are


---------00:42----------
just awful and I said what do you mean


---------00:43----------
the people are awful and he says one of


---------00:46----------
the worst things you can do to someone


---------00:47----------
who has always been the best in their


---------00:50----------
class is to make them feel average and


---------00:54----------
so what happens with a lot of these high


---------00:56----------
achieving people is that they're used to


---------00:59----------
being high achieving like in middle


---------01:00----------
school they had straight A's in high


---------01:02----------
school they had very good GPAs and so


---------01:04----------
they end up in in like a competitive


---------01:08----------
college right you go to like an Ivy


---------01:09----------
League school or something like that and


---------01:11----------
you're with a bunch of other pre-meds


---------01:12----------
and then suddenly you have this identity


---------01:15----------
built on being smart and smarter than


---------01:17----------
everyone else and suddenly you're


---------01:19----------
[ __ ] average and the funny thing is


---------01:21----------
the more high achieving you are the


---------01:23----------
worse the problem becomes because I want


---------01:25----------
you guys to envision someone who ends up


---------01:27----------
at Harvard Medical School so not only


---------01:28----------
were they've at the top of their class


---------01:30----------
in middle school and then in high school


---------01:33----------
and then in college when they went to


---------01:35----------
their Ivy League university and then


---------01:37----------
when they wind up because you you rise


---------01:39----------
higher and higher and higher and you're


---------01:42----------
always the best and then you end up in a


---------01:43----------
place like HMS and then suddenly your


---------01:45----------
[ __ ] average so you've been used to


---------01:48----------
not being average for even longer and


---------01:50----------
it's becoming even no greater part of


---------01:51----------
your identity so the biggest problems


---------01:53----------
you see in self-worth or with the people


---------01:55----------
who are the highest achieving the higher


---------01:58----------
achievement goes the bigger the problem


---------02:00----------
is with self-worth it's that simple


---------02:03----------
right


---------02:05----------
that's simple so what do you do about it


---------02:11----------
well that's a great question so I think


---------02:14----------
the best thing to do a couple of things


---------02:16----------
one is to understand that a lot of


---------02:18----------
people's identity is based on comparison


---------02:21----------
so your sense of self worth is in


---------02:24----------
reflection to the people around you that


---------02:28----------
needs to change you need to start to


---------02:30----------
have an identity that's based on


---------02:32----------
yourself in isolation not in relation to


---------02:35----------
someone else and if you think about


---------02:37----------
people who are like falling behind right


---------02:40----------
so a lot of people that I work with a


---------02:42----------
lot of people on Twitch gamers things


---------02:44----------
like that are upset because they're


---------02:46----------
behind so like I remember when I start I


---------02:49----------
started medical school at the age of 27


---------02:51----------
which means that the people that I


---------02:53----------
entered school with who were pre-med


---------02:55----------
like when we were twenty I had a group


---------02:57----------
of people who were pre-med right my


---------02:58----------
friends from pre-med classes and then at


---------03:01----------
22 they graduated from college and they


---------03:03----------
go to medical school and they finish


---------03:04----------
medical school at 26 so I remember when


---------03:08----------
I was 26 years old and they were moving


---------03:10----------
on Ravis residency and graduating they


---------03:12----------
would ask me hey man what are you up to


---------03:14----------
nowadays and when they're graduating


---------03:15----------
from medical school I would say I'm


---------03:18----------
applying to medical school I didn't even


---------03:20----------
tell them that because that's [ __ ]


---------03:21----------
it's so shaming six years ago we were in


---------03:26----------
the same shoes and now I'm still


---------03:28----------
applying to the school that you are


---------03:30----------
graduating from that's the comparative


---------03:33----------
mindset and then you feel shame right


---------03:37----------
and so you just got to stop comparing


---------03:42----------
yourself there meditation techniques


---------03:43----------
around that will do that today okay yeah


---------03:51----------
so then then


---------03:52----------
the second part of this question is that


---------03:54----------
they were telling me stories of therapy


---------03:56----------
drugs etc that we're not succeeding yeah


---------03:59----------
because like a drug is not gonna fix


---------04:01----------
that you guys get that like if you're


---------04:02----------
used to being the smartest kid in the


---------04:04----------
room and that's what your identity has


---------04:06----------
been based on since you were the age of


---------04:07----------
10 and suddenly at the age of 22 the


---------04:11----------
entire person that you are gets called


---------04:13----------
into question because your average a


---------04:16----------
medication is not going to fix that it's


---------04:19----------
just not going to fix it so like a


---------04:25----------
medication can help with some of the


---------04:27----------
symptoms of that but it's not gonna fix


---------04:30----------
it


---------04:30----------
so what you've got to do is give people


---------04:32----------
a sense of worth or a sense of identity


---------04:35----------
that is based on themselves as opposed


---------04:38----------
to not on comparison and if you could do


---------04:40----------
that they're gonna be fine
