---------00:00----------
all right so here's the problem with


---------00:01----------
weed you know so as a psychiatrist i


---------00:03----------
recognize that there are medical uses


---------00:05----------
for marijuana


---------00:07----------
um


---------00:08----------
i think the most convincing


---------00:11----------
medical reason i've seen for using


---------00:13----------
marijuana is to help people with opioid


---------00:14----------
addiction that's kind of


---------00:16----------
counterintuitive


---------00:18----------
but it does seem to work well


---------00:20----------
because there are a lot of physiologic


---------00:21----------
problems that happen with happen with


---------00:23----------
heavy opiate use that sort of get better


---------00:25----------
and i think on balance it's a good thing


---------00:26----------
to do you know has to be prescribed and


---------00:28----------
stuff like that


---------00:30----------
the basic issue with marijuana you have


---------00:32----------
to understand how marijuana works in the


---------00:33----------
brain so the first thing is that


---------00:35----------
marijuana works on these things called


---------00:37----------
anandamide receptors so the anandamide


---------00:40----------
receptor


---------00:41----------
was coined by an indian guy i assume i


---------00:43----------
think he was indian because he named it


---------00:44----------
after the sanskrit word for bliss


---------00:47----------
so he was like what there are these


---------00:48----------
bliss receptors in our brain and that's


---------00:50----------
what like marijuana acts on


---------00:53----------
so a lot of people think that marijuana


---------00:55----------
acts like makes people stupider right so


---------00:58----------
people say like oh i've been smoking pot


---------00:59----------
my entire life like my accused fine so


---------01:01----------
marijuana doesn't work like that what


---------01:02----------
marijuana does i think is far more


---------01:04----------
insidious


---------01:05----------
so if you look at the cannabinoid system


---------01:07----------
in the brain it involves habit formation


---------01:09----------
and motivation


---------01:11----------
so like once a how can i say this early


---------01:15----------
on in the brain


---------01:16----------
when you are reinforcing a behavior it


---------01:19----------
is the dopamine system that reinforces a


---------01:21----------
behavior


---------01:23----------
once you have a habit formed the primary


---------01:25----------
neurotransmitter is no longer dopamine


---------01:28----------
it's


---------01:29----------
cannabinoids


---------01:31----------
so for example like the first time i


---------01:32----------
brush my teeth i may really enjoy it or


---------01:34----------
let's talk about video game addiction


---------01:35----------
for example


---------01:37----------
so the first time i play video game it's


---------01:38----------
a lot of fun i have it's dopaminergic i


---------01:41----------
enjoy it then i want to play again and i


---------01:43----------
want to play again and each time i get


---------01:44----------
less dopamine less dopamine less


---------01:46----------
dopamine and if you guys have been


---------01:47----------
addicted to video games you understand


---------01:49----------
at some point you cross this critical


---------01:50----------
threshold


---------01:52----------
where you keep playing the game


---------01:54----------
but you stop having fun


---------01:57----------
and it's like what the hell is going on


---------01:58----------
at that point why are you even doing it


---------02:00----------
if you're no it's no longer even


---------02:01----------
rewarding


---------02:02----------
so the interesting thing is if you


---------02:03----------
understand neuroscience there's like


---------02:05----------
actually a good reason for that and


---------02:07----------
that's that like the shift of the


---------02:09----------
behavior


---------02:10----------
moves from a reward circuit to a


---------02:12----------
habituated circuit


---------02:14----------
so habits in the brain are governed by a


---------02:17----------
different circuit than like the dopamine


---------02:19----------
system so the nucleus accumbens


---------02:21----------
mesolimbic system those are both


---------02:22----------
dopaminergic systems that involve


---------02:25----------
pleasure followed by behavioral


---------02:26----------
reinforcement


---------02:28----------
at some point you move into the


---------02:29----------
autopilot circuits which are different


---------02:31----------
circuits of the brain and once you enter


---------02:33----------
an autopilot it's not like there's any


---------02:36----------
reward right so if you think about


---------02:39----------
brushing your teeth there's like no


---------02:41----------
reward there anymore right even if you


---------02:43----------
think about dogs for example when you're


---------02:45----------
training a dog at the very beginning in


---------02:47----------
order to get them to fetch you have to


---------02:48----------
give them a reward because there's no


---------02:50----------
inherent dopaminergic reward for


---------02:52----------
fetching a ball or a stick so you throw


---------02:56----------
the ball when the dog brings it you give


---------02:57----------
them a treat boom they get a hit of


---------02:59----------
dopamine you do it again boom they get a


---------03:01----------
hit of dopamine boom they get get a hit


---------03:03----------
of dopamine you do that 10 times 20


---------03:05----------
times 30 times their brain becomes


---------03:07----------
habituated to it it enters kind of the


---------03:10----------
cannabinoid system and you no longer


---------03:12----------
need to provide a dopamine dopaminergic


---------03:15----------
reward to engage in the behavior you all


---------03:17----------
get that


---------03:18----------
gaming is the same once you move over to


---------03:20----------
the cannabinoid system then it becomes a


---------03:22----------
habit then it becomes hard to break


---------03:24----------
despite the fact that it's not even fun


---------03:27----------
so why is marijuana a problem


---------03:30----------
i don't know exactly how but marijuana


---------03:32----------
screws up that circuit


---------03:34----------
marijuana makes it hard my observation


---------03:36----------
clinical observation okay so now like we


---------03:38----------
know that basic neuroscience but we


---------03:40----------
don't know that that neuroscience


---------03:42----------
actually translates to human behavior


---------03:45----------
i haven't seen those studies yet i don't


---------03:46----------
think our stuff is sophisticated enough


---------03:49----------
but clinically what i've seen is when


---------03:50----------
people use pot they fall into this this


---------03:52----------
weird habitual non-enjoyment way easier


---------03:55----------
they like fall into bad habits and it's


---------03:58----------
really really hard to get them out of


---------03:59----------
those habits


---------04:00----------
and what i've discovered is that if i


---------04:02----------
can get them sober from marijuana their


---------04:04----------
ability to change their habits becomes


---------04:06----------
way easier


---------04:13----------
okay so someone's saying


---------04:17----------
okay so sorry for me throwing out a lot


---------04:19----------
of words


---------04:20----------
and you're confused


---------04:23----------
do you all get that or not


---------04:28----------
so here's a quick summary


---------04:30----------
our brain has two circuits


---------04:32----------
one is a reward circuit


---------04:35----------
that we release dopamine which allows us


---------04:37----------
to feel pleasure and reinforces a


---------04:39----------
behavior so for example i'm drinking


---------04:41----------
this iced coffee right now and it tastes


---------04:44----------
good


---------04:45----------
[Music]


---------04:46----------
so when i drink it i get a hit of


---------04:48----------
dopamine and it's like oh i want more


---------04:50----------
over time if you look at people who


---------04:52----------
develop addictive behaviors


---------04:54----------
they still engage in the behavior but


---------04:56----------
they don't actually feel any pleasure


---------04:58----------
from it


---------05:00----------
the reason for that is because we have a


---------05:01----------
separate circuit of the brain that


---------05:03----------
starts to take over which is the habit


---------05:05----------
circuit


---------05:06----------
so once something becomes a habit it no


---------05:08----------
longer gives us a reward


---------05:11----------
but it's still we're still driven to do


---------05:13----------
it even though we don't enjoy it anymore


---------05:15----------
so when we get addicted to a video game


---------05:17----------
and we just start like playing video


---------05:18----------
games and like we don't even enjoy them


---------05:20----------
anymore that's a problem of our habit


---------05:22----------
circuit getting messed up and the habit


---------05:23----------
circuit's primary neurotransmitter is an


---------05:26----------
endocannabinoid


---------05:27----------
or a cannabinoid it's an endo means


---------05:30----------
it's basically internal thc right it's a


---------05:33----------
cannabis compound like neurotransmitter


---------05:36----------
that is built within us so when people


---------05:38----------
use marijuana the biggest problem that i


---------05:41----------
see is it becomes hard for them to break


---------05:43----------
habits i'm not quite sure how it works


---------05:46----------
but i suspect that it has something to


---------05:47----------
do with the fact that the cannabinoid


---------05:49----------
receptors in the brain the marijuana


---------05:51----------
receptors in the brain have something to


---------05:53----------
do with habit formation and habit


---------05:55----------
execution


---------05:56----------
and when people smoke pot it's just hard


---------05:58----------
for them to make changes in their life


---------06:02----------
is that better


---------06:14----------
yeah so people are asking um do you have


---------06:16----------
any advice for medical cannabis users


---------06:18----------
that's where like i think you should


---------06:19----------
talk to your doctor because the risks


---------06:21----------
and benefits


---------06:24----------
are like individualized right so like


---------06:26----------
when i think about using medical


---------06:27----------
cannabis i look at an individual person


---------06:30----------
i think about okay what are the risks


---------06:31----------
what are the benefits what do we gain


---------06:33----------
what do we lose and for each individual


---------06:35----------
person or situation it's going to be


---------06:36----------
slightly different


---------06:41----------
i quit we three weeks ago and i still


---------06:43----------
get cold sweats and very vivid dreams is


---------06:45----------
that normal i'm not sure


---------06:47----------
to be honest


---------06:48----------
so that too is something that you should


---------06:50----------
talk to your doctor about because


---------06:52----------
cold sweats and vivid dreams


---------06:54----------
how can i say this


---------06:56----------
so you guys understand that like a


---------06:58----------
substance causes particular changes


---------07:01----------
but the substance acts within an in


---------07:03----------
within an individual body


---------07:06----------
which means that like


---------07:10----------
you know so the reason how does that


---------07:12----------
make sense like there's an individual so


---------07:14----------
if you talk about the effects of


---------07:16----------
marijuana


---------07:17----------
there is no such thing technically as


---------07:19----------
the effects of marijuana because the


---------07:21----------
marijuana has to act within a human


---------07:23----------
being so the effects of marijuana are


---------07:26----------
going to be filtered through an


---------07:27----------
individual human being


---------07:29----------
so when we talk about the effects of


---------07:30----------
marijuana basically what we're doing is


---------07:33----------
averaging the effects within a thousand


---------07:35----------
individuals and sort of saying this is


---------07:37----------
the effect of the drug which is


---------07:38----------
scientifically valid but in terms of any


---------07:41----------
individual case there's going to be a


---------07:42----------
slightly different presentation because


---------07:44----------
your receptors your metabolism your


---------07:46----------
brain is going to be different which


---------07:48----------
means i can take one compound


---------07:50----------
and put it in a thousand people and


---------07:52----------
it'll act slightly differently that's


---------07:54----------
why if you look at like you know


---------07:56----------
protocols for medication


---------07:59----------
it's not like there's one antidepressant


---------08:01----------
that works equally for all people


---------08:03----------
we have 30 antidepressants that each


---------08:05----------
have different efficacy within different


---------08:06----------
people


---------08:09----------
and so that's what's tricky about


---------08:11----------
medicine it's also what makes it fun


---------08:13----------
because it's not like there's a


---------08:14----------
one-size-fits-all solution


---------08:16----------
so in terms of your particular


---------08:18----------
relationship to a substance there's


---------08:19----------
going to be a lot of individuation there


---------08:37----------
you
