---------00:15----------
so we talked a little bit about


---------00:17----------
open-ended problem solving and


---------00:19----------
closed-ended problem solving and how


---------00:21----------
gamers actually how games shape them but


---------00:25----------
being very good at analytical thinking


---------00:27----------
with a defined solution so they're very


---------00:30----------
good at things like puzzles where you


---------00:33----------
sort of have a particular sandbox to


---------00:36----------
work in and a gamer is really good at


---------00:38----------
figuring out how to get from point A to


---------00:40----------
point Z if you show them where point A


---------00:42----------
is and if you show them where point Z is


---------00:44----------
they struggle with open-ended


---------00:46----------
problem-solving which is a problem that


---------00:48----------
you kind of don't know where the end


---------00:51----------
point is for example finding a job like


---------00:54----------
how do you know if the job that you


---------00:55----------
found is good enough could you find a


---------00:58----------
job that paid you a little bit more


---------00:59----------
could you find a job that had a better


---------01:01----------
boss like how do you know when that ends


---------01:03----------
how do you beat the game of finding a


---------01:06----------
job because you don't really know what


---------01:07----------
the end point is a lot of gamers think


---------01:10----------
that the reason they struggle with


---------01:12----------
open-ended problems like finding a job


---------01:14----------
or finding a girlfriend is because you


---------01:17----------
guys think you're lazy and if you


---------01:19----------
weren't lazy then everything would be


---------01:21----------
easier in life and you're just someone


---------01:22----------
who drew the short straw and you're lazy


---------01:25----------
that's actually not the case in my


---------01:27----------
experience there are some kinds of


---------01:30----------
people other groups of people that


---------01:31----------
struggle with open-ended problem-solving


---------01:33----------
and there's a particular group that is


---------01:35----------
very smart and not lazy at all but still


---------01:38----------
struggles with open-ended


---------01:39----------
problem-solving and that group actually


---------01:41----------
happens to be doctors crazy I know but


---------01:45----------
in order to understand how a doctor and


---------01:48----------
why a doctor struggles with open-ended


---------01:50----------
problem-solving we have to track back to


---------01:53----------
the mind of like the 15 year old kid who


---------01:56----------
decides that they want to be a doctor so


---------01:58----------
you've got this 15 year old kid who's at


---------02:01----------
a Christmas party that they're at at


---------02:03----------
their you know their friends their


---------02:05----------
family friends have a Christmas party


---------02:07----------
and they're going there and they see


---------02:09----------
someone that they haven't seen in a year


---------02:10----------
and that adult asks them what do you


---------02:12----------
want to be when you grow up and then


---------02:14----------
that kid says I want to be a surgeon and


---------02:16----------
then everyone's like so impressed it


---------02:17----------
like oh my god like you're gonna be a


---------02:19----------
surgeon that's amazing like you're so


---------02:20----------
smart


---------02:20----------
and they sort of the kid you know just


---------02:23----------
by saying telling people that you want


---------02:25----------
to be a surgeon somehow that makes the


---------02:27----------
kid more respected so the kid decides


---------02:29----------
I'm gonna be a surgeon because everyone


---------02:31----------
thinks that that's awesome and I'm a


---------02:32----------
good person


---------02:33----------
and I'm going to make a lot of money and


---------02:34----------
I'm gonna perform surgery on people and


---------02:36----------
I'm gonna save lives and so what does


---------02:38----------
that kid actually do they go to their


---------02:40----------
school counselor and they say you know I


---------02:43----------
want to I want to be a doctor one day


---------02:44----------
and so the school counselor is like okay


---------02:47----------
so you have to like take a bunch of AP


---------02:48----------
classes you have to do really well on


---------02:50----------
your SAT here's like the Princeton


---------02:52----------
Review or the Kaplan course that you


---------02:54----------
should take and so the kid sort of gets


---------02:56----------
this script to to how to be successful


---------03:00----------
and how to get into a good college so


---------03:02----------
they studied really hard they take the


---------03:04----------
AP classes they study for the SAT they


---------03:06----------
work really hard and they kind of do


---------03:08----------
everything that they're supposed to and


---------03:09----------
they end up with a good GPA a good SAT


---------03:11----------
score and then they go and they talk to


---------03:13----------
their school counselor and the school


---------03:14----------
counselor says you should apply to Ivy


---------03:16----------
League universities you should apply to


---------03:18----------
Harvard and Yale and Stanford and UCLA


---------03:20----------
and UC Berkeley and you should apply to


---------03:22----------
all these wonderful institutions like


---------03:24----------
Cornell and Columbia and so the kid goes


---------03:28----------
to those websites and downloads all


---------03:29----------
those applications and fills out a bunch


---------03:31----------
of applications and then writes a bunch


---------03:33----------
of essays and then writes exactly I mean


---------03:36----------
the school tells you what's right they


---------03:37----------
say write 500 words about a challenge


---------03:40----------
that you faced in your life and it's all


---------03:42----------
scripted so they don't actually have to


---------03:44----------
think about what they're doing because


---------03:45----------
everything is laid out for them so they


---------03:48----------
get into college and then when they're


---------03:50----------
getting oriented as a freshman they meet


---------03:52----------
their academic adviser and they tell


---------03:54----------
their academic advisor I want to you


---------03:56----------
know become a doctor and so the academic


---------03:58----------
adviser tells them what to do and they


---------04:00----------
say okay you've got to take pre-med


---------04:02----------
courses you've got to take biology


---------04:03----------
you've got to take physics you've got to


---------04:05----------
take chemistry in your third year of


---------04:08----------
college you have to take the medical


---------04:10----------
college admissions test which is like


---------04:12----------
the SAT for medical school and then you


---------04:14----------
also need to do some kind of


---------04:16----------
volunteering you need to do some kind of


---------04:18----------
leadership experience you need to do


---------04:20----------
some kind of research so they once again


---------04:22----------
get a script of like ABCDE F and G of


---------04:26----------
boxes they need to check and they start


---------04:28----------
plotting along and they work really hard


---------04:30----------
and they do all of those different


---------04:32----------
things and then they apply to medical


---------04:34----------
school and the medical school invites


---------04:36----------
them for an interview and so the medical


---------04:38----------
school tells the kid okay now that


---------04:40----------
you've sent us all this paperwork this


---------04:42----------
application in these


---------04:43----------
says--and things like that about why you


---------04:44----------
want to be a doctor come to our medical


---------04:46----------
school on this day and make sure you


---------04:48----------
wear suit and then we're gonna ask you


---------04:50----------
why you want to be a doctor and then


---------04:51----------
based on that and your MCAT scores and


---------04:54----------
your GPA will either accept you into our


---------04:56----------
medical school or we won't so the kid


---------04:58----------
gets accepted to medical school they go


---------05:01----------
to medical school and then once again


---------05:02----------
it's like you don't sign up for


---------05:04----------
particular classes in med school you


---------05:05----------
sort of have to learn everything so you


---------05:07----------
go to class every day and you study


---------05:08----------
really hard and you take a bunch of


---------05:10----------
tests and then you kind of do what


---------05:12----------
you're told and then third year medical


---------05:14----------
school rolls around and that's when you


---------05:16----------
start doing these things called


---------05:16----------
rotations so the first two years of


---------05:19----------
medical school you're kind of a student


---------05:20----------
you're sitting in a chair just like in


---------05:21----------
college or in high school but the last


---------05:23----------
two years of medical school you're


---------05:25----------
actually working in a hospital and so


---------05:27----------
you're following doctors around and


---------05:29----------
you're doing things like learning how to


---------05:30----------
tie sutures and learning how to give


---------05:33----------
injections and you're kind of in awe in


---------05:35----------
the hospital actually doing the work of


---------05:37----------
a doctor so they do that for a little


---------05:40----------
while and then after that you do this


---------05:42----------
thing called apply to residency so after


---------05:44----------
medical school is when you really learn


---------05:46----------
how to be a doctor and that's during


---------05:48----------
residency so you do different kinds of


---------05:50----------
residency there's a surgery residency


---------05:52----------
there's a psychiatry residency that's


---------05:53----------
the one that I did I'm a psychiatrist


---------05:55----------
and so when you go but once again it's


---------05:59----------
like a it's just like college


---------06:00----------
applications or medical school


---------06:02----------
applications you fill out an application


---------06:03----------
I write an essay about why I want to be


---------06:05----------
a psychiatrist or why I think that the


---------06:07----------
field of Psychiatry is exciting and I


---------06:10----------
didn't write about video game addiction


---------06:11----------
back then because it wasn't really a


---------06:13----------
thing and people didn't really know what


---------06:14----------
that was and it's even still sort of


---------06:16----------
just becoming a thing at least within


---------06:18----------
the academic community and so you end up


---------06:21----------
sort of applying the residency and then


---------06:23----------
you interview and then you get matched


---------06:25----------
there's a computer program that tells


---------06:27----------
you where you end up going for residency


---------06:29----------
so you go to your residency and you


---------06:31----------
train there for four years and during


---------06:33----------
residency they tell you they're like


---------06:34----------
okay so on day one you need to show up


---------06:36----------
at this hospital at this time and work


---------06:38----------
on this unit and then on day 31 you're


---------06:41----------
gonna be on call overnight in the


---------06:43----------
hospital so you have to show up here and


---------06:44----------
do this kind of work so every step of


---------06:46----------
the way they tell you exactly what to do


---------06:48----------
and then you finish residency and most


---------06:52----------
people finish residency somewhere


---------06:54----------
between the ages of 30 30 and 30


---------06:57----------
five depending on what you do and/or 29


---------07:01----------
and 35 and that's when just pause and


---------07:05----------
think about this for a second that's the


---------07:06----------
first time that this person applies for


---------07:10----------
a job so like you have a 34 year old guy


---------07:13----------
who's like a neurosurgeon who is never


---------07:15----------
applied for a job never applied for a


---------07:17----------
job


---------07:18----------
he's just been he boarded the train and


---------07:20----------
the train has its tracks and he just


---------07:22----------
goes along the track goes along the


---------07:23----------
track goes along the track and then he


---------07:25----------
gets off the track and the guy has never


---------07:26----------
applied for a job so a lot of doctors


---------07:29----------
actually struggle with like job


---------07:31----------
negotiations and a lot of doctors the


---------07:33----------
first couple of years after they


---------07:35----------
finished medical school get chronically


---------07:37----------
underpaid because they actually don't


---------07:38----------
know what they're worth they feel


---------07:40----------
embarrassed asking for more money so


---------07:43----------
they go to their chief and their chief


---------07:44----------
says well why don't you work here why


---------07:45----------
don't you work here and they apply for


---------07:47----------
different jobs but they actually don't


---------07:48----------
know like they've never worked anywhere


---------07:51----------
all they've ever done is fill out


---------07:54----------
applications take tests go to class and


---------07:57----------
do exactly what they've been told to do


---------07:58----------
so doctors actually struggle a lot with


---------08:01----------
like basic life skills like paying taxes


---------08:04----------
and stuff like that because they haven't


---------08:05----------
done that I mean you've got a 34 year


---------08:07----------
old guy who's I mean they have paid


---------08:09----------
taxes but you know their taxes are


---------08:11----------
really simple


---------08:12----------
they've never they've never found a job


---------08:14----------
they've never thought about you know


---------08:15----------
where they want to live or buying a


---------08:17----------
house or anything like that they're like


---------08:18----------
hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt


---------08:20----------
they've never had a paycheck and that's


---------08:22----------
a doctor and if you ask a doctor you


---------08:24----------
know how do you find a job it's really


---------08:27----------
hard for them they really struggle with


---------08:28----------
like negotiating and struggling with


---------08:30----------
like finding benefits and like you know


---------08:32----------
asking for paid parking and all these


---------08:34----------
like tiny things come up that cause


---------08:36----------
doctors all kinds of grief and it's not


---------08:38----------
that they're smart I mean it's not that


---------08:40----------
they're stupid and it's not that they're


---------08:41----------
lazy


---------08:42----------
it's that finding a job is a skill that


---------08:45----------
you actually have to learn how to do and


---------08:48----------
if you don't do it until you're 34


---------08:51----------
you're not gonna be good at it it has


---------08:52----------
nothing to do with being lazy or being


---------08:53----------
stupid it's just it's a skill it's a


---------08:55----------
part of your brain that you've never had


---------08:56----------
to use so gamers are kind of the same


---------08:59----------
way because if you look at a game a game


---------09:01----------
breaks down all of your problems for you


---------09:03----------
it gives you a script of this is level


---------09:06----------
one and this is level two and this is


---------09:07----------
level three in an order it'll unlock


---------09:09----------
level four you have to beat


---------09:11----------
one two and three but it's kind of like


---------09:13----------
a very close ended system in medical


---------09:17----------
school and people who become doctors are


---------09:18----------
kind of the same way they just go from A


---------09:20----------
to B to C to D you know you do high


---------09:22----------
school and then college and then Medical


---------09:24----------
School and the residency it's like level


---------09:25----------
one two three and four and each one has


---------09:27----------
an application and each one has an essay


---------09:28----------
and most of them have interviews and so


---------09:32----------
how is that different from a gamer


---------09:34----------
it's actually kind of the same thing in


---------09:36----------
both of these situations you have


---------09:38----------
problems which are very close ended and


---------09:41----------
you're told what to do so both of these


---------09:43----------
populations actually struggle with kind


---------09:45----------
of open-ended or abstract thinking a lot


---------09:47----------
of doctors also struggle with finding


---------09:49----------
relationships by the way but that's kind


---------09:50----------
of a separate issue so now let's compare


---------09:54----------
that a little bit with someone else


---------09:57----------
who's let's say doesn't go to medical


---------09:59----------
school and let's look at how they get


---------10:00----------
better at open-ended problem-solving so


---------10:03----------
let's once again start with our fifteen


---------10:05----------
year old kid but this kid doesn't have


---------10:06----------
aspirations to be a surgeon so when they


---------10:09----------
turn 16 you know they're not quite sure


---------10:11----------
what they want to do they apply for


---------10:13----------
their first job and so how does a 16


---------10:15----------
year old find a job they probably like


---------10:18----------
start working somewhere where they know


---------10:19----------
someone who's working so they have a


---------10:21----------
friend who works at a car wash and so


---------10:22----------
they fill out an application and they


---------10:24----------
end up getting a job at the car wash or


---------10:26----------
they have an uncle who has like a I


---------10:29----------
don't know like a paper supply company


---------10:31----------
and so they they work at the paper


---------10:33----------
supply company answering phones


---------10:35----------
basically the the solution space for


---------10:37----------
where they can find a job is basically


---------10:39----------
kind of like what's already in front of


---------10:41----------
them if they know someone they'll kind


---------10:42----------
of apply for a job or they'll be driving


---------10:44----------
down the road and they see like a hiring


---------10:47----------
sign at a restaurant so they'll start to


---------10:48----------
become a waiter or they'll like fill out


---------10:50----------
an application at a place like


---------10:51----------
McDonald's whatever they sort of start


---------10:54----------
to find a job in kind of a pretty narrow


---------10:56----------
area and then what happens is they apply


---------10:59----------
to college and so in college there's


---------11:02----------
also kind of a particular solution space


---------11:04----------
because you know do you want to go to


---------11:05----------
college but this solution space grows a


---------11:08----------
little bit bigger than finding your


---------11:11----------
first job so do you want to go to


---------11:12----------
college in state or out of state do you


---------11:15----------
want to go to college you know do you


---------11:17----------
want to go to a state school or a


---------11:18----------
private school do you need to apply for


---------11:20----------
scholarships you need to go someplace


---------11:22----------
where do you need to kind of stay close


---------11:24----------
to


---------11:24----------
home because you can't afford an


---------11:26----------
apartment so you can stay at home so now


---------11:28----------
there are a lot more going to college


---------11:30----------
become sort of this abstract problem


---------11:31----------
that has a bunch of different variables


---------11:33----------
and people start to learn how to


---------11:35----------
navigate those variables and so that


---------11:38----------
person goes to college as well and now


---------11:40----------
they have to think about well what do I


---------11:41----------
want to major and they haven't decided


---------11:43----------
to become a doctor already at the age of


---------11:44----------
15 so they talked to their advisors and


---------11:47----------
they're like okay I'm gonna be like an


---------11:48----------
undeclared major or unspecified major or


---------11:51----------
something like that and they have to


---------11:52----------
figure out okay do I want to be an


---------11:53----------
engineer or do I want to study finance


---------11:55----------
or do I want to study philosophy or


---------11:57----------
biology and so they have to think about


---------11:59----------
like what they want to be when they grow


---------12:00----------
up and that's kind of an abstract


---------12:02----------
problem and so they they've try it a


---------12:04----------
little bit and they decide to pick


---------12:05----------
something and then they when they finish


---------12:07----------
college they start looking for a job and


---------12:09----------
so that too becomes kind of like a now


---------12:13----------
the net is even wider so do you want to


---------12:15----------
work in the same town that you went to


---------12:18----------
college because now you have more


---------12:20----------
options because you're actually gonna be


---------12:21----------
getting a paycheck so you don't have to


---------12:23----------
live close to home so now the number of


---------12:26----------
things that you can do actually


---------12:27----------
increases and you have to think do I


---------12:29----------
want to work in the country or out of


---------12:30----------
the country do I want to live in


---------12:32----------
California or live in New York or say in


---------12:34----------
Texas do I want to be close to family


---------12:36----------
where do I want to live what kind of job


---------12:38----------
do I want to find and so they start the


---------12:41----------
job hunting process and then they end up


---------12:43----------
getting a job and let's say they went to


---------12:45----------
the University of Texas at Austin and


---------12:47----------
they decide they want to move out west


---------12:48----------
to California and so they go to


---------12:50----------
California and then after a couple of


---------12:52----------
years later let's say they ended up


---------12:53----------
working in finance they decide that they


---------12:55----------
want to go back to school and they want


---------12:57----------
to get their MBA and so once again


---------12:59----------
they're kind of faced with this question


---------13:00----------
of when do I want to get my MBA do I


---------13:02----------
want to get it after two years or three


---------13:05----------
years or four years and do they want to


---------13:07----------
get do it they want to take the


---------13:08----------
promotion or do they want to go to


---------13:10----------
business school so these problems become


---------13:12----------
more and more abstract and let's say


---------13:15----------
that they go to business school then


---------13:16----------
after they leave business school do they


---------13:18----------
want to go back to the old company or do


---------13:19----------
they want to move to a new company do


---------13:21----------
they want to move out of finance into


---------13:24----------
let's say Investment Banking or private


---------13:26----------
equity or marketing or do they want to


---------13:28----------
work in the startup world so these are


---------13:30----------
all really abstract problems but in the


---------13:34----------
case of this this last person that we're


---------13:36----------
talking about you can kind of see it


---------13:38----------
each


---------13:38----------
the way the number of variables they


---------13:40----------
have to deal with to grow 16 year old


---------13:43----------
finding a job has like 10 options


---------13:45----------
applying to college has like 20 options


---------13:47----------
choosing what to major and also has like


---------13:50----------
10 options


---------13:50----------
where you first find a job has like 50


---------13:53----------
options when you decide to go to


---------13:56----------
graduate school has like a hundred


---------13:58----------
options and so it each step of the way


---------14:00----------
this person their brain is actually


---------14:02----------
learning this skill of taking an


---------14:05----------
abstract problem in breaking it down


---------14:08----------
into individual pieces and so this


---------14:11----------
person when a gamer looks at the person


---------14:13----------
who's successful in 30 in their age and


---------14:16----------
says wow that person is like motivated


---------14:18----------
because they now are a manager at an


---------14:21----------
investment bank they look at that and


---------14:23----------
they say that guy's got to be smart and


---------14:24----------
he's not lazy but it's more subtle than


---------14:27----------
that


---------14:27----------
it's not that they're they're lazy or


---------14:30----------
not lazy it's that they have learned how


---------14:32----------
to manage this broader and broader set


---------14:35----------
of abstract problems and have gotten


---------14:37----------
better at open-ended problem solving


---------14:39----------
whereas the guy who's a gamer instead of


---------14:42----------
getting a job at 16 he plays video games


---------14:44----------
for 6 hours a day when he goes to


---------14:46----------
college he doesn't spend a whole lot of


---------14:48----------
time going to different clubs activities


---------14:50----------
and and figuring out what to major and


---------14:53----------
he just picks computer science or like


---------14:54----------
graphic design because he wants to be a


---------14:56----------
video game programmer he spends a lot of


---------14:59----------
his free time just playing video games


---------15:00----------
when he finishes college he applies for


---------15:03----------
a narrower set of jobs and spends most


---------15:05----------
of his time just playing video games


---------15:06----------
when he goes he may not even go to grad


---------15:09----------
school because at that point he's sort


---------15:10----------
of like his abstract thinking stops it


---------15:13----------
stops growing and so then he ends up


---------15:15----------
being 30 years old and comparing himself


---------15:18----------
to the his buddy who's who's a manager


---------15:20----------
and an investment bank and he says wow


---------15:22----------
that guy is like that guy's really


---------15:24----------
hard-working and I'm lazy and that's the


---------15:25----------
reason I am where I am the fascinating


---------15:27----------
thing is that's just not true it just


---------15:30----------
isn't true it's not about laziness it's


---------15:32----------
not about intelligence it's about


---------15:34----------
developing a particular cognitive skill


---------15:37----------
of taking an open-ended abstract problem


---------15:41----------
and being able to chunk it up and what I


---------15:44----------
found when I work with gamers when I


---------15:46----------
work with you guys is that if we can sit


---------15:48----------
down and actually do this consciously


---------15:51----------
take a


---------15:52----------
problem that you have and operationalize


---------15:54----------
it break it down into its component


---------15:57----------
parts and figure out what you need to do


---------15:59----------
it each step of the way


---------16:00----------
then the gamer suddenly starts moving


---------16:02----------
forward in life they suddenly start


---------16:04----------
getting better they start becoming more


---------16:06----------
financially independent they find better


---------16:08----------
jobs they even find girlfriends because


---------16:10----------
we talk a little bit about getting into


---------16:11----------
shape and upgrading your wardrobe and


---------16:14----------
figuring out what to like getting rid of


---------16:16----------
the fedora and then like shaving that


---------16:18----------
neckbeard that you've got and like


---------16:20----------
gamers start to like do better in life


---------16:22----------
if we chunk down why they can't find a


---------16:25----------
girlfriend it's because of the


---------16:26----------
way you dress and it's because of the


---------16:27----------
way that you smell and it's because


---------16:29----------
you're so socially awkward


---------16:31----------
because you spend the whole day be in


---------16:32----------
front of a computer screen so before you


---------16:34----------
do that you got to go and take an improv


---------16:35----------
class once they take an improv class


---------16:37----------
they feel more comfortable socially and


---------16:40----------
they feel more comfortable around women


---------16:42----------
and then women don't think that they're


---------16:43----------
creepy because they know how to interact


---------16:44----------
with limit and so even something like


---------16:47----------
finding a girlfriend is like an abstract


---------16:50----------
problem but that can be chunked down


---------16:52----------
into like fashion in hygiene and social


---------16:55----------
skills and getting physically into shape


---------16:57----------
and not living in your mom's


---------16:59----------
basement like that counts for a lot when


---------17:02----------
you're trying to find a girlfriend so


---------17:03----------
you can break that down into pieces and


---------17:05----------
once you start working on the pieces


---------17:06----------
it's amazing how much better your life


---------17:08----------
is gonna get but in order to do that you


---------17:11----------
have to learn how to actually break down


---------17:13----------
that problem because your brain right


---------17:15----------
now hasn't needed to do that


---------17:18----------
it hasn't needed to do it because you


---------17:19----------
spend so many hours playing video games


---------17:21----------
where that's been done for you so one of


---------17:24----------
the things that I invite you guys to


---------17:26----------
think a little bit about is do you


---------17:29----------
actually know how to achieve the goal


---------17:31----------
that you say you want if you want to be


---------17:33----------
financially independent do you know the


---------17:35----------
steps around doing that and if you sit


---------17:38----------
down and you start writing those steps


---------17:40----------
on a piece of paper I am almost certain


---------17:42----------
that you're gonna come up with like 6 or


---------17:44----------
7 which are gonna be pretty abstract in


---------17:46----------
and of themselves and that's when you're


---------17:48----------
gonna stop and that's when you're gonna


---------17:49----------
have trouble and so what we need to do


---------17:52----------
if you want to start moving forward in


---------17:53----------
life is teach your brain how to take


---------17:56----------
that abstract problem and turn it into a


---------17:58----------
concrete one because the neat thing


---------18:00----------
about gamers is if I give you a concrete


---------18:02----------
problem and I give you a concrete set of


---------18:04----------
tools you'll figure it out on your own


---------18:06----------
so the first step is taking an


---------18:07----------
open-ended problem in turning it into a


---------18:10----------
closed-ended problem and we'll talk a


---------18:12----------
little bit more about how to do that any


---------18:15----------
thoughts or questions
