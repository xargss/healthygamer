---------00:15----------
so we're now going to dig into one of


---------00:18----------
the most important aspects of being a


---------00:21----------
gamer which is being lazy so show of


---------00:25----------
hands who here said who here describes


---------00:27----------
themselves as lazy so pretty much


---------00:29----------
everyone right we're all lazy in human


---------00:33----------
beings are actually designed to be lazy


---------00:35----------
if we think about it like human beings


---------00:38----------
aren't gonna do stuff unless they kind


---------00:40----------
of need to do stuff and that's a common


---------00:43----------
problem for the human condition but


---------00:45----------
tends to be a particular problem for


---------00:47----------
gamers when I talk to gamers and I ask


---------00:50----------
you guys you know why is it that your


---------00:52----------
roommate or your friend from high school


---------00:54----------
is able to do things and you're not able


---------00:57----------
to do things why are you in the position


---------00:59----------
that your net you are you're in now they


---------01:02----------
say because they're lazy and so I think


---------01:05----------
that that's actually a really dangerous


---------01:07----------
train of thought even if it's true


---------01:09----------
because there's nothing you can do about


---------01:12----------
being lazy like laziness is like a trait


---------01:15----------
it's like I'm lazy or I'm not lazy some


---------01:18----------
people are lazy and some people aren't


---------01:20----------
lazy if you're lazy you're basically


---------01:22----------
 because you can't you can't make


---------01:24----------
that go away and so the first part of


---------01:27----------
laziness that we're gonna dig into is


---------01:28----------
understanding a little bit about


---------01:30----------
laziness motivation and willpower you


---------01:33----------
know how these three things fit together


---------01:35----------
a lot of gamers tell me that their life


---------01:38----------
would be different if they could be


---------01:40----------
motivated so I think we're gonna talk a


---------01:42----------
little bit about how motivation


---------01:45----------
circuitry within your brain works so the


---------01:48----------
first thing that recognizes that


---------01:50----------
willpower and motivation are completely


---------01:53----------
different things


---------01:54----------
if you're motivated to do something you


---------01:57----------
actually don't need willpower to do it


---------02:00----------
right like let's pause and think about


---------02:02----------
this for a second so I have an apple


---------02:03----------
here and this Apple is is hard to eat if


---------02:09----------
I'm full if I'm already full and I'm not


---------02:11----------
hungry at all and I want to eat this


---------02:13----------
Apple I actually have to use willpower


---------02:15----------
to eat the Apple because I don't feel


---------02:17----------
like eating the Apple as time goes on


---------02:21----------
let's say that an hour from now I start


---------02:23----------
to get a little bit hungry or an hour


---------02:24----------
from an hour later I start to get a


---------02:26----------
little bit hungry or eight hours from


---------02:28----------
now I'm pretty


---------02:29----------
and then suddenly I don't need willpower


---------02:31----------
to eat the Apple anymore I'm motivated


---------02:34----------
to eat the Apple because I'm now hungry


---------02:36----------
I had this internal biological drive to


---------02:39----------
do something and I have this Apple in


---------02:42----------
front of me so I feel hungry my blood


---------02:45----------
sugar is dropping and I've got this


---------02:46----------
Apple so it becomes easy to eat even if


---------02:49----------
I don't like apples I you can imagine


---------02:51----------
that if I don't like apples and I wait


---------02:54----------
eight hours it's still gonna require


---------02:56----------
some willpower for me to eat the apple


---------02:59----------
if I wait 24 hours it's gonna be I'm


---------03:02----------
gonna be way more motivated to eat the


---------03:04----------
Apple because I'm gonna be starving if I


---------03:07----------
wait 48 hours my motivation to eat the


---------03:10----------
Apple is gonna be gigantic so the first


---------03:12----------
thing to understand is that motivation


---------03:14----------
is not actually willpower motivation is


---------03:18----------
an internal drive that you sort of don't


---------03:21----------
have control over your body has these


---------03:23----------
different circuits in your brain that


---------03:25----------
create a desire to do something and


---------03:29----------
that's kind of what we call motivation


---------03:31----------
the second thing to understand about


---------03:33----------
motivation is that whether you actually


---------03:36----------
do something engage in a behavior or not


---------03:39----------
is not just based on the biological


---------03:41----------
drive it also has to do with


---------03:44----------
availability so if I am starving this


---------03:50----------
Apple is really easy to eat but if I'm


---------03:52----------
not very hungry I still may eat an apple


---------03:55----------
if you put it in front of me so our


---------03:58----------
desire to our ability to actually engage


---------04:00----------
in a behavior actually depends on the


---------04:03----------
availability of what's around us so if I


---------04:06----------
want to eat healthier with a simple


---------04:09----------
thing that I can actually do is just


---------04:10----------
keep healthy food around me and make it


---------04:13----------
easy for me to eat healthy food if I'm a


---------04:16----------
lazy like I am and I just have


---------04:19----------
like healthy food laying around there's


---------04:22----------
a greater chance that I'll eat it


---------04:24----------
because since I'm lazy I'm not gonna


---------04:25----------
leave the house to go pick up a


---------04:27----------
hamburger when there's an apple right


---------04:29----------
here actually I probably will still do


---------04:30----------
that but the chances that I eat food


---------04:33----------
that's healthy is going to be greater if


---------04:35----------
it's around so the first thing that


---------04:37----------
we've got to kind of summarize here is


---------04:39----------
that motivation is a combination of an


---------04:42----------
internal Drive


---------04:43----------
and availability and this sort of makes


---------04:46----------
sense for you guys if you stop and think


---------04:47----------
about it because one thing that a lot of


---------04:49----------
gamers tell me is that it's easy for


---------04:51----------
them to do something if they have an


---------04:54----------
external pressure to do it it's easy to


---------04:57----------
study geometry if you have a test on


---------05:00----------
Friday but it's hard to study geometry


---------05:02----------
after you've taken the test and so if we


---------05:04----------
think about that that motivation to


---------05:07----------
study comes from the environment and


---------05:09----------
that's kind of like having an apple


---------05:11----------
available a part of our motivation is


---------05:14----------
actually based on our environment of


---------05:16----------
what's available around us and a part of


---------05:18----------
it is based on our internal drive so


---------05:21----------
what does that mean for gamers how do


---------05:23----------
you create motivation well you may not


---------05:27----------
be able to do a whole lot but we can


---------05:28----------
talk a little bit about managing the


---------05:30----------
internal drive but one of the big things


---------05:32----------
that I tell gamers is that a lot of


---------05:34----------
motivation is based on your environment


---------05:36----------
so if you hang out with people who go to


---------05:39----------
the gym three times a week there's a


---------05:41----------
much greater chance that you'll actually


---------05:43----------
go to the gym your motivation will go to


---------05:46----------
the go to the gym will be increased by


---------05:48----------
the kind of people that you spend time


---------05:50----------
with and so one of the biggest things to


---------05:53----------
understand about your motivation the


---------05:54----------
first thing to understand is that it's


---------05:56----------
not willpower and that it's actually


---------05:59----------
based on a combination of internal


---------06:00----------
drives and availability or environment


---------06:03----------
and so if you think about it that way


---------06:05----------
you can start to problem-solve a little


---------06:07----------
bit about okay what is it that I want to


---------06:09----------
do what do I want to change do I want to


---------06:11----------
go to the gym more do I want to eat


---------06:13----------
healthier and then you can structure


---------06:15----------
your environment to sort of prompt you


---------06:18----------
to move in the direction that you want


---------06:20----------
to go so for example if you want to eat


---------06:22----------
healthier go to the grocery store when


---------06:25----------
you're not starving and buy some healthy


---------06:27----------
food and keep it at home keep an apple


---------06:29----------
on your desk next to your PC and then


---------06:32----------
when you feel a little bit hungry it's


---------06:34----------
easier to eat the Apple make it easy for


---------06:36----------
yourself to do the things that you want


---------06:39----------
to do if for example you want to go out


---------06:42----------
to lunch try to ask the buddy that


---------06:44----------
you're going out to lunch with hey why


---------06:46----------
don't we go to the gym first we'll like


---------06:47----------
workout from 10:30 to 11:30 and then


---------06:50----------
grab lunch afterward the more that you


---------06:52----------
can structure your environment to


---------06:55----------
support your be


---------06:56----------
behavior and move you in the direction


---------06:58----------
that you want to go the better off


---------07:00----------
you'll be


---------07:00----------
and the funny thing about that is that


---------07:02----------
you don't actually need willpower all


---------07:04----------
you need is to just structure in your


---------07:06----------
environment in a way that it prompts the


---------07:09----------
motivation that you want
