---------00:00----------
so today we're it's going to be a


---------00:01----------
whirlwind


---------00:03----------
all right so


---------00:05----------
first thing that we're going to do is


---------00:06----------
talk a little bit about what we've


---------00:08----------
covered so far so on day one we


---------00:10----------
went through an introduction right what


---------00:12----------
is coaching what is therapy and how do


---------00:14----------
we understand uh


---------00:16----------
what gets in the way of our clients


---------00:18----------
achieving their goals on the screen


---------00:20----------
share with y'all


---------00:22----------
there we go


---------00:24----------
and so what we kind of came to is this


---------00:26----------
you know diagram of this is their intent


---------00:30----------
this is the resistance they have to


---------00:31----------
overcome


---------00:34----------
and then once they overcome their


---------00:35----------
resistance they're prone to take action


---------00:38----------
and so on day one we sort of went over


---------00:40----------
an overview of this model


---------00:43----------
and the key takeaways from the overview


---------00:44----------
of this model are that the reason that


---------00:46----------
people can't find motivation is because


---------00:50----------
they kind of you they use one term oh


---------00:52----------
i'm unmotivated right


---------00:54----------
but the truth is that motivation


---------00:56----------
involves a number of different


---------00:57----------
physiologic psychologic


---------00:59----------
neuroscientific spiritual behavioral


---------01:03----------
economics there are lots of different


---------01:04----------
disciplines that look that go into what


---------01:07----------
motivation is and the reason people stay


---------01:09----------
stuck is because they don't have the


---------01:11----------
precision to figure out where is my


---------01:13----------
problem is it a problem of intent am i


---------01:16----------
not like do i not really want it or am i


---------01:18----------
conflicted am i ambivalent is there a


---------01:20----------
part of me that should get up at 8 am


---------01:23----------
every day but there's a part of me that


---------01:25----------
wants to stay up till 4 a.m every day so


---------01:28----------
that internal conflict makes their


---------01:30----------
intent kind of scrambled so they can't


---------01:32----------
really act


---------01:34----------
is the problem resistance so even if i


---------01:36----------
really want to do something and my best


---------01:38----------
example of this is people who are like


---------01:39----------
very very lonely so people who are very


---------01:42----------
very lonely will want to make friends


---------01:44----------
will want to find a romantic partner


---------01:46----------
will want all of these things and their


---------01:48----------
intent is a hundred percent they want it


---------01:51----------
more than anything else in the world and


---------01:53----------
yet they still can't do it so if we kind


---------01:55----------
of diagnose that person's motivational


---------01:57----------
problem what we'll probably uncover is


---------01:59----------
that there's resistance there's some


---------02:01----------
amount of shame that they experience


---------02:03----------
some amount of identity problems that


---------02:05----------
they have so if we kind of talk about


---------02:07----------
resistance you know there's two


---------02:08----------
components to it there's like emotions


---------02:10----------
and identity there are other things as


---------02:12----------
well but that's kind of how we break it


---------02:13----------
up


---------02:14----------
and so how can you as a coach even if


---------02:16----------
their intent is fully clarified how can


---------02:19----------
you help them overcome their resistance


---------02:22----------
and so today we're going to kind of talk


---------02:24----------
about i think the nuts and bolts of what


---------02:26----------
most people expect from like goal


---------02:28----------
setting and motivation which is the


---------02:29----------
action and the key point here is that a


---------02:32----------
lot of people come in and they like want


---------02:33----------
to jump right towards their goals but


---------02:35----------
it's been my experience and hopefully


---------02:37----------
you all have seen this too i'm pretty


---------02:38----------
sure y'all have


---------02:39----------
that people who focus on the action


---------02:42----------
right away without focusing on the


---------02:43----------
obstacle and the energy going into their


---------02:47----------
their goals


---------02:49----------
are the ones that


---------02:50----------
tend to get blindsided and feel stuck


---------02:53----------
because they're like oh i know what i


---------02:54----------
need to do but i can't bring myself to


---------02:56----------
do it and then they go and keep on


---------02:58----------
looking for magical solutions to their


---------03:00----------
problems


---------03:02----------
but they don't need a magical solution


---------03:03----------
what they need to do is fix the problem


---------03:05----------
to begin with right they need to remove


---------03:06----------
the resistance they need to remove the


---------03:08----------
obstacles


---------03:09----------
so now what we're going to focus on is


---------03:12----------
actually how to set an appropriate


---------03:14----------
action and how to help your clients like


---------03:17----------
succeed in the goals that they set


---------03:20----------
and today we're going to cover four


---------03:22----------
things we're going to talk about setting


---------03:23----------
a goal we're going to talk about science


---------03:25----------
a little bit and evidence-based or


---------03:27----------
scientifically valid validated


---------03:30----------
um points or like understandings that


---------03:34----------
will help your clients achieve their


---------03:36----------
goals


---------03:36----------
so there are lots of different


---------03:38----------
psychological principles and other


---------03:40----------
things at play that we can kind of


---------03:42----------
leverage to optimize a client actually


---------03:44----------
achieving their goal then we're going to


---------03:46----------
talk about troubleshooting goals and


---------03:48----------
then the last thing that we're going to


---------03:49----------
talk about is give you all a good solid


---------03:51----------
cognitive framework to think about the


---------03:53----------
dimensions


---------03:54----------
of a goal so that you can try to figure


---------03:56----------
out where a problem within a goal exists


---------04:00----------
questions


---------04:05----------
okay so let's jump in


---------04:08----------
so


---------04:10----------
setting a goal


---------04:12----------
how do most clients set goals


---------04:22----------
they look at what other people are doing


---------04:25----------
very good right so monkey see monkey do


---------04:30----------
what else


---------04:36----------
they have a desire to sort of achieve


---------04:37----------
something


---------04:38----------
okay


---------04:39----------
so let's say that that my


---------04:42----------
so uh


---------04:44----------
goal is based on achievement right


---------04:47----------
is that fair to say kent


---------04:49----------
yep


---------04:50----------
so i know this sounds kind of weird but


---------04:52----------
like when we use the word goal


---------04:55----------
like what we're kind of focusing on is


---------04:57----------
like the end of the road the achievement


---------05:01----------
right so like if i have a goal like


---------05:03----------
what's like a goal is like i want to


---------05:05----------
become an olympic gold medalist


---------05:08----------
that's the achievement right most of the


---------05:10----------
time when our clients think about like


---------05:11----------
goals they set it based on the target so


---------05:14----------
it's like a target focus fair


---------05:19----------
end of the road


---------05:22----------
where else where do you think goals go


---------05:24----------
what else like where else do your


---------05:25----------
clients goals come from any other ideas


---------05:29----------
sometimes there are consequences of


---------05:31----------
their current behavior and they want to


---------05:32----------
change it


---------05:33----------
but what do you mean by that eli


---------05:36----------
um like i guess sometimes like i have a


---------05:39----------
few clients who maybe want to lose


---------05:40----------
weight because of you know what it's


---------05:43----------
like to be physically active and so they


---------05:45----------
like set a goal


---------05:47----------
to


---------05:48----------
be more fit


---------05:50----------
can you help me understand how they


---------05:52----------
decided to set the goal to be more fit


---------05:59----------
i guess the adult to you last point


---------06:02----------
would it be like


---------06:04----------
reaching like a certain like emotional


---------06:05----------
feeling like happiness


---------06:07----------
okay so sometimes they're chasing


---------06:11----------
a feeling


---------06:13----------
or there's like a correlation with their


---------06:15----------
goal like


---------06:16----------
that's that's kind of a good point so


---------06:18----------
like


---------06:19----------
i think that if i get promoted i will be


---------06:22----------
happy


---------06:23----------
is that a good way to put it


---------06:26----------
if i'm


---------06:27----------
you know all of my life would be better


---------06:29----------
if i got


---------06:31----------
jaw surgery and made my jaw extend


---------06:34----------
further from my face and then i could be


---------06:36----------
a strong john male


---------06:38----------
right


---------06:39----------
so like they're sort of their goal


---------06:43----------
correlates with


---------06:46----------
some what's actually their goal


---------06:48----------
correlates with their values but it's


---------06:50----------
not directly chasing the value it's like


---------06:52----------
chasing some approximation of the value


---------06:54----------
it's an excellent point


---------06:56----------
okay


---------06:57----------
so the the i think the key thing here is


---------06:59----------
that a lot of clients will set goals


---------07:01----------
based on what they see other people do


---------07:03----------
um you know what that target is and they


---------07:07----------
may even attribute some inappropriate


---------07:10----------
things to that target so this is like


---------07:12----------
grass is greener on the other side


---------07:16----------
right so the first thing that i kind of


---------07:17----------
want to point out is that like


---------07:20----------
goal setting is not a systematic or


---------07:22----------
thought out process it's not methodical


---------07:24----------
at all it's just sort of like they wake


---------07:26----------
up one day and they're like oh this is


---------07:27----------
what i should do


---------07:29----------
right and all of the the societal


---------07:31----------
conditioning and stuff kind of comes in


---------07:32----------
so first thing that we can help people


---------07:34----------
do in terms of coaching is to set an


---------07:37----------
appropriate goal we can actually


---------07:39----------
set like use a systematic process to set


---------07:42----------
the right kinds of goals for the for our


---------07:44----------
clients and help them achieve it


---------07:46----------
and our first kind of


---------07:48----------
approach to setting a goal


---------07:51----------
is the 25 rule


---------07:53----------
and so what we kind of say is here's


---------07:54----------
where our clients are


---------07:56----------
here's where they want to go so here's


---------07:58----------
the goal


---------07:59----------
and so what clients try to do is they


---------08:01----------
try to think okay how do i get from here


---------08:02----------
to here which makes perfect sense that's


---------08:04----------
the nature of a goal right if this is


---------08:06----------
like olympic gold medal


---------08:09----------
like of course


---------08:11----------
they're gonna think about how do i get


---------08:13----------
to an olympic gold medal


---------08:14----------
but the problem is that this actually


---------08:16----------
this approach


---------08:18----------
does not scientifically kind of set us


---------08:21----------
up for success so the first thing that


---------08:23----------
we're gonna do is we're gonna ask them


---------08:25----------
okay between where you are and where you


---------08:27----------
want to go


---------08:28----------
what's the halfway point between that


---------08:31----------
and then what's the halfway point


---------08:33----------
between that and this is usually the


---------08:35----------
first general target that we want to set


---------08:38----------
and there are a lot of things that we're


---------08:40----------
engaging by doing this process


---------08:42----------
the first is that our brain has this


---------08:44----------
circuit that sort of you know measures


---------08:46----------
progress towards something


---------08:49----------
and it's it's able to tell that like


---------08:50----------
okay if i if i work out today


---------08:54----------
how close am i to achieving my goal not


---------08:56----------
very close at all and so when the gap


---------08:59----------
between what i'm capable of


---------09:05----------
and what i want to achieve


---------09:09----------
is wide


---------09:11----------
it decreases motivation


---------09:15----------
right so i'm curious


---------09:18----------
do any of y'all like want to be


---------09:19----------
president of the united states


---------09:23----------
like who thinks it would be cool to be


---------09:25----------
president


---------09:26----------
i think it would be pretty cool


---------09:28----------
right so like why don't you strive for


---------09:30----------
it every day brian


---------09:32----------
that's really hard and very abstract


---------09:35----------
absolutely right so what we see is that


---------09:37----------
the gap between what you're what you


---------09:40----------
believe you're capable of or what you


---------09:41----------
the actions you can take and what you


---------09:43----------
want to achieve actually decreases


---------09:45----------
motivation so the first thing that we're


---------09:47----------
going to do is like shrink the goal like


---------09:49----------
to the first target so there's also like


---------09:51----------
positive psychology and things like that


---------09:53----------
that are involved here so when we shrink


---------09:55----------
the first target you know we increase


---------09:57----------
the likelihood of positive reinforcement


---------10:03----------
right we kind of open our ourselves up


---------10:05----------
to like being successful


---------10:10----------
and like all kinds of other stuff so i'm


---------10:12----------
i'm gonna ask you all so maybe you guys


---------10:14----------
know so if i if i were to tell one of my


---------10:16----------
clients hey i know you have this goal


---------10:18----------
over here but why don't we start over


---------10:20----------
here what is your client going to say


---------10:22----------
what's their resistance to it


---------10:28----------
it's not enough or it's not important


---------10:30----------
beautiful not enough so we're going to


---------10:32----------
get that okay we just want to table that


---------10:33----------
eli


---------10:34----------
we'll talk about how to deal with that


---------10:36----------
in a second okay


---------10:38----------
so the first thing that we want to do is


---------10:39----------
set a reasonable goal okay


---------10:41----------
um and


---------10:43----------
the 25 rule is kind of


---------10:47----------
how to sort of frame it i think this is


---------10:50----------
a goal that we also really discovered


---------10:52----------
worked very well in our parent coaching


---------10:54----------
program so there are a bunch of parents


---------10:56----------
who feel like their kids are addicted to


---------10:57----------
video games and so they came to us and


---------10:59----------
they said oh my god can you fix our


---------11:01----------
children can i sign them up for coaching


---------11:03----------
and we said no your kid isn't the


---------11:05----------
problem you need to sign up for coaching


---------11:06----------
and some parents get really really upset


---------11:08----------
with that they're like they're the one


---------11:09----------
who's playing video games all day and


---------11:11----------
i'm like you're their parent if they're


---------11:12----------
doing something all day it's your fault


---------11:14----------
i don't say that say it in that way but


---------11:16----------
our parent coaching program we don't


---------11:17----------
work with the kids we work with the


---------11:19----------
parents and the first thing that we do


---------11:21----------
is help the parents understand that


---------11:24----------
the goals that you want to achieve you


---------11:25----------
want your your kid to start running


---------11:27----------
track and never play video games and and


---------11:29----------
do all their chores


---------11:31----------
and be home for like show up at the


---------11:33----------
table and set the table and eat dinner


---------11:35----------
like they're not gonna do that right


---------11:37----------
that's a completely inappropriate goal


---------11:39----------
for you to set let's meet the kid where


---------11:42----------
they're at what does the kid want what


---------11:43----------
do they care about you know what are


---------11:44----------
they capable of


---------11:46----------
and so in terms of setting this goal


---------11:48----------
like there's a couple of good techniques


---------11:50----------
that you can use that can get people to


---------11:52----------
to buy in a little bit


---------11:54----------
so


---------11:55----------
um you know you can ask questions like


---------11:58----------
uh


---------11:59----------
you know where can you start


---------12:06----------
so this is kind of emphasizing


---------12:08----------
this point instead of this point okay


---------12:12----------
so like asking the client so if they say


---------12:14----------
oh it wouldn't be enough


---------12:16----------
focusing on the start sort of


---------12:19----------
dismantles then not enough somewhat does


---------12:22----------
that make sense


---------12:23----------
because then it's not like there's no


---------12:24----------
there's no enough if you're just talking


---------12:26----------
about where to start is enough has to do


---------12:28----------
with hitting your target it doesn't have


---------12:30----------
to do with like where you are it has to


---------12:32----------
do with where you want to go does that


---------12:33----------
make sense


---------12:35----------
so you can kind of ask clients where you


---------12:37----------
can start and then you can also ask them


---------12:39----------
like you know


---------12:40----------
what did you do over the last week


---------12:47----------
so you want to sort of emphasize where


---------12:49----------
they are


---------12:52----------
but right so if someone wants to like


---------12:53----------
diet for example or lose weight or


---------12:55----------
whatever you know if someone wants to


---------12:57----------
find a new job you can kind of ask them


---------12:59----------
okay what effort like what did you do


---------13:01----------
over the last week in terms of like


---------13:03----------
moving towards this goal and chances are


---------13:05----------
they'll say nothing


---------13:06----------
because they haven't started on the goal


---------13:08----------
yet right which is kind of fine so you


---------13:09----------
kind of


---------13:11----------
approach them with a little bit of like


---------13:12----------
compassion and then you can say okay


---------13:14----------
that's totally fine so if you didn't


---------13:16----------
work on it last week so where's your


---------13:17----------
this is your baseline kind of telling


---------13:19----------
them this is your baseline


---------13:22----------
okay and kind of cognitively i know it's


---------13:25----------
kind of weird but people don't do this


---------13:26----------
right


---------13:27----------
they don't sort of think about where


---------13:29----------
they are is their baseline they think


---------13:32----------
about where they are is a negative does


---------13:34----------
that make sense like cognitively


---------13:37----------
so


---------13:40----------
and so that cognitive shift is


---------13:42----------
incredibly important right so like


---------13:44----------
instead of the gap of like in the


---------13:47----------
negative numbers


---------13:48----------
you know this is kind of where they are


---------13:50----------
so all they see is a deficit whereas


---------13:52----------
like this line actually belongs here


---------13:54----------
because that's where you're starting


---------13:56----------
so you can sort of


---------13:58----------
set this out as your baseline and then


---------14:00----------
kind of ask the question you know what's


---------14:02----------
the like and then you can kind of get


---------14:03----------
back to where where can you start


---------14:06----------
um but you can sort of ask the question


---------14:08----------
like


---------14:08----------
you know what what's one step you can


---------14:10----------
take


---------14:17----------
above the baseline


---------14:21----------
right so this is where like once you


---------14:23----------
frameshift to the baseline of where they


---------14:26----------
are it adjusts their expectations so


---------14:29----------
using these techniques like does a lot


---------14:31----------
of things like adjust expect


---------14:33----------
adjust expectations


---------14:35----------
which correlates with increased success


---------14:38----------
it also has a present focus


---------14:40----------
which correlates with in increased


---------14:42----------
success it meets people where they're at


---------14:51----------
which correlates with increased success


---------14:54----------
it models


---------14:56----------
acceptance


---------14:59----------
for them about where they are and this


---------15:01----------
also


---------15:02----------
leads to increased success


---------15:04----------
so what we're going to use is like use


---------15:06----------
this kind of frame shift and use some of


---------15:07----------
these techniques to recruit several


---------15:10----------
principles that are correlated with


---------15:12----------
better outcomes


---------15:13----------
questions about that


---------15:20----------
okay so just to give you all kind of a


---------15:21----------
quick example so you know let's say okay


---------15:23----------
i want to i want to get healthy all


---------15:25----------
right what did you do last week


---------15:27----------
i didn't exercise at all and i ate you


---------15:30----------
know i ordered like uber eats every day


---------15:32----------
okay


---------15:33----------
so like let's take that as your baseline


---------15:35----------
sounds like you've got a long way to go


---------15:37----------
you want to kind of acknowledge right


---------15:38----------
you want to acknowledge their goal you


---------15:40----------
want to acknowledge the gap you want to


---------15:41----------
acknowledge the feeling of not enough


---------15:43----------
then you can say okay where do you think


---------15:44----------
is the so for someone who doesn't


---------15:46----------
exercise and kind of is eating out every


---------15:48----------
day what do you think would be a


---------15:50----------
reasonable goal for like that person to


---------15:52----------
start


---------15:53----------
like what do you think is the first step


---------15:54----------
they need to do


---------15:56----------
and then this is where your client will


---------15:58----------
say well i guess they need to start


---------15:59----------
working out every day and it's like no


---------16:01----------
no i don't think that's reasonable


---------16:02----------
that's like that's do you think that


---------16:04----------
someone who didn't work out zero days in


---------16:06----------
the last week can start working out


---------16:08----------
every single day


---------16:10----------
and then you kind of like they're like


---------16:11----------
no well i don't think that that's really


---------16:13----------
possible so like okay so like what do


---------16:15----------
you think is possible


---------16:17----------
you know do you think working out a


---------16:18----------
single day is like possible for this


---------16:20----------
person all right let's try let's see


---------16:23----------
what happens i understand that it feels


---------16:25----------
like it's not going to be enough to you


---------16:26----------
and frankly it's not going to be enough


---------16:27----------
let's just acknowledge that


---------16:29----------
but what's enough and what you're


---------16:30----------
capable of are two different things


---------16:32----------
where you want to go and what your


---------16:33----------
baseline is or two different things okay


---------16:36----------
you all get that


---------16:39----------
so what we're going to do is set our


---------16:40----------
goal at 25


---------16:42----------
of where they want to go


---------16:44----------
and then or maybe even smaller and then


---------16:46----------
sort of have this kind of discussion of


---------16:48----------
where their baseline is defining their


---------16:50----------
baseline and moving upward from the


---------16:52----------
baseline


---------16:53----------
and that sort of recruits positive


---------16:55----------
reinforcement and being successful


---------16:57----------
instead of this gap between what they're


---------16:59----------
capable of and what they want to achieve


---------17:01----------
and will positively enhance our


---------17:03----------
motivation


---------17:04----------
it also has the added benefits of


---------17:06----------
adjusting expectations


---------17:08----------
helping people retain a present focus so


---------17:10----------
people will ask the question how do i


---------17:12----------
stay focused in the present it's not


---------17:14----------
something you can do right you don't


---------17:15----------
just stay focused in the present as a


---------17:18----------
coach what you're going to do is model a


---------17:20----------
certain kind of behavior that forces


---------17:22----------
them to be in the present and then their


---------17:23----------
brain will learn oh this is how i stay


---------17:25----------
in the present they're not even going to


---------17:27----------
realize that it's happening to them but


---------17:28----------
over time they will start to be more


---------17:30----------
present focused as you direct them to be


---------17:33----------
like to force them into the present by


---------17:35----------
sort of focusing on baseline instead of


---------17:37----------
goals


---------17:39----------
it meets people where they at where


---------17:40----------
they're at which i think you guys all


---------17:42----------
understand the value of and it also does


---------17:44----------
things like models acceptance right


---------17:46----------
you're not judging them for their


---------17:47----------
baseline you're kind of saying oh so you


---------17:49----------
don't work out at all and you eat out


---------17:51----------
every day like okay that's where we're


---------17:53----------
gonna start you're not spending the next


---------17:54----------
15 minutes beating them up about how


---------17:56----------
they could do better or how they're


---------17:58----------
pathetic or whatever so you're gonna


---------17:59----------
start to adjust their self-talk by


---------18:02----------
modeling acceptance okay so that's how


---------18:04----------
we set a goal


---------18:06----------
questions before we move on


---------18:11----------
okay


---------18:13----------
evidence-based goal setting


---------18:15----------
section number two


---------18:18----------
so there


---------18:20----------
there are uh


---------18:22----------
a number


---------18:25----------
of different kind of scientific


---------18:26----------
principles that we can we can kind of


---------18:29----------
leverage


---------18:30----------
to optimize how to set a goal okay


---------18:34----------
so number one


---------18:35----------
is advice giving


---------18:38----------
and why not to do it


---------18:40----------
number two is going to be


---------18:41----------
operationalizing


---------18:45----------
and understanding the frontal lobe


---------18:49----------
number three is going to be done in


---------18:51----------
krueger


---------18:57----------
yeah so these are going to be the three


---------18:58----------
things that we're going to focus on so


---------18:59----------
the first is when you give people advice


---------19:01----------
how effective is it


---------19:07----------
it's not very


---------19:08----------
effective absolutely right so why is


---------19:11----------
that you all know


---------19:17----------
i think because like the advice we give


---------19:18----------
them doesn't take any like context of


---------19:21----------
their situation


---------19:24----------
okay very good


---------19:25----------
right so oftentimes it's invalidating


---------19:28----------
yep so advice can be invalidating it


---------19:30----------
doesn't um


---------19:31----------
kind of


---------19:33----------
it doesn't seem to


---------19:35----------
land right like so presenting people


---------19:37----------
with information we've talked about


---------19:38----------
explicit memory and implicit memory and


---------19:40----------
all that good stuff


---------19:41----------
so the other problem with advice giving


---------19:43----------
is that it tends to be like a gut


---------19:45----------
reaction so the other thing about goal


---------19:47----------
setting that most people tend to do is


---------19:49----------
that it's like a gut reaction they like


---------19:51----------
wake up one day and they're like i need


---------19:52----------
to get in shape


---------19:54----------
right they just sort of set this


---------19:55----------
arbitrary goal


---------19:57----------
so there's evidence that shows that


---------19:59----------
instead of giving people a solution if


---------20:01----------
you want to engage them in behavior give


---------20:03----------
them a choice


---------20:05----------
so choice is greater than advice


---------20:08----------
or solutions


---------20:10----------
so i know it sounds kind of weird but


---------20:12----------
this is just a very simple technique


---------20:13----------
which there have been there's been a ton


---------20:15----------
of research on


---------20:16----------
which is like if someone wants to lose


---------20:18----------
weight if you tell them okay let's


---------20:20----------
develop an exercise plan that is not as


---------20:23----------
likely to succeed as if you ask them hey


---------20:26----------
so if you want to lose weight do you


---------20:27----------
think a dietary approach would be better


---------20:29----------
or like an exercise approach would be


---------20:31----------
better and then if they say exercise


---------20:34----------
approach


---------20:35----------
and then you kind of run down that like


---------20:37----------
that will actually be more likely to


---------20:39----------
succeed even if you give them the answer


---------20:41----------
at the beginning giving them the answer


---------20:43----------
at the beginning and letting them choose


---------20:46----------
the answer is actually like leads to


---------20:48----------
different outcomes even though you both


---------20:50----------
settle on on the same answer which is


---------20:52----------
kind of weird right because generally


---------20:53----------
speaking when we think about


---------20:55----------
the success of an endeavor we think the


---------20:58----------
endeavor is what results in success so


---------21:01----------
if i exercise


---------21:02----------
i will lose weight if i don't but the


---------21:05----------
the really interesting thing about human


---------21:06----------
psychology is how you get to the


---------21:09----------
conclusion of exercise actually


---------21:11----------
drastically affects your outcome in


---------21:14----------
terms of whether you're successful or


---------21:15----------
not


---------21:16----------
and so this is also where we're going to


---------21:18----------
draw on nobel prize winning economist


---------21:20----------
daniel kahneman


---------21:22----------
and so remember that where do goals come


---------21:25----------
from monkey see monkey do


---------21:29----------
right


---------21:31----------
where goals come from is our gut


---------21:33----------
so human beings do not engage in a


---------21:36----------
methodical process


---------21:38----------
of designing goals


---------21:40----------
they just rely on their gut it's driven


---------21:42----------
by emotion or their goals or what they


---------21:44----------
see by other people and so this is


---------21:46----------
called type one reasoning which is the


---------21:48----------
big discovery that daniel kahneman made


---------21:52----------
and the interesting thing about choice


---------21:54----------
is that choice starts to recruit type


---------21:56----------
two reasoning


---------21:58----------
and what kahneman kind of realized is


---------22:00----------
that human beings have two ways that


---------22:03----------
they make decisions


---------22:04----------
one is type one which is like gut so


---------22:07----------
this is like easy


---------22:09----------
to do


---------22:10----------
and it feels very logical


---------22:15----------
so a good example of this is is if you


---------22:17----------
look at like uh you know research on


---------22:19----------
advertising


---------22:20----------
if i put a display of oreos


---------22:24----------
like front and center


---------22:26----------
in like a grocery store and then someone


---------22:29----------
purchases oreos


---------22:30----------
and then i asked that person why did you


---------22:33----------
buy the oreos what are they going to say


---------22:38----------
it was in front of me that's actually


---------22:40----------
incorrect they will never say that


---------22:43----------
they'll say it's because


---------22:45----------
they wanted them absolutely


---------22:47----------
the reason so kent your map hacking bro


---------22:51----------
the reason they bought it is because it


---------22:53----------
was in front of them


---------22:55----------
but


---------22:56----------
the reason they think they bought it is


---------22:58----------
because of something that feels very


---------23:00----------
logical this is a big discovery that


---------23:02----------
that matt packing can


---------23:04----------
this is a big discovery that um daniel


---------23:07----------
kahneman made is that people make gut


---------23:10----------
reactions but they think that their gut


---------23:12----------
reactions are well thought out


---------23:14----------
so an example of type 2 reasoning is


---------23:16----------
differential diagnosis


---------23:18----------
so generally speaking type 2


---------23:20----------
reasoning is cognitive


---------23:24----------
it's intense


---------23:26----------
and it feels bad


---------23:28----------
people don't enjoy doing it they


---------23:30----------
actually don't enjoy being like logical


---------23:32----------
or methodical


---------23:34----------
so literally what we have to do with


---------23:35----------
doctors is we have to spend years like


---------23:38----------
literally years of cognitive training


---------23:40----------
for them to go from this to this


---------23:43----------
so generally speaking a doctor usually


---------23:45----------
has a hypothesis about what's wrong with


---------23:47----------
a patient within five minutes of like


---------23:49----------
seeing the patient sometimes even less


---------23:51----------
like you kind of got an idea of like


---------23:53----------
what's going on


---------23:54----------
but what we spend years actually


---------23:56----------
training is to not trust our gut and


---------23:59----------
start to be systematic in the way that


---------24:00----------
we approach patients and that's how we


---------24:02----------
don't miss things okay so there's a lot


---------24:05----------
of really interesting research as well


---------24:06----------
about you know why uh family members


---------24:08----------
shouldn't be physicians because it's


---------24:10----------
hard for family members to do type 2


---------24:12----------
reasoning with like with your family or


---------24:14----------
sorry it's hard for physicians to do


---------24:16----------
type 2 reasoning with their family so


---------24:18----------
the interesting thing about type 2


---------24:19----------
reasoning is that this leads to better


---------24:21----------
results but it feels really hard it's


---------24:23----------
like cognitively very intense you know


---------24:25----------
when um you know if you're studying and


---------24:27----------
you find studying boring that's like an


---------24:30----------
example of like type 2 reasoning it's


---------24:32----------
not it's a bit of a stretch there but


---------24:34----------
all of the activities that human beings


---------24:37----------
find like cognitively cumbersome or


---------24:39----------
boring tend to be closer to type 2


---------24:41----------
reasoning and the real tricky thing that


---------24:43----------
also kahneman discovered is that


---------24:45----------
everyone thinks they operate from here i


---------24:47----------
mean sorry everyone thinks they operate


---------24:49----------
from here but most people actually


---------24:51----------
operate from here most of our decisions


---------24:53----------
like when you think about what you want


---------24:54----------
to eat today you don't sit down with a


---------24:56----------
chart of all possible foods and do


---------24:59----------
calculations about caloric inputs and


---------25:01----------
vitamin needs and like all this kind of


---------25:03----------
stuff it's sort of like i kind of feel


---------25:05----------
like eating this


---------25:06----------
right if you think about your grocery


---------25:08----------
shopping like you may have a list but


---------25:10----------
where did that list come from it wasn't


---------25:12----------
a list of all possible things that you


---------25:13----------
could eat it was sort of like okay we


---------25:15----------
need more of this well where did that


---------25:17----------
idea come from well


---------25:19----------
the fruit bowl is empty so we need more


---------25:21----------
bananas like it's all just random ass


---------25:23----------
gut-oriented non-methodical thinking


---------25:26----------
this is also where advice comes from


---------25:30----------
right so like if you think about it and


---------25:31----------
someone gives you advice


---------25:33----------
you know if you talk to someone about


---------25:35----------
their pro your problems


---------25:37----------
how much time do they spend thinking


---------25:40----------
about what's the best advice they could


---------25:42----------
get it's a fluid conversation they spend


---------25:44----------
all of like two seconds if even that


---------25:46----------
right they listen to you for a while


---------25:47----------
like hey i think you should do this even


---------25:49----------
i do that


---------25:51----------
so what i present on stream most of the


---------25:53----------
time when i'm doing q a is type one


---------25:54----------
reasoning it's just like my gut so you


---------25:57----------
can refine your gut over time and we'll


---------25:59----------
kind of get get to that but this lecture


---------26:02----------
is type two reasoning


---------26:03----------
it took a long time for me to like write


---------26:05----------
out right so i have like a whole script


---------26:07----------
i sat down i can answer questions about


---------26:10----------
motivation but if i actually want to


---------26:12----------
offer like a complete educational


---------26:14----------
experience i have to do type 2 reasoning


---------26:16----------
and it takes me like six or eight hours


---------26:18----------
whereas like i can just show up and talk


---------26:19----------
about motivation that's easy peasy lemon


---------26:21----------
squeezy done


---------26:22----------
y'all with me


---------26:24----------
so


---------26:25----------
here's how we're going to help our


---------26:26----------
clients we're going to engage in type 2


---------26:28----------
reasoning by giving them a choice so you


---------26:31----------
as a coach are going to ask open-ended


---------26:33----------
questions okay so if our if our target


---------26:35----------
is is wait okay let's


---------26:37----------
someone give me a target that i can run


---------26:38----------
through for the whole lecture


---------26:41----------
what's a target


---------26:42----------
what's something that people want to do


---------26:50----------
what do you mean by target just like


---------26:52----------
what's a goal that someone will come in


---------26:54----------
on


---------26:55----------
like


---------26:57----------
okay i'm gonna take one from chat it's


---------26:59----------
work out


---------27:01----------
okay


---------27:02----------
this is our target


---------27:04----------
so


---------27:05----------
one of the the questions that we could


---------27:06----------
ask people is you know we could ask


---------27:08----------
people okay like um


---------27:10----------
what are the ways


---------27:15----------
in which you could work out


---------27:22----------
okay so we're gonna start with like an


---------27:23----------
open-ended question and then they're


---------27:25----------
gonna give you a couple of answers like


---------27:27----------
uh like it's like most of the time when


---------27:29----------
people say work out like they're gonna


---------27:30----------
jump straight to like i need to go to


---------27:31----------
the gym every day y'all see that it's


---------27:33----------
like automatic there's not even like uh


---------27:35----------
what are my options and then they they


---------27:37----------
say like like even asking that question


---------27:39----------
is gonna lead to like i suspect a small


---------27:43----------
uh like improvement in outcomes okay so


---------27:45----------
they can say i can go to the gym i can


---------27:47----------
work out at home


---------27:48----------
i can go for a run so you want to


---------27:50----------
generate as many options as you can okay


---------27:54----------
i could work out with friends


---------27:56----------
i could do push-ups


---------27:58----------
while i'm waiting in queue for a game


---------28:03----------
right and so like you want to generate


---------28:05----------
as many options as you can and then i


---------28:07----------
know it sounds kind of weird and then


---------28:08----------
you just repeat the options back and


---------28:10----------
you're like which one do you think


---------28:13----------
which which one do you want to do do you


---------28:15----------
want to try


---------28:18----------
so already in this process like maybe


---------28:21----------
the gym sucks like like sure that's what


---------28:23----------
other people do right like other people


---------28:25----------
go to the gym but i have a ton of social


---------28:26----------
anxiety and feel ashamed of myself so


---------28:28----------
that may be a terrible idea


---------28:30----------
but like that person


---------28:32----------
without your help they're gonna have


---------28:34----------
this goal they're gonna come up with a


---------28:36----------
solution based on type one reasoning and


---------28:38----------
they're gonna stay stuck forever and


---------28:39----------
never work out that's why people wanna


---------28:40----------
work out and don't work out because they


---------28:42----------
don't go through this process so just by


---------28:44----------
generating this process we begin to see


---------28:46----------
okay this is what your individual


---------28:48----------
preferences are what do you want to try


---------28:49----------
and they can say okay i want to try


---------28:50----------
working out at home


---------28:52----------
okay so you've already won there like


---------28:54----------
that's already better than like what


---------28:56----------
most people do


---------28:58----------
so the next thing that we want to do is


---------29:00----------
just like kind of refine that choice


---------29:02----------
over time right so like what could you


---------29:03----------
do at home


---------29:09----------
right they're like oh i guess i could do


---------29:10----------
like push-ups


---------29:12----------
i could do yoga


---------29:14----------
i could do


---------29:16----------
parkour


---------29:18----------
you know like whatever like they can


---------29:19----------
come up with whatever like stuff they


---------29:21----------
want and we'll kind of get to the


---------29:22----------
different dimensions of goal setting at


---------29:24----------
the end but the key point here is that


---------29:26----------
you want to give them a choice


---------29:28----------
because when people make a choice and


---------29:29----------
you all remember from the stages of


---------29:31----------
change change model this is why planning


---------29:33----------
and action are actually like


---------29:35----------
scientifically or psychologically


---------29:37----------
discreet steps


---------29:39----------
they're not the same planning it


---------29:40----------
planning an action is the one that most


---------29:42----------
clients like don't realize are actually


---------29:44----------
cognitively discreet steps so this is


---------29:47----------
all planning phase


---------29:50----------
okay from stages of change model


---------29:53----------
and so this is how you work with someone


---------29:54----------
in the planning phase you give them a


---------29:56----------
menu of options and then what happens


---------29:58----------
when you give them a menu is they're


---------29:59----------
going to gravitate towards the most


---------30:00----------
likely scenarios and sort of set


---------30:02----------
themselves up for the most success okay


---------30:05----------
questions about


---------30:06----------
giving people choices instead of advice


---------30:11----------
oh one question so


---------30:13----------
does this evidently lead to like a


---------30:15----------
solution for that for the client


---------30:17----------
yep yes right okay so like this is gonna


---------30:20----------
end up with a plan


---------30:21----------
like instead of jumping straight from i


---------30:23----------
want to work out to the gym this is


---------30:25----------
going to be like okay you're going to do


---------30:27----------
yoga every morning


---------30:31----------
and then you're going to do push-ups


---------30:33----------
while cueing


---------30:36----------
for a league of legends game


---------30:39----------
while you're waiting for fortnite cue


---------30:42----------
okay like that that's how you develop a


---------30:44----------
plan this is going to be like more


---------30:45----------
attainable for them


---------30:47----------
and we'll get to you know why this for


---------30:49----------
example probably won't work but anyway


---------30:53----------
so the second thing that we're gonna do


---------30:54----------
so this will lead to a plan but it's one


---------30:56----------
of the steps of planning brian so the


---------30:58----------
second step of planning is


---------30:59----------
operationalizing do you guys know what


---------31:01----------
operationalizing a problem is you all


---------31:04----------
heard that term before


---------31:06----------
like breaking it down


---------31:08----------
yep breaking it down


---------31:10----------
what does that do for us


---------31:14----------
makes things concrete


---------31:16----------
yep how does that help


---------31:19----------
well now they're not abstract and you


---------31:20----------
can actually do them because something


---------31:22----------
abstract is essentially like


---------31:24----------
insurmountable


---------31:25----------
okay very good right so you can't take


---------31:28----------
abstract action


---------31:30----------
i can't get into shape it isn't possible


---------31:32----------
welcome forrest by the way bro how you


---------31:34----------
been


---------31:36----------
surviving and thriving


---------31:38----------
awesome dude


---------31:39----------
good to see you


---------31:40----------
um


---------31:41----------
what else how else would y'all describe


---------31:44----------
operationalizing


---------31:47----------
it kind of increases the amount of


---------31:49----------
achievable steps there are in absolutely


---------31:53----------
achievable steps


---------31:55----------
okay


---------31:56----------
so we have this part of our brain called


---------31:58----------
the frontal lobe all right and the


---------32:00----------
frontal lobe is good at operationalizing


---------32:03----------
so i don't know if you guys kind of know


---------32:05----------
this but you know like when some kids


---------32:07----------
uh apply to college their parents help


---------32:10----------
them manage the application process


---------32:12----------
y'all familiar with that


---------32:15----------
so let me ask you something why does the


---------32:17----------
kid


---------32:18----------
need the parent


---------32:20----------
to help them with the application


---------32:21----------
process


---------32:22----------
and how is it that the parent is able to


---------32:24----------
help them with the application process


---------32:27----------
to begin with


---------32:28----------
right why can't the kid just do it on


---------32:30----------
their own


---------32:35----------
just apply to college easy


---------32:38----------
well isn't it because like two things


---------32:39----------
like one and never applied to college in


---------32:42----------
two i guess they don't understand like


---------32:44----------
the actual process of like falling


---------32:46----------
through that decision


---------32:47----------
yeah right so so it's really interesting


---------32:50----------
because like maybe the parents have


---------32:51----------
applied but not always


---------32:53----------
and then the second thing is that like


---------32:55----------
the parents may have some ability to


---------32:58----------
like understand the process so we have


---------33:00----------
this part of our brain called the


---------33:01----------
frontal lobe and the frontal lobe is


---------33:03----------
responsible for executive function


---------33:06----------
and what executive function means is the


---------33:08----------
ability to plan and execute tasks


---------33:11----------
so it's like a literally this ability to


---------33:13----------
operationalize so if i look at you know


---------33:16----------
so this is kind of my favorite example


---------33:18----------
but it applies to college and stuff too


---------33:20----------
so if i tell by a two-year-old to clean


---------33:22----------
her room she can't do that


---------33:26----------
i can tell her i can ask her to put her


---------33:29----------
books away so she can do that


---------33:31----------
but she can't clean her room because


---------33:33----------
cleaning her room is an abstract


---------33:37----------
process


---------33:39----------
and based on what her frontal lobe is


---------33:41----------
capable of


---------33:42----------
i have to break as an adult i have to


---------33:44----------
break it down into books


---------33:47----------
toys


---------33:48----------
and pencils


---------33:50----------
right and even if you look at the


---------33:52----------
the brain of a one-year-old they can't


---------33:54----------
even put away the pencils but i can tell


---------33:57----------
them hey here's a pencil can you go put


---------33:58----------
it in the box


---------34:00----------
so like putting things in boxes


---------34:05----------
right so if we look at what's the


---------34:06----------
difference between an adult and a kid


---------34:09----------
maybe it's experience but it may not


---------34:10----------
even be experience it's just that an


---------34:13----------
adult has a fully developed frontal lobe


---------34:15----------
so they can take this abstract process


---------34:17----------
of applying to college and like divide


---------34:19----------
it into chunks


---------34:20----------
and give their kid like a chunk that


---------34:22----------
they can manage


---------34:24----------
and so if we talk about you know like a


---------34:26----------
six-year-old or a ten-year-old a


---------34:27----------
ten-year-old can clean their room right


---------34:29----------
and even like


---------34:31----------
theoretically because i imagine we have


---------34:33----------
a lot of people myself included who


---------34:34----------
don't have clean rooms


---------34:35----------
um


---------34:36----------
so even sometimes adults can't clean


---------34:38----------
rooms but


---------34:39----------
so this is the process of executive


---------34:41----------
function so one of the ways that you can


---------34:42----------
help people succeed is like if i tell a


---------34:45----------
two-year-old to clean their room they're


---------34:46----------
gonna fail like they're destined to


---------34:48----------
failure so as a coach you can help


---------34:50----------
someone


---------34:51----------
by operationalizing for them


---------34:54----------
operationalizing is a very cognitively


---------34:56----------
intensive task that once again is like


---------35:00----------
you know difficult for people to do they


---------35:02----------
may think they can do it they may beat


---------35:04----------
themselves up for you know because they


---------35:07----------
should be able to do it but they may


---------35:08----------
actually be hard it may be hard to do


---------35:11----------
and this is something that's also a


---------35:12----------
little bit theoretical i don't know


---------35:14----------
there's actually good science behind


---------35:15----------
this but in my experience gamers


---------35:17----------
especially are very bad at


---------35:19----------
operationalizing


---------35:21----------
problems


---------35:22----------
so if you look at video games


---------35:24----------
all of the operationalizing has been


---------35:26----------
done for you right there's part one of


---------35:28----------
the main quest part two of the main


---------35:30----------
quests part three the main quest part


---------35:31----------
for the main quest part five of the main


---------35:33----------
quest and then there's the final boss


---------35:36----------
so gamers excel a lot they actually do


---------35:38----------
really well with something that i call


---------35:40----------
close-ended problem solving


---------35:46----------
which is when they're given a discrete


---------35:48----------
task and all of the tools necessary


---------35:52----------
okay so if i like tell a gamer hey i


---------35:55----------
want you to


---------35:57----------
build a car


---------35:59----------
out of tape


---------36:00----------
they'll actually be able to do that


---------36:02----------
like you give them a task with the goal


---------36:05----------
very clear and all of the pieces laid


---------36:07----------
out it's basically like they're good at


---------36:09----------
assembling legos


---------36:11----------
right they're awesome at legos


---------36:13----------
because you could tell them hey i want


---------36:15----------
you to build you know a tree with legos


---------36:17----------
they can do that


---------36:19----------
um maybe even superior to the the


---------36:21----------
average population by the way what


---------36:23----------
they're bad at is open-ended


---------36:24----------
problem-solving


---------36:26----------
which is


---------36:27----------
things like


---------36:29----------
getting into college


---------36:31----------
right because what like what are the


---------36:32----------
pieces of that like i don't really know


---------36:34----------
like who where do i apply to i don't


---------36:37----------
really know do i apply nationally


---------36:38----------
internationally like


---------36:40----------
you know


---------36:42----------
you know like i i don't know i don't


---------36:43----------
know like where to start with that so as


---------36:46----------
a coach one of the key things that you


---------36:47----------
can help them do is convert an


---------36:49----------
open-ended problems uh problem into a


---------36:51----------
closed-ended problem you want to act as


---------36:53----------
their frontal lobe and break an abstract


---------36:56----------
task


---------36:58----------
into achievable steps


---------37:03----------
right and so this is we kind of did this


---------37:05----------
right here


---------37:07----------
do you all see that this is actually


---------37:08----------
operationalizing for them okay so you're


---------37:10----------
gonna do yoga every morning notice how i


---------37:12----------
defined am over here so how did i get


---------37:14----------
that it's because i'm gonna ask another


---------37:16----------
question when


---------37:19----------
could you do yoga


---------37:23----------
right so this is how we're going to


---------37:24----------
operationalize and break the task apart


---------37:27----------
so this week what you're going to do


---------37:29----------
you're not going to find a job


---------37:31----------
this week what you're going to do is


---------37:34----------
we may even say something like


---------37:37----------
make your resume but that's even too


---------37:38----------
abstract this week what you're going to


---------37:40----------
do is google three different resume


---------37:43----------
templates take a look at them and decide


---------37:45----------
which one you want to use


---------37:48----------
then what you're going gonna do is


---------37:49----------
you're gonna replace the demographic


---------37:51----------
information at the top so you're gonna


---------37:53----------
replace the john smith at the top with


---------37:55----------
like your actual name and your address


---------37:58----------
and then what you're gonna do is grab a


---------37:59----------
piece of paper and write down all of the


---------38:01----------
things that you think could belong on


---------38:03----------
the resume


---------38:05----------
that's your task for the week right it's


---------38:07----------
like two or three tasks but they're like


---------38:08----------
super simple if you really think about


---------38:10----------
it takes like less than half an hour and


---------38:12----------
then next week they've already started


---------38:14----------
adding they're editing their resume at


---------38:15----------
least the top part is done the next week


---------38:17----------
it's going to be translating what they


---------38:19----------
put on their piece of paper onto the


---------38:21----------
resume


---------38:22----------
and once you do that then we're going to


---------38:24----------
look at your resume together and we're


---------38:25----------
going to try to figure out okay how can


---------38:27----------
we make this sound good so you're going


---------38:29----------
to take one task on your resume and


---------38:32----------
you're gonna try to like sell it in some


---------38:34----------
way


---------38:35----------
so for example if you were


---------38:38----------
president of your esports


---------38:40----------
gaming association in college


---------38:43----------
right like how can we buff that up some


---------38:45----------
so you can state that and then you can


---------38:47----------
say i increased membership over 300


---------38:50----------
percent like over the course of one year


---------38:53----------
you know organized a 50 000 charity


---------38:55----------
tournament and organized 200 students


---------38:59----------
into like organized an event


---------39:01----------
that involved sponsors 200 students and


---------39:05----------
all that kind of stuff so you're


---------39:06----------
demonstrating on your resume like


---------39:07----------
president of esports or what does that


---------39:09----------
mean like is that a thing but when you


---------39:11----------
start like


---------39:12----------
listing things out that like an employer


---------39:14----------
will be like oh wow so this person can


---------39:16----------
like get stuff done this is actually


---------39:17----------
pretty cool they organized an event


---------39:19----------
okay so you may have to help them a


---------39:21----------
little bit with their and and that may


---------39:22----------
be a little bit tricky in terms of


---------39:24----------
resume building but do you all see how


---------39:26----------
the key thing is breaking apart the


---------39:28----------
pieces of like making a resume


---------39:31----------
is that clear


---------39:32----------
so you want to operationalize out their


---------39:34----------
task as best as possible


---------39:37----------
when you do that the chances of them


---------39:39----------
being able to succeed will be a lot


---------39:41----------
better


---------39:43----------
key other things you know so when we


---------39:44----------
talk about achievable steps that also


---------39:47----------
you know helps us uh where is it


---------39:50----------
where's positive reinforcement there it


---------39:52----------
is


---------39:53----------
right so we get a plus there and we get


---------39:54----------
a plus there as you kind of do these


---------39:56----------
things okay


---------39:58----------
so we're going to help them with their


---------39:59----------
frontal lobes the cool thing is as you


---------40:01----------
engage in this process with them over


---------40:03----------
time


---------40:04----------
you're engaging in type 2 reasoning


---------40:06----------
which will


---------40:08----------
over time actually become type one


---------40:10----------
reasoning


---------40:11----------
okay so then they'll actually get


---------40:12----------
automatic at doing this kind of stuff


---------40:14----------
they'll be able to break apart tasks for


---------40:16----------
themselves so the first time i teach my


---------40:18----------
kid how to clean up their room


---------40:20----------
i have to like direct them right but as


---------40:22----------
they practice their brain is able to


---------40:24----------
operationalize that task and i could


---------40:26----------
even take them to a house they've never


---------40:27----------
been to and i could say clean up this


---------40:29----------
room and they could do it


---------40:31----------
make sense


---------40:33----------
so that's the second thing that we're


---------40:34----------
going to kind of focus on


---------40:36----------
our second principle that we can


---------40:37----------
leverage so now we're going to move on


---------40:39----------
to number three which is dunning-kruger


---------40:41----------
so


---------40:44----------
dunning-kruger graph


---------40:45----------
has


---------40:47----------
um you know so this is


---------40:50----------
unconscious


---------40:52----------
this is competence


---------40:55----------
right so i i may be miss attributing


---------40:57----------
this


---------40:59----------
so


---------41:01----------
generally speaking we start up here


---------41:04----------
where we're unconsciously incompetent


---------41:07----------
and at the end we end up this may not be


---------41:09----------
done in kruger actually


---------41:11----------
i think it relates to don and kruger but


---------41:12----------
and up here we sort of end up with


---------41:14----------
unconscious competence i'm a natural


---------41:17----------
right and if we think about playing a


---------41:18----------
video game like you know there are times


---------41:21----------
where


---------41:22----------
you suck


---------41:23----------
and you intentionally try to get better


---------41:26----------
and your brain is like doing the


---------41:28----------
cognitive work


---------41:29----------
so


---------41:30----------
and then over time you know so this is


---------41:33----------
conscious incompetence and then we move


---------41:35----------
over here


---------41:36----------
to


---------41:37----------
conscious competence


---------41:41----------
right that's what what this is over here


---------41:43----------
and then eventually we move up to


---------41:45----------
unconscious


---------41:46----------
competence and then it becomes easy so


---------41:48----------
we're natural over here


---------41:51----------
over here we're oblivious


---------41:54----------
so one of the key things this is


---------41:57----------
a little bit more anecdotal or based on


---------42:00----------
my own experience


---------42:01----------
but i think our goal so a lot of people


---------42:04----------
when they think about achieving their


---------42:05----------
goals what they want to do is they want


---------42:07----------
to go from here to here


---------42:08----------
right this is where you start i suck i


---------42:10----------
don't know how to work out this is me


---------42:12----------
working out every day


---------42:13----------
i think our job as a coach is not


---------42:16----------
actually to move along this axis


---------42:18----------
our job as a coach is to push people


---------42:20----------
down here


---------42:22----------
what we want them to do is to start


---------42:23----------
thinking about it right so what we


---------42:26----------
really want to emphasize is like


---------42:27----------
conscious thought process we want to


---------42:29----------
emphasize type 2 reasoning we want to


---------42:32----------
emphasize being methodical we want to


---------42:34----------
emphasize being critical of your process


---------42:37----------
we want to emphasize problem solving in


---------42:39----------
a very organized and conscious way this


---------42:42----------
is being thoughtful being mindful being


---------42:44----------
present all that crap


---------42:46----------
so one of the key things that that this


---------42:48----------
process does


---------42:50----------
right is we ask people these like


---------42:52----------
different kinds of questions and things


---------42:53----------
like that is we're making the process of


---------42:56----------
goal setting become competent conscious


---------43:00----------
so you don't know how to set a good goal


---------43:02----------
that's fine even after asking you a few


---------43:04----------
questions you're going to be down here


---------43:06----------
you're still not going to know how to


---------43:06----------
set a good goal right you may come up


---------43:08----------
with push-ups between while cueing but


---------43:10----------
who the does push-ups while queuing


---------43:12----------
no one come on that's ridiculous


---------43:15----------
right


---------43:16----------
the point though is not that these are


---------43:18----------
gonna succeed we'll get there in a


---------43:19----------
second when it comes troubleshooting


---------43:21----------
goals and iteration and all that kind of


---------43:22----------
stuff the point of doing this exercise


---------43:25----------
is that people are going to be thinking


---------43:27----------
about it in a critical and calculating


---------43:29----------
way


---------43:30----------
that's ultimately what leads to success


---------43:32----------
in goal setting


---------43:33----------
is bringing things from the unconscious


---------43:35----------
to the conscious and now that we're


---------43:37----------
aware of the problem right because


---------43:38----------
remember that most of our problems are


---------43:40----------
lying dormant they're invisible we can't


---------43:42----------
detect them and then we can't deal with


---------43:43----------
them you all know this through coaching


---------43:45----------
right this is what the emotional


---------43:46----------
catharsis is you all have done this with


---------43:47----------
all of your clients where you've helped


---------43:49----------
them understand something in a way that


---------43:51----------
they didn't understand anymore


---------43:53----------
and that understanding proceeds change


---------43:56----------
so we know this you guys already know


---------43:57----------
how to do this process i suspect just


---------43:59----------
keep doing what you're doing


---------44:01----------
and once it's conscious then we can


---------44:03----------
start acting on it right you don't go


---------44:05----------
from here to here you don't go from here


---------44:07----------
to here you go from here to here then


---------44:09----------
you start doing being successful but


---------44:12----------
being successful involves being


---------44:13----------
conscious first


---------44:15----------
then you become successful and then it


---------44:17----------
becomes easy then you get to the person


---------44:19----------
who's in shape and you ask them how hard


---------44:22----------
is it for you to work out and they say


---------44:23----------
it's not that hard


---------44:25----------
it's natural for me and this is where


---------44:27----------
everyone wants to go but since all of


---------44:30----------
our clients want to go from here to here


---------44:32----------
they want to actually ignore where the


---------44:34----------
money happens this is where change


---------44:36----------
happens change happens down here not up


---------44:38----------
here and as long as they keep on doing


---------44:40----------
this they're doomed to failure


---------44:42----------
so your job as a coach is to help them


---------44:44----------
become conscious


---------44:46----------
even if they fail be conscious


---------44:48----------
be conscious of your failure because


---------44:50----------
that's what's going to help you succeed


---------44:52----------
questions about that


---------44:58----------
okay


---------45:00----------
now we're going to move on to


---------45:02----------
number three on our big topics which is


---------45:04----------
troubleshooting goal setting


---------45:08----------
okay


---------45:09----------
so what are the problems with the goals


---------45:11----------
this open-ended question kind of read my


---------45:13----------
mind question what are the problems with


---------45:15----------
the goals that our clients set


---------45:18----------
what are the different kinds of


---------45:19----------
challenges they have with goal setting


---------45:24----------
let's even don't even think about what


---------45:25----------
they set what are the what are the


---------45:27----------
problems that what when you when clients


---------45:29----------
come in


---------45:30----------
what are their what are their challenges


---------45:31----------
around like setting goals or


---------45:33----------
you know just


---------45:35----------
okay


---------45:36----------
chats helping expectations oh what does


---------45:38----------
that mean expectations


---------45:40----------
oh they have like


---------45:42----------
like a higher like expected outcome


---------45:44----------
based on their actions okay so


---------45:47----------
very good so they're gonna have overly


---------45:49----------
ambitious goals


---------45:54----------
what else


---------46:01----------
maybe goals that don't really align with


---------46:03----------
their values


---------46:05----------
very good misdirected goals


---------46:13----------
what else


---------46:25----------
the last one


---------46:26----------
is remarkably


---------46:29----------
common


---------46:30----------
and


---------46:32----------
also really easy to miss


---------46:34----------
because i may be set is setting it up to


---------46:37----------
fail


---------46:42----------
they lack goals


---------46:45----------
right we see this too where someone


---------46:47----------
comes in and they're like i don't even


---------46:48----------
know where to start


---------46:51----------
there's no point anymore


---------46:53----------
right so we still have to think about


---------46:54----------
that person in terms of goal setting


---------46:55----------
like we owe it to that person to help


---------46:57----------
them find an appropriate goal okay so


---------46:59----------
here's the problem that we run into with


---------47:01----------
goals is that some people lack goals to


---------47:04----------
begin with


---------47:05----------
and they don't know where to start how


---------47:06----------
should we deal with the person who lacks


---------47:07----------
goals


---------47:12----------
what do you all think


---------47:19----------
maybe kind of trying to understand them


---------47:20----------
a little bit more try and get a feel for


---------47:22----------
like


---------47:23----------
what they want to do absolutely right so


---------47:26----------
like this is where the first like we


---------47:28----------
just need to understand them


---------47:31----------
so before we figure out where we want to


---------47:33----------
go let's like triangulate our gps and


---------47:35----------
figure out where we are


---------47:37----------
right so where are we


---------47:40----------
what's going on in your life


---------47:43----------
right so and this is you all know how to


---------47:44----------
do this i'm pretty confident right so


---------47:46----------
they don't they feel overwhelmed they


---------47:48----------
feel directionless they feel hopeless so


---------47:50----------
it's like all these questions about okay


---------47:51----------
like why do you feel hopeless like where


---------47:53----------
does the hopelessness come from you know


---------47:55----------
why don't you have like you know you


---------47:57----------
don't ask why questions but um you know


---------47:59----------
what makes it hard for you to pick a


---------48:00----------
direction to go and you're gonna uncover


---------48:03----------
all kinds of crap like oh there's no


---------48:05----------
point in trying okay like when did you


---------48:07----------
give up hope like when did you learn how


---------48:08----------
to give up hope you guys know all this


---------48:09----------
stuff right pretty familiar we good okay


---------48:12----------
so if they lack goals it's going to be


---------48:13----------
like


---------48:14----------
exploratory work


---------48:18----------
it's not about directing them anywhere


---------48:20----------
it's about exploration


---------48:22----------
so for clients who have overly ambitious


---------48:24----------
goals


---------48:25----------
what are we going to do for them


---------48:34----------
start with the 25 rule


---------48:36----------
sure so 25 rule is good


---------48:41----------
what else


---------48:43----------
why are their goals overly ambitious


---------48:51----------
um i think we would


---------48:53----------
try to make them


---------48:55----------
like let them figure out that their goal


---------48:56----------
is actually ambitious


---------48:58----------
yep good so increase in sight


---------49:04----------
into


---------49:06----------
overly ambitious goals


---------49:09----------
good


---------49:12----------
i'm pretty confident that you guys are


---------49:13----------
able to do that as well but why are


---------49:15----------
their goals ambitious


---------49:18----------
eli


---------49:20----------
you figured this out some time ago


---------49:27----------
because yeah they're comparing


---------49:29----------
themselves to others and it's not


---------49:31----------
it's not enough all that crap right so


---------49:33----------
this is where


---------49:34----------
enter all of the things that you guys


---------49:36----------
are already experts in shoulds


---------49:39----------
not enough


---------49:42----------
comparison


---------49:45----------
ahamkar


---------49:48----------
all this crap comes in


---------49:50----------
so the key thing here is you've got to


---------49:51----------
deconstruct the idea of should


---------49:54----------
right and i think you guys know how to


---------49:56----------
do this


---------49:59----------
because what does that mean like


---------50:01----------
or enough


---------50:04----------
because like that's not a thing


---------50:06----------
enough is not a thing


---------50:09----------
right and you can make the argument that


---------50:11----------
it is a thing you can say okay i did not


---------50:15----------
get a score high enough to pass the


---------50:17----------
class


---------50:18----------
dr k clearly that's the thing i didn't


---------50:20----------
pass the class okay fair enough


---------50:22----------
so like enough can absolutely be a thing


---------50:24----------
there's a reason why there's a word for


---------50:26----------
it but i would say that most of the


---------50:28----------
times


---------50:30----------
whether


---------50:31----------
some


---------50:32----------
outcome is enough or not enough because


---------50:34----------
enough is an outcome orientation


---------50:37----------
whether you do something that is enough


---------50:39----------
or not enough is completely or whether


---------50:41----------
it's enough or not enough is completely


---------50:43----------
independent of what you do


---------50:45----------
does that make sense


---------50:47----------
so i can study every day


---------50:51----------
or i can study as much as i can and


---------50:53----------
maybe that'll be not enough


---------50:56----------
but


---------50:57----------
do i want this to determine what how i


---------51:00----------
take action in the present


---------51:02----------
or do i want to focus on this and then


---------51:04----------
just hope that this happens so the


---------51:07----------
problem with the idea of not enough is


---------51:09----------
that as people are like thinking about


---------51:10----------
not enough it actually paralyzes them


---------51:12----------
from taking action and destroys their


---------51:14----------
motivation so you really have to


---------51:16----------
deconstruct the idea of like enough and


---------51:18----------
should and all this kind of crap through


---------51:20----------
all of these things which i know you all


---------51:21----------
can do so you kind of do that if they


---------51:23----------
have overly ambitious goals right and


---------51:25----------
then on a more practical level so this


---------51:27----------
is like on a philosophical level


---------51:29----------
what you need to do as a coach


---------51:31----------
oh no i missed an oh


---------51:37----------
and on a practical level you can help


---------51:40----------
them set more ambitious goals and be


---------51:42----------
prepared for that resistance right and


---------51:44----------
so you like as soon as you try to use


---------51:45----------
the 25 rule on them they're gonna say


---------51:47----------
it's not enough but you're gonna be


---------51:49----------
ready for them because you know all this


---------51:50----------
stuff and then you're gonna be like


---------51:51----------
let's talk about that right you're gonna


---------51:53----------
work through all this crap then they're


---------51:55----------
gonna set an appropriate goal and then


---------51:56----------
they're more likely to achieve it we


---------51:58----------
good


---------52:00----------
another key point here is that sometimes


---------52:01----------
people confuse goals with wish lists


---------52:06----------
i don't know if you all have ever done


---------52:07----------
this yourselves or you've heard someone


---------52:09----------
else or where like you start to set a


---------52:10----------
goal for yourself and then you start


---------52:12----------
tacking more on


---------52:13----------
it's like i should work out every day


---------52:15----------
and i should eat healthy and i should


---------52:17----------
have a smoothie every morning and then


---------52:19----------
like goals like quickly like spiral into


---------52:20----------
wishlists and then it's like


---------52:22----------
everything when a goal turns into a wish


---------52:25----------
list you're destroying your frontal


---------52:26----------
lobe's ability to do any of it it


---------52:28----------
becomes overwhelming it's too many goals


---------52:30----------
so you're going to help them kind of


---------52:31----------
scale back okay


---------52:33----------
so number three


---------52:35----------
the misdirected goal


---------52:40----------
so this is


---------52:41----------
the hardest thing about coaching


---------52:44----------
is that sometimes clients come in and


---------52:46----------
they have the wrong goals and you may


---------52:48----------
say dr k that's ridiculous how can a


---------52:51----------
client have a wrong goal isn't it for


---------52:53----------
them to determine aren't they the ones


---------52:55----------
to decide incorrect sometimes our


---------52:58----------
clients are stupid let me give you an


---------53:00----------
example so i had a client that came in


---------53:02----------
one day and said dr k my boat is sinking


---------53:05----------
i need a bigger bucket i need a bigger


---------53:07----------
bucket this bucket is not big enough to


---------53:09----------
get all the water out of my boat


---------53:12----------
can you give me a bigger bucket


---------53:14----------
and what they need to do is plug the


---------53:16----------
holes


---------53:18----------
so like this is where type one reasoning


---------53:20----------
comes in again right because it's clear


---------53:21----------
because the person's logical if they've


---------53:23----------
got a bigger bucket they can bail water


---------53:25----------
faster and they'll you know like that's


---------53:27----------
what that'll fix it right


---------53:30----------
but their goal is coming from like an


---------53:32----------
incorrect understanding of the problem


---------53:34----------
and this is where you can roll in a


---------53:36----------
bunch of stuff that we've talked about


---------53:38----------
like jung's shadow


---------53:41----------
right we can talk about things like


---------53:42----------
alexithymia


---------53:46----------
you know like psychological defense


---------53:48----------
mechanisms like suppression


---------53:51----------
we can talk about ahamkar


---------53:54----------
blind spots


---------53:56----------
right because the ahamkar won't let them


---------53:58----------
see where the real problem is


---------54:00----------
oh yeah like if i'm a narcissist the


---------54:02----------
problem is that everyone else is like


---------54:03----------
very insensitive to me people need to be


---------54:06----------
more insensitive to me


---------54:07----------
you know it's like everyone around me is


---------54:09----------
an everyone around me needs to


---------54:10----------
be nicer it's just like i need a bigger


---------54:12----------
bucket no the problem is something else


---------54:14----------
like so your job as a coach is to help


---------54:17----------
people access all this crap


---------54:19----------
cognitive biases


---------54:21----------
and i know you've done it i know all of


---------54:23----------
y'all have done it


---------54:24----------
where a client will come in and will be


---------54:26----------
like you know we'll say one thing and


---------54:28----------
then you're like hey wait a second what


---------54:29----------
you're saying actually doesn't make any


---------54:31----------
sense you point out the discrepancy you


---------54:33----------
point out the cognitive bias you point


---------54:35----------
out the ambivalence


---------54:39----------
right so oh i just need to start


---------54:41----------
drinking after 5 p.m i just need to not


---------54:43----------
drink early


---------54:44----------
well


---------54:45----------
what how do you get to that conclusion


---------54:47----------
well because when i drink after 5 pm


---------54:49----------
everything is fine when i start early


---------54:51----------
it's a problem whereas like the real


---------54:52----------
problem is like maybe you've got a


---------54:53----------
problem with alcohol you should be


---------54:54----------
drinking at all


---------54:55----------
so there are all kinds of things that


---------54:57----------
can result in a misdirected goal


---------54:59----------
so this is once again where y'all you


---------55:01----------
know i'm pretty sure you guys know how


---------55:02----------
to deal with this


---------55:04----------
right do you all feel comfortable with


---------55:05----------
like people who have misdirected goals


---------55:11----------
right so and this is where building a


---------55:12----------
therapeutic alliance is really good this


---------55:14----------
is also where like remember as a coach


---------55:16----------
you're not like you're not there to just


---------55:18----------
agree with whatever they say you're


---------55:19----------
there to challenge them so with clients


---------55:21----------
who have misdirected goals like it's a


---------55:23----------
good place to challenge them once you


---------55:25----------
have an alliance and you can say hey i'm


---------55:27----------
wondering you know if maybe there's a


---------55:29----------
different way to think about how to fix


---------55:30----------
this problem once again recruit type 2


---------55:33----------
reasoning


---------55:35----------
to help them think about you know how


---------55:37----------
they could deal with this problem


---------55:38----------
otherwise like what's a creative


---------55:39----------
solution to your problem


---------55:41----------
because their solutions are not


---------55:43----------
individualized they're not based on


---------55:44----------
their own creativity they're based on


---------55:46----------
what someone on the internet what worked


---------55:47----------
for someone on the internet


---------55:50----------
i watched this


---------55:51----------
person who did this on the internet this


---------55:52----------
is what worked for them so that's what


---------55:54----------
i'm gonna do


---------55:55----------
maybe you have a different problem


---------55:57----------
okay


---------55:59----------
questions about troubleshooting goals


---------56:01----------
or troubleshooting goal setting i should


---------56:03----------
say


---------56:06----------
okay


---------56:07----------
so um


---------56:09----------
now we're going to talk about one other


---------56:10----------
thing in terms of uh


---------56:13----------
kind of how to iterate so we're going to


---------56:14----------
talk about iteration for a second


---------56:17----------
so our approach for goal setting and


---------56:19----------
motivation at healthy gamer is to not


---------56:21----------
achieve your goals it's to iterate


---------56:24----------
success is not our target learning is


---------56:26----------
our target


---------56:28----------
so i don't know that we can succeed but


---------56:30----------
we can certainly try to learn


---------56:32----------
so what we're going to do is we're we're


---------56:34----------
going to give you guys a robust


---------56:35----------
framework for this but you know expect


---------56:38----------
your clients to succeed some


---------56:41----------
and fail some


---------56:46----------
and then what we're gonna do is like do


---------56:48----------
kind of like a post-mortem analysis of


---------56:50----------
like okay why did you fail what got in


---------56:52----------
the way things like that the key thing


---------56:53----------
that i want to share with you all is a


---------56:55----------
really fascinating


---------56:58----------
uh other i guess scientific principle


---------57:00----------
for lack of a better term actually comes


---------57:01----------
from public health is something called


---------57:03----------
positive deviance so often times when


---------57:06----------
our clients have goals and they fall


---------57:08----------
short of their goals their emphasis is


---------57:10----------
on the failure and what they could do


---------57:11----------
better


---------57:12----------
but the interesting thing is that


---------57:14----------
the recipe to success is not necessarily


---------57:17----------
and what they could do better it's


---------57:19----------
actually in the times that they already


---------57:22----------
succeeded


---------57:23----------
so this is a quick story that i'll share


---------57:24----------
with y'all so these were the people who


---------57:26----------
sort of discovered positive deviance


---------57:28----------
there were a group of uh doctors from


---------57:30----------
france in the us


---------57:32----------
that were tasked by the world health


---------57:34----------
organization or someone like that to fix


---------57:36----------
malnutrition in rural vietnam


---------57:39----------
really fascinating story you guys can


---------57:41----------
check out the book positive deviants


---------57:43----------
um so what they did is they went to


---------57:45----------
vietnam and they sort of made all these


---------57:47----------
arrangements and the vietnamese


---------57:48----------
government said like okay our people are


---------57:50----------
malnourished and so these folks were


---------57:52----------
like okay do you all have food that we


---------57:54----------
can give them and the vietnamese


---------57:55----------
government was like yes because the


---------57:57----------
problem to malnourishment is food aid


---------57:59----------
right like if you're in a developing


---------58:00----------
country and people don't have food to


---------58:02----------
eat gg like you just need food just get


---------58:04----------
food easy bro


---------58:05----------
so then they show up and it turns out


---------58:07----------
that there's been some kind of


---------58:08----------
communication problem or maybe


---------58:10----------
corruption and the food aid is no longer


---------58:12----------
there and they've like set they've taken


---------58:14----------
sabbaticals and they're like traveling


---------58:16----------
to vietnam they're going to be there for


---------58:17----------
like six months but now they don't have


---------58:19----------
any of the resources that they were


---------58:20----------
supposed to have to fix this food aid


---------58:22----------
problem


---------58:23----------
and so the vietnamese government was


---------58:24----------
like or whatever the health


---------58:26----------
department or whatever was like we can


---------58:28----------
give you a van lodging and a translator


---------58:31----------
can you please help us with this problem


---------58:33----------
can you please help our population


---------58:34----------
become less malnourished without any


---------58:36----------
food


---------58:37----------
and so these people are like sure why


---------58:39----------
not and so the malnour like the rate of


---------58:41----------
malnutrition amongst like pediatric or


---------58:44----------
amongst kids because it was focused on


---------58:45----------
children was something like 50


---------58:48----------
and so the researchers had this really


---------58:49----------
interesting idea which is like you know


---------58:51----------
there are a thousand people in in let's


---------58:53----------
say this part of rural vietnam


---------58:55----------
and half of them are malnourished that's


---------58:57----------
terrible


---------58:58----------
but why aren't the other half


---------59:00----------
malnourished


---------59:02----------
like it's kind of interesting because


---------59:03----------
there's actually a success


---------59:05----------
there's like some people are not


---------59:06----------
malnourishing like what's up with that


---------59:08----------
and so what they sort of discovered was


---------59:10----------
like this principle of positive deviance


---------59:12----------
which is that if you're trying to figure


---------59:14----------
out how to fix a problem


---------59:15----------
don't focus on the people who are


---------59:17----------
unsuccessful or don't focus on your


---------59:19----------
attempts that are failures focus on your


---------59:21----------
attempts that are successes and by


---------59:23----------
emphasis by exploring why you were


---------59:25----------
successful then and duplicating that you


---------59:28----------
will actually fix the problem of failure


---------59:30----------
in and of itself as it turns out for


---------59:33----------
those of you who are curious what they


---------59:35----------
discovered is that most of the people


---------59:36----------
are malnourished because they're rice


---------59:39----------
farmers and so their primary staple of


---------59:41----------
their diet is rice so they get enough


---------59:43----------
calories but they just don't get enough


---------59:44----------
like protein and micronutrients and


---------59:46----------
stuff like that


---------59:48----------
and so what they discovered is that some


---------59:50----------
families


---------59:51----------
when they're out in the rice fields


---------59:53----------
there are different kinds of like things


---------59:55----------
that are growing in the rice fields so


---------59:56----------
you'll get like small like clams and


---------59:59----------
shrimps and things like that and that


---------60:01----------
some people would literally like have an


---------60:03----------
apron and any time they saw like some


---------60:05----------
tiny bit of fish like like a small fish


---------60:08----------
or a clam or like a shrimp or like some


---------60:10----------
kind of you know


---------60:11----------
water organism crustacean they would


---------60:14----------
scoop it up and stick it in their apron


---------60:16----------
they also found that that this same


---------60:18----------
group of people that there were certain


---------60:20----------
weeds that would grow in the rice fields


---------60:23----------
that are actually very nutritious but


---------60:25----------
are considered like poor people's food


---------60:27----------
so in the in the southern united states


---------60:29----------
for example like if you look at it


---------60:31----------
historically like collard greens were


---------60:33----------
foods that like slaves would would eat


---------60:36----------
because they were considered less


---------60:37----------
desirable so like you know the the slave


---------60:40----------
the plantation owners would eat like the


---------60:42----------
desirable vegetables and then the slaves


---------60:44----------
would eat the collard greens collard


---------60:46----------
greens are delicious by the way


---------60:48----------
and so if you look at recipes for


---------60:49----------
collard greens they all involve like you


---------60:51----------
know like off cuts of pork and things


---------60:54----------
like that so you add like a little bit


---------60:55----------
of bacon and like other like types of


---------60:57----------
meat that you can't it's hard to eat but


---------61:00----------
if you add it to collard greens makes it


---------61:01----------
delicious


---------61:03----------
so um what they sort of discovered is


---------61:05----------
that there's kind of this social stigma


---------61:07----------
against eating this like nutritious


---------61:10----------
vegetable


---------61:11----------
and so that's the way in which like half


---------61:13----------
of the population was not malnourished


---------61:15----------
while the other half of the population


---------61:16----------
was and so by sort of discovering that


---------61:18----------
success and applying it to the other


---------61:20----------
people by teaching the people oh hey you


---------61:22----------
should scoop up shrimp too they also did


---------61:24----------
a couple of other interventions like um


---------61:27----------
they had like they set up like a meal


---------61:28----------
plan where like one family would cook


---------61:31----------
every day for like five or six different


---------61:33----------
people so they kind of got together and


---------61:35----------
shared their cooking duties said like


---------61:37----------
one pot of stew that would serve five


---------61:38----------
families and that worked really well too


---------61:40----------
so discovered a couple of other things


---------61:42----------
but essentially the the the idea behind


---------61:45----------
positive deviance is when you're working


---------61:46----------
with a client our tendency you know if


---------61:49----------
they let's say they you know did yoga


---------61:51----------
for three days


---------61:53----------
and then like failed for four days


---------61:56----------
and their target was


---------61:58----------
yoga


---------61:59----------
every day qd means daily medical


---------62:03----------
abbreviation okay


---------62:04----------
so then what you what we want to do is


---------62:06----------
we can say oh why did you feel like what


---------62:07----------
happened what got in the way but i


---------62:09----------
equally important is asking them you


---------62:11----------
know


---------62:12----------
why did you succeed


---------62:14----------
what were the circumstances


---------62:17----------
for the first three days that allowed


---------62:18----------
you to succeed and what changed on day


---------62:20----------
four so oftentimes i've noticed this


---------62:23----------
bias in how people solve problems is


---------62:26----------
that everyone focuses on the negative in


---------62:28----------
problem solving right if you kind of


---------62:30----------
think about it i do this kind of stuff


---------62:32----------
in all dimensions whether it's


---------62:34----------
investment banking working with traders


---------62:36----------
working with physicians around like like


---------62:38----------
you know


---------62:39----------
uh bad outcomes with patient care even


---------62:41----------
in esports because what everyone focuses


---------62:44----------
on on esports is the games that they


---------62:46----------
lost not the games that they win do you


---------62:48----------
ever watch replays of the games that you


---------62:49----------
crush the opponent not usually right


---------62:52----------
usually if you want to learn we focus on


---------62:54----------
your mistakes


---------62:56----------
um


---------62:58----------
so


---------62:59----------
recruit positive devious deviants and uh


---------63:02----------
focus on


---------63:04----------
how your clients are able to succeed and


---------63:06----------
duplicate that process to troubleshoot


---------63:08----------
goals questions


---------63:14----------
okay


---------63:16----------
last one i recognize i'm out of time


---------63:18----------
dimensions of goals so this we're gonna


---------63:21----------
run through very quickly there'll be a


---------63:23----------
lot more um information in the manual


---------63:26----------
okay


---------63:28----------
so when we think about a goal


---------63:30----------
much like our original


---------63:33----------
um


---------63:34----------
diagram there's a lot of value to be


---------63:36----------
gained out of something like motivation


---------63:40----------
and actually breaking apart motivation


---------63:42----------
into multiple things


---------63:44----------
because there isn't like one motivation


---------63:46----------
lever but when we break it apart into


---------63:48----------
different things we can like adjust the


---------63:50----------
levers in different ways


---------63:52----------
so if we think about even something like


---------63:53----------
language so the more letters we have the


---------63:57----------
more we're able to like


---------63:59----------
compose different words right so


---------64:02----------
increasing the resolution on which we


---------64:04----------
can act increasing the precision at


---------64:07----------
which we can make changes will lead to


---------64:09----------
better outcomes so there's also like a


---------64:11----------
balancing influence and that you know at


---------64:13----------
some point we decided that a collection


---------64:15----------
of letters should make a word instead of


---------64:17----------
you know having one unique word i mean


---------64:20----------
one unique symbol for each word which is


---------64:23----------
what hieroglyphics is which is also like


---------64:25----------
if you look at um you know chinese


---------64:26----------
characters or kanji if you look at


---------64:28----------
emojis right so there's like an


---------64:30----------
interesting balance between like what's


---------64:32----------
the resolution of like letters versus


---------64:33----------
symbols


---------64:35----------
and what we can see is if you look at


---------64:37----------
something like emojis you can


---------64:38----------
communicate things very effectively by


---------64:40----------
like increasing the precision as we


---------64:42----------
expand the number of emojis at our


---------64:44----------
disposal we become more efficient


---------64:46----------
communicators


---------64:47----------
so what we're going to do is expand the


---------64:49----------
precision with which we look at a goal


---------64:52----------
and so here are the dimensions that i


---------64:54----------
would encourage all to think about with


---------64:55----------
a client and work on okay so the first


---------64:57----------
is the target


---------65:00----------
so this is what we kind of think of


---------65:01----------
traditionally is the goal like


---------65:03----------
become an olympic gold medalist right so


---------65:06----------
what are the ways in which we can adjust


---------65:07----------
the target so the goal here is that


---------65:10----------
each of these dimensions can be explored


---------65:12----------
and adjusted to help us attain success


---------65:15----------
okay


---------65:16----------
so should we change our target so this


---------65:18----------
is where the 25 rule


---------65:20----------
comes in okay


---------65:22----------
second thing is what are the actions


---------65:25----------
so this is also where like


---------65:26----------
operationalizing comes in because


---------65:28----------
oftentimes we set goals that are not


---------65:30----------
actually actions so to explicitly take a


---------65:33----------
goal a target and reduce it to actions


---------65:36----------
we'll we'll operationalize will make


---------65:38----------
things easier abstract to concrete all


---------65:40----------
that good stuff so this is all uh this


---------65:42----------
is all stuff that hopefully all will


---------65:43----------
understand


---------65:46----------
it's just an organized framework that


---------65:48----------
y'all can use with a client okay so what


---------65:50----------
are the actions that we can take


---------65:52----------
third


---------65:54----------
dimension is exploring examples


---------65:58----------
of


---------65:59----------
success


---------66:00----------
and failure


---------66:02----------
right so very practically


---------66:04----------
what you can do with a client is you can


---------66:06----------
ask them you know once they if they set


---------66:08----------
a goal for themselves and they come in


---------66:10----------
next week and they say i succeeded i did


---------66:12----------
it for the first three days and then i


---------66:14----------
forgot and then i didn't do it again so


---------66:16----------
we can explore that okay how do you feel


---------66:18----------
about that you know what what do you


---------66:20----------
what do you understand about what got in


---------66:22----------
the way what made it hard for you to to


---------66:24----------
do it the last four days


---------66:26----------
uh it's also kind of bizarre because it


---------66:27----------
seems like you were crushing it for 72


---------66:29----------
hours how do you understand that right


---------66:30----------
so that's positive humans we just talked


---------66:32----------
about that but still a part of our


---------66:33----------
framework you can you can explore


---------66:35----------
examples of success and failure and the


---------66:37----------
key things is what are the key


---------66:39----------
what are the key takeaways


---------66:46----------
from these successes and failures that


---------66:48----------
once you make these key takeaways


---------66:50----------
conscious


---------66:52----------
you have increased your clients ability


---------66:54----------
to like engage in them again right so


---------66:56----------
we're going to dunny krueger we're going


---------66:58----------
to move along to dunn the dunning-kruger


---------67:00----------
uh


---------67:00----------
curve by asking this question


---------67:04----------
so um this is also an opportunity to


---------67:06----------
explore resistance


---------67:11----------
right so like when you fail like there


---------67:12----------
may be like resistance there


---------67:14----------
could be and then once again emotions


---------67:16----------
ego etc


---------67:17----------
a good question here is what gets in the


---------67:19----------
way


---------67:24----------
so you don't want to ask the question


---------67:25----------
why did you fail you want to ask the


---------67:27----------
question you know it seems like you were


---------67:29----------
able to do yoga the first three days


---------67:30----------
what got in the way the fourth day and


---------67:33----------
so what even if you think about that


---------67:34----------
question what you're instead of them


---------67:36----------
saying oh i'm a failure right like


---------67:37----------
instead of letting them retreat to their


---------67:39----------
identity and it was doomed to fail and


---------67:40----------
all this kind of stuff i am dot dot dot


---------67:43----------
you're raising awareness about an


---------67:45----------
external factor that could be


---------67:47----------
influencing them which then they can


---------67:48----------
control


---------67:49----------
so for example what you may discover is


---------67:52----------
i wanted to do yoga but i actually like


---------67:55----------
overslept because i stayed up way too


---------67:57----------
late and that's really interesting right


---------67:59----------
because then you've sort of discovered


---------68:00----------
oh the problem isn't boosting your


---------68:02----------
willpower the problem is if you want to


---------68:04----------
do yoga consistently you need to fix


---------68:05----------
your sleep schedule so it could be an


---------68:07----------
issue of a misdirected goal


---------68:10----------
dimension number four


---------68:12----------
um


---------68:16----------
okay so i had actually split these uh in


---------68:18----------
my


---------68:20----------
in the framework i'd actually split


---------68:21----------
these into two different things so


---------68:24----------
examples of success in exploring failure


---------68:26----------
and then going down the route


---------68:28----------
of resistance okay so that's number four


---------68:31----------
okay so there are some things here that


---------68:33----------
we're going to include for the sake of


---------68:34----------
completeness which is not really within


---------68:35----------
the scope of coaching so then if we also


---------68:37----------
think about it there are physiologic


---------68:38----------
factors


---------68:41----------
right so people could have circadian


---------68:43----------
rhythm disorders they could have vitamin


---------68:44----------
d deficiency they could have um they


---------68:47----------
could be hypothyroid they could have


---------68:49----------
testosterone deficiency they may be


---------68:51----------
vitamin b deficient there are all kinds


---------68:53----------
of physiologic factors they may be in a


---------68:55----------
high


---------68:56----------
a high inflammatory state which makes


---------68:59----------
people like feel kind of sluggish and


---------69:01----------
makes it hard to work there's a lot of


---------69:02----------
physiology that goes into motivation a


---------69:04----------
little bit outside of the scope of


---------69:06----------
coaching


---------69:07----------
but i just include it here for


---------69:09----------
completeness this is also where we can


---------69:11----------
think about things like sleep and diet


---------69:12----------
and exercise as being physiologic


---------69:14----------
factors psychological stressors


---------69:19----------
so when you have a goal i know it's this


---------69:21----------
is going to sound really simple but i


---------69:23----------
don't think that people really


---------69:24----------
appreciate this it's everyone sort of


---------69:26----------
intellectually understands it


---------69:28----------
but they don't really understand it on


---------69:30----------
an implicit level


---------69:32----------
and they're not consciously aware of it


---------69:34----------
that you know if you're overwhelmed


---------69:38----------
or stressed


---------69:41----------
or had a bad interaction at work


---------69:47----------
that's going to impact your ram


---------69:49----------
right so like we all have a limited


---------69:51----------
amount of ram working memory


---------69:57----------
we all have like limited amounts of like


---------69:59----------
energy in our frontal lobe we have


---------70:00----------
limited amounts of willpower


---------70:02----------
and what you'll see time and time again


---------70:04----------
is like you know when people get sober


---------70:06----------
for example


---------70:08----------
oftentimes there's a psychological


---------70:10----------
stressor


---------70:11----------
like their ex started texting them again


---------70:14----------
which sort of precipitates the relapse


---------70:17----------
so there are all kinds of psychological


---------70:19----------
stresses that can contribute to


---------70:21----------
difficulty in achieving your goals


---------70:24----------
okay so you can ask them you know what's


---------70:26----------
been stressful for you over the last


---------70:27----------
week


---------70:28----------
um


---------70:29----------
when when things get stressful how do


---------70:32----------
you think that will affect your ability


---------70:34----------
to meet your goals because generally


---------70:35----------
speaking what people the conclusion they


---------70:37----------
tend to come to is oh i suck at this if


---------70:39----------
i was better if i could manage stress


---------70:42----------
better


---------70:43----------
then i would succeed so the failure is


---------70:44----------
mine but by sort of pointing out


---------70:47----------
explicitly that their psychological


---------70:49----------
stressors which will make their life


---------70:50----------
hard you allow them to do things like


---------70:52----------
forgive themselves demonstrate


---------70:54----------
self-compassion you also give them axes


---------70:56----------
so if i think the problem is that i'm a


---------70:58----------
failure and that i can't handle stress


---------71:01----------
well


---------71:02----------
that's not actionable whereas if you


---------71:04----------
reframe the problem you take that


---------71:06----------
misdirected goal and you help people


---------71:07----------
recognize that you're human


---------71:09----------
and that if you get stressed it's hard


---------71:11----------
to work out you're going to stress eat


---------71:13----------
more maybe the solution is not to be


---------71:16----------
increase your willpower because i don't


---------71:17----------
know how to do that


---------71:18----------
but maybe the solution is to set better


---------71:20----------
boundaries with people who create stress


---------71:22----------
in your life


---------71:23----------
and that if you really want to work out


---------71:25----------
every day the first step is to actually


---------71:27----------
set boundaries with people who are very


---------71:29----------
stressful


---------71:32----------
so psychological stresses


---------71:34----------
next thing is social influences i kind


---------71:36----------
of bled into this with the last one but


---------71:39----------
i think it's actually very important to


---------71:42----------
explicitly acknowledge what the social


---------71:44----------
influences towards your goal setting are


---------71:46----------
who are the people that you hang out


---------71:48----------
with so there's a there's an entire


---------71:50----------
video about this in dr k's guide on


---------71:51----------
sangha which is in the meditation path


---------71:54----------
and the path of accomplishment


---------71:56----------
so you know like


---------71:57----------
if you


---------71:59----------
you know what do your roommates


---------72:03----------
inspire you to do


---------72:08----------
you know how do your parents


---------72:14----------
um


---------72:14----------
affect your motivation


---------72:17----------
and there's some interesting


---------72:21----------
like revelations here which not a lot of


---------72:23----------
people realize because like parents


---------72:25----------
think they're being supportive right


---------72:27----------
they'll go to their kin they'll say oh


---------72:28----------
my god you have so much potential


---------72:31----------
like you can do anything you're so smart


---------72:33----------
oh my god you're so smart you're so


---------72:35----------
brilliant


---------72:36----------
you have so much potential how do you


---------72:38----------
think that affects a kid's motivation


---------72:45----------
makes it worse


---------72:46----------
absolutely right the parent thinks that


---------72:47----------
they're


---------72:48----------
helping they're actually making things


---------72:50----------
worse


---------72:52----------
oh my god you're such a wonderful boy i


---------72:55----------
don't know why you can't find a


---------72:56----------
girlfriend you're so handsome


---------72:59----------
and you're so wonderful and you're so


---------73:02----------
sweet you're such a catch


---------73:04----------
i don't know what why the girls just


---------73:06----------
don't like you like i don't understand


---------73:08----------
what's going on well first of all mom


---------73:09----------
i'm gay


---------73:11----------
you know


---------73:12----------
so that's part of it


---------73:17----------
um anyway so like it's kind of


---------73:19----------
interesting but i think once again the


---------73:20----------
goal is to consciously make people aware


---------73:22----------
so like you know you have your friends


---------73:24----------
right


---------73:25----------
and so like but what are your friends


---------73:27----------
actually motivate you to do like when


---------73:28----------
you spend more time with your friends


---------73:30----------
what how do your behaviors evolve when


---------73:32----------
you hang out with your friends


---------73:34----------
do you


---------73:35----------
play more video games


---------73:42----------
eat healthy food like what happens


---------73:45----------
what's the influence explicitly


---------73:46----------
understand what's the influence of


---------73:49----------
different people in your life


---------73:51----------
and even in cases of like romantic


---------73:52----------
partners right like so i this is a


---------73:55----------
really


---------73:56----------
surprisingly common example


---------73:59----------
so sometimes you'll have a married


---------74:00----------
couple


---------74:01----------
and one member of the married couple is


---------74:03----------
motivated to change their diet


---------74:07----------
and then they start eating healthy and


---------74:09----------
what does the other member of the


---------74:10----------
married couple do


---------74:14----------
they start eating healthy too


---------74:16----------
you would hope so if only that were the


---------74:19----------
case


---------74:19----------
can anyone imagine the opposite


---------74:22----------
if you're resentful


---------74:24----------
absolutely


---------74:26----------
right so sometimes steve sometimes


---------74:28----------
you're correct


---------74:29----------
i tend to be kind of pessimistic


---------74:31----------
so i see the dark side of things and


---------74:34----------
what tends to happen is the other


---------74:36----------
partner feels ashamed


---------74:38----------
right because it's like i still want to


---------74:39----------
eat my doughnut


---------74:41----------
and there you are eating oatmeal it's


---------74:43----------
like i just want a doughnut and then i


---------74:44----------
feel bad about myself because you're


---------74:45----------
sitting there eating oatmeal and i'm


---------74:47----------
sitting here eating a doughnut i feel


---------74:48----------
like an idiot


---------74:50----------
and then i resent you and then i start


---------74:51----------
to sabotage you and then i start to get


---------74:53----------
in the way


---------74:55----------
happens all the time


---------74:57----------
right and you may see this kind of thing


---------74:58----------
like even within your like online


---------75:00----------
friends right i love them but sometimes


---------75:03----------
they're like oh no man like play one


---------75:04----------
more don't quit


---------75:07----------
play one more like we're gonna crush


---------75:08----------
them like let's do it bro


---------75:10----------
don't don't quit don't go to sleep yet


---------75:12----------
i'm not going to sleep yet what's wrong


---------75:14----------
with you putting together your life


---------75:16----------
screw that


---------75:18----------
let's play


---------75:20----------
so social influences


---------75:22----------
right thinking about so a couple of


---------75:24----------
explicit questions here who holds you


---------75:26----------
back


---------75:32----------
who pulls you forward


---------75:38----------
and there are a couple of other


---------75:38----------
revelations to be had here as well


---------75:41----------
so the first is that


---------75:43----------
sometimes the people that make you feel


---------75:45----------
bad are actually the ones that pull you


---------75:47----------
forward i certainly had this experience


---------75:49----------
at harvard


---------75:50----------
where i felt like holy crap these people


---------75:52----------
are amazing and every time i talk to


---------75:54----------
them i'm like you did what


---------75:56----------
you have how many publications that's


---------75:58----------
insane


---------76:01----------
you have a picture with barack obama


---------76:03----------
because you served in the health


---------76:04----------
department and helped him


---------76:06----------
pass the affordable care act like that's


---------76:08----------
crazy bro


---------76:10----------
right


---------76:11----------
like that's what you wind up with and


---------76:13----------
you may feel some amount of like


---------76:14----------
resistance


---------76:16----------
to hanging out with those people but


---------76:18----------
helping your clients understand who are


---------76:20----------
the people in their lives that pull them


---------76:21----------
forward and what's the resistance to


---------76:23----------
hanging out with them


---------76:26----------
can actually be very helpful


---------76:29----------
next thing is environmental influences


---------76:34----------
okay


---------76:35----------
and by environmental influences this


---------76:37----------
one's pretty straightforward


---------76:39----------
but it's it's things like access to cell


---------76:41----------
phone


---------76:43----------
so like where is your cell phone


---------76:45----------
when you're trying to work


---------76:47----------
is it in your pocket is it easily


---------76:48----------
accessible is it locked you know what's


---------76:51----------
the status of your notifications


---------76:55----------
when do you get distracted how do you


---------76:57----------
get distracted where do you study


---------77:03----------
is it the library is it at home


---------77:07----------
what are the environmental influences


---------77:08----------
that are going to lead to success once


---------77:10----------
again going back to the working out


---------77:12----------
example right so we kind of asked people


---------77:14----------
like


---------77:14----------
gym or home that's key it's crucial


---------77:18----------
so a lot of these dimensions are baked


---------77:20----------
into everything that you guys are


---------77:21----------
already doing which is by the way part


---------77:23----------
of the reason that you all have the


---------77:24----------
outcomes that you do despite never


---------77:26----------
having had this training because it's


---------77:27----------
all baked in you're already doing it but


---------77:29----------
by giving you this framework hopefully


---------77:31----------
it'll help you be a little bit more


---------77:32----------
focused and


---------77:34----------
increase the value that you bring to


---------77:36----------
your clients so right now after spending


---------77:39----------
eight weeks with one of y'all lovely


---------77:41----------
people our clients feel 25 more in


---------77:44----------
control of their lives that's awesome


---------77:46----------
25 control in eight weeks is like really


---------77:48----------
amazing no one ever feels 100


---------77:50----------
right it's just not going to happen


---------77:52----------
there's some issues with the data so 25


---------77:54----------
is actually objectively very good


---------77:56----------
and so as we sort of teach you the these


---------77:58----------
kinds of things my hope is that we'll be


---------77:59----------
able to bump you all from like 25 to 30


---------78:01----------
percent


---------78:03----------
um


---------78:04----------
and then the last thing this is kind of


---------78:06----------
weird


---------78:06----------
this isn't really so much for the


---------78:08----------
average client but matters more in terms


---------78:11----------
of like performance coaching and things


---------78:12----------
like that is i like to think about


---------78:13----------
stakeholders


---------78:17----------
so like what are the different


---------78:18----------
stakeholders for the goal that you're


---------78:20----------
trying to achieve


---------78:22----------
um and this is kind of important because


---------78:24----------
this is kind of goes back to the married


---------78:26----------
couple example but sometimes for the


---------78:27----------
goals that you have


---------78:29----------
they're actually like other people who


---------78:31----------
don't want those goals right so if


---------78:33----------
you're trying to get promoted for


---------78:34----------
example that's a great example of like


---------78:37----------
doing this like we're doing a


---------78:38----------
stakeholder analysis is very helpful


---------78:41----------
to help your clients recognize that


---------78:43----------
there are things outside of them that


---------78:45----------
are going to be influencing them and


---------78:47----------
actually consciously thinking about


---------78:49----------
those things can help you adapt your


---------78:52----------
goal and adapt your actions to


---------78:54----------
accommodate for those stakeholders this


---------78:56----------
is definitely something that we'll talk


---------78:58----------
more about so as we sort of um we're


---------79:00----------
probably going to do like a relaunch of


---------79:02----------
performance coaching at some point we'll


---------79:04----------
talk a lot more about this


---------79:06----------
but it's just i'm kind of including it


---------79:08----------
here for the sake of completeness


---------79:09----------
okay so i've run


---------79:11----------
way over time i apologize i wanted to go


---------79:13----------
fast
