---------00:01----------
so i want to talk to you guys a little


---------00:02----------
bit about


---------00:03----------
value today so sometimes we have these


---------00:06----------
experiences in life that like hurt


---------00:10----------
and they can make us feel less like


---------00:14----------
people like they're even dehumanizing


---------00:16----------
and


---------00:17----------
you know we look around and we see like


---------00:18----------
other people being treated with value


---------00:20----------
and sometimes we don't get treated with


---------00:22----------
value


---------00:23----------
and that hurts so much that like our


---------00:25----------
mind has to come up with a reason


---------00:28----------
why that person is treating me that way


---------00:30----------
because the idea that this


---------00:32----------
that i'm just like i'm not worth it is


---------00:35----------
so


---------00:35----------
painful in and of itself and that i have


---------00:38----------
to rationalize


---------00:39----------
or justify or excuse that person's


---------00:42----------
behavior


---------00:43----------
because if we can excuse someone else's


---------00:45----------
behavior


---------00:46----------
then it's not that we don't lack value


---------00:49----------
they're not actually treating us


---------00:51----------
appropriately


---------00:52----------
there's a reason they're treating us


---------00:54----------
that way so it's like okay for


---------00:56----------
them to do that to us and it's bizarre


---------00:59----------
because


---------00:59----------
in that moment by giving the other


---------01:01----------
person an excuse you're protecting your


---------01:03----------
own sense of value


---------01:05----------
but then what happens is that becomes


---------01:07----------
maladaptive very very quickly


---------01:09----------
and then what happens is like we start


---------01:11----------
giving people excuses


---------01:13----------
for mistreating us because when we give


---------01:15----------
them an excuse then it's not our fault


---------01:17----------
to like


---------01:17----------
you know we're oh i'm not actually a bad


---------01:19----------
person this person was just raised in


---------01:21----------
such a way and like that's just


---------01:22----------
you know has nothing to do with me it


---------01:24----------
has everything to do with them


---------01:26----------
and so we start to create these


---------01:27----------
solutions where we protect ourselves


---------01:29----------
from what they do to us by giving them


---------01:31----------
an excuse


---------01:32----------
and that's actually what screws us


---------01:34----------
because then suddenly


---------01:36----------
no one is doing anything wrong and at


---------01:38----------
the end of the day you're still getting


---------01:39----------
hurt


---------01:40----------
and if you're getting hurt and no one's


---------01:42----------
to blame then like what do you do with


---------01:44----------
that


---------01:45----------
and that's when you end up like stuck


---------01:47----------
interpersonally with other people


---------01:49----------
that's where you end up with like


---------01:50----------
trusted views and all these other like


---------01:52----------
weird manifestations


---------01:54----------
are propagating unhealthy relationships


---------01:57----------
because you're not willing to hold the


---------01:58----------
responsible parties responsible


---------02:00----------
and so when you give them that excuse


---------02:05----------
you take away from yourself the capacity


---------02:09----------
to forgive


---------02:10----------
you take away from yourself the capacity


---------02:12----------
to move on


---------02:13----------
because remember if they didn't do


---------02:15----------
anything wrong then what is there to


---------02:16----------
forgive


---------02:17----------
and so you're kind of stuck in this


---------02:19----------
limbo where there's pain


---------02:21----------
that you kind of defend against but you


---------02:23----------
hold no one responsible


---------02:25----------
and therefore you can't forgive because


---------02:27----------
they didn't do anything wrong and then


---------02:28----------
you're kind of stuck


---------02:29----------
and you end up in this weird like limbo


---------02:31----------
where like it just feels weird like


---------02:33----------
relationships feel


---------02:34----------
off to you and this especially happens


---------02:36----------
with people in your life


---------02:37----------
that you love because the more you love


---------02:40----------
them


---------02:41----------
the harder it is to accept that they did


---------02:43----------
something hurtful to you


---------02:45----------
because that hurts way more so the more


---------02:47----------
you love them


---------02:48----------
the more you make excuses for them the


---------02:51----------
more you make excuses for them the more


---------02:52----------
it isn't their fault


---------02:53----------
and the more it isn't their fault


---------02:55----------
there's no need to forgive everyone's


---------02:57----------
hunky-dory everything's great


---------02:58----------
no need for forgiveness i can hang out


---------03:00----------
with him tomorrow


---------03:01----------
everything's great except they did do


---------03:05----------
that thing to you


---------03:06----------
and it did hurt and it does hurt another


---------03:10----------
week goes by


---------03:11----------
they do it again another excuse no


---------03:13----------
forgiveness


---------03:14----------
no responsibility no need for change and


---------03:16----------
then your heart builds up a little bit


---------03:18----------
but no no no no i'm gonna be


---------03:21----------
compassionate


---------03:22----------
i'm gonna be a nice person it's not


---------03:23----------
their fault they were raised by really


---------03:26----------
abusive parents so it's okay if they hit


---------03:27----------
me


---------03:28----------
that's just the way they were raised and


---------03:30----------
so it's devastating


---------03:32----------
it's difficult because like part of the


---------03:34----------
reason you're stuck is because you can't


---------03:36----------
forgive


---------03:37----------
and part of the reason people ask me how


---------03:38----------
do i move past stuff


---------03:40----------
how do i let go you have to like forgive


---------03:43----------
right you have to accept you have to


---------03:45----------
forgive


---------03:46----------
but you can't do that as long as you


---------03:48----------
deny there's a problem


---------03:49----------
and the reason that you deny there's a


---------03:51----------
problem is because it hurts to admit


---------03:53----------
that there is a problem


---------03:54----------
and so in a bizarre way if you want to


---------03:56----------
start moving forward i know this sounds


---------03:58----------
bizarre


---------03:59----------
because people are going to tell you


---------04:00----------
that like blaming is what gets people


---------04:02----------
stuck


---------04:03----------
but especially with those you love start


---------04:06----------
with blame


---------04:06----------
start by holding people responsible for


---------04:08----------
what they're doing


---------04:10----------
start by holding yourself responsible


---------04:12----------
for what you do and then comes the hard


---------04:14----------
part right because we're really good at


---------04:16----------
holding ourselves responsible and


---------04:17----------
beating ourselves up


---------04:18----------
i'm gonna do better tomorrow i'm gonna


---------04:21----------
work harder tomorrow


---------04:22----------
next time it's gonna be different and


---------04:23----------
then you beat yourself up so when it


---------04:25----------
comes to yourself


---------04:26----------
you need to do the second piece which is


---------04:28----------
forgive


---------04:30----------
so assign responsibility accept it


---------04:34----------
forgive and that's when you can be free


---------04:38----------
that's when your relationship can get


---------04:39----------
better that's when you can start to move


---------04:41----------
forward


---------04:42----------
but you have to start by calling it what


---------04:44----------
it is


---------04:45----------
if someone mistreats you call them out


---------04:47----------
on it


---------04:48----------
if you love them anyway you can say hey


---------04:50----------
like i care about you


---------04:52----------
but like what you did wasn't good


---------04:56----------
and it hurt and when it comes to


---------04:58----------
yourself


---------05:00----------
if you blame yourself way too much learn


---------05:02----------
how to forgive


---------05:03----------
like yeah you did screw up but that's


---------05:07----------
okay because no one's perfect


---------05:09----------
and you're gonna do your best next time


---------05:11----------
and that you are in your own corner


---------05:14----------
that you're willing to give yourself


---------05:16----------
another shot so be careful because


---------05:19----------
the things that we do to protect


---------05:21----------
ourselves from hurt


---------05:23----------
are the things that sign us up for more


---------05:25----------
hurt down the road


---------05:26----------
and you have to understand what you're


---------05:28----------
doing to yourself


---------05:29----------
and once you begin to understand what


---------05:31----------
you're doing to yourself you can start


---------05:33----------
to change it try to change it do your


---------05:34----------
best


---------05:35----------
just like today right if we look at


---------05:37----------
aaron like what he did wonderfully was


---------05:38----------
like at that very


---------05:39----------
last point i don't know how to say this


---------05:41----------
but you know we talked about it for a


---------05:42----------
while


---------05:44----------
and then he didn't get to it until we


---------05:47----------
pointed out


---------05:48----------
what he does to protect himself and if


---------05:50----------
you guys are trying to


---------05:51----------
clean the hurt you have to take off the


---------05:54----------
shell first


---------05:55----------
and then you can get out in there and


---------05:56----------
clean it up so be careful about the


---------05:58----------
things that you tell yourself to protect


---------06:00----------
yourself from being hurt


---------06:02----------
and try not telling yourself those


---------06:03----------
things let yourself feel that hurt let


---------06:06----------
the consequences flow


---------06:08----------
sit with them and then you can move


---------06:14----------
forward
