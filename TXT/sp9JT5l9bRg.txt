---------00:00----------
thanks I'm nervous everyone is nervous


---------00:02----------
have you seen other people say that uh I


---------00:05----------
I think so yeah everybody's nervous what


---------00:09----------
are you nervous about um talking in


---------00:15----------
general uh uh talking is hard yeah yeah


---------00:19----------
yeah yeah yeah it's it's I think it's


---------00:24----------
completely normal to be nervous would it


---------00:25----------
help you to hear that I'm nervous too or


---------00:27----------
would that make things worse I don't


---------00:31----------
know I think it's funny yeah because


---------00:36----------
like I don't know what we're talking


---------00:38----------
about mm-hmm and like what if I don't


---------00:41----------
say the right thing oh it's okay I don't


---------00:45----------
always say the right thing either but I


---------00:47----------
feel like you have a very good way of


---------00:49----------
saying things so I know that's why I'm


---------00:51----------
nervous right because people come on and


---------00:53----------
they have this expectation that I have a


---------00:55----------
good mood saying things mm-hmm and so


---------00:58----------
like the only thing I can do is


---------01:00----------
disappoint


---------01:03----------
nope I don't think so I think you're


---------01:06----------
good no matter what yeah so if I were to


---------01:09----------
tell you that what would you say I think


---------01:12----------
you're God you are him you know what you


---------01:16----------
bring to the table is what you bring to


---------01:17----------
the table that's cool yeah see that's a


---------01:25----------
problem that I kinda have yeah I have I


---------01:28----------
think I have a bit of impostor syndrome


---------01:31----------
here when it comes to that yeah so tell


---------01:35----------
us about that


---------01:38----------
is that what you want to talk about


---------01:39----------
today are you gonna talk about something


---------01:41----------
else


---------01:41----------
I I could talk about anything yeah what


---------01:45----------
do you want to talk about


---------01:47----------
[Music]


---------01:49----------
yeah that's like something we could talk


---------01:51----------
about because it's something that like


---------01:52----------
occurs a lot yeah so what do you mean by


---------01:57----------
imposter syndrome


---------02:00----------
or maybe it's not that but um basically


---------02:04----------
whenever someone tries to like tell me


---------02:07----------
that I'm like doing really well or that


---------02:10----------
I'm


---------02:14----------
mmm performing all of something or like


---------02:17----------
doing well like whether it's this or


---------02:20----------
that I always attribute it to not really


---------02:23----------
being because of me um I think mostly


---------02:28----------
huh


---------02:30----------
yeah sorry good oh I think it's mainly


---------02:35----------
just like the people I'm surrounded by


---------02:38----------
who like carrying me a lot you get


---------02:41----------
carried that's how I feel you're the new


---------02:45----------
band and you're with a bunch of pro


---------02:47----------
players yes yes together sorry I


---------02:51----------
probably speak a lot in league terms or


---------02:54----------
think a lot if that's okay we won't hold


---------02:56----------
it yeah so then what what are you envy


---------03:01----------

---------03:05----------

---------03:09----------

---------03:14----------
um oh no don't know that's just the


---------03:17----------
leads in real life what are ya what's


---------03:20----------
your what's your league position in real


---------03:22----------
life in real life I feel like I'm kind


---------03:25----------
of like a I feel like a support I feel


---------03:28----------
like I try to like run around and be


---------03:29----------
there for everyone as best I can


---------03:32----------
yeah you know what I am in league but


---------03:36----------
I'm a minion I just I just run down a


---------03:41----------
particular Lane mindlessly and get


---------03:44----------
farmed by other people um it's okay I'm


---------03:50----------
pretty much the same I'm pretty much


---------03:51----------
like like a cannon minion if anything


---------03:54----------
this yeah maybe it's worse why is it I


---------03:57----------
thought a candid minion was better yeah


---------04:01----------
I don't know


---------04:05----------
give me mr. busy there you go messing it


---------04:09----------
up again no one's around to carry you


---------04:11----------
now


---------04:12----------
Yvonne yeah exactly yes me so it sounds


---------04:16----------
like but it does sound like you try to


---------04:18----------
help other people a lot uh yeah I think


---------04:22----------
so yeah


---------04:23----------
can you at least know about that I guess


---------04:30----------
it's just kind of what I do a TV I try


---------04:33----------
to like be there for everyone they need


---------04:35----------
help or whatever the company needs help


---------04:37----------
with so yeah it's just like I try to


---------04:40----------
till I get everything done and make


---------04:42----------
everyone happy mm-hmm


---------04:44----------
try to make everyone happy well it also


---------04:48----------
makes me happy seeing they're happy


---------04:50----------
because I care about them a lot okay so


---------04:52----------
it sounds like you really do care I hope


---------04:56----------
so yeah you hope so yeah I mean oh yeah


---------05:01----------
I I think I care a lot do you think you


---------05:05----------
care a lot how would you know I'm just


---------05:07----------
um I know I think there are a lot


---------05:12----------
circumstances where if it wasn't them or


---------05:18----------
yeah if it cuz it feel like in this what


---------05:21----------
up for what I do I really have to like


---------05:22----------
the people to like what I do well that's


---------05:25----------
why um just like interact with them


---------05:30----------
everyday and like live with them and


---------05:31----------
like yeah just working with people like


---------05:35----------
everyday I feel like you sort of have to


---------05:37----------
like them or like what your life


---------05:39----------
wouldn't be very like great or you ain't


---------05:42----------
like your job at all if you didn't


---------05:45----------
Yvonne would you describe your life is


---------05:47----------
great


---------05:52----------
not so much right now it's okay what


---------05:56----------
what makes it so it sounds like that


---------05:58----------
question maybe you seem a little bit


---------06:00----------
more nervous what are you feeling right


---------06:01----------
now when I asked I feel really nervous


---------06:04----------
yeah something changed you were talking


---------06:07----------
a little bit more openly so like what


---------06:11----------
did you feel when I asked you that


---------06:12----------
question um I think it's like


---------06:15----------
overwhelming a lot what's been happening


---------06:18----------
on like social media or like um I also


---------06:23----------
kind of got out of a relationship lately


---------06:26----------
that's been like


---------06:28----------
really turbulent for my emotions um yeah


---------06:34----------
so there's just like a whole spectrum of


---------06:36----------
things that's been like I guess


---------06:38----------
overwhelming in like this time period


---------06:41----------
because it feels very I guess it feels


---------06:45----------
like a there's a lot going on in such a


---------06:47----------
short amount of time


---------06:48----------
sure yeah I mean that sounds incredibly


---------06:51----------
overwhelming like just too much to


---------06:53----------
handle all at once it's sort of like


---------06:55----------
you're your ADC is in ting and you're


---------06:57----------
top lane or DC or it's actually yeah


---------07:02----------
pretty much there's a lot of stressful


---------07:04----------
things that's just like every Lane is


---------07:06----------
falling apart and you're supported


---------07:07----------
you're trying to you're trying to like


---------07:09----------
your mid laner to like gone off to a bad


---------07:11----------
start and ganked by bitter jungler and


---------07:14----------
then your top laner DC lead and then


---------07:17----------
your ADC is ending chaos everywhere yeah


---------07:21----------
and it's like you can't fix everything


---------07:24----------
set Hatfields


---------07:27----------
I'm trying to it's like I'm I'm like


---------07:30----------
slowly like fixing things one by one


---------07:33----------
sort of thing wow that's actually pretty


---------07:35----------
impressive because most people just


---------07:39----------
crumble under the pressure I feel like a


---------07:42----------
lot of things are like either a with


---------07:45----------
time it's better or like who you learn


---------07:47----------
to like manage it better after


---------07:49----------
experiencing a lot of things so cool


---------07:52----------
yeah that's you sound like you're quite


---------07:54----------
a resilient person maybe I never thought


---------07:59----------
of myself that way how do you think


---------08:01----------
you're of yourself


---------08:04----------
[Music]


---------08:07----------
it's a hard question sounds simple yeah


---------08:09----------
I don't really know yeah it's like I


---------08:16----------
just want to just call your attention to


---------08:18----------
something so it's kind of weird right


---------08:19----------
that we like think about ourselves in we


---------08:23----------
know in which ways we don't think about


---------08:25----------
ourselves but we don't know how we think


---------08:28----------
about ourselves mm-hmm you don't see


---------08:30----------
yourself as resilient you're pretty sure


---------08:31----------
about that but you're not quite sure how


---------08:33----------
you see yourself which is like a weird


---------08:35----------
way to live life but that's actually


---------08:36----------
completely normal we don't really know


---------08:38----------
we don't think about who we are so maybe


---------08:40----------
we could try to figure out how you do


---------08:42----------
think about yourself so some of so one


---------08:45----------
thing to just acknowledge right is so it


---------08:47----------
sounds like you think about yourself as


---------08:49----------
less than what other people see yeah I


---------08:54----------
would say that for sure yeah so we can


---------08:59----------
just let's put a pin in that for a


---------09:00----------
second what's it like to think about


---------09:05----------
yourself as less than what other people


---------09:07----------
see I feel like I don't believe anything


---------09:13----------
that people say so


---------09:19----------
whenever they say like for example oh


---------09:23----------
you're like channel is doing really well


---------09:24----------
or anything I feel like a lot of it is


---------09:28----------
not because of me it's because of like


---------09:31----------
um all the really great people like


---------09:36----------
around me and I also feel like whenever


---------09:40----------
they say like my


---------09:43----------
if they say like my work ethic is really


---------09:45----------
good I feel like that's just what you


---------09:46----------
should be doing most of the time it's


---------09:48----------
just like regular work um like if


---------09:52----------
someone hired you for something or if


---------09:54----------
like you're working at like an company


---------09:57----------
IQ just be doing what you're told or


---------09:59----------
like okay stuff like that which i think


---------10:01----------
is just like basic


---------10:08----------
can I just repeat back a little bit of


---------10:10----------
what I heard sure sounds like you've got


---------10:13----------
a pretty high evasion rate for


---------10:14----------
appreciation yeah I think so


---------10:19----------
it's kind of weird huh yeah like people


---------10:24----------
trying to tell you that you're doing a


---------10:25----------
good job you're like dodged easy yeah I


---------10:30----------
think so and it's still nice to hear but


---------10:34----------
like um I just remember my friend


---------10:38----------
walking up to me at a party and then he


---------10:41----------
was like wow we've on like your channels


---------10:43----------
YouTube channels doing really well and


---------10:45----------
I'll just I felt zero like


---------10:48----------
credit for it I felt like


---------10:52----------
I didn't feel that much happiness


---------10:54----------
hearing it I ever Fenny what did you


---------10:57----------
feel


---------10:58----------
um the first thing I just said was oh


---------11:02----------
yeah but it's not me mm-hmm yeah so how


---------11:08----------
long have you felt that it isn't you for


---------11:16----------
like a long time


---------11:21----------
I don't know exactly how long but yeah


---------11:24----------
it's been like that for a bit have you


---------11:26----------
felt that way before you started


---------11:28----------
streaming ah no but that's pretty


---------11:34----------
different because before such screaming


---------11:38----------
I was just playing games and I wasn't


---------11:40----------
there's like no one there's no like


---------11:42----------
numbers to measure your success or like


---------11:45----------
any type of stuff like that


---------11:46----------
it was just like I'm just playing video


---------11:48----------
games after work and like that's it


---------11:51----------
sure and and so what affected his


---------11:54----------
numbers to measure your success huh hmm


---------11:59----------
I don't know but I feel like in our


---------12:03----------
industry it's like a lot of people look


---------12:05----------
at the numbers um I don't find myself


---------12:09----------
having that much value towards the


---------12:11----------
numbers especially nowadays I feel like


---------12:14----------
they're very hollow to me and they're


---------12:16----------
just like I feel more I put more


---------12:21----------
emphasis on if I'm happy or not and I


---------12:24----------
think like if I'm just doing what I


---------12:26----------
enjoy I don't really care like how much


---------12:29----------
numbers or whatever I put out are you


---------12:32----------
happy


---------12:36----------
in terms of like what I'm doing yeah I


---------12:38----------
get to like play fret play games with my


---------12:40----------
friends every day and like that's what I


---------12:42----------
enjoy I think I'm unhappy if I don't


---------12:46----------
have friends to play with okay so


---------12:48----------
earlier I asked you if your life was


---------12:51----------
great and you said it's okay and so let


---------12:56----------
me just pause for a moment and think


---------13:00----------
through what I'm hearing and then you


---------13:01----------
let me know if we're kind of on the same


---------13:03----------
page so there are a couple of


---------13:07----------
circumstances like so you mentioned that


---------13:10----------
what's going on right now and I don't


---------13:12----------
know exactly what you're referring to


---------13:13----------
but I'd love to hear more about that the


---------13:16----------
second thing you said is that there's a


---------13:18----------
lot of turbulent emotion around a


---------13:20----------
breakup so those are sort of like maybe


---------13:22----------
temporary D buffs right or like you know


---------13:25----------
they're like conditions like weather


---------13:28----------
patterns that may clear over time mm-hmm


---------13:31----------
but I'm also getting some sense that you


---------13:36----------
know there's something that isn't


---------13:37----------
temporary somewhere along the way you


---------13:39----------
started to think that like you know the


---------13:43----------
numbers and people's appreciation and


---------13:46----------
your value the value that people see


---------13:49----------
doesn't like fit with what you see yeah


---------13:53----------
that doesn't feel quite as temporary to


---------13:55----------
me that feels like it's sort of baked in


---------14:00----------
what do you think mm-hmm


---------14:04----------
yeah I agree so now then what I see is a


---------14:07----------
fork in the road so what we can do is we


---------14:10----------
can talk about what's baked in right


---------14:13----------
like where do you get the I like how can


---------14:15----------
I say this so you have a particular


---------14:19----------
impression of yourself and when someone


---------14:22----------
tries to appreciate you you dodge right


---------14:25----------
yeah it's like instant rejection almost


---------14:28----------
and I can't help it exactly so then like


---------14:30----------
if we think about that the reason that


---------14:32----------
you're dodging is because it doesn't fit


---------14:34----------
which means in turn that you have a


---------14:36----------
particular perception of yourself right


---------14:39----------
so then the question becomes where did


---------14:43----------
you learn what you are like how did you


---------14:47----------
learn that so we can talk about that so


---------14:50----------
we can talk about the over like the the


---------14:52----------
idea of like how you view yourself and


---------14:54----------
like where that comes from or what we


---------14:57----------
can do is talk a little bit about sort


---------14:59----------
of the effects of what's going on right


---------15:01----------
now as you put it or the effects of the


---------15:03----------
break-up and because those two things


---------15:04----------
could be related like sometimes when


---------15:06----------
people break up with people like when


---------15:08----------
there's a breakup going on their sense


---------15:10----------
of self-worth takes a hit and it becomes


---------15:13----------
harder for them to appreciate it to


---------15:15----------
accept the appreciation of others mmm I


---------15:20----------
think we could go with what's going on


---------15:23----------
right now and the breakup okay cool


---------15:25----------
let's do that first okay see if we have


---------15:29----------
time for the other one so tell me which


---------15:31----------
one of those do you want to talk about


---------15:32----------
first the breakup or what's going on


---------15:34----------
right now


---------15:38----------
I'm not sure which order is better or if


---------15:41----------
there is one yeah okay maybe we can just


---------15:46----------
do it in the order that you mentioned


---------15:47----------
them okay


---------15:49----------
would you venture first uh things that's


---------15:53----------
going on right now cool how nervous are


---------15:55----------
you by the way um look I'm like shaking


---------16:01----------
a bit yeah yeah so do you want to just


---------16:03----------
think about that for a second should we


---------16:05----------
help you with that uh I think it's okay


---------16:09----------
I think he's just like


---------16:13----------
nervous to talk about of it okay sure so


---------16:15----------
let's let's give it a shot and if you're


---------16:17----------
still feeling pretty nervous we can


---------16:19----------
pause and try to help you with your


---------16:20----------
nervousness that's not okay yeah yeah


---------16:23----------
because I you know if you're gonna be


---------16:25----------
nervous for an hour and a half that's


---------16:26----------
gonna be rough man no no I mean like I


---------16:29----------
think no matter what I'll feel a little


---------16:32----------
nervous but just like you know talking


---------16:36----------
about stuff especially having you out


---------16:40----------
there it's just like a little


---------16:41----------
intimidating okay


---------16:42----------
let me ask you one last question to


---------16:45----------
derail you because you're you're just


---------16:47----------
getting your feet steady under you yeah


---------16:49----------
um do you view yourself as a courageous


---------16:51----------
person um no but I am trying to like do


---------16:59----------
a lot of things this year to like push


---------17:01----------
myself out of my comfort zone yeah is


---------17:03----------
this one of them um kind of it's like


---------17:08----------
not something I feel like I had to like


---------17:10----------
really like muster myself up to do it's


---------17:14----------
something that like I've listened like


---------17:18----------
watched a lot of your videos or streams


---------17:20----------
and like I like really want to like have


---------17:24----------
a talk with you so it's like something I


---------17:26----------
wanted to do it wasn't something that I


---------17:28----------
was like to like force myself to do okay


---------17:30----------
so now I have another question what did


---------17:33----------
you want to talk to me about why did you


---------17:34----------
want to come on here um I kind of just I


---------17:39----------
have this is it uh I never felt like I


---------17:43----------
needed to talk to someone maybe until I


---------17:47----------
was going through like a huge debate in


---------17:54----------
terms of my relationship and then also I


---------17:57----------
guess that was a main thing that is done


---------17:59----------
from um because I want to like learn


---------18:02----------
about myself more so that I could kind


---------18:05----------
of have a better idea of like what I


---------18:07----------
want or like what I can do for myself


---------18:10----------
this year like stuff like that cool man


---------18:14----------
that's um


---------18:16----------
I feel inspired listening to you it's


---------18:18----------
that weird I know it's it's confusing


---------18:24----------
right so sorry because I'm probably


---------18:27----------
making you more nervous because here


---------18:28----------
comes nomination so get ready like


---------18:30----------
you're about to dodge yeah ready ready


---------18:31----------
for it I mean so I think it's really


---------18:33----------
cool that you noticed that your life was


---------18:36----------
not what you wanted it to be and you


---------18:37----------
thought intentionally about how you can


---------18:41----------
make it different from what it is hmm


---------18:44----------
like basically what I think is inspiring


---------18:46----------
is that you chose not to live on


---------18:47----------
autopilot right like for a moment like


---------18:50----------
it's like a minion is on autopilot


---------18:52----------
you're just gonna run down like we're


---------18:53----------
just gonna live life and just just you


---------18:55----------
know that's what we're gonna do we're


---------18:57----------
not gonna think we're not gonna switch


---------18:59----------
lanes we're not gonna adapt relationship


---------19:02----------
is relationship let's just go


---------19:04----------
and then here's Yvonne who's kind of


---------19:06----------
like well maybe I should think about


---------19:07----------
like I'm not sure if this relationship


---------19:09----------
is right for me like maybe I should move


---------19:10----------
lanes and then like what's the goal like


---------19:13----------
why am I playing this game of life like


---------19:15----------
what do I want out of life like that's


---------19:16----------
actually pretty cool what do you think


---------19:19----------
about that um I think it comes from like


---------19:24----------
what bothers me about other people I


---------19:26----------
think something that bothers me is like


---------19:29----------
when I hear someone complaining a lot


---------19:30----------
and they don't do anything to then and


---------19:34----------
they don't try to do anything about it


---------19:36----------
like there are some things that are out


---------19:38----------
of your control but the things that are


---------19:40----------
in your control I feel like if you could


---------19:43----------
do something to change what you're


---------19:45----------
complaining about then you should or at


---------19:49----------
least like have the effort to sure so


---------19:52----------
yeah I just wanted to like get help with


---------19:55----------
that I guess like cool yourself up do


---------19:59----------
you view yourself as a complainer um I


---------20:04----------
rant but if I complain about something I


---------20:07----------
will try to solve it at least


---------20:11----------
I hope I'm like that like I try I think


---------20:14----------
I'm like that yeah yeah interesting yeah


---------20:18----------
I mean so that sounds like a positive


---------20:20----------
quality like it sounds like something


---------20:22----------
that's something that you respect and


---------20:23----------
appreciate about yourself hmm


---------20:27----------
I think so I never thought of that


---------20:28----------
specifically I just know I don't like


---------20:30----------
that about other people when they do it


---------20:32----------
so I try not to do but I may not be I'm


---------20:34----------
not perfect so maybe I still complain


---------20:36----------
and not fix things you know yeah I don't


---------20:39----------
think anyone thinks you're perfect but


---------20:41----------
you know at the same time I was just


---------20:44----------
kind of thinking that sometimes what


---------20:45----------
bothers us and other people is what we


---------20:47----------
see in ourselves mm-hmm like sometimes


---------20:51----------
that's the case do you think that's the


---------20:53----------
case here


---------20:54----------
mmm not so much I think it's because I


---------20:58----------
do that that it bothers me maybe one


---------21:00----------
other I see other people not doing that


---------21:01----------
okay maybe we can come back to that


---------21:06----------
second sorry that I I'm kind of bouncing


---------21:08----------
the conversation around like oh no yeah


---------21:11----------
and so okay so you were saying you know


---------21:15----------
you were debating about something about


---------21:17----------
your relationship and that's why you


---------21:18----------
wanted to come on I'm just gonna try to


---------21:20----------
toss out one more compliment that you


---------21:22----------
can dodge would you would you consider


---------21:25----------
yourself I mean so I I think what you're


---------21:27----------
doing is courageous what do you think


---------21:30----------
what um what am i doing like oh come on


---------21:34----------
street talking about it


---------21:37----------
[Music]


---------21:38----------
yeah I know it's not maybe what's


---------21:44----------
happening in your head let's let's look


---------21:45----------
oh yeah it's a party that's dodging


---------21:51----------
there's party like no yeah like it like


---------21:54----------
yes but it doesn't feel curry just to me


---------21:57----------
because I don't I think it maybe more so


---------22:00----------
to other people I guess I'm not as


---------22:02----------
afraid to me I'm just like okay okay


---------22:05----------
it's it's not as heart you don't really


---------22:07----------
it's not that you discount your


---------22:09----------
courageousness it's just like actually


---------22:11----------
it's not that hard for you to come on


---------22:12----------
yeah yeah yeah exactly


---------22:14----------
okay cool so that doesn't that doesn't


---------22:17----------
feel to me that you're really dodging


---------22:19----------
the compliment or appreciation so much


---------22:21----------
as you just don't really think it's that


---------22:22----------
applicable yeah okay I can live with


---------22:27----------
that so maybe we should talk about can


---------22:29----------
you tell us what debate you were having


---------22:31----------
about your relationship um so I there's


---------22:39----------
kind of a timeline I guess um I started


---------22:42----------
dating my first boyfriend when I was


---------22:44----------
like 16 and that relationship last hit


---------22:46----------
like seven years and then it was like a


---------22:50----------
month or so like not too long afterwards


---------22:52----------
I got into my next relationship that


---------22:55----------
lasted another almost seven years and


---------22:59----------
but he was just like really too good to


---------23:01----------
like kind of pass up at the time like I


---------23:04----------
just met him and I was like go out this


---------23:05----------
person's like


---------23:07----------
amazing like he's so different from my


---------23:09----------
ex he was just like um and I guess like


---------23:16----------
the debate I got was this person is like


---------23:20----------
if I like he did he was like everything


---------23:22----------
I would have wanted in someone um he


---------23:25----------
like said and did all like the right


---------23:27----------
things and what are the right mmm like


---------23:34----------
he would and whenever I was stressed he


---------23:37----------
would always ask me like oh like what


---------23:38----------
can I do to help like he like health


---------23:41----------
isn't a lot and sounds like he was


---------23:43----------
supportive mm-hmm he's like he's super


---------23:45----------
super supportive and almost like


---------23:47----------
anything that I do or yeah ever anything


---------23:49----------
that I do and he's like really funny and


---------23:55----------
he all my anyone that all my friends


---------23:59----------
like really like him there's he just


---------24:01----------
like gets along with everyone and he's


---------24:06----------
like a really good person and I guess um


---------24:10----------
so for a really long time I never felt


---------24:14----------
like I was really happy and it wasn't


---------24:19----------
you felt like you you were really happy


---------24:21----------
um being with him is I'm very happy but


---------24:27----------
for myself it's like I felt like more


---------24:31----------
within this year that um more


---------24:34----------
reoccurring thoughts would happen where


---------24:36----------
I wonder what would be like if I was on


---------24:38----------
my own because I was in a relationship


---------24:40----------
since I was 16 pretty much


---------24:42----------
and like I've never gotten the chance to


---------24:44----------
be like independent I don't know what I


---------24:47----------
am like on my own I've always had


---------24:48----------
someone else there and I felt like such


---------24:52----------
a strong need for independence despite


---------24:54----------
having being with someone who was like


---------24:56----------
so great um Wow


---------25:00----------
so it was like something that it felt


---------25:03----------
like a missing puzzle piece that I would


---------25:05----------
like never experience or have if I would


---------25:08----------
just date with this person forever um I


---------25:12----------
needed I it was like something that


---------25:15----------
before I kind of brushed off and then it


---------25:16----------
became more and more like in my face as


---------25:20----------
it like popped up in my thoughts and


---------25:22----------
more and then I felt like I just really


---------25:25----------
needed to know like what it's like to


---------25:26----------
truly be like on my own and how I grow


---------25:29----------
as a person and what when you say it


---------25:33----------
sort of


---------25:33----------
come in your face what does that look


---------25:35----------
like um like I just had more and more


---------25:38----------
thoughts I kept thinking about like I


---------25:41----------
want to like know what it's like


---------25:46----------
like I I don't know what I'd be what


---------25:49----------
it's like at all for me to be on my own


---------25:52----------
and like having to tackle problems on my


---------25:55----------
own or like how it grow as a person I


---------25:57----------
think in like your early years you have


---------26:01----------
a lot of like finding yourself or like


---------26:04----------
exploring or like experiencing things


---------26:07----------
that help you grow a lot and I feel like


---------26:12----------
when you say God knows what what ages


---------26:15----------
are we talking about just to clarify I


---------26:16----------
feel like in your early 20s okay you


---------26:19----------
have like a lot that of like I guess


---------26:24----------
things that just shape who you are as a


---------26:27----------
person and helps you grow so yeah yeah


---------26:32----------
so you feel like you kind of missed out


---------26:34----------
on that I guess being in a relationship


---------26:38----------
I don't know if I


---------26:43----------
ever like like I just don't know I would


---------26:46----------
just never know what what's what am I


---------26:47----------
like


---------26:48----------
without someone that's just it yeah so


---------26:53----------
can I just point out like an interesting


---------26:55----------
kind of connection that my mind is


---------26:56----------
making so earlier I had asked you like


---------27:00----------
you know you'd said that you're you


---------27:01----------
don't view yourself Brazil is resilient


---------27:04----------
and I asked how do you view yourself and


---------27:06----------
you're like I don't know and I'm just


---------27:08----------
wondering whether what you're talking


---------27:10----------
about


---------27:10----------
maybe is part of the reason that you


---------27:12----------
don't know who you are because you've


---------27:14----------
always sort of existed in relation to


---------27:16----------
someone else mm-hmm and you don't know


---------27:19----------
you know in a sense it's kind of like


---------27:23----------
you know you're duo queueing for


---------27:25----------
everything and so the challenge is like


---------27:28----------
if you're duo queueing you never really


---------27:29----------
know like what your skill is means


---------27:34----------
you've always yeah you know it's like


---------27:36----------
you're never solo queueing so like


---------27:37----------
mm-hmm and and sure you're gonna hit a


---------27:41----------
particular rank but like how much of


---------27:43----------
that is like you being carried and like


---------27:46----------
you doing the carry mm-hmm is that how


---------27:49----------
you feel um not too much in terms of


---------27:54----------
like I never felt like I was getting


---------27:56----------
carried by someone in terms of in terms


---------27:59----------
of like relationships hmm um my first


---------28:04----------
boyfriend was just someone that I met


---------28:06----------
while I was in high school and he was my


---------28:07----------
first boyfriend so we end up dating for


---------28:09----------
a really long time because it's like


---------28:10----------
you're an experienced you try to make it


---------28:12----------
work do you like it's like a very naive


---------28:15----------
like I really wanted like my first


---------28:18----------
boyfriend to like our last boyfriend yes


---------28:22----------
have a thought but then it was kind of


---------28:25----------
like saying really wasn't working


---------28:27----------
there's no way like you hit the point


---------28:30----------
where you're like do I want to be with


---------28:32----------
this person for the rest of my life and


---------28:33----------
because I do you break up for you're


---------28:35----------
with them forever right so that's


---------28:37----------
there's no you got to get out now and I


---------28:39----------
just just mustered it up and it was like


---------28:42----------
one of the hardest things ever had to do


---------28:44----------
because he was all I knew for like seven


---------28:46----------
years I was so attached as family and we


---------28:49----------
had mutual friends and everything yeah


---------28:52----------
so your lives have been kind of in tank


---------28:54----------
together yeah but like with my most


---------28:58----------
recent boyfriend I was like he gave me


---------29:00----------
so much freedom and I um could do like


---------29:05----------
whatever pretty much like he didn't


---------29:08----------
really hold me back from doing anything


---------29:10----------
but it's just like the fact of the


---------29:13----------
matter is that I've just been in a


---------29:16----------
relationship for life alas how many


---------29:18----------
years and I just never got to be on my


---------29:21----------
own


---------29:21----------
but that is a conflicting part because


---------29:24----------
it's like he's so good but um I I just


---------29:30----------
was like it felt like Miss timing yeah


---------29:34----------
so what is what is the appeal of


---------29:35----------
independence like in your mind what was


---------29:38----------
it that you wanted from being not what


---------29:42----------
did you I don't even know if there's


---------29:44----------
like something that I want in particular


---------29:47----------
it's more like than not knowing what


---------29:51----------
it's like period I think I never got to


---------29:55----------
experience it's like missing on like the


---------29:58----------
experience and like how I could be as a


---------30:02----------
person or what I'd be on my own


---------30:04----------
interesting


---------30:08----------
hmm and so so can are you still with


---------30:12----------
your boyfriend or is that no nein no so


---------30:17----------
how did that how did that happen


---------30:22----------
[Music]


---------30:24----------
it's something we I brought up to him


---------30:26----------
like during Christmas and then it kind


---------30:28----------
of like you know I kind of like brushed


---------30:30----------
it off and I could tell like he didn't


---------30:32----------
want to break up obviously so he also


---------30:35----------
like um tried to like just be like yeah


---------30:39----------
um but then yeah what Oh like kind of


---------30:45----------
like um he was just like saying I can't


---------30:51----------
remember what he said to be honest but


---------30:52----------
is something that along the lines of


---------30:54----------
like I could tell he was trying to just


---------30:56----------
be like yeah but we're like you know


---------30:59----------
we're we're good together


---------31:01----------
okay it's just kind of like that um and


---------31:05----------
then and I agreed but it was just like a


---------31:09----------
thought that just kept surfacing and


---------31:11----------
there's to the point where like I know


---------31:13----------
that if I stay with him I will think


---------31:18----------
whether it's a year down the line 20


---------31:20----------
years down the line 20 foot like 30


---------31:23----------
years down the line that like I still


---------31:25----------
would wonder what it would have been


---------31:26----------
like to be on my own and so I didn't


---------31:30----------
want to like


---------31:32----------
be with him but still have those


---------31:34----------
thoughts I needed to just know what it's


---------31:37----------
like and so it sounds like you wanted to


---------31:40----------
avoid a life of regret


---------31:42----------
yes oh yeah pretty much


---------31:45----------
and that you would have regretted


---------31:47----------
staying with him um I don't know if I


---------31:51----------
would have regretted staying with him


---------31:53----------
but I would have just regretted like not


---------31:55----------
knowing


---------31:58----------
and not knowing that I'll not be yeah


---------32:01----------
yeah yeah but yeah I think it's an


---------32:05----------
important distinction that what you


---------32:07----------
actually regret is not knowing what


---------32:08----------
Independence feels like mm-hmm-hmm this


---------32:14----------
is tricky upon yeah it's real tricky


---------32:20----------
yeah what I'm hearing from you is like


---------32:23----------
it sounds like you understood that you


---------32:25----------
had something that was valuable and good


---------32:28----------
mm-hmm that's what made it super hard


---------32:30----------
and that's why I wanted to talk to


---------32:33----------
someone because it's like


---------32:36----------
he's totally someone that I would see


---------32:39----------
myself with and then and be happy with I


---------32:41----------
like it just felt like I'm missing like


---------32:45----------
I just I just needed it sure of it


---------32:49----------
and so what what happened next um and


---------32:54----------
then uh we tried talking still for a bit


---------32:59----------
to keep in touch and then it's just too


---------33:02----------
hard because like my emotions are too


---------33:04----------
turbulent whenever I get a message from


---------33:06----------
him or um anything like that it like


---------33:10----------
yeah so so after Christmas you guys kind


---------33:13----------
of broke up or no this was a this was


---------33:16----------
like in um we broke up right at the


---------33:20----------
start of June okay and and so when you


---------33:23----------
say you broke up so what what how did


---------33:25----------
that go


---------33:30----------
it feels bad it feels like I'm kind of


---------33:34----------
being I'm being selfish um everyone


---------33:38----------
around me feel sad for us feels super


---------33:42----------
sad like Oh a lot of people say they're


---------33:45----------
getting like secondhand depression just


---------33:46----------
from listening to because it feels like


---------33:49----------
we're like we love each other so much


---------33:54----------
but it's like almost like we have to be


---------33:57----------
a part sort of thing


---------33:58----------
so it feels very tragic like sad sounds


---------34:01----------
tragic yeah so I've been having a hard


---------34:06----------
time especially the past like a couple


---------34:09----------
of weeks to be like happy but like it's


---------34:11----------
been obviously I know it's like a time


---------34:12----------
thing I know as time goes on like it


---------34:14----------
would be better but it was just harder


---------34:17----------
there's a couple of weeks and like he


---------34:20----------
messaged me once and he came over once


---------34:24----------
to like just give me a cake and then


---------34:27----------
like I I felt so sad it was like the day


---------34:31----------
that I finally felt better and then he


---------34:33----------
came over and then I was like oh my god


---------34:36----------
it's like everyone was sad like the


---------34:39----------
people in my house were sad and like


---------34:43----------
yeah how does it feel like to be someone


---------34:46----------
who takes care of everyone and then make


---------34:49----------
everyone sad


---------34:53----------
it felt like I hated that I was like a


---------34:57----------
negative energy I felt like a because I


---------35:00----------
was sad I was like exerting a bunch of


---------35:04----------
like sad energy and they all told me it


---------35:07----------
was okay but it felt bad because


---------35:09----------
normally I'm the one who's like I Vince


---------35:12----------
I feel like I've been so like stable


---------35:16----------
kind of throughout all the years like I


---------35:17----------
never felt sad or depressed I've always


---------35:21----------
been like content and like pretty like


---------35:23----------
relatively like chill you know kind just


---------35:26----------
like a lot low like yeah yeah and this


---------35:31----------
was I guess the time where I felt like I


---------35:33----------
was very I was more negative or more


---------35:37----------
like sad


---------35:38----------
I don't like exerting that energy at


---------35:41----------
least for too long and two weeks felt


---------35:43----------
long yeah so let's ask so let me ask you


---------35:47----------
a couple questions about that so the


---------35:49----------
first is is that okay um I think so


---------36:00----------
because I know it's only temporary


---------36:04----------
I wouldn't want to like be a negative


---------36:06----------
ball of energy for like a long long


---------36:10----------
period of time but like it feels good


---------36:12----------
now that like knowing after like two to


---------36:14----------
three weeks like I feel like it's


---------36:16----------
getting better mm-hmm okay yeah so the


---------36:20----------
next question I have for you is do you


---------36:22----------
think you were selfish


---------36:29----------
I don't think so but in this case I feel


---------36:34----------
like I am because


---------36:42----------
I think it's because


---------36:44----------
I know he doesn't want to break up


---------36:47----------
that I feel like it's a little selfish


---------36:50----------
and that


---------36:53----------
we could get back together in like a


---------36:56----------
year from now or whatever and it'd be


---------36:58----------
like him waiting or whatever even though


---------37:01----------
I'm not asking him to and that feels


---------37:03----------
like selfish because I know him I kind


---------37:05----------
of feel like he would wait regardless


---------37:07----------
until he knew like there's no chance


---------37:11----------
[Music]


---------37:12----------
yeah so it feels like selfish in that


---------37:15----------
regard


---------37:17----------
is that okay


---------37:20----------
I think that's okay and


---------37:24----------
something bad happens in between or like


---------37:26----------
yeah um I did I don't think it would be


---------37:31----------
okay if I started seeing someone else


---------37:33----------
what do you alright you just lost me for


---------37:36----------
a second so so what would not be okay


---------37:38----------
about that because he's waiting for you


---------37:41----------
[Music]


---------37:44----------
what's up cuz I would hurt him or what


---------37:46----------
okay so you don't think it's okay so let


---------37:53----------
me just share a couple of thoughts so


---------37:55----------
first of all so you got it you got to


---------37:57----------
like let me finish okay cuz I'm gonna


---------37:58----------
say some things but sometimes I say some


---------38:00----------
things that sound hurtful but it's


---------38:02----------
really not my intention


---------38:03----------
so first thing is I think what you did


---------38:04----------
was selfish and I also think that that's


---------38:06----------
completely okay so I think sometimes we


---------38:09----------
forget and and know that did I just


---------38:13----------
body you there was that hard to hear


---------38:15----------
okay no so I think sometimes we forget


---------38:18----------
like so we have this idea of like who we


---------38:20----------
are right and Yvonne is the person that


---------38:22----------
takes care of other people she's the


---------38:24----------
person who supports our you're the


---------38:26----------
support right and then they're their


---------38:28----------
takers and they're givers and sometimes


---------38:31----------
we go through life thinking that we're a


---------38:32----------
giver and so it can be really hard to


---------38:36----------
like be a taker because that's not who


---------38:39----------
you are and so like it's funny because


---------38:41----------
we kind of say you know we treat


---------38:43----------
selfishness like a bad thing because in


---------38:46----------
a sense it is bad but I don't think the


---------38:48----------
world is quite that black-and-white like


---------38:50----------
I think anytime you break up in a


---------38:51----------
relationship where the other person


---------38:53----------
doesn't want to break up because you're


---------38:54----------
not happy that's selfish and also I


---------38:58----------
think it's fine right like as human


---------39:01----------
beings you know it's it's okay and I


---------39:04----------
think this is a big problem that a lot


---------39:06----------
of people have that like it's okay to


---------39:07----------
you know put yourself first I don't


---------39:11----------
think you should put yourself first all


---------39:12----------
the time I don't think that you should


---------39:14----------
you know


---------39:17----------
I think you should be careful about I


---------39:19----------
think the most important thing is that


---------39:21----------
you're intentional and aware of when


---------39:24----------
you're putting yourself first and when


---------39:26----------
you're not putting yourself first the


---------39:29----------
biggest problems I've ever seen in


---------39:31----------
relationships and we are when people are


---------39:33----------
not aware of like when they're being


---------39:36----------
selfish and when they are like when


---------39:39----------
someone doesn't when someone thinks that


---------39:41----------
they're being selfless and they're


---------39:42----------
actually being selfish like that's what


---------39:44----------
tanks a relationship for one person to


---------39:47----------
say hey this doesn't work for me right


---------39:49----------
now and I need to like put myself first


---------39:51----------
I think that's fine and is it gonna hurt


---------39:53----------
another person yes and that's actually


---------39:56----------
okay - I don't think that we can live


---------39:58----------
our lives controlling I mean there's


---------40:00----------
certainly some things that we can do


---------40:01----------
that can hurt other people but I think


---------40:04----------
some of that is on them and some of that


---------40:06----------
is on us mm-hmm and I'm not saying that


---------40:09----------
you know you can't hurt another person


---------40:11----------
because you clearly can and maybe that's


---------40:13----------
when you refer to what's going on right


---------40:14----------
now I think that's what we see yeah and


---------40:18----------
so I'm not saying that you know you you


---------40:20----------
can't hurt like of course you can hurt


---------40:21----------
another human being but I think you know


---------40:23----------
some of that is like their investment


---------40:26----------
and their attachment to the relationship


---------40:28----------
is what's gonna cause them hurt and and


---------40:32----------
sometimes I think it is okay to end a


---------40:33----------
relationship that your partner doesn't


---------40:35----------
want to end because it's not working for


---------40:37----------
you because that's just sort of that's


---------40:38----------
life


---------40:38----------
right mm-hmm what do you think about all


---------40:41----------
that that makes sense


---------40:47----------
better than what was in my head what was


---------40:49----------
in your head oh I just felt bad and I


---------40:53----------
felt like


---------40:55----------
Oh


---------40:59----------
I just felt bad


---------41:08----------
he asked me if like what I'm


---------41:11----------
doing feels fair


---------41:14----------
and I guess it does feel like it's fair


---------41:20----------
to me but not him sure and I agree and


---------41:25----------
what I'm saying is that sometimes it's


---------41:27----------
okay to be unfair in a relationship like


---------41:30----------
that's this is a crazy thing is like you


---------41:32----------
know we try to be perfect but I think


---------41:34----------
that like life is muddy right when


---------41:37----------
you're playing League of Legends like


---------41:38----------
sometimes you get damaged it's part of


---------41:41----------
the game you know it's it's like and and


---------41:45----------
is it unfair to him absolutely


---------41:48----------
and sometimes I think that that's okay


---------41:52----------
which is weird because like a lot of


---------41:53----------
times we tie together like we assume


---------41:55----------
that unfairness does unacceptable


---------41:57----------
mmm-hmm which is like a really really


---------42:00----------
interesting nuance and that we feel like


---------42:04----------
everyone has to be fair all the time but


---------42:06----------
in my experience of relationships like


---------42:07----------
relationships are frequently unfair and


---------42:10----------
even the healthiest ones are frequently


---------42:12----------
very unfair and generally speaking we


---------42:16----------
hope that over time that there's


---------42:17----------
fairness over the aggregate but like


---------42:19----------
he's invested a lot in the relationship


---------42:21----------
it sounds like he's been very supportive


---------42:24----------
it sounds like he's been a good person


---------42:25----------
he's been nice to your friends he's he's


---------42:28----------
really supported you and so it kind of


---------42:30----------
feels like he kind of got screwed mm-hmm


---------42:33----------
you know cuz because you're and I'm not


---------42:35----------
trying to beat you up here but I think I


---------42:37----------
think it's important to call it what it


---------42:38----------
is because like from his perspective


---------42:39----------
he's invested seven years into this


---------42:41----------
relationship and like the hardest thing


---------42:44----------
from his perspective is he's not doing


---------42:45----------
anything wrong yeah like it's so easy to


---------42:48----------
are not so easy but it comes way easier


---------42:51----------
to break up with someone and be broken


---------42:53----------
up with if you [ __ ] up in some way


---------42:54----------
yeah yeah but like what the [ __ ] he did


---------42:58----------
everything right yeah and I'm gonna be a


---------43:01----------
little bit hyperbolic here so you know


---------43:03----------
let me know if your feelings get hurt


---------43:04----------
but I'm just gonna hmm you're kind of


---------43:06----------
being neutral and kind of quiet and so


---------43:08----------
when you're when people are neutral I


---------43:10----------
tend to show more emotion okay so let me


---------43:13----------
know if you feel judged but he's like


---------43:15----------
what the [ __ ] yeah yeah I don't like


---------43:18----------
you're breaking up with me when I've


---------43:20----------
supported you for seven years and like


---------43:22----------
you're dumping me because you need


---------43:23----------
independence mm-hmm like why don't you


---------43:26----------
tell me when you were 24 so I


---------43:28----------
moved on with my life you know what


---------43:30----------
that's not he feels and that's a fair


---------43:31----------
way to feel mm-hmm and just because he


---------43:35----------
feels like it's unfair doesn't mean that


---------43:37----------
you can't break up with it mm-hmm no


---------43:40----------
thank you


---------43:45----------
just one of those things that feels bad


---------43:47----------
but you know it is what it is yeah


---------43:50----------
do people yeah so you seem like okay


---------43:54----------
with this mm-hmm fry that's impressive


---------44:03----------
what Oh but uh-oh is is it yeah I think


---------44:10----------
it's really hard to so I think a lot of


---------44:12----------
people feel a lot of people have trouble


---------44:16----------
tolerating the idea that they did


---------44:18----------
something that was unfair to another


---------44:20----------
person and they actually knew all kinds


---------44:22----------
of mental gymnastics to convince


---------44:23----------
themselves that it was fair that's what


---------44:26----------
I think is really impressive because


---------44:28----------
I've talked to a lot of people who who


---------44:29----------
are in your situation and find some way


---------44:33----------
to make it fair


---------44:34----------
mm-hmm right they come up with all these


---------44:36----------
reasons of things that like maybe your


---------44:39----------
boyfriend did or didn't do or like you


---------44:41----------
know they like rationalize things or


---------44:43----------
they justify things but I think a


---------44:45----------
genuine lose I really respect what


---------44:47----------
you're saying which is that yeah it kind


---------44:49----------
of sucks for him but I had to do it


---------44:50----------
because I had to do it mm-hmm which sort


---------44:54----------
of sounds cold but I think that it's


---------44:55----------
actually incredibly authentic and it's


---------44:58----------
better to be honest with yourself and


---------45:00----------
know that you did something that like


---------45:02----------
hurt another human being then pretend


---------45:05----------
that you did it that's I felt more like


---------45:08----------
also I'd be dishonest with him if I


---------45:11----------
stayed with him and felt that way yeah


---------45:13----------
so you know the other way to look at it


---------45:16----------
is yeah you told him it like so on the


---------45:19----------
one hand you maybe could have told him a


---------45:21----------
little bit earlier but you know I think


---------45:23----------
you told him when you did because that's


---------45:24----------
when you started to feel this way it's


---------45:27----------
more like a lot strongly about it yeah


---------45:29----------
on the other hand you know I think it is


---------45:31----------
good that you know you didn't just


---------45:34----------
squash those feelings and then go


---------45:36----------
another seven years yeah because I've


---------45:39----------
seen those relationships to where you


---------45:42----------
know then it usually ends in divorce


---------45:43----------
mm-hmm and and yeah so okay so I feel


---------45:50----------
like we kind of covered that I have a


---------45:51----------
couple of other different thoughts any


---------45:53----------
any thoughts questions reflections oh


---------45:55----------
that's good okay is that helpful yeah it


---------46:00----------
is really helpful how can I go for a


---------46:02----------
bathroom base yes absolutely


---------46:09----------
you


---------46:18----------
you


---------46:25----------
posture check


---------46:31----------
[Music]


---------46:36----------
wait how am i saying hi to myself dr. K


---------46:41----------
Chicago maybe


---------46:46----------
seems uncomfortable for the headrest but


---------46:49----------
maybe it isn't


---------46:55----------
you


---------47:02----------
so what should we do chat should we go


---------47:04----------
philosophical should we talk about


---------47:06----------
current events or should we talk about


---------47:11----------
Foster syndrome sorry I'm


---------47:18----------
welcome back so I have a couple of


---------47:22----------
questions for you of on okay so I sort


---------47:25----------
of feel like we're done talking about


---------47:26----------
that thing you seem to be actually


---------47:29----------
pretty level-headed about it


---------47:32----------
I'm not getting like a whole lot of like


---------47:34----------
unresolved piles of yeah you know motion


---------47:38----------
so a couple of other thoughts I mean


---------47:41----------
does that feel okay to you I mean you're


---------47:43----------
nodding but okay yeah how's your


---------47:47----------
nervousness by the way uh better now


---------47:50----------
yeah I can tell yeah so a couple of


---------47:54----------
interesting so a couple of directions so


---------47:57----------
we can talk about what's going on now we


---------48:00----------
can talk about impostor syndrome and


---------48:02----------
where you kind of get the idea that you


---------48:05----------
know why you dodge when people try to


---------48:07----------
appreciate you because you'd a dodge at


---------48:09----------
all right now by the way I don't know if


---------48:10----------
you remember not like dodging or no


---------48:13----------
cognitive biases or anything like that


---------48:15----------
least not that I could pick up


---------48:17----------
so either you're out playing me or


---------48:19----------
they're not there I think is just in


---------48:21----------
certain areas like maybe not in all


---------48:24----------
aspects of life but in that aspect I do


---------48:27----------
feel that way yeah I would agree with


---------48:29----------
that


---------48:29----------
so we can talk about kind of what's


---------48:31----------
going on right now how that's stressful


---------48:33----------
where you get your idea of like who you


---------48:36----------
are we can also dig into a little bit


---------48:39----------
more about that sort of like thirst for


---------48:40----------
independence and where that comes from


---------48:42----------
I think though like those are kind of


---------48:44----------
deeper discussions the other interesting


---------48:46----------
thing this is a little bit philosophical


---------48:47----------
a little bit yogic but you know it was


---------48:52----------
and so this may be a little bit less


---------48:54----------
personal I don't know how helpful this


---------48:56----------
is gonna be but I find it interesting is


---------48:58----------
the idea of living a life without


---------49:01----------
regrets right so like when you're faced


---------49:04----------
with a choice in life and you say this


---------49:06----------
is good but if I do this then I may


---------49:09----------
regret something like how do you know


---------49:14----------
when to change and how do you know when


---------49:18----------
to concur so you're essentially giving


---------49:21----------
in to your fear of regret by making a


---------49:24----------
change in your relationship you see that


---------49:26----------
mmm-hmm so when do you conquer the fear


---------49:29----------
of regret and when do you give in to the


---------49:32----------
fear of regret and I don't think that


---------49:34----------
one is necessarily better than the other


---------49:36----------
because sometimes giving in to the fear


---------49:38----------
of regret is exactly what you need to


---------49:39----------
like that's how you make good choices


---------49:40----------
and other times it's how you make


---------49:43----------
terrible choices yeah right so like if


---------49:46----------
I'm


---------49:46----------
in like my mid-40s and I have a midlife


---------49:49----------
crisis and I think about all of the


---------49:51----------
things I feel tied down with a mortgage


---------49:54----------
and paying college funds and stuff like


---------49:56----------
that and I think about you know I wanted


---------49:58----------
to get a you know like a motorcycle and


---------50:02----------
like drive across Asia and then I like


---------50:05----------
that regret and I'm like [ __ ] that I'm


---------50:07----------
gonna divorce I'm gonna go because I


---------50:10----------
have to like do this for myself


---------50:11----------
otherwise I'll die on my deathbed and


---------50:13----------
all have regrets so when is it the right


---------50:16----------
choice to give in to the fear of regret


---------50:20----------
and when did is when is it the wrong


---------50:22----------
choice I don't even know how to begin


---------50:23----------
that discussion but I think it's a


---------50:25----------
really interesting conundrum right is it


---------50:28----------
because there is a road in which you can


---------50:32----------
essentially let go of your fear of what


---------50:36----------
could have been and stick with what you


---------50:39----------
have yeah and it's just a interesting


---------50:44----------
kind of conundrum that I was noticing


---------50:45----------
that you know you were facing it and we


---------50:47----------
sort of had this idea that like you got


---------50:50----------
to do you but I I don't know if that's


---------50:52----------
always true because sometimes that just


---------50:53----------
turns you into an [ __ ] yeah I think


---------50:56----------
it really depends on what it is because


---------50:58----------
I think like in my case it's like it


---------51:01----------
would be also unfair to him and it's


---------51:04----------
like something that I didn't just like


---------51:06----------
randomly thought of and on a whim it's


---------51:09----------
like something that's been really goes


---------51:12----------
fairly important and somewhat reasonable


---------51:15----------
to do so I think it feels like very


---------51:19----------
dream you'd have to definitely be way


---------51:23----------
more careful about that yeah so I agree


---------51:26----------
with you a hundred percent and also


---------51:28----------
having talked to some 45 year olds they


---------51:31----------
also think about it a lot sometimes they


---------51:33----------
think about in four years mm-hmm and


---------51:37----------
they feel like it is unfair to their


---------51:39----------
partner as well to be in a marriage


---------51:42----------
where you're not happy mm-hmm so I think


---------51:47----------
sometimes they think the same things


---------51:49----------
even though I'm painting a picture


---------51:50----------
that's like far more reason I mean far


---------51:53----------
less reasonable sometimes those people


---------51:55----------
feel the same way and I think it's an


---------51:56----------
interesting question to figure out like


---------51:58----------
you know how do you


---------51:59----------
what's when what's right and what's


---------52:01----------
wrong but anyway yeah so what what do


---------52:05----------
you want to talk about because I think


---------52:07----------
we still have a little bit of time you


---------52:12----------
wanna talk about what's going on right


---------52:13----------
now you want to talk about a little bit


---------52:15----------
more about imposter syndrome hmm where


---------52:19----------
independence where the need for


---------52:20----------
independence comes from why why you get


---------52:23----------
pissed off when people complain and do


---------52:25----------
nothing about it I think we can talk


---------52:27----------
about what's going on right now yeah so


---------52:29----------
tell me what's going on right now um so


---------52:33----------
right now there's a lot of the sexual


---------52:39----------
harassment and sexual assault stuff


---------52:41----------
going around on social media and I guess


---------52:47----------
there's like some things that i


---------52:49----------
minimized a lot before that are starting


---------52:52----------
to what feels like blow up in my face


---------52:55----------
now and um when I was in those


---------53:01----------
situations I guess


---------53:05----------
both times I just like froze at certain


---------53:09----------
points and like I don't know why I do


---------53:14----------
that or like how to prevent that or like


---------53:18----------
what do you mean by those situations


---------53:21----------
what are you froze what does that mean


---------53:24----------
um in which like the


---------53:29----------
sexual


---------53:31----------
iseman or assault or it happened do you


---------53:35----------
mm-hmm


---------53:37----------
oh [ __ ] that's awful


---------53:41----------
have you talked about this like if you


---------53:43----------
because I know a lot of people are like


---------53:45----------
posting stuff publicly you mentioned any


---------53:47----------
of this to people before oh no I haven't


---------53:51----------
um but I've talked to my friends about


---------53:54----------
it okay so the first question I mean


---------53:56----------
this question genuinely I understand


---------53:58----------
that we sort of said we're going to talk


---------53:59----------
about this but I would really think


---------54:02----------
about whether you're to what degree


---------54:05----------
you're comfortable disclosing stuff like


---------54:07----------
here and now because I definitely don't


---------54:09----------
want to ask you things that you're not


---------54:12----------
comfortable saying mm-hmm


---------54:16----------
so let's just think about that for a


---------54:18----------
second because I'm you know my next


---------54:19----------
question is gonna be like what happened


---------54:21----------
yeah and but I want to just make sure I


---------54:25----------
don't want you to feel I want to


---------54:28----------
acknowledge that you may feel pressure


---------54:29----------
to answer that question and at the same


---------54:31----------
time I want to give you the space to not


---------54:33----------
answer it and also I'm going to judge


---------54:35----------
you for like not speaking because you're


---------54:37----------
not ready I think I'm okay with like


---------54:42----------
explaining scenarios and like


---------54:44----------
circumstances and how I feel and stuff


---------54:47----------
but I don't want to like name people


---------54:50----------
okay so anything okay


---------54:53----------
I completely understand and respect that


---------54:55----------
and but I I want to just I think it's


---------55:02----------
important if it's okay with you for us


---------55:03----------
to also talk about what makes you


---------55:06----------
uncomfortable naming people


---------55:10----------
hmm not that you have to name the people


---------55:12----------
but can we explore the feeling of


---------55:14----------
hesitation about naming people yeah okay


---------55:19----------
some of it yeah


---------55:21----------
great I'm just asking for whatever you


---------55:23----------
feel comfortable yet there because and


---------55:25----------
now I want you to step out of this


---------55:27----------
discussion and talk to me we're not


---------55:30----------
talking about this now we're just step


---------55:31----------
out of it we're gonna go madam for a


---------55:33----------
second so Yvonne I want us to think a


---------55:36----------
little bit about our opportunities in


---------55:38----------
this conversation so you're gonna have


---------55:42----------
personal feelings fine it can be hard


---------55:44----------
for you fine there can be all kinds of


---------55:46----------
consequences of this conversation the


---------55:48----------
reason that I'm particularly interested


---------55:50----------
in would like permission to explore your


---------55:52----------
feelings to not name names and explore


---------55:55----------
the boundary because you drew a line in


---------55:56----------
the sand right you said I'm okay talking


---------55:59----------
about all this [ __ ] but I'm not took


---------56:00----------
okay talking about this and I think that


---------56:03----------
line in the sand is something that many


---------56:08----------
many people experience and is part of


---------56:10----------
what's responsible for what we're the


---------56:13----------
situation yeah does that make sense to


---------56:15----------
you yeah so I think I'm not asking you


---------56:18----------
to name names I'm really not yeah at the


---------56:20----------
same time I think it's very very


---------56:23----------
important for everyone to understand


---------56:25----------
when someone is a victim of some kind or


---------56:28----------
the receiver of sexual harassment or


---------56:31----------
assault like what is going on that keep


---------56:34----------
slip like you don't want to say


---------56:37----------
something right in fact you actively


---------56:39----------
don't want to and like what's up with


---------56:42----------
that because that's something that I


---------56:43----------
think we need to understand I'm not


---------56:44----------
saying you should change some people may


---------56:46----------
say that you should change but I'm not


---------56:48----------
it's not my place yeah so okay cool


---------56:51----------
can we talk we get all right so what


---------56:54----------
happened


---------56:57----------
[Music]


---------56:59----------
uh the first time


---------57:05----------
I had a club for a friend's birthday and


---------57:08----------
then he got a table and then I worried


---------57:13----------
by


---------57:17----------
in 2018 okay oh okay so a couple years


---------57:22----------
ago yeah okay a couple years ago and


---------57:26----------
then


---------57:30----------
it was next to


---------57:32----------
Abell of some people that I knew


---------57:36----------
for me sports


---------57:38----------
and they weren't people that I met


---------57:42----------
before


---------57:42----------
I just know them because I because I see


---------57:45----------
them on I'll see us and stuff and then


---------57:50----------
the guys it was like talking to me


---------57:52----------
because he recognized me from one of our


---------57:55----------
parties and then he was just like oh


---------57:58----------
like you're like you've gone from


---------58:01----------
offline TV and like stuff like that and


---------58:03----------
then he like struck up a conversation


---------58:05----------
and then he also like he asked me like


---------58:08----------
what ethnicity I was and I said oh I'm


---------58:10----------
like Chinese and then he like talked to


---------58:15----------
the other people that we were there too


---------58:18----------
and he asked them like the same thing


---------58:22----------
kind of you're in their similar


---------58:25----------
conversation and then like yeah I


---------58:28----------
thought he was like being pretty


---------58:29----------
friendly but just like talking wise like


---------58:31----------
there wasn't anything crazy and he was


---------58:34----------
like pretty drunk and then we walked out


---------58:38----------
of the club and then he like said to


---------58:42----------
someone beside him who was like there he


---------58:45----------
is just like


---------58:47----------
how do I say I want to [ __ ] you in


---------58:49----------
Chinese and


---------58:53----------
then later


---------58:57----------
we I try to get into an uber to go to my


---------59:01----------
friend's house we're all in like a van


---------59:03----------
because a bunch of us are going together


---------59:05----------
and then he


---------59:12----------
so my boyfriend at the time is well it's


---------59:16----------
us in the backseat my boyfriend that guy


---------59:20----------
and me and then sitting in the middle


---------59:24----------
yeah I don't know why he was sitting in


---------59:26----------
the middle it's just when we got into


---------59:27----------
like her I don't even know why he came


---------59:29----------
with us to be honest he just saw maybe


---------59:32----------
where I was going and so he followed I'm


---------59:35----------
not sure but um he was just in in


---------59:39----------
between us I don't think he he didn't


---------59:41----------
know we were dating I think cuz it was


---------59:42----------
just like um yeah and then in the fan


---------59:50----------
like I was wearing like a crop top and


---------59:53----------
like a skirt and he like it's a good


---------59:58----------
tough it's like a t-shirt is usually


---------59:59----------
pretty long a crop top is kinda like


---------60:01----------
cropped in the middle okay so when


---------60:03----------
you're sitting down it could like go up


---------60:06----------
a little bit thank you yeah um it's like


---------60:09----------
a [ __ ] it's just a short t-shirt and


---------60:11----------
then so like is your is your belly


---------60:14----------
button showing in the crop top no no not


---------60:17----------
even it goes past that okay and then uh


---------60:22----------
he has some I don't remember how but I


---------60:26----------
just remember like he had his hand like


---------60:28----------
under my crop top like on my skin


---------60:31----------
and I felt super uncomfortable like his


---------60:35----------
arm around me like touching me there and


---------60:39----------
then I


---------60:40----------
I remember I was like I have to like


---------60:43----------
stop this and then I like grabbed his


---------60:46----------
hand I grabbed his hand and I put it


---------60:48----------
over my head back to where he was or


---------60:51----------
back to just you know on his side this


---------60:54----------
is my side and like I put it back on his


---------60:57----------
side and then


---------61:02----------
and then somehow he had his hand on my


---------61:05----------
ass


---------61:06----------
and then I just froze


---------61:11----------
like he basically went back ahead how my


---------61:13----------
ass and I just frozen I didn't doing or


---------61:15----------
or from his side all the way around like


---------61:19----------
like a round like this yeah and then I


---------61:21----------
just like froze and I just couldn't do


---------61:25----------
anything there was so because I felt


---------61:27----------
like I already like threw his hand away


---------61:29----------
and he did it again and I didn't know


---------61:31----------
what to do and then


---------61:36----------
yeah and yeah that's and then we got


---------61:39----------
back to my friend's place and then I


---------61:41----------
think he saw there's like a ton of


---------61:43----------
people there and he just left afterwards


---------61:47----------
and then later on that way like a couple


---------61:50----------
days later he like DM me on Twitter and


---------61:53----------
he's like hey I don't remember like


---------61:56----------
anything from that night just remember


---------61:59----------
meeting you


---------62:01----------

---------62:09----------

---------62:17----------

---------62:48----------

---------63:19----------

---------63:20----------

---------63:21----------
so one thing that we can do is we can


---------63:23----------
just hear the second story and then like


---------63:25----------
try to find themes or common things or


---------63:27----------
we can like tunnel down into this one


---------63:29----------
first okay what do you think okay maybe


---------63:35----------
second one and then find like the common


---------63:38----------
theme I think I just want to like yeah


---------63:42----------
[Music]


---------63:45----------
second one is


---------63:50----------
someone who is like a really good friend


---------63:52----------
of mine who I like trusted a lot and oh


---------63:59----------
my god every story is the I'm drunk


---------64:02----------
story but he was drunk he came he just


---------64:07----------
uh he was out drinking


---------64:10----------
and


---------64:15----------
I was like in my room in my bed and then


---------64:19----------
he came in and he do you guys


---------64:27----------
okay yeah how does he get into your


---------64:31----------
house uh he was just teach us can or yes


---------64:39----------
yeah just a good friend


---------64:43----------
and he came in and


---------64:49----------
laid down next to me and


---------64:53----------
felt it was fun that wasn't anything


---------64:56----------
weird and then he grabbed my hand and


---------65:02----------
like held it and I froze I was like


---------65:07----------
maybe he's just like drunk and like


---------65:10----------
wants to just chill or something um and


---------65:14----------
then he like started brushing my hand


---------65:18----------
against his face and then he like kissed


---------65:20----------
it and then


---------65:26----------
ah


---------65:30----------
and then he also like


---------65:34----------
went into like my sleeve like my t-shirt


---------65:37----------
sleeve and then like


---------65:42----------
basically just


---------65:44----------
and it just it was weird like it was


---------65:46----------
like an area I was uncomfortable with


---------65:49----------
and then I just like froze and like I


---------65:52----------
didn't know what to do and then ten


---------65:56----------
minutes later and then he like stopped


---------65:58----------
and then he like it looked like he liked


---------66:00----------
what he like fell asleep or something


---------66:02----------
and then ten minutes ago he's like whoa


---------66:04----------
how did I get here and I was like you


---------66:07----------
don't remember anything and he's like no


---------66:09----------
and I was like okay


---------66:15----------
and I thought like he just you know was


---------66:18----------
that just


---------66:21----------
drunken maybe he blocked down he forgot


---------66:23----------
I don't know


---------66:24----------
and then um


---------66:27----------
I asked him the next day I was like do


---------66:28----------
you like so do you remember what


---------66:30----------
happened last night and he's just like


---------66:32----------
no and I was like okay um but I just


---------66:38----------
kind of brushed it off I guess and then


---------66:41----------
a month later or like I don't even know


---------66:46----------
if as a month later or a couple weeks


---------66:48----------
later but like something he came in


---------66:52----------
again again when he was drunk


---------66:56----------
and then


---------66:59----------
apologized for what he did he said he


---------67:02----------
knew he was like overstepping or


---------67:04----------
something and that it was like yeah


---------67:07----------
uh so he remembered when he was drunk


---------67:12----------
again


---------67:13----------
but he didn't remember when I asked him


---------67:16----------
he was sober the next day that time so


---------67:20----------
do you think about that


---------67:24----------
I feel like he remembers and he just


---------67:27----------
lied that he forgot what happened last


---------67:29----------
night


---------67:30----------
or the other night why would someone do


---------67:32----------
that


---------67:37----------
what maybe be about remembering


---------67:43----------
so he doesn't have to be as responsible


---------67:46----------
for what he did can you think of any


---------67:49----------
other reasons


---------67:53----------
responsibilities absolutely one of the


---------67:55----------
biggest reasons that people lie yeah I'm


---------67:59----------
not really sure what the other could be


---------68:02----------
right now


---------68:05----------
but he apologized and then ten minutes


---------68:08----------
later he did the exact same thing I'm


---------68:10----------
also - the t-shirt part I gotta say the


---------68:15----------
not sure it's [ __ ] weird man


---------68:17----------
it is weird yes is yes it's weird I


---------68:21----------
don't even I mean I've heard a lot of


---------68:23----------
weird [ __ ] in my day and it's it's so


---------68:28----------
interesting how when we think about


---------68:31----------
violation we think about certain body


---------68:33----------
parts but holy [ __ ] the t-shirt sounds


---------68:36----------
so creepy it is is like an uncomfortable


---------68:39----------
place I wouldn't waste to like touch


---------68:43----------
people it's like when you think about


---------68:45----------
like boundaries and violations like we


---------68:47----------
generally think about like genitals yeah


---------68:50----------
or even the face but like the t-shirt is


---------68:53----------
just I mean it it sound I mean it sorry


---------68:57----------
if I'm talking too much about the


---------68:58----------
services making you uncomfortable it's


---------69:00----------
just hearing your story has made me


---------69:02----------
really appreciate how violation doesn't


---------69:06----------
have to do with genitals right there's


---------69:09----------
something about the experience of like


---------69:10----------
boundaries and space and lines and


---------69:13----------
crossing lines that is not just you know


---------69:19----------
like there's a certain essence to it


---------69:21----------
it's like a place that no one normally


---------69:24----------
touches it was like right on the side


---------69:27----------
here that's like next to you know and


---------69:31----------
it's like yeah it feels very like


---------69:33----------
private still or like it's just not


---------69:35----------
somewhat somewhere I want my good friend


---------69:38----------
to be touching me that's weird


---------69:40----------
yeah like I don't know and like you just


---------69:47----------
pretended like you forgot about the


---------69:48----------
whole thing how does that make you feel


---------69:50----------
i minimized it a lot


---------69:57----------
cuz I would still see him around so I


---------70:00----------
basically tried to just


---------70:03----------
act like it never happened so see that's


---------70:06----------
interesting the language there is


---------70:07----------
interesting I traveled to act like it


---------70:10----------
never happened so what I'm hearing from


---------70:13----------
you is there's actually like a part of


---------70:14----------
your mind that is actively suppressing


---------70:18----------
what happened yeah and I did that for a


---------70:23----------
very long time how do you understand


---------70:25----------
that part of you oh I didn't I think


---------70:31----------
until recently when I started reading


---------70:34----------
everything and I realized how much I


---------70:37----------
minimized it and it's to the point where


---------70:39----------
it's very hard for me to ignore it now


---------70:41----------
right so what I'm asking you is why does


---------70:44----------
a mind so now we're gonna go meta again


---------70:47----------
okay like so like let me just so


---------70:52----------
actually first let me ask you so after


---------70:53----------
sharing this stuff or saying it out loud


---------70:55----------
do you have any thoughts or feelings


---------70:57----------
that come up like how do you feel after


---------71:01----------
sharing this I feel like upset that he


---------71:05----------
was able to get away with it


---------71:08----------
um


---------71:08----------
[Music]


---------71:11----------
that


---------71:14----------
people who just


---------71:18----------
people don't see him that way


---------71:25----------
which sucks people don't see him that


---------71:28----------
way


---------71:30----------
and so what how does that shape what you


---------71:33----------
do


---------71:36----------
[Music]


---------71:42----------
I don't really know it just


---------71:49----------
yeah so let's look at that so when


---------71:55----------
people don't see someone a particular


---------71:57----------
way what I'm hearing from you is that it


---------72:00----------
makes it harder for you to run against


---------72:02----------
the grain


---------72:06----------
one's thinking one way it's hard to


---------72:07----------
speak up hmm I feel differently from


---------72:15----------
that and I can't really explain it


---------72:19----------
[Music]


---------72:21----------
yeah it's just not something can yeah so


---------72:27----------
Yvonne I really am gonna press you here


---------72:31----------
if that's okay because I think it's very


---------72:33----------
important for everyone out there


---------72:35----------
listening to understand why it's hard


---------72:37----------
for you to speak mmm right so like I'm


---------72:40----------
hearing a theme here which is that like


---------72:42----------
you kind of made like there were lots of


---------72:46----------
points where


---------72:50----------
you could have said something and you


---------72:54----------
didn't and I'm not blaming you for that


---------72:56----------
I'm just saying that I think it's a


---------72:58----------
testament to like the pressure that you


---------73:01----------
feel in those moments does that make


---------73:04----------
sense


---------73:05----------
mm-hmm it's like really really hard to


---------73:08----------
speak and the question yes why right so


---------73:12----------
like when when a dude so first of all so


---------73:15----------
it sounds like he asked someone else how


---------73:18----------
do you say I want to [ __ ] or something


---------73:20----------
in Chinese right or no he said I want


---------73:23----------
how do you mean how do you say I want to


---------73:25----------
[ __ ] you in Chinese and he wasn't


---------73:27----------
talking to you he was talking to anyone


---------73:30----------
else yeah man I could hear it okay so


---------73:34----------
like you're pretty sure it was directed


---------73:35----------
towards you which you know when he


---------73:38----------
climbs into the car and starts putting


---------73:40----------
his hand on your ass we can either flip


---------73:42----------
to and do together yeah and and so you


---------73:46----------
know I'm just I'm kind of envisioning


---------73:47----------
because you use this phrase you say you


---------73:49----------
use the word froze mm-hmm and I'd really


---------73:53----------
like to understand you know as best as


---------73:56----------
you can and I understand it's hard


---------73:57----------
because like we don't talk about the


---------73:59----------
stuff and like this is the problem right


---------74:00----------
as people don't know so if we think


---------74:02----------
about like what we do on the stream we


---------74:05----------
help people put words to things that


---------74:07----------
they don't understand and by one person


---------74:10----------
putting words to it it helps everyone


---------74:12----------
else recognize oh [ __ ] that's what I'm


---------74:14----------
feeling


---------74:15----------
mm-hmm and I haven't been able to put


---------74:17----------
words to it and and if it's okay with


---------74:19----------
you and it's not you know like you you


---------74:22----------
draw the line wherever you want to or


---------74:23----------
you know you call it quits whenever


---------74:25----------
you're ready to and I really I'm not


---------74:26----------
trying to I won't judge you for that at


---------74:29----------
the same time I do feel like it's very


---------74:31----------
important for people to at least


---------74:34----------
understand how you feel about it and I


---------74:39----------
find myself because if I think I think


---------74:41----------
if we want to fix this we have to help


---------74:44----------
people understand like how you freeze


---------74:47----------
because it's shocking to me that


---------74:49----------
something like this can happen and by


---------74:51----------
shocking it once again I don't blame you


---------74:52----------
for it but I think it's just it speaks


---------74:54----------
to how big of a problem this is that you


---------74:57----------
can be in a car with your boyfriend and


---------74:59----------
a dude can be like feeling you up


---------75:03----------
there's a lot of stuff here that just


---------75:05----------
boggles my mind like you know when when


---------75:08----------
your friend comes in and lays down next


---------75:11----------
to you in bed like is that something


---------75:12----------
that happened like is that normal within


---------75:15----------
the range of how you interact with


---------75:17----------
people and I'm not trying to paint you


---------75:19----------
and about just yet and and so so you


---------75:21----------
know like how does how does a situation


---------75:23----------
arise where like he thinks that that's


---------75:25----------
acceptable and furthermore when he's


---------75:29----------
laying in bed like what makes it hard


---------75:31----------
for you I don't want to say what makes


---------75:34----------
it hard for you to tell him to leave but


---------75:36----------
because I've heard your language it was


---------75:38----------
sort of like well maybe it's just this


---------75:41----------
like there's a part of your mind that is


---------75:44----------
telling you that this is not okay and


---------75:46----------
what I'm also hearing you is there's a


---------75:48----------
part of your mind that is trying to like


---------75:51----------
be the Mafia and like shut up the part


---------75:54----------
of your mind that's telling you it's not


---------75:55----------
okay


---------75:56----------
that's almost how it sounds to me does


---------75:58----------
that make sense yeah like you tried


---------76:01----------
really hard to minimize it it's almost


---------76:04----------
like the secret police is like showing


---------76:06----------
up at your door and telling the part of


---------76:08----------
your mind it's like hey this is [ __ ]


---------76:09----------
up they're like don't say anything


---------76:12----------
and even now that I mean I'm guessing


---------76:15----------
that that's still there because you even


---------76:17----------
said I don't want to name names so I


---------76:20----------
want you to like look within yourself


---------76:22----------
and try to think is there a part of you


---------76:24----------
that's saying and I'm sorry that this is


---------76:26----------
hurting you I really I really am that


---------76:30----------
but like you know I think it scares the


---------76:34----------
[ __ ] out of me that there's like some


---------76:35----------
part of you that like keeps you from


---------76:37----------
speaking and I'm not saying you're dumb


---------76:39----------
and I'm not saying it's bad I'm saying


---------76:40----------
like that's the reality that my face


---------76:42----------
what we're seeing is like the actual


---------76:44----------
struggle like this is why people say


---------76:47----------
silent because something within you is


---------76:49----------
telling you


---------76:50----------
Evon whatever you do do not open your


---------76:53----------
mouth what do you see that yeah what is


---------77:01----------
that


---------77:05----------
how would you feel about yourself if you


---------77:08----------
did open your mouth and let me know if


---------77:13----------
we got to stop


---------77:28----------
I just can't


---------77:36----------
I think is it's not just mean that's


---------77:39----------
like it just affects a lot of things so


---------77:42----------
I can't say anything


---------77:51----------
you


---------77:58----------
I'm gonna think about it you could keep


---------78:00----------
going if you want to I'm just letting


---------78:03----------
you know that I think there's a lot


---------78:04----------
there and I'm gonna do my best


---------78:09----------
to pull as much out of that statement as


---------78:11----------
I can because I recognize that this is


---------78:13----------
painful for you in some way


---------78:17----------
so I'm gonna try to make every word


---------78:19----------
count if that makes sense


---------78:26----------
what are the consequences that you're


---------78:28----------
afraid of


---------78:37----------
you


---------78:43----------
everything that happens after


---------78:47----------
but what does your mind envision will


---------78:50----------
happen after


---------78:57----------
things will just be very scary


---------79:00----------
what will occur


---------79:19----------
I think


---------79:25----------
you


---------79:28----------
it's just there's a lot that comes with


---------79:30----------
it so like it's like hard for me to say


---------79:33----------
anything


---------79:37----------
okay


---------79:42----------
i its weird so I found myself smiling


---------79:44----------
there for a second


---------79:45----------
did you remember earlier when I was like


---------79:47----------
thinking you're a courageous person


---------79:48----------
mm-hmm I I think I think twice as much


---------79:52----------
now for 10 times as much I thought


---------79:56----------
you're gonna say opposite yeah I'm not


---------79:59----------
surprised because how do you feel


---------80:05----------
[Music]


---------80:08----------
the same I do I just feel like I guess


---------80:16----------
you just emphasized it a lot more


---------80:18----------
they're like I really can't say anything


---------80:22----------
and that feeling just really sucks what


---------80:27----------
sucks about that feeling


---------80:35----------
the under different circumstances are a


---------80:38----------
lot of other things that I have to


---------80:40----------
consider I would say something so I'm


---------80:48----------
wondering if we should just stop this


---------80:49----------
conversation because I don't want this


---------80:51----------
to damage you in any way shape or form


---------80:56----------
what do you think


---------81:00----------
I don't think it's damaging I think I'm


---------81:03----------
just like


---------81:07----------
I just don't


---------81:10----------
or people to know okay so if people knew


---------81:15----------
how would you what would happen that


---------81:19----------
you're afraid of what would you what


---------81:22----------
would you they think about you


---------81:27----------
I don't think it'd be any


---------81:30----------
thing to Adam


---------81:34----------
I just think chaos the world burned down


---------81:37----------
and like that's just it's how I see it


---------81:41----------
yeah yeah well I mean on the one hand


---------81:48----------
sort of makes sense because I can


---------81:52----------
imagine why you would want to stay


---------81:53----------
silent if the alternative is is burning


---------81:56----------
the world out yeah right I think for me


---------82:01----------
Vaughn it's incredibly confusing so I


---------82:03----------
tend to be like a pretty good judge of I


---------82:05----------
can like read people's minds kind of and


---------82:08----------
even then I mean I could you know I can


---------82:11----------
take a stab at it but to me it's a


---------82:12----------
little bit confusing about you know what


---------82:15----------
what is it that you're afraid of like


---------82:19----------
and the other the other interesting


---------82:21----------
thing is that I wonder if it's actually


---------82:22----------
fear that's keeping your mouth that I'm


---------82:24----------
beginning to realize it's not fear I


---------82:27----------
think what you're trying to do is


---------82:29----------
preserve and protect


---------82:35----------
what do you think yeah I agree


---------82:39----------
there's Yvonne support player protecting


---------82:46----------
taking it for the team and boy did you


---------82:50----------
take it this time


---------82:56----------
who are you protecting


---------83:00----------
I'm not asking you to name those people


---------83:02----------
I mean in general like you know just to


---------83:05----------
be clear


---------83:10----------
what does it feel like you're protecting


---------83:16----------
a lot of things


---------83:22----------
you


---------83:25----------
how are you feeling right now


---------83:33----------
okay


---------83:42----------
you


---------83:49----------
you


---------83:52----------
you


---------83:58----------
this may sound kind of weird but I have


---------84:00----------
faith in you I don't know exactly for


---------84:03----------
what but I'm in your corner


---------84:08----------
and yeah I hope you didn't dodge that


---------84:13----------
one


---------84:13----------
she don't okay good you've got so many d


---------84:19----------
buffs right now you can't dodge anything


---------84:21----------
it's true just take anything at this


---------84:24----------
point


---------84:25----------
yeah so I I mean I think you're a good


---------84:27----------
person in oddly enough a bond so I'm


---------84:30----------
gonna talk a little bit because I think


---------84:32----------
it may help you feel like like less in


---------84:35----------
your head which may be as bad maybe it's


---------84:37----------
good but I'm gonna do it because I feel


---------84:38----------
like I got a I got a taunt okay so I'm


---------84:41----------
gonna tank and I'm gonna you want to


---------84:43----------
keep going guys to stay silent no no you


---------84:46----------
can go okay you want to explore your


---------84:49----------
feelings right now or you want me to


---------84:51----------
take the camera off of you


---------84:53----------
[Music]


---------84:54----------
no you can go okay so oddly enough I


---------84:58----------
think this is making a lot more sense to


---------85:00----------
me because I think that how can I say


---------85:04----------
this


---------85:09----------
so I tend to be an optimist and when I


---------85:13----------
think about you know what people make


---------85:16----------
sacrifices for I tend to think that they


---------85:19----------
make sacrifices and ultimately like the


---------85:21----------
biggest sacrifice that you're making is


---------85:23----------
yourself here right can we sort of see


---------85:25----------
that you're like you're paying the price


---------85:28----------
for something we don't really know


---------85:31----------
exactly what it is you're protecting a


---------85:32----------
lot of things you're protecting the


---------85:34----------
world from coming down with your silence


---------85:35----------
and like this is your cross to bear


---------85:40----------
there's this idea that like we can


---------85:42----------
protect the world with our suffering and


---------85:44----------
that's what I see you doing and the


---------85:48----------
interesting thing the interesting


---------85:49----------
assumption here is that people think


---------85:50----------
that women stay silent not just women


---------85:53----------
but men too just victims stay silent out


---------85:56----------
of negative emotions and to me that's


---------86:00----------
never really like fit perfectly because


---------86:02----------
like fear is a powerful motivator but


---------86:05----------
for the amount of suffering that people


---------86:08----------
put themselves through and feel and


---------86:10----------
carry and don't let go because people


---------86:13----------
hold on to it right it actually makes


---------86:16----------
far more sense to me that there's


---------86:17----------
actually like a noble reason in your


---------86:19----------
mind that allows you to put yourself


---------86:22----------
through this


---------86:25----------
yeah like protection and being a support


---------86:29----------
and taking care of others and


---------86:32----------
maintaining stability are like the


---------86:35----------
reasons that we put up with [ __ ] like


---------86:37----------
that actually makes way more sense to me


---------86:39----------
and that's not something that I had


---------86:41----------
really ever understood or appreciated


---------86:42----------
until we had this conversation everyone


---------86:45----------
just assumes that it's like fear right


---------86:49----------
but I think it's all kinds of like other


---------86:51----------
stuff and I'm not getting this from you


---------86:54----------
quite yet but I really wonder if it's


---------86:56----------
down there like sometimes you know the


---------86:59----------
reason that some women stay silent in


---------87:01----------
the car is because when he touches you


---------87:05----------
in a weird way your mind thinks that if


---------87:09----------
you're a boyfriend knew he would break


---------87:11----------
up with you


---------87:15----------
what do you think about that mm-hmm that


---------87:18----------
wasn't the case for me yeah I'm not


---------87:20----------
getting that from you I think it's


---------87:21----------
actually quite I'm happy that you're not


---------87:24----------
doing that because sometimes women blame


---------87:26----------
themselves for being victims I kind of


---------87:31----------
did a little bit in the sense of like


---------87:36----------
because my boyfriend did ask me like why


---------87:38----------
didn't I say anything at the time


---------87:40----------
because he was right there or he is


---------87:43----------
there like I didn't tell him until the


---------87:45----------
guy left our friend's place and I said


---------87:49----------
like I don't know I just like froze and


---------87:52----------
I couldn't say anything at the time and


---------87:55----------
that's just how I explained it and I


---------87:58----------
guess like I don't


---------88:02----------
I didn't blame myself because I didn't


---------88:05----------
want to be in that situation in the


---------88:06----------
first place and he put me there so it's


---------88:09----------
like how I react


---------88:13----------
is it


---------88:16----------
why am I to blame for how I reacted when


---------88:18----------
I did try to like move him away and like


---------88:23----------
I didn't even want to be put in that


---------88:25----------
situation in the first place


---------88:27----------
and you don't blame yourself mm-hmm


---------88:31----------
that's rare it's also hard to not put


---------88:35----------
them yourself because a lot of times


---------88:39----------
people do blame themselves do you blame


---------88:42----------
yourself for not saying no more


---------88:45----------
forcefully


---------88:50----------
I feel like I tried but it's like I was


---------88:53----------
put in a situation I didn't expect that


---------88:55----------
also I didn't know what to do and it's


---------88:59----------
like thinking on your feet but your


---------89:00----------
brains not really working because you're


---------89:02----------
like trying to process what's going on


---------89:04----------
so


---------89:08----------
yeah I just think that


---------89:12----------
it's not my fault that he just literally


---------89:17----------
couldn't keep his hands to himself yeah


---------89:19----------
I think there's something really


---------89:21----------
important there too so a lot of people


---------89:24----------
when they look at a story like this


---------89:26----------
they say that you could have said no at


---------89:28----------
any point mm-hmm right you could have


---------89:31----------
told your friend what the [ __ ] are you


---------89:33----------
doing in my bed


---------89:34----------
mm-hmm you could have said hey like


---------89:37----------
don't touch me I have a boyfriend and


---------89:39----------
he's sitting right over there go [ __ ]


---------89:40----------
yourself mm-hmm you know there are a lot


---------89:43----------
of people who will say that and it


---------89:45----------
they're not wrong right you could have


---------89:48----------
said no mm-hmm


---------89:50----------
and at the same time I don't think that


---------89:53----------
people really understand or appreciate


---------89:56----------
even women will say this about other


---------89:58----------
women by the way I don't think they


---------90:00----------
understand or appreciate the


---------90:02----------
physiological response that happens when


---------90:05----------
something like this happens and how like


---------90:08----------
your mental goes boom like you're just


---------90:11----------
not thinking clearly like it's there's


---------90:14----------
something there forces within you that


---------90:16----------
keep you from speaking and we don't


---------90:19----------
really understand that or appreciate


---------90:20----------
that and the weird thing is it's kind of


---------90:22----------
interesting because you say that you


---------90:23----------
weren't prepared for the situation I


---------90:25----------
think they're in actually lies off the


---------90:27----------
problem and what I'm really like


---------90:29----------
grateful honestly Yvonne from the bottom


---------90:31----------
of my heart as a as a father of like two


---------90:34----------
daughters I am like really grateful for


---------90:36----------
you that you're like saying this because


---------90:37----------
this is how people get prepared right is


---------90:41----------
like someone like you have to know that


---------90:43----------
it can happen before it actually happens


---------90:45----------
yeah and a lot of times like like the


---------90:49----------
problem is that no one knows that the


---------90:51----------
[ __ ] can happen it's like everyone just


---------90:52----------
assumes mmm because as you put it he's a


---------90:56----------
friendly guy and the other guy has been


---------90:59----------
a friend of yours for a long time


---------91:03----------
and so we're not prepared and like it's


---------91:09----------
hard to say


---------91:12----------
next thing so it's like how do you feel


---------91:14----------
right now by the way I feel better okay


---------91:17----------
yeah


---------91:18----------
I've tanked so now now we have an


---------91:21----------
interesting question right so like we


---------91:23----------
got to figure out can we keep going or


---------91:24----------
is this enough for today and if you can


---------91:27----------
keep going I'm gonna drop aggro and put


---------91:32----------
it back on you but only if you're ready


---------91:34----------
yeah I'm ready okay so now I think we've


---------91:37----------
got to talk about like why I'm not once


---------91:40----------
again I'm not trying to pressure you


---------91:41----------
into speaking or anything like that so


---------91:43----------
please understand that but I do think


---------91:44----------
it's important very important for people


---------91:47----------
to understand why you can talk about the


---------91:49----------
general out in general and view yourself


---------91:51----------
why you can talk about the generalities


---------91:54----------
of the situation without naming names


---------91:58----------
mm-hmm right so you like what is it that


---------92:01----------
keeps you from speaking fine like your


---------92:03----------
your you know your mind isn't wasn't


---------92:05----------
functioning back then there's like a


---------92:06----------
physiological stress response there's


---------92:09----------
actually you know there's a and just so


---------92:12----------
people know you ever heard of something


---------92:18----------
called catatonia No


---------92:23----------
okay so I'll just tell I'll show you


---------92:26----------
guys a paper later so there's a there's


---------92:28----------
a mammalian survival response which is


---------92:30----------
to freeze and play that so it's like


---------92:33----------
some people call it playing possum so


---------92:35----------
you like you know when some animals are


---------92:36----------
attacked they just like literally freeze


---------92:38----------
there's a psychiatric condition called


---------92:41----------
catatonia which is fascinating to see


---------92:43----------
but it's like when people become like


---------92:45----------
literally stop and and like they can't


---------92:49----------
speak they can't move they're like


---------92:50----------
sitting there just with their eyes open


---------92:52----------
and they're like minimally responsive to


---------92:54----------
stimuli and so people have hypothesized


---------92:56----------
that so catatonia is like actually


---------92:59----------
something that happens to people


---------93:00----------
sometimes with like schizophrenia they


---------93:02----------
can have different kinds of conditions


---------93:03----------
and so there's actually like a


---------93:05----------
neurological response that causes you to


---------93:08----------
lock up and not it's like your biology


---------93:12----------
is just sort of playing dead and that


---------93:15----------
state is called catatonia and later on


---------93:17----------
when you guys get professor dr. K then


---------93:20----------
or Professor K or whatever I'll show you


---------93:22----------
guys papers and physiology and stuff


---------93:24----------
like that but I think what happened to


---------93:25----------
you when people blame you for not


---------93:27----------
speaking and when people when when


---------93:29----------
people say oh you could have said no at


---------93:31----------
any time and when even people say like


---------93:33----------
oh you should have said something just


---------93:35----------
say something people need to understand


---------93:37----------
that there's actually like physiological


---------93:39----------
evidence that shows that when human


---------93:41----------
beings are in danger literally what they


---------93:43----------
do is lock up it's not like a


---------93:45----------
psychological lock up it's like a


---------93:46----------
neurological lock up


---------93:47----------
it's [ __ ] me yeah um I don't know I


---------93:52----------
don't even know what I was talking about


---------93:53----------
there but oh yeah so so what I was


---------93:56----------
saying is that you know the reason that


---------93:57----------
you didn't speak back then is because of


---------93:59----------
maybe a catatonic response fine it was a


---------94:02----------
survival response you froze the reason


---------94:05----------
that you're not speaking now I suspect


---------94:07----------
is different because you are walking and


---------94:09----------
talking right it's not the catatonic


---------94:11----------
response it's something else so I'd


---------94:13----------
really like to understand what that is


---------94:17----------
can we talk about that


---------94:22----------
okay okay thank you I appreciate that


---------94:25----------
and once again you know you get to pull


---------94:27----------
the plug at any point you want okay and


---------94:30----------
I may pull the plug if I think you know


---------94:32----------
I'm gonna try to pull the plug for you


---------94:34----------
if I think that you'd go into a


---------94:35----------
catatonic space and you can't pull the


---------94:37----------
plug yourself okay so what is it that


---------94:42----------
makes it hard for you to name names


---------94:48----------
there's a lot of implications that come


---------94:51----------
along with it what kind of implications


---------94:53----------
implications for you implications for


---------94:55----------
them implications for mutual people it


---------95:01----------
feels like the whole world okay so let's


---------95:04----------
stop and think about that for a second


---------95:06----------
when I tell you Yvonne that I'm afraid


---------95:09----------
of doing something because it has


---------95:11----------
implications for the whole world how


---------95:14----------
would you interpret that


---------95:21----------
what would you think about


---------95:26----------
I'm not sure um I mean it depends like


---------95:30----------
what I'm asking you why you're not like


---------95:33----------
what you're not sharing and stuff but


---------95:38----------
yeah so it's like you said before that I


---------95:43----------
want to protect and so I can't okay can


---------95:48----------
you tell us so my first thought is that


---------95:51----------
when someone feels like it has


---------95:53----------
implications from the whole world that


---------95:56----------
sounds like a emotional thought as


---------95:58----------
opposed to a logical thought what do you


---------96:01----------
think about that I agree so what is the


---------96:05----------
emotion that is keeping you from


---------96:07----------
speaking is it fear is it shame is it


---------96:13----------
anger is it love


---------96:21----------
adding its love


---------96:25----------
yeah man that makes so much more I've


---------96:27----------
never realized this until today but like


---------96:29----------
it makes so much sense you know and and


---------96:35----------
I mean this is such a hard conversation


---------96:41----------
to have because how do i how do we


---------96:44----------
understand this more without


---------96:46----------
compromising what your goals are which I


---------96:49----------
want to respect at all costs


---------96:52----------
because the question that I want to ask


---------96:54----------
is like who do you love that you're


---------96:57----------
trying to protect but I think that


---------96:58----------
that's the question that you don't want


---------97:00----------
to answer so I can't ask that question


---------97:02----------
but I feel like that's the important


---------97:04----------
question you with me mm-hmm


---------97:07----------
let me think about this


---------97:15----------
why do you feel responsible for


---------97:18----------
protecting the ones that you love


---------97:24----------
because I want to


---------97:31----------
you


---------97:34----------
you


---------97:44----------
this may be the final boss by the way


---------97:46----------
you may be the red boss people have been


---------97:49----------
looking for the raid boss for a long


---------97:50----------
time yeah I'm just trying to really


---------97:55----------
think about


---------98:02----------
you


---------98:08----------
okay let me put it to you this way the


---------98:11----------
people that you're trying to protect


---------98:13----------
what do you think they would say about


---------98:19----------
you speaking


---------98:27----------
if that was ultimately what I wanted to


---------98:29----------
do I think they would support me 100%


---------98:37----------
okay but okay so that's a that's an


---------98:44----------
interesting statement so we're gonna


---------98:46----------
unpack that a little bit but like it's


---------98:48----------
kind of interesting because you're


---------98:49----------
saying if that's what I really wanted to


---------98:52----------
do they would support me but if you're


---------98:55----------
makin says if you're but you're not


---------99:01----------
doing it for yourself you're doing it


---------99:03----------
for them


---------99:07----------
Yeah right so so but like so like what


---------99:10----------
you're saying sort of doesn't make sense


---------99:11----------
to me is because it's kind of like you


---------99:13----------
know if I want to I feel like baking a


---------99:15----------
cake or I'm gonna bake a cake and I'm


---------99:17----------
gonna bake it for them so I'm gonna put


---------99:19----------
in all this time and effort for their


---------99:21----------
sake I'm gonna suffer and stay silent


---------99:23----------
for that and then if I go to the person


---------99:25----------
I say like hey like I want to bake this


---------99:28----------
cake for you and they're like but I want


---------99:30----------
the cake like you should do whatever you


---------99:32----------
want to like if you want the cake go for


---------99:33----------
it you know so it's weird because you're


---------99:38----------
making a sacrifice for on their behalf


---------99:40----------
but like I'm not so sure that they want


---------99:43----------
you to make that sacrifice do you think


---------99:45----------
they want you to make that sacrifice do


---------99:50----------
you think they would want you to be


---------99:51----------
silent


---------99:54----------
what they would need to be silent I


---------99:57----------
think they would always want what's like


---------100:00----------
best for me or like they would want me


---------100:02----------
be happy it's just also a part of what I


---------100:06----------
want to do it's a part of what you so


---------100:09----------
you want to say silent right now yeah


---------100:13----------
yeah okay and and that's out of


---------100:16----------
primarily you still think love or do you


---------100:18----------
think that there's some other stuff


---------100:20----------
going on there


---------100:24----------
no I think it's still that okay and okay


---------100:30----------
so I think if you want to stay silent


---------100:31----------
then I think maybe we've done enough for


---------100:35----------
today what do you think yeah that sounds


---------100:38----------
good to you okay so one last question


---------100:41----------
mm-hmm and then I should teach you


---------100:44----------
meditation but boy is it hard to teach


---------100:45----------
meditation after this yeah so do you do


---------100:50----------
you feel so I know that you don't want


---------100:54----------
to name names fine do you feel


---------100:55----------
comfortable saying who it is that you


---------100:57----------
love and for whom you're choosing to


---------101:00----------
stay silent or is that too much because


---------101:03----------
I can't I don't I don't know if that's


---------101:04----------
the same people uh just think in general


---------101:09----------
there's like not a lot I want to say in


---------101:11----------
regards to that okay cool


---------101:14----------
I wish I could because I feel like if


---------101:17----------
you helped a lot of people but no just


---------101:19----------
me all right now don't don't worry about


---------101:21----------
it man I I really don't want you to


---------101:22----------
worry about that sure I think that let


---------101:25----------
me put it this way he gone


---------101:27----------
you have to help everyone you just do


---------101:30----------
what you can do and if half of the world


---------101:34----------
or a quarter of the world or 10% of the


---------101:36----------
world does what you've done today we're


---------101:39----------
gonna be fine hmm you don't need to lift


---------101:42----------
for all of us you don't have to be a DC


---------101:44----------
for the whole [ __ ] every league game


---------101:46----------
out there we just need like 20 percent


---------101:49----------
of people to be a DC's right like


---------101:52----------
literally look it's a beautiful analogy


---------101:53----------
everything can be learned from legal yes


---------101:56----------
hmm


---------101:57----------
and so you've carried plenty for today


---------101:59----------
you don't need to keep carrying you know


---------102:01----------
you don't need to carry for other people


---------102:02----------
I think you've done like that's what


---------102:03----------
that's what a oe healing is about it's


---------102:05----------
like each person comes on and like does


---------102:07----------
their part and then some other noob will


---------102:11----------
come on and they'll start caring yeah


---------102:16----------
how you feeling right now uh yeah a


---------102:20----------
little shaken up I'm getting yeah I mean


---------102:23----------
I should hope you're a little bit shaken


---------102:25----------
out I [ __ ] sure yeah yeah I mean I


---------102:29----------
think I mean a little bit more than you


---------102:31----------
bargained for huh mm-hmm yeah definitely


---------102:34----------
yeah an extract a lot of it I thought it


---------102:36----------
was be like yeah but it was good as good


---------102:40----------
yeah I mean for what it's worth way more


---------102:42----------
than what I bargained for yeah you know


---------102:47----------
I thought we were just gonna be talking


---------102:48----------
about impostor syndrome because that


---------102:49----------
[ __ ] I know yeah and you know low


---------102:53----------
self-esteem and all the sudden it just


---------102:58----------
feels like suck for so long about other


---------103:02----------
things but yes you know no pressure in


---------103:08----------
terms of meditation and I don't even


---------103:09----------
know what I would teach mm-hmm today I


---------103:12----------
mean I feel like after after sessions


---------103:14----------
like today I don't really tell like I


---------103:16----------
think probably the best thing to do is


---------103:18----------
for you to just sit and process and


---------103:21----------
don't try to force your mind to do


---------103:22----------
anything if you have an animal or a cup


---------103:28----------
of tea or something tasty or sunlight or


---------103:32----------
water I think you should go and be with


---------103:34----------
those things mm-hmm and just let


---------103:37----------
yourself shed because you've been like


---------103:40----------
kind of wrung out right does that do you


---------103:43----------
feel that way


---------103:44----------
a little thing yeah yeah so you've got


---------103:46----------
to just let yourself like you know when


---------103:48----------
I when I twist something and I wring it


---------103:50----------
out it has a natural tendency to like


---------103:52----------
want to come back to its former shape


---------103:54----------
that's what your meditation should be


---------103:57----------
let yourself return to the person that


---------104:00----------
you are that's like kind of in your


---------104:02----------
comfortable neutral state if you have


---------104:05----------
children I would say that you should


---------104:06----------
kiss them and cuddle them that's what


---------104:08----------
I'm gonna do after we're done with this


---------104:09----------
yeah I'm going to hold my daughters and


---------104:13----------
possibly I mean this is gonna sound like


---------104:16----------
a bad joke but touch them in places that


---------104:18----------
they don't want to be touched


---------104:19----------
like is their belly button and other


---------104:22----------
cheeks mmm-hmm and things like that is a


---------104:25----------
side note I can tell you sorry my wife


---------104:27----------
told me can't tell you story


---------104:29----------
sure yeah so my wife actually taught me


---------104:31----------
a really important lesson so when my


---------104:32----------
eldest daughter was - she's like four


---------104:34----------
now um I was trying to convince her to


---------104:37----------
give me a kiss right yes that's what we


---------104:39----------
do


---------104:39----------
and that she was like you know you


---------104:41----------
should be careful about what you teach


---------104:44----------
her about like cajoling affection when


---------104:48----------
she doesn't want to give it mm-hmm


---------104:50----------
and like what am i signal to her in


---------104:53----------
terms of like how do you respond when


---------104:55----------
someone wants you to do something that


---------104:56----------
you don't feel like doing if I can blew


---------104:58----------
my mind yeah that's crazy that makes so


---------105:01----------
I never even thought of it that way yeah


---------105:04----------
I never thought of it that way either


---------105:05----------
but now I just I totally like respect


---------105:07----------
their boundaries which is like you know


---------105:08----------
can Daddy yes if she says no and then


---------105:11----------
I'll beg and plead a little bit but then


---------105:12----------
I'll be like okay well can I give you a


---------105:14----------
kiss okay I mean yeah it's really


---------105:19----------
interesting how a lot of this stuff is


---------105:20----------
baked in right yeah it's teaching her


---------105:24----------
that she's allowed to say no when it


---------105:26----------
comes to physical affection is like


---------105:27----------
apparently something that you start


---------105:29----------
learning when you're 2 and it really


---------105:31----------
makes me think long and hard about like


---------105:33----------
why you couldn't say no then and what


---------105:36----------
the programming in your brain was that


---------105:38----------
started when like literally you were 2


---------105:40----------
years old or when your year old mm-hmm


---------105:44----------
so it was kind of eye-opening it's


---------105:45----------
interesting


---------105:46----------
Tapp daughters could be a man learn a


---------105:49----------
lot


---------105:51----------
I bet yeah but it's a very good thing I


---------105:56----------
feel like you empathize a lot and think


---------106:01----------
a lot from their shoes


---------106:04----------
yeah I I hope so I feel like most of the


---------106:08----------
time I just don't understand them


---------106:10----------
they're just completely different


---------106:11----------
creatures sometimes I give you like but


---------106:14----------
