---------00:00----------
almost as you get fatigued by like


---------00:02----------
towards 4 p.m 6 p.m 7 p.m it becomes


---------00:06----------
like easier for you to start studying


---------00:07----------
and then you stay up all night you pound


---------00:09----------
caffeine and then you kind of get into


---------00:11----------
what i would call like the fatigue


---------00:12----------
groove for lack of a better term okay so


---------00:15----------
we're gonna talk a little bit about why


---------00:17----------
is it that


---------00:19----------
you get a ton of motivation when you're


---------00:21----------
going to bed at night


---------00:22----------
um


---------00:25----------
and


---------00:27----------
why when you wake up in the morning like


---------00:28----------
you don't actually do anything okay


---------00:31----------
so a couple of different dimensions that


---------00:32----------
we're going to talk about


---------00:34----------
one is like so our question is why do we


---------00:36----------
get motivated at night but like not


---------00:37----------
during the day so we're going to start


---------00:38----------
by understanding some stuff about


---------00:40----------
neuroscience we're going to talk about


---------00:42----------
one aspect of psychology and then we're


---------00:43----------
just going to talk about a couple of


---------00:45----------
general principles this is almost more


---------00:47----------
spiritual


---------00:50----------
about clarity of mind and like where


---------00:52----------
motivation comes from and we're going to


---------00:53----------
talk about behavioral calculations as


---------00:55----------
well okay


---------00:57----------
so the first thing to understand i'm


---------00:58----------
going to tell you guys about an


---------00:59----------
experiment okay


---------01:01----------
so they took a bunch of mice


---------01:04----------
and


---------01:05----------
what they were doing is trying to assess


---------01:07----------
there's a part of our brain called the


---------01:08----------
nucleus accumbens


---------01:10----------
and the nucleus accumbens is the part of


---------01:12----------
our brain that actually manages


---------01:14----------
reward and behavior okay so it's a very


---------01:17----------
dopamine it's like a very like it's one


---------01:19----------
of the dopamine circuits in the brain so


---------01:21----------
a lot of times people are talking about


---------01:22----------
dopamine dopamine dopamine like dopamine


---------01:24----------
is the reason that like i get addicted


---------01:25----------
to video games i need to detox off of


---------01:27----------
dopamine i'm in dopamine exhaustion we


---------01:29----------
talk about dopamine everyone talks about


---------01:30----------
dopamine dopamine


---------01:32----------
so in the nucleus accumbens there's


---------01:34----------
dopamine


---------01:35----------
but the interesting thing is that


---------01:37----------
all of this stuff has been


---------01:38----------
oversimplified so i'm going to add some


---------01:40----------
complexity to it but even i'm going to


---------01:42----------
be oversimplifying


---------01:44----------
so they took a group of mice and they


---------01:45----------
basically did a really interesting


---------01:47----------
experiment where they injected different


---------01:49----------
stuff into the nucleus accumbens of mice


---------01:52----------
so generally speaking they took mice and


---------01:54----------
they gave them two options of food


---------01:56----------
one is like a high carbohydrate super


---------01:59----------
tasty like twinkie pellet it's basically


---------02:02----------
like a pellet that's like a twinkie and


---------02:04----------
the other is like a regular food and


---------02:06----------
they normally have to work a little bit


---------02:08----------
harder they have to like press a lever


---------02:10----------
to get like the twinkie versus like the


---------02:12----------
kale salad okay


---------02:15----------
so generally speaking when you give mice


---------02:16----------
this choice what'll happen is they'll


---------02:18----------
like they'll go for the twinkie they'll


---------02:20----------
go for the high carbohydrate nutrient


---------02:21----------
dense food and they'll eat it and


---------02:23----------
they'll be happy little mice fat little


---------02:25----------
mice too


---------02:26----------
so what some researchers did is they


---------02:29----------
uh


---------02:30----------
injected


---------02:31----------
a certain amount of dopamine blocker


---------02:34----------
into the brains of these mice okay so


---------02:37----------
we're gonna kind of go back to this for


---------02:38----------
a second


---------02:39----------
and let's see what happened


---------02:41----------
so


---------02:42----------
i'm gonna have to figure out how to draw


---------02:44----------
this so let's say you've got a mouse


---------02:47----------
and then the default


---------02:49----------
is high energy pellet


---------02:55----------
and then the other option is low energy


---------02:56----------
pellet


---------03:00----------
so normally


---------03:02----------
in the situation


---------03:03----------
that


---------03:04----------
our normal situation let's call it blue


---------03:06----------
so normally a mice goes a mouse goes


---------03:08----------
this way they they choose the high


---------03:10----------
dopamine pellet okay


---------03:11----------
so then what what researchers did is


---------03:13----------
they they blocked dopamine in the


---------03:16----------
nucleus accumbens


---------03:17----------
so in the nucleus accumbens of mice


---------03:20----------
they took a


---------03:21----------
dopamine blocker


---------03:25----------
and they blocked dopamine and what they


---------03:27----------
actually found when you block the action


---------03:29----------
of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is


---------03:31----------
that mice will actually go this way


---------03:34----------
okay so if we blocked opening that's


---------03:36----------
because these are a little bit harder to


---------03:37----------
get the other way you can kind of think


---------03:39----------
about it is that they have no preference


---------03:41----------
for the high energy pellet over the low


---------03:43----------
energy pellet


---------03:45----------
and then they did something really


---------03:46----------
interesting


---------03:48----------
they took a third chemical


---------03:50----------
adenosine


---------03:51----------
and they actually blocked


---------03:54----------
the action of adenosine


---------03:57----------
in the nucleus accumbens and what they


---------03:59----------
found is that the mouse went back to the


---------04:01----------
high energy palette


---------04:03----------
okay


---------04:04----------
so now we're going to talk a little bit


---------04:06----------
because like you know neuroscience is


---------04:07----------
complicated but you know most people


---------04:09----------
talk about dopamine don't talk about in


---------04:11----------
a complicated sense so there's three


---------04:12----------
states that we can kind of think of


---------04:16----------
in terms of dopamine and adenosine


---------04:19----------
okay


---------04:20----------
so let's just talk actually for a second


---------04:22----------
about what adenosine is adenosine is


---------04:24----------
essentially a waste product in the brain


---------04:26----------
so we have a um


---------04:29----------
we have this like the the fuel of our


---------04:30----------
brain is something called atp


---------04:33----------
and the waste product after we burn a


---------04:36----------
molecule of atp is to wind up with


---------04:38----------
adenosine and we know we don't really i


---------04:40----------
mean adenosine does all kinds of stuff


---------04:41----------
so i'm oversimplifying things but the


---------04:43----------
other thing that we know is as you as


---------04:45----------
the day goes on so like if we think


---------04:47----------
about um you know


---------04:49----------
time of the day


---------04:51----------
in adenosine


---------04:53----------
okay


---------04:54----------
what happens over time


---------04:56----------
as we go throughout our day is adenosine


---------04:58----------
slowly climbs


---------05:00----------
and then we go to sleep


---------05:02----------
and then what our brain does is clear


---------05:04----------
adenosine from the brain


---------05:05----------
and then this is waking up


---------05:08----------
so as the day goes on


---------05:10----------
we increase in our adenosine so what i


---------05:12----------
would kind of say and if we kind of


---------05:14----------
think about dopamine for a second okay


---------05:16----------
so when you wake up first thing in the


---------05:18----------
morning and you feel really excited to


---------05:19----------
play a game


---------05:21----------
so let's say this is dopamine


---------05:23----------
and let's say this is time i'm super


---------05:25----------
excited to play a game i really want to


---------05:26----------
play dota there's a new patch the first


---------05:28----------
game of dota i play gives me a lot of


---------05:30----------
dopamine right this is an


---------05:31----------
oversimplification but dopamine signal


---------05:34----------
is a better way to put it and then the


---------05:35----------
more games of dota i play essentially my


---------05:37----------
dopamine starts to go down


---------05:39----------
so this is why when you kind of look at


---------05:41----------
like behavioral reinforcement


---------05:43----------
right so this is why people will say


---------05:45----------
like at the beginning of the day like


---------05:47----------
that's when you like if you're


---------05:48----------
productive at the beginning you're going


---------05:49----------
to have a good day whereas if you start


---------05:51----------
playing video games like it's a lot


---------05:52----------
easier to do work for two hours and then


---------05:55----------
start gaming than it is to play for two


---------05:57----------
hours stop and then start doing work


---------05:59----------
so our dopamine generally speaking like


---------06:01----------
we get more bored of crap by the end of


---------06:03----------
the day we're excited to do things but


---------06:06----------
by like 7 p.m 8 p.m you're like eh if


---------06:08----------
you've been playing games all day you


---------06:09----------
don't really feel like doing much right


---------06:11----------
and then we go to sleep over here


---------06:14----------
and then we kind of wind up


---------06:16----------
back here when we wake up if we're lucky


---------06:19----------
so if we kind of look at it there are


---------06:20----------
kind of three states of dopamine and


---------06:22----------
adenosine throughout the day and


---------06:24----------
remember this is a waste product right


---------06:25----------
so we can have high dopamine and low


---------06:27----------
adenosine so this is in the am


---------06:30----------
we can have


---------06:32----------
low dopamine and low adenosine we'll get


---------06:34----------
to this state in a second or what we can


---------06:36----------
have is low dopamine and high adenosine


---------06:39----------
okay


---------06:40----------
and so if we kind of think about it


---------06:42----------
when we block


---------06:44----------
so this is a state where when we block


---------06:46----------
dopamine


---------06:47----------
and we still have adenosine remember we


---------06:50----------
end up going for the low energy pellet


---------06:52----------
right so when we block


---------06:54----------
adenosine as well


---------06:56----------
then we end up either going for both are


---------06:58----------
we going for end up going for the high


---------07:00----------
energy pellet so you can almost think


---------07:02----------
about adenosine and dopamine as having


---------07:04----------
antagonistic properties


---------07:06----------
so adenosine will blunt the effect of


---------07:10----------
dopamine okay so what is the dopamine


---------07:12----------
counter it is adenosine


---------07:15----------
okay


---------07:16----------
is the dopamine counter


---------07:18----------
so you guys may wonder a little bit


---------07:20----------
about this


---------07:22----------
and why this actually works


---------07:24----------
so like let me give you guys kind of


---------07:25----------
like an example


---------07:27----------
so if you guys ever like


---------07:29----------
studied like let's say you've got a


---------07:30----------
final the next day right what time do


---------07:32----------
you usually start studying


---------07:34----------
if you're like me you don't start


---------07:36----------
studying first thing in the morning for


---------07:37----------
the final the next day you procrastinate


---------07:39----------
until 2 pm 4 pm you're like


---------07:41----------
around you're like i should study i


---------07:43----------
should study i shouldn't study and then


---------07:45----------
once oh gg


---------07:48----------
once uh 6 pm rolls around you're kind of


---------07:51----------
like


---------07:54----------
once 6 pm rolls around you're kind of um


---------07:57----------
you kind of like oh man like


---------07:59----------
like it's somehow like easy like as as


---------08:01----------
time goes on you get like a little bit


---------08:03----------
less distracted


---------08:05----------
and like then suddenly it's like easy


---------08:08----------
for you to study right in the morning


---------08:09----------
it's actually like super hard for you to


---------08:11----------
study but almost as you get fatigued by


---------08:13----------
like towards 4 p.m 6 p.m 7 p.m it


---------08:17----------
becomes like easier for you to start


---------08:19----------
studying and then you stay up all night


---------08:20----------
you pound caffeine and then you kind of


---------08:22----------
get into what i would call like the


---------08:24----------
fatigue groove for lack of a better term


---------08:26----------
okay


---------08:27----------
so like the fatigue groove is like when


---------08:29----------
you're actually like really functional


---------08:30----------
but you're kind of tired and in a weird


---------08:33----------
way you can get into this fatigue group


---------08:36----------
easier than you can like at the start of


---------08:38----------
the day when it's so easy to get


---------08:40----------
distracted does that sort of make sense


---------08:42----------
it's almost like games are more tempting


---------08:44----------
at like


---------08:45----------
noon than they are at like 6 p.m or 7


---------08:48----------
p.m and then like you kind of get tired


---------08:50----------
and then it's sort of like you get into


---------08:52----------
this weird fatigue groove and what i'd


---------08:54----------
call that fatigue groove is essentially


---------08:56----------
this this adenosine buildup throughout


---------08:58----------
the day so as like our day goes goes on


---------09:01----------
and we kind of think about it this way


---------09:02----------
so like


---------09:04----------
let's call dopamine green okay


---------09:09----------
so dopamine kind of starts out high easy


---------09:11----------
to get distracted video games and then


---------09:13----------
let's call adenosine yellow


---------09:16----------
and then like you kind of start


---------09:17----------
adenosine over here and then like this


---------09:19----------
is sort of like


---------09:21----------
6 p.m and this is when you start


---------09:22----------
studying and then you pull you study all


---------09:24----------
night you're kind of fatigued and then


---------09:26----------
like with 7 a.m rolls around your exam


---------09:28----------
is in an hour and then you kick yourself


---------09:30----------
right you're like man if i had started


---------09:31----------
like four hours earlier six hours


---------09:33----------
earlier if i only started studying a


---------09:35----------
little bit earlier i could have gotten


---------09:37----------
so much more but it was so hard to study


---------09:40----------
so much earlier and i think part of that


---------09:42----------
is adenosine


---------09:43----------
so it's interesting because what you


---------09:45----------
know our ability to get distracted by


---------09:48----------
stuff


---------09:49----------
oh sh i'm sorry i couldn't see this this


---------09:52----------
so this is dopamine this is adenosine


---------09:54----------
and then you know so you start out with


---------09:56----------
dopamine over here high and then over


---------09:58----------
time it it goes down and then with


---------10:00----------
adenosine let's call it yellow


---------10:02----------
and then it increases and then this is


---------10:04----------
kind of your 6 p.m switch where you


---------10:06----------
start studying okay and this is also


---------10:08----------
where like we can kind of think a little


---------10:10----------
bit about night owls right so there's


---------10:11----------
actually like there are a lot of


---------10:13----------
situations where we can see


---------10:15----------
people are actually more productive like


---------10:17----------
later in the day and that may have


---------10:19----------
something to do with like adenosine


---------10:21----------
production in the brain


---------10:22----------
and so then the question becomes like


---------10:24----------
what's the relationship between these


---------10:25----------
two things


---------10:26----------
and it's that when we're vulnerable to


---------10:29----------
our dopaminergic activities


---------10:31----------
early in the day like when you feel


---------10:33----------
excited to play games you kind of want


---------10:35----------
to watch stuff like it's really hard to


---------10:37----------
work and then once you kind of get into


---------10:39----------
this like fatigue groove in the middle


---------10:40----------
of the day the dopaminergic pull


---------10:43----------
decreases on its own and then like


---------10:45----------
adenosine because remember adenosine has


---------10:46----------
a blunting effect on dopamine right


---------10:48----------
that's what the key thing about this rat


---------10:50----------
study


---------10:52----------
is that it demonstrated how dope


---------10:54----------
adenosine is the dopamine counter so


---------10:56----------
adenosine is a waste product in the


---------10:57----------
brain and that sort of makes sense too


---------10:59----------
because the more that our brain does


---------11:01----------
things


---------11:02----------
the more energy it uses up and the more


---------11:05----------
energy it uses up the more tired it


---------11:08----------
feels and the less it feels like doing


---------11:10----------
things


---------11:11----------
so since adenosine is the dopamine


---------11:13----------
counter as the day goes on it blunts our


---------11:15----------
ability to like respond to dopamine or


---------11:17----------
be controlled by dopamine and then we


---------11:19----------
can start studying it like 6 pm after


---------11:21----------
procrastinating all day okay so that's


---------11:23----------
the first thing


---------11:25----------
so


---------11:26----------
the first reason why i think you can


---------11:28----------
sometimes get motivated is because your


---------11:30----------
motivation gets distracted by


---------11:31----------
dopaminergic activities early in the day


---------11:34----------
and then as you start to get fatigued


---------11:36----------
like you don't feel like you know the


---------11:38----------
dopaminergic pull isn't there you're not


---------11:39----------
thinking about playing games anymore


---------11:41----------
you're not like oh i really want to do


---------11:42----------
this so this would be kind of fun and so


---------11:44----------
as you're as all of the the desires and


---------11:47----------
the dopaminergic controls starts to fade


---------11:49----------
into the background because of elevated


---------11:51----------
levels of adenosine then like the deeper


---------11:53----------
motivation can start to shine forth


---------11:55----------
because it's not just this dopaminergic


---------11:56----------
crap anymore does that make sense


---------11:59----------
so that's one thing that has to do with


---------12:01----------
neuroscience so let now let's talk a


---------12:03----------
little bit about future discounting


---------12:06----------
so


---------12:08----------
if we talk about you know what the real


---------12:10----------
problem is


---------12:12----------
motivation is a feeling and it increases


---------12:14----------
at night right so motivation


---------12:18----------
increases at night


---------12:21----------
but now here's the question


---------12:23----------
does behavior increase at night


---------12:26----------
right so when you feel super motivated


---------12:29----------
at night do you


---------12:32----------
engage


---------12:34----------
in the behavior


---------12:39----------
interesting right


---------12:41----------
so when we when we kind of


---------12:43----------
when we go to bed at night there's a


---------12:44----------
really interesting thing about


---------12:46----------
motivation which is that there's no


---------12:50----------
cost motivation


---------12:53----------
so our motivation can like increase


---------12:56----------
unchecked it can spiral out of control


---------12:58----------
you're sitting there like late at night


---------12:59----------
and you're thinking like oh tomorrow i'm


---------13:01----------
gonna do this i'm gonna do this it's


---------13:03----------
gonna be great it's gonna be awesome


---------13:05----------
like i have all of this motivation and


---------13:06----------
in our brain there's no cost because


---------13:09----------
you're not giving anything up


---------13:11----------
you're not actually doing anything so


---------13:13----------
it's like your motivation can like rise


---------13:16----------
to epic proportions because there's no


---------13:18----------
cost to the motivation there's no


---------13:20----------
balance to the motivation


---------13:22----------
now when you wake up the next morning


---------13:24----------
what's the situation


---------13:25----------
the next am


---------13:28----------
now you have a choice


---------13:30----------
motivation


---------13:32----------
versus video game


---------13:35----------
so let's say that at night i think about


---------13:38----------
oh man i'm gonna write a novel


---------13:41----------
right so this is the other thing


---------13:42----------
creative stuff right happens a lot at


---------13:44----------
night i'm gonna write a novel so now i


---------13:46----------
have a choice i can write a novel


---------13:49----------
or i can play a video game


---------13:53----------
and now suddenly there's a cost to the


---------13:55----------
motivation


---------13:57----------
right so if i if i if i write a novel


---------13:59----------
for one hour have i written a novel no


---------14:02----------
have i written one percent of a novel no


---------14:05----------
there's no like cost benefit like


---------14:07----------
there's no like what have i done in an


---------14:08----------
hour so my brain is sitting there and


---------14:11----------
it's doing this kind of goes back to


---------14:12----------
this other calculation like the


---------14:13----------
behavioral calculation and my brain is


---------14:15----------
sitting there in the morning and it's


---------14:17----------
thinking like okay if i like can i write


---------14:19----------
a novel now no like can i write a novel


---------14:20----------
in an hour no can i write a novel in two


---------14:23----------
hours no can i write a novel in four


---------14:24----------
hours no


---------14:26----------
so can i actually write the novel in the


---------14:28----------
morning


---------14:29----------
no


---------14:30----------
now can i play a game in an hour


---------14:33----------
yup


---------14:34----------
can i get a little bit of that can i get


---------14:36----------
that dopamine can i get me a little bit


---------14:38----------
that dopamine please


---------14:39----------
ma'am sir thank you yes please and thank


---------14:42----------
you yeah absolutely easy


---------14:45----------
easy so now when in the light of day


---------14:48----------
when you actually have the opportunity


---------14:49----------
to engage in the behavior


---------14:51----------
there's an opportunity cost now because


---------14:54----------
at night there's no opportunity cost


---------15:01----------
so your your your you know your


---------15:03----------
motivation can just fly through the roof


---------15:05----------
because it doesn't cost you anything


---------15:07----------
it's like free


---------15:08----------
like i can and then you get more


---------15:10----------
inspired you think about how great it's


---------15:12----------
gonna be i'm gonna have this idea i'm


---------15:13----------
gonna have that idea like this


---------15:15----------
character's gonna do this we're gonna do


---------15:16----------
plot twists here it's gonna be like no


---------15:18----------
one's gonna realize what's gonna happen


---------15:20----------
it's gonna get picked up there's gonna


---------15:21----------
be a bidding war between netflix and hbo


---------15:24----------
for my awesome new novel it's gonna be


---------15:26----------
great it's like twilight meets game of


---------15:27----------
thrones it's gonna be like the most epic


---------15:29----------
thing since harry potter it's gonna be


---------15:31----------
so awesome there's no cost to any of it


---------15:35----------
right and then come the light of day now


---------15:37----------
suddenly there's a cost like


---------15:39----------
twilight meets game of thrones holy crap


---------15:41----------
that's gonna take a lot of work like how


---------15:42----------
do i even do that they're gonna be


---------15:43----------
different vampire houses like what's up


---------15:45----------
with that how's that gonna work ah


---------15:47----------
it's overwhelming


---------15:50----------
i don't know how to start


---------15:53----------
so let me just play a video game at


---------15:54----------
least that's easy


---------15:56----------
easy easy let me just do this so in your


---------16:00----------
brain you have this behavioral


---------16:01----------
calculation we've talked about the doubt


---------16:03----------
march endowed paper a lot right so if


---------16:05----------
you guys remember that paper it's also


---------16:06----------
on our discord and things like that


---------16:08----------
there's a behavioral calculation that in


---------16:10----------
in the night doesn't it's like it's like


---------16:12----------
a


---------16:13----------
an equation that only has one side of


---------16:15----------
the equal sign so it can the motivation


---------16:18----------
goes out of control because there's no


---------16:20----------
cost but come the light of day now


---------16:21----------
suddenly there's a cost it's like you're


---------16:23----------
going to sleep at night and you're like


---------16:24----------
man i'm going to wake up tomorrow i'm


---------16:25----------
going to work out first thing


---------16:27----------
and then you wake up tomorrow and it's


---------16:29----------
like am i going to work out right now


---------16:32----------
because do you work out in the middle of


---------16:33----------
the night like when you feel so


---------16:34----------
motivated to write that novel do you


---------16:35----------
actually get up and write do you


---------16:36----------
actually work out no you don't do any of


---------16:38----------
those things when the cost actually


---------16:40----------
becomes part of the scale so we've got


---------16:42----------
you know a set of scales right


---------16:47----------
and then like the motivation is just you


---------16:49----------
know there's a ton of motivation over


---------16:50----------
here so it's easy because it's empty


---------16:52----------
so motivation easy but now we start


---------16:54----------
adding a cost during the day and then


---------16:56----------
suddenly this is gone and then our


---------16:57----------
motivation goes up or whatever you know


---------17:00----------
this wins


---------17:01----------
and then it's gg


---------17:03----------
okay


---------17:05----------
so next thing to consider so there's


---------17:07----------
like a future discounting problem


---------17:08----------
there's an opportunity cost problem uh


---------17:11----------
it's not really the future discounting


---------17:13----------
is another one of these principles where


---------17:14----------
like


---------17:15----------
um our brain chooses the reason i call


---------17:17----------
it future discounting is because our


---------17:18----------
brain chooses an immediate gain over an


---------17:21----------
uncertain long-term gain


---------17:23----------
so like i can get some immediate


---------17:24----------
satisfaction right now but come the


---------17:27----------
light of morning like i don't actually


---------17:28----------
know if anyone's ever going to bid war


---------17:30----------
over this because i've been writing for


---------17:31----------
an hour and it sucks there's no plot


---------17:33----------
twist like i can't


---------17:35----------
you know there's no


---------17:36----------
it's not successful


---------17:38----------
after one hour but if i play a game it's


---------17:40----------
like easy done


---------17:43----------
so now what i want to talk a little bit


---------17:44----------
about is almost


---------17:47----------
what i would call spiritual it's not


---------17:49----------
really spiritual but


---------17:51----------
it's not scientific and i think like the


---------17:52----------
yogic folks like understood this stuff


---------17:55----------
like a little bit better


---------17:56----------
and so what i'm going to talk about now


---------17:58----------
about why you know this is the third


---------18:00----------
reason


---------18:01----------
why motivation is higher at night is


---------18:02----------
shower thoughts


---------18:04----------
okay


---------18:05----------
so if you think about shower thoughts


---------18:06----------
like what's so interesting about the


---------18:08----------
shower like when you're in the shower


---------18:10----------
you're in this kind of like con state of


---------18:12----------
consciousness where you're not really


---------18:14----------
distracted you can't be on your phone


---------18:21----------
you can't really like do a whole lot


---------18:23----------
with your mind there's like no mental


---------18:25----------
distraction


---------18:30----------
and there's some amount of physical


---------18:31----------
roteness


---------18:34----------
right you're just like hopefully like


---------18:36----------
shampooing yourself cleaning your hair


---------18:37----------
things like that


---------18:39----------
and and then what happens is like this


---------18:41----------
combination of factors leads to profound


---------18:43----------
thinking


---------18:48----------
and now we all let now let's look at the


---------18:50----------
situation we go to bed so like you know


---------18:52----------
i i mean if you're on your bed you're


---------18:53----------
not gonna have i mean if you're on your


---------18:55----------
phone in bed you're not going to have


---------18:56----------
motivation you guys see that if you're


---------18:58----------
sitting there watching something or


---------18:59----------
browsing something you're not going to


---------19:00----------
feel an ounce of motivation it's when


---------19:03----------
you go to bed


---------19:05----------
it's when you put down your phone


---------19:13----------
there's nothing left to mentally


---------19:15----------
distract you so you're just sitting with


---------19:17----------
yourself


---------19:20----------
there isn't necessarily like a physical


---------19:22----------
roteness but there is sort of like a


---------19:24----------
physical


---------19:26----------
pull


---------19:27----------
or grounding let's say maybe that's a


---------19:29----------
better


---------19:32----------
feeling right and so we see a very


---------19:34----------
analogous situation to actually


---------19:36----------
showering


---------19:38----------
and then we result in like motivation


---------19:40----------
and thinking


---------19:45----------
right this is the situation in bed and


---------19:47----------
so the reason i call this kind of like


---------19:49----------
spiritual in nature is because i think


---------19:50----------
yoga like the yogis and stuff were the


---------19:52----------
ones that really looked at these


---------19:54----------
different states of mind and figured out


---------19:56----------
how do we cultivate this kind of state


---------19:58----------
of mind


---------19:59----------
and so what we can see is that a lot of


---------20:01----------
that motivation


---------20:03----------
naturally bubbles forth when we are free


---------20:06----------
from distraction


---------20:08----------
when we have no dopaminergic options at


---------20:10----------
hand and we are being with ourself


---------20:18----------
right so this is like a phrase that we


---------20:19----------
use where when you go for a walk


---------20:22----------
in nature


---------20:24----------
when you shower


---------20:26----------
when you lay in bed at night


---------20:30----------
and the interesting thing is that even


---------20:32----------
like technically someone else can be


---------20:33----------
there like you can lay in bed with your


---------20:34----------
partner or whatever but as long as you


---------20:36----------
guys aren't interacting the state will


---------20:38----------
come


---------20:39----------
so the reason i call it spiritual is


---------20:40----------
because it's about like this is the


---------20:42----------
angle where i think about cultivating a


---------20:44----------
particular state of consciousness


---------20:46----------
so if you want that kind of motivation


---------20:49----------
to hit you in other parts of the day we


---------20:52----------
already figured out showering


---------20:54----------
right so this one is like there's even


---------20:55----------
like shower thoughts is a thing


---------20:58----------
we see it when we go to bed at night but


---------20:59----------
you can actually cultivate these states


---------21:02----------
by walking in nature by


---------21:04----------
doing away with the dopaminergic


---------21:06----------
distractions right because at the end of


---------21:08----------
the day this is going to


---------21:10----------
increase dopamine


---------21:14----------
or like when you're on your phone it's


---------21:16----------
going to increase open when you play


---------21:17----------
video games it's going to increase


---------21:18----------
dopamine


---------21:19----------
and so this kind of goes back to like


---------21:21----------
this state over here


---------21:22----------
where these meditative practices


---------21:25----------
this is actually the ideal state so this


---------21:27----------
is why if you really look at people like


---------21:29----------
i for example do my most productive work


---------21:31----------
in the morning


---------21:33----------
where if i if i spend 15 minutes on my


---------21:36----------
phone at the beginning of my day if i


---------21:38----------
sit down at my computer my product


---------21:39----------
productivity is going to be like


---------21:41----------
at 80 percent of what it was sometimes


---------21:43----------
even less


---------21:44----------
the longer i spend at my computer first


---------21:46----------
thing in the morning the more screwed i


---------21:48----------
am for the day


---------21:49----------
whereas most of my like thinking


---------21:52----------
my high quality thinking happens before


---------21:54----------
i hop on the dopamine train


---------21:57----------
so avoid the dopamine train


---------22:03----------
okay takeaways number one avoid the


---------22:05----------
dopamine train number two


---------22:07----------
adenosine


---------22:09----------
gets you off


---------22:12----------
the dopamine train


---------22:16----------
so this is the fatigue groove


---------22:18----------
but


---------22:22----------
the problem with the fatigue groove is


---------22:24----------
that you're fatigued right it's not like


---------22:26----------
adenosine like adenosine is a waste


---------22:28----------
product so at this point like you're


---------22:30----------
fatigued so even though you can work


---------22:31----------
you're not as distracted the quality of


---------22:34----------
your work is going to be like 60 to 80


---------22:38----------
right and so number three


---------22:40----------
is like what you really want to


---------22:41----------
cultivate and this is like where kind of


---------22:43----------
meditation comes in is this state of


---------22:44----------
mind so this is the fatigue groove


---------22:48----------
this is when we get distracted


---------22:50----------
and then this state of mind with low


---------22:52----------
dopamine and low adenosine when your


---------22:53----------
mind is fresh where it's super capable


---------22:56----------
and at the same time it's not distracted


---------22:59----------
it's not being dopaminergic we're


---------23:01----------
creating space to be with ourselves


---------23:03----------
where we're not on our phones we don't


---------23:05----------
have mental distractions and often times


---------23:08----------
it can really help to have a physical


---------23:10----------
roteness or a grounding activity this is


---------23:12----------
why walking is really really healthy for


---------23:14----------
you or hiking right you can think a lot


---------23:16----------
or awesome really deep thoughts when


---------23:18----------
you're going for a hike if it's not


---------23:20----------
physically intensive to the point where


---------23:21----------
it's occupying your mind so if i'm rock


---------23:23----------
climbing for example like i'm not going


---------23:24----------
to be thinking deep philosophical


---------23:26----------
thoughts or creative thoughts because


---------23:27----------
all of my mental focus is going to be on


---------23:29----------
the actual physical activity but that's


---------23:31----------
the thing is that there are some


---------23:32----------
activities like showering or being in


---------23:34----------
bed or going for a walk that have a


---------23:36----------
certain physical grounding aspect


---------23:39----------
that don't demand your mental attention


---------23:41----------
so your mind can be free


---------23:43----------
and then you'll start to have motivation


---------23:47----------
questions


---------23:50----------
so what was number three oh yeah


---------23:54----------
seek out


---------23:56----------
you know


---------23:57----------
low dopamine


---------24:00----------
low adenosine states


---------24:03----------
and these states have these components


---------24:05----------
that we talked about over here right


---------24:07----------
which is


---------24:08----------
no dopamine


---------24:11----------
distractions


---------24:14----------
physical grounding


---------24:19----------
and what was this oh yeah


---------24:23----------
like mental space let's call it


---------24:26----------
and the other thing that you can do is


---------24:27----------
like this is what we call


---------24:29----------
being


---------24:30----------
with


---------24:31----------
yourself


---------24:33----------
and meditation helps a lot so like don't


---------24:36----------
start the first hour of the day like


---------24:38----------
don't use technology that's the biggest


---------24:40----------
thing you can do


---------24:42----------
questions


---------24:53----------
i personally prefer showering in the


---------24:54----------
morning but to each their own


---------25:04----------
oh my god so many questions hold on hold


---------25:06----------
on hold on


---------25:10----------
okay here's here's the


---------25:12----------
okay so big mouth fringe says what


---------25:15----------
should we do tldr


---------25:19----------
so here's the thing i can tell you what


---------25:20----------
to do but


---------25:22----------
you have to understand


---------25:23----------
right so here's something to unders


---------25:25----------
here's something to understand


---------25:27----------
behavioral change does not come with


---------25:29----------
information transmission


---------25:31----------
behavioral change comes from


---------25:32----------
understanding so we see this a lot in


---------25:35----------
addictions where like people say one day


---------25:37----------
they'll wake up and they'll say


---------25:39----------
enough is enough and if you ask them how


---------25:40----------
did you quit alcohol they just say i


---------25:42----------
woke up one day and i realized enough is


---------25:44----------
enough


---------25:45----------
now i could tell them every day before


---------25:47----------
that enough is enough you've got to stop


---------25:49----------
drinking and they're not going to do it


---------25:52----------
so the first thing you should do is


---------25:53----------
understand this the first thing that you


---------25:55----------
should do is study yourself


---------25:58----------
the first thing you should do is see if


---------25:59----------
what i'm saying is correct


---------26:01----------
do you find the fatigue groove what


---------26:03----------
happens first thing when you wake up in


---------26:04----------
the morning experiment first don't worry


---------26:07----------
about doing because who the hell knows


---------26:08----------
like this may not apply to you


---------26:10----------
experiment first understand first


---------26:12----------
explore first


---------26:14----------
see if you can find these three things


---------26:16----------
to cultivate this kind of like


---------26:18----------
motivational you know triad


---------26:21----------
of physical grounding but not physically


---------26:23----------
demanding stuff free of mental


---------26:25----------
distraction or mental space and to be


---------26:28----------
free of mental distractions


---------26:30----------
see what happens in your day when for


---------26:32----------
the first hour of the day you do not


---------26:34----------
touch a piece of technology


---------26:35----------
what happens in your mind what happens


---------26:37----------
to your motivation


---------26:41----------
right because at the end of the day if


---------26:42----------
you want to optimize performance


---------26:45----------
you don't need you don't want to use the


---------26:47----------
crutch of adenosine and the fatigue


---------26:49----------
groove to get stuff done that's what has


---------26:51----------
you operating at 70 percent


---------27:00----------
what are some good books to learn all


---------27:02----------
this stuff and also more heavily focused


---------27:04----------
on disorders there aren't unfortunately


---------27:05----------
there aren't really books


---------27:08----------
so that's why we built dr k's guide


---------27:09----------
because like what i'm offering you guys


---------27:11----------
is a synthesis of knowledge


---------27:13----------
i will link to you however two papers


---------27:17----------
which i think um for those of you who


---------27:19----------
are interested in adenosine so there are


---------27:20----------
a couple of references there


---------27:23----------
but this stuff i mean this is an


---------27:24----------
amalgamation of books right this is not


---------27:27----------
just books is the other thing is a lot


---------27:29----------
of what i teach is not books it's like


---------27:31----------
scientific papers


---------27:33----------
so you can you what you have to do is


---------27:35----------
like read a lot of scientific papers and


---------27:36----------
like stitch things together


---------27:38----------
and the part of the what we teach is


---------27:40----------
like you know you can get a phd in


---------27:42----------
neuroscience you'll learn a third of


---------27:43----------
this lecture you can get a phd in


---------27:45----------
psychology you'll learn a third of this


---------27:46----------
lecture you can spend five years


---------27:48----------
studying in india and you'll get a third


---------27:49----------
of this lecture


---------27:53----------
i don't mean i just genuinely don't have


---------27:55----------
like it's not like this is in one book


---------27:57----------
like the whole point is like this is an


---------27:58----------
amalgamation of knowledge


---------28:01----------
um what if my work is on technology then


---------28:03----------
don't work for the first week first hour


---------28:04----------
of the day i'm serious


---------28:07----------
just don't work for the first hour don't


---------28:09----------
do your job


---------28:10----------
right you can do your job later so spend


---------28:12----------
the first hour of the day cooking


---------28:14----------
cleaning


---------28:15----------
exercising straightening up your place


---------28:17----------
running an errand


---------28:21----------
you know


---------28:26----------
good questions


---------28:28----------
how do twitch streamers that are


---------28:29----------
addicted to video games become


---------28:31----------
successful then excellent question


---------28:32----------
because their success


---------28:34----------
is tied to the dopaminergic process


---------28:38----------
so this is a fantastic question right


---------28:41----------
so if your material success is tied to


---------28:45----------
the dopaminergic circuit in the nucleus


---------28:47----------
accumbens then you can be successful and


---------28:50----------
do this


---------28:52----------
easy


---------28:54----------
the challenge is that for most of us


---------28:57----------
the dopaminergic hit


---------28:59----------
does not lead to material success


---------29:02----------
so this is also where i mean they have


---------29:04----------
their fair amount of suffering too okay


---------29:06----------
so


---------29:06----------
but this is where if we look at like you


---------29:08----------
know part of the job of being a


---------29:09----------
successful twitch streamer is to spend


---------29:11----------
time on twitter


---------29:12----------
spend time on youtube spend time playing


---------29:14----------
games these are all dopaminergic


---------29:15----------
activities that's why there are


---------29:18----------
successful twitch streamers because the


---------29:20----------
world has evolved to a point where


---------29:22----------
dopaminergic activities can be


---------29:24----------
financially rewarded video games aren't


---------29:27----------
a distraction anymore they're now a job


---------29:29----------
and so what people have managed to do is


---------29:31----------
give in to their dopamine dopaminergic


---------29:33----------
circuits


---------29:35----------
they've become successful on twitch and


---------29:37----------
they're a mess


---------29:39----------
they suffer on the inside unless they


---------29:40----------
can learn how to set limits


---------29:42----------
right they like they like internally


---------29:45----------
like they're burnt out


---------29:46----------
because like they're just they're stuck


---------29:48----------
in the dopamine loops they don't feel


---------29:49----------
like they're in control of their life


---------29:50----------
all this kind of stuff


---------29:54----------
not even music in the morning i guess


---------29:56----------
you can listen to music


---------30:00----------
how do i reset the cycle from working


---------30:02----------
all night what i would say is that you


---------30:03----------
should try to stay up


---------30:05----------
and then like go to bed like at like 6


---------30:07----------
p.m or 7 p.m


---------30:09----------
so in my experience if you want to


---------30:11----------
reset your sleep schedule we've got a


---------30:13----------
video about this by the way


---------30:15----------
so if you look at the


---------30:16----------
human brain insomnia and circadian


---------30:19----------
rhythm


---------30:20----------
as a human being is it is easier to stay


---------30:23----------
up when you are tired than it is to go


---------30:25----------
to sleep when you are not


---------30:27----------
this is the key thing to understand


---------30:28----------
about resetting your sleep schedule


---------30:30----------
there's one thing to understand it's


---------30:32----------
that staying up is easier than going to


---------30:34----------
bed


---------30:35----------
so if my circadian rhythm is all off and


---------30:37----------
i lay down at 9 00 pm i may stay awake


---------30:39----------
for like four hours and then there's


---------30:41----------
like gg


---------30:43----------
nothing i can do about it


---------30:45----------
whereas it's way easier to stay up all


---------30:47----------
night right like it's it's easier to go


---------30:49----------
to stay awake 12 hours longer than when


---------30:52----------
you should go to bed than it is to go to


---------30:55----------
sleep 12 hours earlier than


---------30:57----------
you know you should go to sleep


---------30:59----------
so like it's really hard to wake up at 8


---------31:01----------
a.m and like go to sleep at 10 a.m


---------31:04----------
way easier to wake up at 8 a.m and stay


---------31:07----------
up


---------31:08----------
until 10 a.m the next day


---------31:10----------
i know i'm four pixels


---------31:12----------
trying to figure out why okay there


---------31:15----------
there we go


---------31:16----------
okay


---------31:17----------
so i would say try to stay up


---------31:19----------
until like you know 6 p.m or 7 p.m and


---------31:22----------
then you're gonna be so exhausted that


---------31:23----------
you should have no trouble falling


---------31:24----------
asleep or hopefully it'll be easier


---------31:27----------
and then what will happen is you'll


---------31:28----------
sleep for a long time and it'll be


---------31:30----------
easier to wake up in the morning so i'd


---------31:31----------
say like go to sleep at like 6 p.m 7 p.m


---------31:34----------
stay up for like 36 hours you have to be


---------31:37----------
careful about you know driving and stuff


---------31:38----------
i wouldn't drive or anything like that


---------31:39----------
so don't do anything that's dangerous


---------31:41----------
because you're gonna be heavily impaired


---------31:43----------
and then what you want to do is like set


---------31:45----------
an alarm for like 12 hours from you know


---------31:48----------
when you go to bed so like set an alarm


---------31:49----------
for like 6 a.m or 7 a.m you may feel


---------31:51----------
kind of groggy and weird when you wake


---------31:53----------
up


---------31:54----------
um


---------31:55----------
but then that'll be like the first step


---------31:57----------
in the right direction and then you have


---------31:59----------
to power through that day and then it'll


---------32:01----------
be easier to go to sleep at like 10 p.m


---------32:04----------
so that's how you fix it


---------32:12----------
someone's asking


---------32:15----------
how do i avoid the dopamine training in


---------32:16----------
the morning it's so hard yeah you're


---------32:18----------
absolutely right it is very hard


---------32:21----------
so i think the biggest problem with the


---------32:23----------
dopamine train is your phone


---------32:25----------
so really think about what is your phone


---------32:27----------
for right what is the function of your


---------32:30----------
phone why do we keep it with us we keep


---------32:32----------
it with us because of emergencies what


---------32:34----------
if there's an emergency but like the


---------32:35----------
likelihood of emergency is very very low


---------32:38----------
so what i'd recommend for people who are


---------32:40----------
trying to avoid the dopamine train in


---------32:41----------
the morning is just


---------32:42----------
keep the devices away from you


---------32:46----------
like make the burden of reaching your


---------32:48----------
device very hard don't sleep with your


---------32:49----------
phone in the same room


---------32:51----------
and it's like what if something happens


---------32:53----------
in the middle of the night and someone


---------32:54----------
calls me well then like


---------32:56----------
or if you want to i guess you can put it


---------32:58----------
at the other end of the room


---------33:00----------
and like keep it away from you so it's


---------33:01----------
not with you when you're going to bed at


---------33:03----------
night


---------33:05----------
and it's not like within arms reach when


---------33:06----------
you wake up in the morning


---------33:09----------
and the second thing is like just be


---------33:11----------
aware like as you wake up understand


---------33:13----------
what's happening like you want to go and


---------33:14----------
you sit down at your computer like


---------33:15----------
that's what you want to do with every


---------33:17----------
fiber of your being


---------33:20----------
you know it's like and be like what the


---------33:22----------
hell is that


---------33:25----------
let me see how long i can sit here


---------33:28----------
without going to the computer and watch


---------33:30----------
that struggle within yourself


---------33:32----------
it's going to be like this serpent like


---------33:34----------
uncoiling and like threatening you and


---------33:36----------
it's going gonna like pressure you so


---------33:38----------
much the pressure is crazy and then your


---------33:40----------
mind is gonna find this like internal


---------33:42----------
like weird you're gonna trick yourself


---------33:44----------
into thinking it's okay to do


---------33:47----------
you guys see what i'm saying like you're


---------33:49----------
gonna be like it's not that big of a


---------33:50----------
deal


---------33:51----------
your mind is gonna slippery like


---------33:54----------
twist this way and that to get you to


---------33:56----------
the computer


---------33:58----------
if you just say to yourself like i'm not


---------34:00----------
gonna use the computer for an hour your


---------34:01----------
mind will go into absolute rebellion


---------34:06----------
and it'll it'll push you it'll say


---------34:08----------
that's stupid


---------34:09----------
don't do it and when that doesn't work


---------34:11----------
it'll be like it's not that big of a


---------34:12----------
deal just do it it's like like you can


---------34:14----------
start tomorrow like whatever you watch


---------34:15----------
what your mind does it'll turn against


---------34:17----------
you


---------34:18----------
in every fiber of its being and that's


---------34:20----------
the dopamine craving it's like the


---------34:21----------
addict that's looking for something and


---------34:24----------
just be like what the


---------34:25----------
is this


---------34:27----------
it's crazy


---------34:29----------
then the other thing that you can do so


---------34:31----------
you can struggle there but you're gonna


---------34:32----------
fail if you struggle for too long i'd


---------34:34----------
say like you know brush your teeth take


---------34:35----------
a shower if you can whatever get dressed


---------34:37----------
then just leave the house without your


---------34:39----------
phone go for a walk in your neighborhood


---------34:42----------
get dressed and just walk around the


---------34:43----------
block 15 minutes 20 minutes


---------34:46----------
as you're walking around the block think


---------34:47----------
about okay i gotta make breakfast i'll


---------34:49----------
make coffee like whatever go back and


---------34:50----------
then like lay out a very simple plan


---------34:53----------
don't overshoot it right don't think


---------34:55----------
about all the things you have to do


---------34:56----------
today your goal is to make it to one


---------34:58----------
hour


---------34:59----------
you're gonna make your food you're gonna


---------35:00----------
have your coffee then you're going to


---------35:02----------
sit down and then then you pull out a


---------35:03----------
to-do list okay what am i going to do


---------35:05----------
over the next two hours don't make your


---------35:06----------
to-do list for the day you're screwed if


---------35:08----------
you make a to-do list for the day you're


---------35:10----------
screwed do you know why


---------35:12----------
because if it's too loose for the day


---------35:14----------
you don't have to start now


---------35:17----------
you can play games for a couple of hours


---------35:18----------
you can start like 2 p.m 4 p.m 6 pm


---------35:20----------
do this for the day


---------35:22----------
don't make it two deals for the day


---------35:24----------
just what am i gonna do this next hour


---------35:26----------
what is the next right step


---------35:29----------
this is a meditation practice that i do


---------35:31----------
myself so here's my meditation for the


---------35:32----------
day


---------35:33----------
it's gonna be kind of weird it's to ask


---------35:35----------
yourself what is the next best step


---------35:39----------
what is the next


---------35:40----------
best


---------35:42----------
step that's it


---------35:45----------
ask yourself this question again and


---------35:47----------
again and again


---------35:48----------
what is the next best step


---------35:52----------
and the reason i include next and best


---------35:55----------
is because


---------35:56----------
sometime i don't know if this kind of


---------35:58----------
makes sense


---------36:00----------
maybe actually what i say to myself what


---------36:02----------
is the next best thing i can do that's


---------36:04----------
the that's the practice i realized i


---------36:06----------
left a piece out what is the next best


---------36:08----------
thing i can do and the important thing


---------36:10----------
about that is it's not about what is


---------36:12----------
objectively best


---------36:13----------
it is about what is the next best thing


---------36:16----------
that i can do


---------36:19----------
so it acknowledges for a moment that you


---------36:20----------
don't have to be perfect it acknowledges


---------36:22----------
for a moment that you don't have to


---------36:24----------
start studying for your test right now


---------36:25----------
but if i can't start studying for my


---------36:27----------
tests can i toss in a load of laundry


---------36:30----------
can i do some laundry if i can't do


---------36:32----------
laundry can i go for a walk okay then


---------36:35----------
it's a second walk chat i cannot tell


---------36:37----------
you guys i will go for three walks


---------36:39----------
during the day and the reason i go for


---------36:41----------
three walks for during the day is


---------36:42----------
because unless i go for a walk i'm gonna


---------36:44----------
fall into gaming


---------36:47----------
but i can like physically i can force


---------36:49----------
myself


---------36:50----------
to walk 10 feet put on my shoes and walk


---------36:54----------
out the door and once i walk out the


---------36:56----------
door the desire to game disappears


---------36:59----------
you guys get that like


---------37:00----------
the key to


---------37:02----------
building a successful like


---------37:04----------
action throughout the day or habit is


---------37:08----------
not doing the whole action it's just


---------37:10----------
boarding the train to the easy part


---------37:13----------
because once it's i have never in my


---------37:16----------
life


---------37:17----------
taken two steps outside the door with my


---------37:20----------
shoes on being dressed turned around and


---------37:22----------
walked back in


---------37:24----------
in fact at that point it feels really


---------37:27----------
awkward and difficult to do that i don't


---------37:28----------
think i could do it


---------37:31----------
so sometimes what happens in our mind is


---------37:33----------
we think about


---------37:34----------
what goal we need to meet it's not about


---------37:36----------
the goal all you have to do is get far


---------37:39----------
enough to like let the train take you


---------37:41----------
the rest of the way you just have to


---------37:42----------
board the train


---------37:43----------
it's all about which train am i boarding


---------37:45----------
am i boarding the dota train or i'm


---------37:47----------
boarding the walk train


---------37:49----------
and then as you walk okay fine you


---------37:51----------
resisted for 15 minutes


---------37:53----------
20 minutes come back okay let's eat


---------37:55----------
something so you sit down it's just like


---------37:58----------
you know when you walk inside once again


---------38:00----------
it's like a battle of wills for like


---------38:02----------
five seconds do i go into like my my


---------38:05----------
room where the computer is or do i walk


---------38:07----------
into the kitchen that's all it takes if


---------38:09----------
i walk into the kitchen then it's easy i


---------38:10----------
boarded the kitchen train


---------38:13----------
right


---------38:14----------
and then in that way you will build up


---------38:17----------
like the life that you want like one


---------38:19----------
painstaking struggle at a time


---------38:22----------
some days you'll win some days you'll


---------38:23----------
lose and so it comes back to what is the


---------38:25----------
next best thing i can do i've played two


---------38:28----------
i've wasted two hours playing video


---------38:29----------
games


---------38:30----------
can i resist and can i actually get up


---------38:33----------
and go for a walk if you can't do it no


---------38:34----------
big deal


---------38:35----------
so this is your meditation what is the


---------38:37----------
next best thing i can do


---------38:39----------
what's next what do i need to do


---------38:42----------
anything any tiny thing that is the best


---------38:44----------
thing that i am capable of let me do


---------38:45----------
that thing


---------38:51----------
got it


---------38:59----------
do music or books help or hurt the


---------39:01----------
dopamine dopaminergic system generally


---------39:04----------
speaking i think they're like positive


---------39:06----------
because what they do is they get us away


---------39:08----------
from the things that are like super


---------39:09----------
toxic


---------39:11----------
right so like they get us away from


---------39:12----------
games and stuff


---------39:15----------
like so i think music can be very


---------39:16----------
inspiring like you can use your music


---------39:18----------
very judiciously so i tend to use music


---------39:20----------
very judiciously i don't have it on all


---------39:22----------
the time


---------39:23----------
i listen to music and i listen to it


---------39:25----------
intentionally because music can put you


---------39:26----------
in a particular mood


---------39:28----------
so before i stream like i oftentimes


---------39:30----------
listen to music to get in the right mood


---------39:33----------
i'll listen to some like pageants and


---------39:35----------
stuff too so like like devotional music


---------39:37----------
because that creates a certain move


---------39:38----------
sometimes i'll listen to kanye because


---------39:40----------
that creates a certain mood you can use


---------39:42----------
music to cultivate a particular mood


---------39:45----------
so go for a walk for 15 minutes and like


---------39:46----------
have like a you know a nice inspiring


---------39:48----------
playlist


---------39:50----------
and then like you'll get back and you'll


---------39:51----------
kind of do it


---------39:53----------
right


---------40:05----------
so for people who are saying


---------40:07----------
my work involves a computer so here's a


---------40:09----------
wild thing you can do this is tough


---------40:13----------
you can have a different computer for


---------40:14----------
your work in a different computer for


---------40:15----------
your gaming


---------40:16----------
okay


---------40:18----------
now even if you have one computer so


---------40:20----------
this is literally what i did so for


---------40:22----------
people who are struggling so if you're


---------40:24----------
like a programmer


---------40:26----------
and you find that like it's really hard


---------40:30----------
okay so let me let me think about how to


---------40:31----------
say this


---------40:35----------
so


---------40:36----------
a lot of taking control of your life and


---------40:38----------
doing the right things in the day is


---------40:40----------
avoiding getting on the dopamine


---------40:42----------
dopamine training right the second you


---------40:44----------
pick up your phone and you open up


---------40:46----------
twitter or something else you've lost 15


---------40:48----------
minutes you've lost an hour even you


---------40:51----------
browse and you browse and you browse and


---------40:52----------
then like the sun goes down it's a gg


---------40:54----------
the second you sit down on your computer


---------40:56----------
it's so easy to just open up a damn tab


---------40:59----------
and like all these browsers are getting


---------41:01----------
smart they know what you like to read so


---------41:02----------
the second you open up a tab one click


---------41:04----------
is all it takes and then like it shows


---------41:06----------
you stuff like your homepage even have


---------41:08----------
suggested readings for you right like


---------41:10----------
even phones nowadays have like this this


---------41:12----------
thing that you can't disable where if


---------41:14----------
you swipe in one direction it gives you


---------41:16----------
a feed and then it's gg


---------41:19----------
so if you if you're a programmer or


---------41:21----------
something your job is on your computer


---------41:23----------
how do you avoid


---------41:26----------
like falling into the trap of like the


---------41:28----------
dopamine or your crap how do you avoid


---------41:30----------
logging into steam or like you know


---------41:31----------
booting up this video game or like


---------41:33----------
pulling up youtube or whatever


---------41:35----------
and so the thing that i actually did so


---------41:37----------
like i would say you can have two


---------41:39----------
computers if you can financially like


---------41:40----------
afford that even when i was in medical


---------41:42----------
school i had one computer


---------41:45----------
but what i would what i did have is like


---------41:47----------
two desks or two spaces in my desks


---------41:50----------
so i had like two da it wasn't even like


---------41:52----------
a folding table


---------41:53----------
and like a crappy desk so you can


---------41:55----------
actually get that


---------41:56----------
and what i would literally do is pick up


---------41:58----------
my laptop and i had like my gaming


---------42:00----------
station and i had my like working


---------42:02----------
station so my working station was a


---------42:04----------
large desk where i had like books and


---------42:06----------
stuff like that i'd stick my laptop in


---------42:08----------
the back


---------42:09----------
and when i was ready to play games i


---------42:11----------
would literally pick up my laptop move


---------42:12----------
to the gaming station plug in a proper


---------42:14----------
mouse plug in my like head uh like


---------42:17----------
headphones or or speakers or whatever


---------42:20----------
and then i like game at that station and


---------42:22----------
it was it was like i'd slide my chair


---------42:24----------
over and even that can make a big


---------42:26----------
difference


---------42:27----------
so i think if your job involves your


---------42:29----------
computer as best as you can try to


---------42:31----------
separate the two so you can separate the


---------42:33----------
physical spaces so that is like an


---------42:35----------
important part of like habit and


---------42:36----------
environment you can also create


---------42:38----------
different logins


---------42:39----------
right you can have a professional login


---------42:41----------
and a work login because that also


---------42:43----------
centers your mind and sort of anchors


---------42:45----------
your mind in a particular mode you have


---------42:48----------
professional login and gaming login and


---------42:50----------
you don't log into your gaming login


---------42:52----------
until you're done with your work for the


---------42:53----------
day you like time things from like nine


---------42:54----------
to five there are these kinds of


---------42:56----------
behavioral anchors that you can actually


---------42:58----------
use that are the opposite of exactly


---------43:00----------
what these developers use to get you


---------43:02----------
hooked


---------43:03----------
right so like disable your feeds


---------43:06----------
like this is also where like you think


---------43:07----------
about your phone like do you use your


---------43:09----------
phone for work maybe get a second phone


---------43:11----------
have one phone for work or one phone for


---------43:13----------
you know personal stuff if you use your


---------43:15----------
phone for work like this is the problem


---------43:17----------
with having devices that do everything


---------43:20----------
because the more our devices do


---------43:22----------
everything the easier it is to slip from


---------43:24----------
one thing into another


---------43:26----------
this is a problem for content creators


---------43:28----------
too because since they do twitter for


---------43:30----------
professional reasons and they do twitter


---------43:31----------
for personal reasons it blends one into


---------43:33----------
the other


---------43:35----------
and so you're on twitter for like six


---------43:36----------
hours a day like having fun and


---------43:38----------
absorbing toxicity from like people on


---------43:40----------
the internet and you're screwed


---------43:42----------
so separate things out as much as you


---------43:45----------
can


---------43:46----------
there's a set of really interesting


---------43:48----------
experiments that was done by um


---------43:51----------
i forget who it is there's a set of


---------43:52----------
these like experiments that was done on


---------43:54----------
rats to explore like dystopia and


---------43:56----------
overcrowding i forget who it is


---------44:00----------
i think some sir someone so i think he's


---------44:02----------
like some kind of like noble in england


---------44:03----------
or something so he did this experiment


---------44:05----------
where he tried to create a rat utopia


---------44:08----------
okay and so what he did is he created a


---------44:10----------
space where he gave the rats as much


---------44:11----------
food as they wanted as much water as


---------44:13----------
they wanted


---------44:14----------
and then he just saw what happened and


---------44:16----------
basically like the rats like over bred


---------44:20----------
and then like they started like


---------44:22----------
degenerating as a society they started


---------44:24----------
falling apart so they would like eat as


---------44:26----------
much as they wanted to they started like


---------44:28----------
breeding like they were like all these


---------44:29----------
like terrible things happening like uh


---------44:31----------
rat mothers would have babies and they


---------44:33----------
would just like abandon them in like the


---------44:34----------
mess of rats


---------44:36----------
okay


---------44:38----------
and so like all kinds of like bad things


---------44:39----------
were happening


---------44:41----------
the one set of rats yeah it's calhoun


---------44:44----------
thank you


---------44:45----------
the one set of rats that retained their


---------44:47----------
sanity were the ones that could block


---------44:50----------
off their space from the mass of rats so


---------44:54----------
most of the rats would like congregate


---------44:55----------
in this like courtyard where there was


---------44:58----------
unlimited food and it was just like a


---------44:59----------
cesspool it's basically like the


---------45:01----------
internet


---------45:02----------
and then there were like some rats that


---------45:04----------
sort of maintained like healthy family


---------45:06----------
structures they engaged in good grooming


---------45:08----------
behaviors they also like took care of


---------45:10----------
their kids and stuff and those were the


---------45:13----------
ones that essentially like found corners


---------45:15----------
of the world and walled themselves off


---------45:17----------
and like would go out to eat and then


---------45:19----------
would come back


---------45:21----------
so even within rats there's this kind of


---------45:23----------
idea that the ones that could maintain


---------45:26----------
some kind of boundary were the ones that


---------45:29----------
were healthy


---------45:30----------
now big criticism of calhoun's


---------45:32----------
experiments which i you know i'm falling


---------45:34----------
into is that people over interpreted the


---------45:37----------
rat utopia to like human dynamics which


---------45:40----------
is a little bit unfair


---------45:41----------
but i think we know from also like


---------45:43----------
theories of psychology and stuff that


---------45:45----------
like setting good boundaries like having


---------45:47----------
good social media hygiene having good


---------45:49----------
technology hygiene having good


---------45:50----------
relationship hygiene


---------45:52----------
setting limits with your technology


---------45:54----------
usage setting limits with your


---------45:55----------
narcissistic parents


---------45:57----------
all of those things can actually be


---------45:59----------
really really healthy


---------46:01----------
so learn to set limits learn to set


---------46:02----------
boundaries use whatever tools you can to


---------46:04----------
kind of set those boundaries


---------46:06----------
and that's what you should do if you're


---------46:07----------
a programmer


---------46:09----------
what about some some reading in the


---------46:11----------
first hour is that also a no-go i would


---------46:13----------
actually steer clear of it if you can
