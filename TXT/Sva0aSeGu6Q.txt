---------00:01----------
[ __ ] stories the craziest thing about


---------00:03----------
that


---------00:03----------
story train is that when you said you


---------00:05----------
saw a pair of


---------00:07----------
ass cheeks clapping i was like what


---------00:16----------
how you doing bro good good good you


---------00:19----------
know just uh


---------00:20----------
you know had a late night playing rust


---------00:22----------
and uh


---------00:24----------
you know get some gambling on there and


---------00:26----------
you know hey


---------00:28----------
let's just say you know uh


---------00:35----------
luck wasn't on my side last night wait


---------00:38----------
so i heard something about this there


---------00:40----------
was some kind of like rust server or


---------00:41----------
something that came out


---------00:43----------
or something yeah what's the deal there


---------00:45----------
can you fill me in


---------00:46----------
pretty much um offline tv they created


---------00:49----------
this


---------00:50----------
um server for streamers on rust


---------00:55----------
so everyone can collaborate you know get


---------00:56----------
together and stream the game and


---------00:59----------
that's kind of what it is so we just get


---------01:00----------
on and it's just all streamers and


---------01:03----------
we just kind of and rust is like where


---------01:06----------
you guys like


---------01:06----------
like people like it's people like attack


---------01:09----------
each other and stuff right


---------01:11----------
yeah it's like a yeah it's like a


---------01:12----------
survival game i guess survival some [ __ ]


---------01:15----------
yeah it's not


---------01:15----------
survival i don't know and where does the


---------01:17----------
gambling come in


---------01:20----------
well you can so the current well i don't


---------01:22----------
know if it's a currency but there's this


---------01:23----------
stuff called scrap


---------01:25----------
i guess that's the equivalent to the


---------01:26----------
currency in the game and


---------01:29----------
um there's this wheel and you can gamble


---------01:32----------
it


---------01:32----------
make a wish oh for the eyelash i like


---------01:36----------
that


---------01:37----------
it's a middle eastern stuff right i


---------01:39----------
think so


---------01:40----------
yeah yeah so you know


---------01:44----------
hey yeah i pretty much go with the risky


---------01:48----------
bets you know


---------01:49----------
the one is pretty much like a 52 chance


---------01:51----------
of landing you double up everyone does


---------01:52----------
that but you know i'm only going 20 10


---------01:55----------
and five which is like the rarest ones


---------01:57----------
but hey you know big risk big reward go


---------02:00----------
baker go home right


---------02:01----------
go big or go home you know absolutely


---------02:03----------
man yeah


---------02:05----------
so train a couple things i was hoping


---------02:06----------
today i know we we've sort of been


---------02:08----------
we've mentioned addiction a couple of


---------02:10----------
times i i think you had alluded to


---------02:12----------
a few stories or experiences that you


---------02:14----------
had that we never really got into


---------02:16----------
um yeah so i was really hoping to hear


---------02:18----------
about that today and just what your


---------02:20----------
experiences have been


---------02:22----------
i think uh that could be really helpful


---------02:24----------
for other people to kind of hear about


---------02:26----------
and the second thing is just from a time


---------02:27----------
limit standpoint um i have to teach


---------02:30----------
uh in one hour and 45 minutes um


---------02:33----------
so i i really have to stop because


---------02:35----------
there's going to be a you know classroom


---------02:36----------
full of people waiting for me


---------02:38----------
um okay i should i shouldn't be late for


---------02:40----------
that so


---------02:41----------
um apologies if i if i have to stay a


---------02:43----------
little bit more focused today


---------02:45----------
so how long do we have an hour and 45


---------02:48----------
minutes


---------02:49----------
perfect if we're gonna meditate and


---------02:51----------
stuff then then we have to save time for


---------02:53----------
that


---------02:55----------
you know if ends up it ends up being


---------02:56----------
juicy we could do media you know


---------02:58----------
i'll do meditation on my own sure


---------03:00----------
absolutely


---------03:02----------
but let's dive in baby yeah let's do it


---------03:05----------
so tell me


---------03:06----------
yeah i think uh where where i where we


---------03:09----------
had left off is i think maybe you were


---------03:10----------
going to college


---------03:12----------
like we talked a lot about kind of your


---------03:14----------
upbringing and stuff like that


---------03:16----------
and then um you had sort of alluded to


---------03:18----------
substance use at certain times but i


---------03:20----------
don't think we ever talked about that


---------03:24----------
yeah i think um so


---------03:29----------
my entire life um


---------03:32----------
i've kind of just been like a dreamer


---------03:34----------
you know i've never really been grounded


---------03:36----------
you know feeling the ground i've always


---------03:37----------
been you know flying high


---------03:38----------
um you know no pun intended um


---------03:42----------
and i've always been a dreamer i've


---------03:45----------
always


---------03:46----------
you know


---------03:49----------
i've always you know um it's what i'm


---------03:52----------
looking for


---------03:56----------
i've always


---------03:59----------
i'll choose a different word but it's


---------04:01----------
not a good enough word but


---------04:03----------
i've always kind of grasped on to the


---------04:05----------
0.01


---------04:06----------
hope that something could possibly exist


---------04:09----------
that is you know outside of


---------04:10----------
what we understand to be like you know


---------04:12----------
possible or probably whatever the case


---------04:14----------
might be right


---------04:14----------
and like that's just kind of me right


---------04:16----------
i'm living in my head and


---------04:19----------
um you know in high school a lot of my


---------04:21----------
friends they


---------04:23----------
they knew how to live in the moment and


---------04:26----------
you know they could be failing all their


---------04:28----------
courses they could be


---------04:31----------
broke getting kicked out and somehow you


---------04:34----------
know


---------04:34----------
when they'd come over and do a sleepover


---------04:36----------
you know i would turn around and they'd


---------04:37----------
be sleeping with a smile on their face


---------04:39----------
you know and i'm sitting here busting my


---------04:41----------
ass you know getting good grades doing


---------04:42----------
this preparing for college


---------04:44----------
and i'm stressed i mean you know i'm


---------04:46----------
anxious


---------04:47----------
and i guess i've kind of always been


---------04:51----------
bored with the way things are with the


---------04:54----------
way


---------04:54----------
things what the way people tell you that


---------04:56----------
things are right i've always wanted to


---------04:58----------
kind of just venture outside of that


---------05:00----------
i've i've wanted to find the economy on


---------05:02----------
the status quo


---------05:03----------
yeah i've wanted to find the yeah the


---------05:06----------
adventure and the magic in the world


---------05:07----------
right sure so to speak


---------05:08----------
you know like uncharted lands uncharted


---------05:11----------
territory that


---------05:12----------
isn't on a map that can't be you know


---------05:14----------
seen on radar some crazy [ __ ] right


---------05:16----------
and which is which is kind of


---------05:19----------
interesting for a second because it


---------05:20----------
seems like


---------05:21----------
you know in high school you were kind of


---------05:23----------
walking the


---------05:25----------
the narrow path of a good iranian boy


---------05:28----------
you know getting the grades studying


---------05:30----------
hard


---------05:31----------
no no no no no definitely not no no in


---------05:34----------
high school


---------05:35----------
no in high school definitely uh no


---------05:39----------
no no in high school i was


---------05:42----------
i've been i've been pretty insecure


---------05:45----------
probably up until like my


---------05:48----------
26 27th birthday issue i'd say i've been


---------05:52----------
very very insecure i've always i've


---------05:54----------
never been like


---------05:55----------
i've always wanted to like


---------06:01----------
naturally like how i am it was it


---------06:04----------
what i was trying to be by fitting with


---------06:06----------
others i had naturally but i didn't


---------06:09----------
recognize that right because i didn't


---------06:11----------
have that self-love


---------06:13----------
i i you know i hadn't gone through like


---------06:15----------
a self-reflection or


---------06:16----------
a journey you know to really discover


---------06:18----------
myself


---------06:19----------
and love myself and accept myself and


---------06:23----------
through that i was just like a chameleon


---------06:25----------
just fitting in


---------06:26----------
trying to fit in different groups find


---------06:28----------
my place uh


---------06:30----------
find out who i was anyways so


---------06:34----------
back to the adventure stuff um a piece


---------06:36----------
of me has always crept chaos


---------06:38----------
i've always craved chaos you know i just


---------06:41----------
what is there something uh craving chaos


---------06:45----------
is like just craving a disorder craving


---------06:47----------
some sort of


---------06:48----------
storyline almost like creating problems


---------06:50----------
for yourself


---------06:52----------
that perpetuates some sort of like


---------06:58----------
it creates like a purpose like some sort


---------07:00----------
of


---------07:01----------
you know like because like we kind of go


---------07:02----------
about life we just kind of go like


---------07:04----------
robots right you go to school you come


---------07:06----------
home you do your homework you dinner you


---------07:07----------
go to bed


---------07:08----------
right you grow up you get to go to


---------07:10----------
college you get a job you're married you


---------07:12----------
have kids right it's just this like


---------07:14----------
stale


---------07:16----------
timeline the stale schedule kind of


---------07:18----------
adrenaline


---------07:19----------
survival a reason exactly there is


---------07:23----------
something a little more you know like


---------07:24----------
there's a storyline there that there's


---------07:26----------
there's something


---------07:28----------
you know so i've always kind of craved a


---------07:30----------
little bit of care or i've craved a lot


---------07:32----------
of chaos in my life


---------07:33----------
and i think i think that was kind of the


---------07:35----------
entryway into


---------07:36----------
some of the hard drugs i've done which


---------07:39----------
occurred through college i


---------07:40----------
i think i first dabbled in the hardest


---------07:42----------
of drugs


---------07:44----------
probably well i'd say i started freshman


---------07:46----------
year with like a little bit of like soft


---------07:48----------
medium drugs and then i went into like


---------07:50----------
sophomore junior i went some hard drugs


---------07:52----------
can you help me understand how you


---------07:53----------
classify


---------07:54----------
soft drugs medium drugs and hard drugs


---------08:02----------
uh a medium drug to me is like xanax


---------08:05----------
hard drugs like percocet oxycontin


---------08:07----------
heroin meth


---------08:10----------
medium drugs xanax you know vicodin


---------08:13----------
i'd say i don't know and then soft drug


---------08:16----------
i don't know


---------08:17----------
weed i don't know okay and


---------08:20----------
you know train if i ask you anything


---------08:21----------
that you don't feel comfortable


---------08:22----------
answering you just


---------08:23----------
i'm comfortable and the drug topic


---------08:25----------
uncomfortable


---------08:26----------
um because i think it is just important


---------08:28----------
to understand like your terminology so


---------08:30----------
you were saying like


---------08:31----------
soft drugs is marijuana um medium drugs


---------08:35----------
yes


---------08:35----------
is like benzos like xanax did you say


---------08:38----------
vicodin was a medium drug


---------08:40----------
uh i'd say vicodin is actually low-key


---------08:43----------
weaker than xanax xanax is actually


---------08:45----------
[ __ ] dangerous low-key so that's


---------08:46----------
that that's right a little bit harder


---------08:48----------
it's just like that's like one of those


---------08:49----------
things that's like


---------08:50----------
it's everywhere it's like it's become so


---------08:52----------
normalized that you don't see it as this


---------08:55----------
hard drug but xanax is definitely bad


---------08:57----------
i'd say it's


---------08:58----------
i think it's worse than vicodin to be


---------08:59----------
honest but then again i guess watching


---------09:01----------
dr house that's not the case


---------09:03----------
so yeah so so it occurs to me that maybe


---------09:07----------
um


---------09:09----------
you know maybe we need to just do a


---------09:11----------
little bit of public education i may try


---------09:13----------
to put something together just a little


---------09:14----------
bit about


---------09:15----------
what 100 please do different drugs so


---------09:18----------
one thing just so


---------09:20----------
everyone knows this is super dangerous


---------09:22----------
so first of all you know


---------09:24----------
i don't i really don't recommend any


---------09:25----------
kind of substance use at all really ever


---------09:28----------
um the the couple of things that really


---------09:32----------
get people into trouble


---------09:33----------
are just as an addiction psychiatrist


---------09:36----------
i've seen this


---------09:37----------
time and again where sometimes we'll


---------09:39----------
people will use a particular dosage


---------09:41----------
and then if they get sober for a while


---------09:44----------
they'll go back to their old dosage and


---------09:46----------
that can actually be lethal


---------09:49----------
and then i've had patients uh die or


---------09:51----------
overdose because of that


---------09:52----------
and the second thing is that drug


---------09:54----------
classes should really never be mixed


---------09:56----------
that exponentially increases the danger


---------09:59----------
so if you use benzodiazepines and


---------10:01----------
opiates together


---------10:02----------
your chances of death are way higher


---------10:06----------
because they sort of synergistically act


---------10:08----------
to suppress your breathing and things


---------10:09----------
like that


---------10:11----------
um so so really i mean first of all


---------10:13----------
don't do drugs and be super careful


---------10:16----------
because a lot of times people feel like


---------10:17----------
they can handle it and and they can't


---------10:19----------
which is why it's such a problem but


---------10:21----------
um just a couple of quick points but i i


---------10:23----------
hear what you're saying so just to kind


---------10:25----------
of recap


---------10:26----------
marijuana is a soft drug um medium drugs


---------10:29----------
it sounds like xanax and then


---------10:31----------
then the opiates and you you classify


---------10:33----------
meth as a hard drug


---------10:36----------
i'd say so do you know do you have a


---------10:39----------
sense of like when you started using


---------10:41----------
anything


---------10:44----------
sheesh i smoked my first blunt cell from


---------10:45----------
your high school


---------10:47----------
and do you have a sense of like what got


---------10:49----------
you into it


---------10:52----------
friends and like just kind of


---------10:55----------
like peer pressure or i don't know i'm


---------10:58----------
going to be honest it smelled


---------11:00----------
really good you know it's kind of it's


---------11:02----------
kind of cigarettes right


---------11:03----------
cigarettes smell really good but like


---------11:05----------
they just taste like [ __ ] right there's


---------11:06----------
terrible


---------11:07----------
weed it has that smell where you just


---------11:09----------
want to eat it you literally just want


---------11:10----------
to eat it


---------11:11----------
right but it's like it's it's it doesn't


---------11:13----------
actually taste like that when you write


---------11:16----------
some [ __ ] like that's what i'm assuming


---------11:18----------
right yeah


---------11:20----------
yeah so you don't hear pressure probably


---------11:21----------
yeah well no it's it's actually


---------11:23----------
interesting so that may not be peer


---------11:24----------
pressure


---------11:25----------
um so this is something that a lot of


---------11:26----------
people don't know is that


---------11:29----------
you know so i remember the first time i


---------11:30----------
had a beer i thought it was disgusting


---------11:32----------
even now when i have a beer i think it's


---------11:34----------
disgusting i had one sip of alcohol


---------11:36----------
yesterday and i found it to be


---------11:38----------
absolutely foul and abysmal


---------11:41----------
and then some of the the people i've


---------11:42----------
worked with will say that when they had


---------11:44----------
their first


---------11:45----------
sip of alcohol it tastes delicious


---------11:48----------
it's like like so so oddly enough


---------11:50----------
there's some evidence that based on


---------11:52----------
how your brain is wired i've never


---------11:56----------
really thought about smell but


---------11:57----------
the taste of things like alcohol can be


---------12:00----------
super super appealing


---------12:01----------
like your taste buds are wired like if


---------12:03----------
you have that


---------12:04----------
biological predisposition to being


---------12:07----------
vulnerable to like alcohol addiction


---------12:09----------
alcoholism


---------12:10----------
yeah it will taste amazing the first


---------12:12----------
time you try it


---------12:14----------
yeah i've heard of that and and i'm not


---------12:16----------
quite i've never really thought about


---------12:17----------
this with marijuana but i i wonder if


---------12:18----------
there's something similar where like


---------12:20----------
something in your brain is like oh that


---------12:21----------
scent is like


---------12:22----------
that has some of the chemical compounds


---------12:24----------
that like i really really want


---------12:26----------
never really thought about it that way


---------12:27----------
before but it's interesting i've never


---------12:28----------
heard someone


---------12:30----------
you know say that the first time i


---------12:31----------
smelled marijuana i like really wanted


---------12:33----------
to eat it


---------12:34----------
it's kind of it's kind of an interesting


---------12:37----------
yeah


---------12:39----------
yeah yeah that's it maybe yeah


---------12:43----------
and so it sounds like you started using


---------12:44----------
pot in high school anything else in high


---------12:47----------
school


---------12:47----------
well i i wasn't really using pot like i


---------12:50----------
wasn't like


---------12:51----------
i wasn't one of those pod head kids so i


---------12:53----------
played


---------12:54----------
dude don't lose it this time bro no i


---------12:57----------
think it's in my eye low key


---------12:59----------
but anyways i wasn't one of those


---------13:01----------
because i played varsity soccer from


---------13:03----------
freshman year all the way to senior year


---------13:04----------
so like i was


---------13:04----------
constantly doing conditioning constantly


---------13:07----------
you know


---------13:08----------
training just just blink because when


---------13:11----------
you're watching


---------13:11----------
no no yeah yeah but i have contacts oh i


---------13:14----------
don't know


---------13:15----------
that's what's going to change anything


---------13:16----------
so when i blink and there's eyelash in


---------13:18----------
there and it gets mixed with eye contact


---------13:20----------
or just slip underneath and it's even


---------13:21----------
worse


---------13:21----------
okay sorry yeah i didn't realize no


---------13:23----------
don't be sorry it's okay


---------13:24----------
um because a lot of times the way your


---------13:27----------
eyelid is


---------13:28----------
is designed is it pushes the hair


---------13:30----------
towards the middle


---------13:31----------
when it closes yeah it's not


---------13:46----------
mean or so available it sounds like in


---------13:48----------
college you started experimenting with


---------13:50----------
like soft to medium


---------13:53----------
yeah well i kind of fell out of the weed


---------13:55----------
thing you know


---------13:57----------
i don't know when like junior of high


---------13:58----------
school you know i started kind of


---------14:00----------
that that was the point where i you know


---------14:02----------
i think everyone hits a point where


---------14:04----------
you hit a stage in your life if you're


---------14:06----------
lucky i think


---------14:07----------
right because some people just kind of


---------14:08----------
stay


---------14:10----------
you know whatever but i think it hits a


---------14:14----------
stage in the life where they start


---------14:15----------
overthinking right they start


---------14:17----------
overthinking they trip themselves out


---------14:19----------
and i hit that i hit that phase so


---------14:21----------
anyhow i'd smoke i just overthink i just


---------14:23----------
you know freak myself out for no [ __ ]


---------14:25----------
reason you know what i mean


---------14:27----------
and i just stopped that all around right


---------14:29----------
but


---------14:30----------
i just yeah so marijuana stopped and


---------14:32----------
then


---------14:33----------
i think my freshman year i started


---------14:35----------
[ __ ] around some xanax


---------14:38----------
you know i do the mixing stuff you


---------14:40----------
talked about was bad which is like


---------14:42----------
drinking


---------14:43----------
that terrible and then the sense of


---------14:46----------
what pulled you towards that train i


---------14:49----------
would just say


---------14:51----------
just the


---------14:55----------
college i mean i don't know it was kind


---------14:57----------
of the party life


---------14:58----------
you know everyone was kind of just i


---------14:59----------
don't know you know it was something


---------15:01----------
you'd see at a blue mountain state


---------15:03----------
you know some chick you know you know


---------15:08----------
down getting crazy in the bathroom


---------15:11----------
i'm saying pop one of those take a shot


---------15:14----------
start [ __ ] you know kind of like one


---------15:16----------
of those crazy things right


---------15:17----------
kind of happens and then from there


---------15:18----------
you're like damn this feels good


---------15:20----------
and you want to feel that again right


---------15:22----------
but you can never feel that again


---------15:23----------
because


---------15:25----------
the whole trick joe was chasing that but


---------15:27----------
anyways


---------15:28----------
yeah i don't really like it too much to


---------15:30----------
be honest i mean it feels good at the


---------15:31----------
moment but hey


---------15:32----------
that xanax hangover that is terrible


---------15:35----------
that oh man that feeling can we rewind a


---------15:39----------
little bit i


---------15:40----------
i didn't understand some of what you


---------15:42----------
said and


---------15:44----------
and maybe that's because i just can't


---------15:45----------
relate to some of the experience there


---------15:48----------
but um what is that what do you mean by


---------15:51----------
the trick


---------15:53----------
oh the trick so it's like you know i


---------15:55----------
mean it's especially in like


---------15:57----------
especially in opiates right but this i


---------15:59----------
think applies to any drug right like


---------16:01----------
when you take it for your first time


---------16:03----------
what you're gonna feel is just


---------16:04----------
absolute euphoria greatness amazingness


---------16:08----------
unstoppableness right and then from


---------16:11----------
there on


---------16:11----------
right after a couple more times you


---------16:13----------
might feel that way and then from there


---------16:14----------
on you start building a tolerance


---------16:15----------
right and then you're kind of chasing


---------16:18----------
that original high you're chasing the


---------16:20----------
dragon


---------16:20----------
right so you take more you take more you


---------16:23----------
mix this mix that


---------16:25----------
but you never really hit it until you


---------16:26----------
[ __ ] your life up right so that's what i


---------16:27----------
meant by chasing the high


---------16:29----------
got it yeah and and so


---------16:32----------
i'm just curious i mean you mentioned


---------16:33----------
early on that you were kind of insecure


---------16:36----------
that you craved chaos


---------16:37----------
[Music]


---------16:39----------
you would kind of frame the discussion


---------16:41----------
with those at the beginning yeah go


---------16:42----------
ahead


---------16:42----------
yeah those aren't connected i just want


---------16:44----------
to make it clear because i still crave


---------16:45----------
chaos but


---------16:46----------
yeah okay i mean are either of those


---------16:48----------
connected with kind of like


---------16:50----------
you know the freshman party lifestyle


---------16:52----------
maybe how you felt about yourself


---------16:54----------
the insecurity yeah 100 i'm not really a


---------16:56----------
partier


---------16:57----------
because i'm not really a party like what


---------16:59----------
i am is


---------17:01----------
because you sound like one hell of a


---------17:02----------
party or dude yeah i'm


---------17:04----------
listen i can have a good time right you


---------17:06----------
know


---------17:07----------
i think to this day still i've thrown


---------17:09----------
you know the best party at a convention


---------17:12----------
so like i don't have a good time i'm


---------17:13----------
persian you know persians we love to


---------17:15----------
party we let's have a good time


---------17:16----------
but i'm more of like a you know hang out


---------17:19----------
with


---------17:20----------
you know the three kids in science class


---------17:23----------
in grandma's basement do some science


---------17:25----------
experiments eat some chips watch some tv


---------17:26----------
play a board game


---------17:27----------
that's me it doesn't look like me but


---------17:29----------
that's what i enjoy


---------17:30----------
partying it's not me it's just it's so


---------17:34----------
tiring it's just it's just tiring like


---------17:37----------
any like it's the crazy part we talked


---------17:39----------
about last time you know i'm a very


---------17:40----------
outgoing person you know i


---------17:42----------
i excel in any social situation you


---------17:44----------
throw me into a bin of strangers and


---------17:46----------
i'll come out you know friends with all


---------17:48----------
of them but


---------17:50----------
man it is is it tiring because like when


---------17:54----------
i go into these i don't


---------17:55----------
see it like i don't see it for like


---------18:00----------
so for example at a party if you go to a


---------18:01----------
party right i don't see a party as just


---------18:03----------
people having a good time


---------18:05----------
i'm looking and it's just like


---------18:08----------
everyone's


---------18:08----------
like everyone's trying to forget


---------18:10----------
everyone's trying to uh push something


---------18:12----------
that they need to do


---------18:13----------
away they're miserable they're sad


---------18:15----------
they're depressed no one's actually


---------18:17----------
everyone's fronting do you understand


---------18:18----------
like maybe there's a few people have


---------18:20----------
their [ __ ] together and they're actually


---------18:21----------
having a good time one time they're


---------18:22----------
gonna go back and study tomorrow


---------18:24----------
but it's like it's just it's just a


---------18:25----------
cesspool of [ __ ] it's the same with bars


---------18:27----------
right like for me


---------18:28----------
you know i worked in the bars for a bit


---------18:30----------
and when i look at a bar


---------18:32----------
or a club it just looked so gloomy to me


---------18:34----------
everyone else saw this fun


---------18:36----------
escape let's have you know let's go you


---------18:38----------
know this that adventure


---------18:39----------
to me it was just this it was a trick


---------18:42----------
it was literally a trick and no one


---------18:44----------
could see it right


---------18:46----------
it was this crazy thing that's at least


---------18:48----------
the way my brain saw it so yeah


---------18:50----------
it's never been that's never been me but


---------18:52----------
i think


---------18:53----------
in the search for myself


---------18:57----------
i guess that's just one of the paths


---------18:58----------
took me down and so when you were


---------19:01----------
partying like let's say early in college


---------19:03----------
i mean would you say it was an escape


---------19:05----------
for you


---------19:14----------
no what was it for you


---------19:18----------
it was a search for adventure


---------19:22----------
that's what it was yeah it was a search


---------19:25----------
for something


---------19:26----------
i was hoping that you know something


---------19:28----------
crazy should happen i'll be real


---------19:29----------
[ __ ] some crazy [ __ ] happen in those


---------19:31----------
days i have some stories for you oh we


---------19:32----------
can go for


---------19:33----------
hours we don't have that today though


---------19:34----------
but wow


---------19:36----------
but yeah do you feel adventure one


---------19:39----------
just to give us a sense well it's not


---------19:42----------
oh if it's not street stream friendly


---------19:45----------
then that's totally


---------19:45----------
well it i mean it's stream friendly but


---------19:49----------
i don't know how relevant it is just


---------19:52----------
yeah


---------19:54----------
what's all right well it's just


---------19:58----------
you know there are certain things you


---------19:59----------
know you can talk about because people


---------20:01----------
don't


---------20:01----------
i i'll just tell you so i was this guy


---------20:05----------

---------20:06----------
it's funny cause me and kyle started as


---------20:07----------

---------20:09----------

---------20:11----------
and he actually went to my high school


---------20:12----------

---------20:13----------
[ __ ] with me and bullied me but


---------20:14----------
we ended up connecting after we kind of


---------20:17----------
like fought


---------20:18----------
always seems to be the case um anyways


---------20:22----------
he's the one that had issues with you


---------20:24----------
because you walked in with your head


---------20:25----------
held high


---------20:26----------

---------20:29----------
his own issues he


---------20:31----------

---------20:45----------

---------20:56----------
when i go to a party there's this place


---------20:59----------

---------21:00----------

---------21:03----------

---------21:06----------

---------21:08----------

---------21:11----------

---------21:12----------

---------21:20----------

geeked up walks up to me it's like


---------21:46----------

---------21:50----------
right at that point i'm drunk right i'm


---------21:52----------
feeling that good buzz right i'm at a


---------21:54----------
point


---------21:54----------
where superman could have walked up to


---------21:56----------
me and i would have thought i was his


---------21:57----------
kryptonite


---------21:58----------
you know i would have [ __ ] i would have


---------21:59----------
take i would have stolen lois lane from


---------22:01----------
him you know


---------22:02----------
that's where i was mentally this dude's


---------22:04----------
69 250 just steroid it out


---------22:09----------
he's with his friend and his friend was


---------22:11----------
a mutual of mine


---------22:13----------
he tries to grab my beer i turn away


---------22:16----------
i knock his hat off it falls over the


---------22:18----------
balcony


---------22:20----------
he pushes me and then a group of kids


---------22:22----------
form this like


---------22:23----------
alleyway out into the hallway


---------22:26----------
and they want us to fight but we end up


---------22:28----------
like scuffling and fighting


---------22:30----------
in the kitchen and he throws a punch at


---------22:33----------
me


---------22:34----------
and i dodge it and his his hand goes


---------22:36----------
through the door and the door


---------22:38----------
like the doors in these college areas


---------22:39----------
are paper thin it's not like these


---------22:41----------
nice wooden doors paper thin his hand


---------22:44----------
goes to this door


---------22:46----------
and i remember everyone's like oh we


---------22:48----------
both freeze i look


---------22:50----------
i turn behind me i look and all i see is


---------22:53----------
my


---------22:53----------
friend kyle's bare ass cheeks just


---------22:56----------
clapping cheeks just just he's going to


---------22:59----------
town


---------22:59----------
on this other chick in the bathroom on


---------23:02----------
the sink


---------23:03----------
and i'm like hey kyle right and then he


---------23:06----------
runs out right puts his pants on


---------23:07----------
we go into the hallway and


---------23:11----------
to this day i don't know


---------23:14----------
sometimes i feel like i dreamt this


---------23:15----------
because


---------23:17----------
i was in this superman


---------23:20----------
god complex mode where this dude's


---------23:24----------
throwing his haymakers right he's this


---------23:26----------
big guy he's slow


---------23:27----------
and you know his his his tr his uh his


---------23:30----------
lats are huge


---------23:31----------
so he can't throw a straight punch he


---------23:33----------
has to throw these haymakers


---------23:34----------
and i remember when i was looking at him


---------23:36----------
it was as if there was just slow motion


---------23:38----------
i was dodging and i was


---------23:39----------
laughing because it was so slow to me


---------23:42----------
and


---------23:43----------
each when i dodged i jabbed him i jabbed


---------23:45----------
him


---------23:46----------
and i ended up winning that i mean if he


---------23:48----------
was smart he would stick him in the


---------23:49----------
ground and [ __ ] me up but


---------23:50----------
he wasn't so i guess that's the


---------23:52----------
stereotype of the meat head but


---------23:55----------
yeah so that happened and then the next


---------23:56----------
day we end up going to a party and


---------23:58----------
he ends up being there and his face is


---------24:00----------
just messed up and he's like six of his


---------24:02----------
boys i'm by myself


---------24:03----------
very [ __ ] awkward but fortunately he


---------24:05----------
was a good guy and he apologized i


---------24:07----------
apologized


---------24:08----------
we're cool now wow that's the story yeah


---------24:12----------
i have a lot of those i have some crazy


---------24:14----------
[ __ ] stories the craziest thing about


---------24:15----------
that


---------24:15----------
story train is that when you said you


---------24:18----------
saw a pair of


---------24:19----------
ass cheeks clapping i was like


---------24:22----------
what right because you're in the middle


---------24:24----------
of a fight and that's that's the thought


---------24:26----------
that's all thing it's like


---------24:27----------
a movie yeah well yeah why are there but


---------24:29----------
like and then there's like no


---------24:30----------
there's no like segway into there the


---------24:33----------
door was open


---------24:34----------
no it wasn't the guy punched through the


---------24:37----------
door oh


---------24:38----------
i pulled his hand out there's a huge


---------24:39----------
hole and i look into the hole


---------24:42----------
and it's literally just a pair of ass


---------24:43----------
cheeks here


---------24:45----------
right he's just going to town it was it


---------24:48----------
was some hot [ __ ] yeah it was hot as


---------24:49----------
hell but i was in my adrenaline mode so


---------24:50----------
i couldn't really


---------24:51----------
get into that when i was


---------24:58----------
yeah crazy [ __ ] yeah that that's wild


---------25:02----------
man


---------25:03----------
yeah yeah it was yeah


---------25:07----------
anyways so around i'd say i'd say around


---------25:10----------
sophomore year


---------25:11----------
i met these two kids and


---------25:14----------
um they were actually pre-med they had


---------25:16----------
like 4.2 gpas


---------25:18----------
crazy gpas you know always studying in


---------25:22----------
uh you know the office hours


---------25:24----------
i think we called it lab or some [ __ ]


---------25:25----------
like that and


---------25:28----------
they were like smart ass [ __ ]


---------25:30----------
like they were


---------25:31----------
they were on track you know to you know


---------25:34----------
a top 10 med school


---------25:37----------
and at that time in my eyes that's like


---------25:40----------
the most credible thing


---------25:42----------
around me right you got someone that you


---------25:44----------
know has a good family


---------25:45----------
is a good guy has good values has a high


---------25:47----------
gpa


---------25:48----------
on track to a top 10 med school you know


---------25:51----------
doing shadowing and


---------25:52----------
you know uh internships things like that


---------25:55----------
right


---------25:56----------
to me that's incredible now these guys


---------26:00----------
they were secretly [ __ ] up right they


---------26:02----------
were on some crazy [ __ ]


---------26:04----------
right percocets oxycontin they were


---------26:05----------
smoking them doing heroin


---------26:08----------
so you know i kind of got involved with


---------26:09----------
them and in my head


---------26:11----------
i'm thinking okay well can't be that bad


---------26:14----------
these guys are


---------26:15----------
smart they're doing well [ __ ] like


---------26:18----------
right right [ __ ] it why not


---------26:21----------
yeah people who have their [ __ ] together


---------26:22----------
are doing it so


---------26:24----------
yeah i can some [ __ ] like that yeah


---------26:28----------
so it started out with you know perks


---------26:31----------
from perks you know smoking perks


---------26:34----------
from smoking perks to ocs from ocs


---------26:38----------
smoking ocs then ocs got banned and you


---------26:41----------
had these things called opanas which had


---------26:42----------
a coating over it so you couldn't smoke


---------26:44----------
it


---------26:45----------
and then from there you know obviously


---------26:46----------
those are 20 to 50 to 80 dollars a pill


---------26:49----------
you can get that amount times 100


---------26:52----------
for that same price if you do heroin


---------26:54----------
instead of that


---------26:56----------
and realistically what people don't know


---------26:58----------
is percocet is literally synthetic


---------27:00----------
heroin it's a clean heroine right it's a


---------27:02----------
pharmaceutical heroin


---------27:04----------
right no one knows that everyone thinks


---------27:06----------
they take a perk you know you know


---------27:07----------
because like there's a stigma behind


---------27:08----------
heroin and there should be but


---------27:11----------
yet percocet's like this accepted thing


---------27:13----------
if you get it prescribed but it's the


---------27:15----------
same [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------27:16----------
so right and i guess at the time that


---------27:19----------
that's a very dangerous


---------27:20----------
you know thing to kind of say because


---------27:23----------
but it sounds like i'm justifying it it


---------27:25----------
sounds like i'm saying oh well percocets


---------27:26----------
are prescribed this is the same thing


---------27:28----------
it's just dirty


---------27:28----------
right so it should be okay but it's not


---------27:30----------
okay so i want to make that very clear


---------27:32----------
that's very dangerous


---------27:32----------
what what is not okay i'm confused like


---------27:36----------
is it saying to yourself a percocet is


---------27:38----------
prescribed so that's


---------27:40----------
okay or you know i'm saying that like


---------27:44----------
cheaper i'm saying like if you know if


---------27:47----------
you go to your boy's house


---------27:48----------
and on the counter you see his mom's


---------27:50----------
percocet prescription you don't think oh


---------27:52----------
what a [ __ ] drug addict discussing i


---------27:53----------
got to get out of here bad vibes right


---------27:55----------
but if you you know see a needle in


---------27:56----------
heroin you're gonna [ __ ] need if you


---------27:58----------
just see heroin on the count you're like


---------27:59----------
[ __ ] like i gotta get the [ __ ] out of


---------28:01----------
here and call the cops never come back


---------28:02----------
here again right


---------28:03----------
but it's like they're one and the same


---------28:05----------
realistically right like sure


---------28:07----------
that's what i'm talking about right so


---------28:11----------
yeah anyways so you know that happened


---------28:14----------
you know


---------28:15----------
some heroin for like let's say three


---------28:16----------
years


---------28:18----------
tried meth once the meth experience was


---------28:20----------
nuts crazy story for you there


---------28:22----------
[ __ ] that was nuts i remember i came


---------28:24----------

---------28:25----------

---------28:27----------

---------28:28----------

---------28:30----------

---------28:32----------
oh she was tripping balls crazy i was it


---------28:35----------

---------28:36----------

---------28:38----------

---------30:15----------
was some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] it was it


---------30:17----------
was nuts


---------30:19----------
combat [ __ ] terrible yeah


---------30:22----------
so uh that that sounds crazy dude


---------30:26----------
um yeah it's pretty bad


---------30:30----------
i'm just trying to think so like like


---------30:32----------
you said that you you were using


---------30:33----------
so what like first of all your mom knows


---------30:35----------
what meth mites are


---------30:38----------
she googled it but what did she google


---------30:42----------
like so you come home and then i come


---------30:44----------
home i have like scabs and


---------30:47----------
just red all over my face she types in


---------30:50----------
red scabs all over her face and it says


---------30:52----------
methmites and she's like i thought it


---------30:54----------
was mathemates i'm like the [ __ ] are


---------30:55----------
those


---------30:56----------
yeah i look i look that [ __ ] up it says


---------30:59----------
like you know when you're high in meth


---------31:00----------
or whatever like


---------31:01----------
you have this like weird thing where you


---------31:03----------
perceive there to be


---------31:04----------
you think there is like tiny mites


---------31:06----------
underneath your skins you have to pick


---------31:07----------
them out that wasn't the case for me but


---------31:09----------
some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ] like that yeah


---------31:11----------
it was a crazy [ __ ] thing she was


---------31:13----------
[ __ ] mad and she was crying and


---------31:15----------
that was terrible i let her down at that


---------31:17----------
point but yeah


---------31:18----------
so uh train i mean what what were you


---------31:21----------
what was going through your head


---------31:22----------
let's say like you know like a year


---------31:26----------
before that point so it sounds like


---------31:27----------
you're using heroin for a couple or


---------31:29----------
opiates of some kind for a couple of


---------31:30----------
years off and on


---------31:32----------
like what did you think about your life


---------31:34----------
and what did you think about yourself


---------31:36----------
and what did you think about


---------31:37----------
use well nothing because


---------31:41----------
i somehow found this balance that gave


---------31:44----------
me this


---------31:44----------
perfect like denial of slash delusion


---------31:47----------
that like there was


---------31:48----------
something wrong here i found the balance


---------31:50----------
i was


---------31:51----------
you know double majored up i had good


---------31:53----------
grades you know


---------31:54----------
i had you know i had good grades great


---------31:56----------
grades i had


---------31:57----------
two very difficult majors i was getting


---------31:59----------
by and doing very well


---------32:01----------
right i was on track to you know a top


---------32:05----------
20 law school


---------32:06----------
everything was fine like it wasn't this


---------32:08----------
thing where i just tossed everything


---------32:10----------
aside i started selling my parents


---------32:11----------
jewelry and getting high like


---------32:13----------
i was i found this thing where i could


---------32:15----------
cold turkey


---------32:16----------
and it all goes back to like what i told


---------32:18----------
you earlier like that's that story line


---------32:20----------
that


---------32:20----------
that hope that adventure like deep down


---------32:25----------
i prefer that over any high right any


---------32:28----------
escape


---------32:28----------
any shortcut i preferred that real thing


---------32:32----------
that


---------32:32----------
search for that real thing that


---------32:33----------
connection overall and that's what


---------32:36----------
allowed me to actually


---------32:37----------
get out of it myself right there has to


---------32:39----------
be something you love more than the high


---------32:41----------
so like i see but that's how you got it


---------32:44----------
well yeah i wasn't yeah i wasn't so like


---------32:47----------
when i said i was using


---------32:48----------
three years what i mean is like i wasn't


---------32:50----------
using


---------32:51----------
for three years straight what i would do


---------32:54----------
is


---------32:54----------
for one week i would use then i had cold


---------32:57----------
turkey and i was off for three months


---------32:58----------
then i'd be on for two weeks then i'd be


---------33:00----------
off for four months right then i'd be on


---------33:02----------
for a week then i'd be offered two


---------33:03----------
months


---------33:04----------
like i could do that somehow i could do


---------33:06----------
i'm sure it was [ __ ] my body up


---------33:08----------
but somehow i found a method where i


---------33:10----------
could hold turkey off and on and just


---------33:12----------
use it like recreationally almost


---------33:15----------
while also going to school and having a


---------33:18----------
job


---------33:18----------
right so it's not so i didn't toss my


---------33:20----------
job out i didn't toss school out i was


---------33:22----------
still doing all of these things


---------33:24----------
and then like you know if i had nothing


---------33:26----------
to do one weekend right


---------33:27----------
if everything was done with i had a week


---------33:30----------
off


---------33:31----------
that's when i'd use it right does that


---------33:32----------
make sense yeah it makes a lot of sense


---------33:35----------
so it's interesting train i really


---------33:36----------
appreciate the conversation because i'm


---------33:38----------
learning a lot so


---------33:39----------
as a clinician i think the people


---------33:42----------
who are like you never really enter my


---------33:46----------
office


---------33:48----------
like i've never worked with someone


---------33:49----------
who's had an addiction let me think


---------33:51----------
about this before


---------33:52----------
i actually say it no one comes to mind


---------33:55----------
right now i mean usually the people that


---------33:56----------
wind up in my office are the ones that


---------33:58----------
can't cold turkey


---------33:59----------
after a week of use it's like one week


---------34:03----------
turns into two weeks turns into three


---------34:04----------
months turns into six months


---------34:06----------
turns into eight months it does start to


---------34:08----------
affect things


---------34:09----------
in in my time of using here's the [ __ ]


---------34:12----------
up part


---------34:14----------
you know and not many people know this


---------34:18----------
but anyone who's in the heroin game


---------34:21----------
right


---------34:24----------
your friends or at that you know i guess


---------34:27----------
from an outside perspective that none of


---------34:28----------
them are your friends they're your


---------34:30----------
acquaintances or people you're smoking


---------34:32----------
with but when you're in that you know


---------34:33----------
world that they're your friends


---------34:35----------
they're dropping like flies right like


---------34:38----------
four or five friends odin a week dead


---------34:41----------
right


---------34:42----------
i i've had people die in front of me


---------34:43----------
like some crazy [ __ ] like that like some


---------34:45----------
[ __ ] you'd set up a [ __ ] movie


---------34:47----------
and like i've seen it like like people


---------34:48----------
don't understand


---------34:50----------
it's some [ __ ] up [ __ ] right it's not


---------34:52----------
like the dude's eyes are closed and he's


---------34:54----------
just passed out you touch him oh he's


---------34:56----------
cold


---------34:56----------
right it's like


---------34:59----------
right dudes shivering shaking right


---------35:03----------
he's scared right it's some [ __ ] up


---------35:04----------
[ __ ] right like


---------35:06----------
i i've seen some [ __ ] up [ __ ]


---------35:08----------
especially because like everyone shot up


---------35:10----------
that's one thing i promised also i'd


---------35:11----------
never do i never went past smoking it i


---------35:14----------
never shot up ever


---------35:16----------
so many people died and if anyone like


---------35:19----------
is ever in that game they know


---------35:20----------
that it is it's it's people just die


---------35:23----------
it's just [ __ ] up


---------35:24----------
when people are dying what goes through


---------35:28----------
your head


---------35:29----------
the same thing goes through everyone's


---------35:30----------
head for every other thing in the world


---------35:32----------
not gonna happen to me


---------35:33----------
i'm careful right that's the story of


---------35:37----------
everyone's life


---------35:37----------
i think for every situation right


---------35:41----------
look at kobit right koben corbin norma's


---------35:43----------
mask not gonna happen to me right and


---------35:44----------
then suddenly their family member gets


---------35:46----------
it and now they want to be


---------35:47----------
you know they want to start taking


---------35:48----------
precautions right did and did anyone


---------35:50----------
around you think you had a


---------35:52----------
problem or tried to talk to you about


---------35:54----------
like did your parents know


---------35:59----------
i think they i don't know i had it from


---------36:01----------
them for a while


---------36:04----------
i finally told them and they helped me


---------36:06----------
and


---------36:09----------
yeah no they didn't know


---------36:14----------
cause i wasn't home much yeah


---------36:17----------
did anyone kind of express concern about


---------36:20----------
what you were oh every day


---------36:22----------
oh my my parents are expressed concern


---------36:23----------
every day but


---------36:25----------
they didn't know what was going on but


---------36:26----------
they knew there was something up


---------36:28----------
persian parents typically [ __ ] what and


---------36:31----------
what did what would they say


---------36:37----------
typical persian parent kid stuff


---------36:40----------
like what what what is that i don't know


---------36:44----------
for me it's all just melded into


---------36:47----------
typical i'm sure you can imagine yeah


---------36:50----------
i'm sure you can


---------36:51----------
well i mean so


---------36:54----------
i mean my story is like quite different


---------36:56----------
because


---------36:57----------
i wasn't using any drugs in college yeah


---------37:00----------
well i was referring to like like if


---------37:02----------
if you didn't do your homework if you or


---------37:03----------
if you had homework like whatever they


---------37:05----------
bicker at you there


---------37:06----------
take that exact line and throw it at


---------37:08----------
this well yeah so i mean the thing with


---------37:10----------
me is that i was failing out of college


---------37:12----------
though right so it sounds like you were


---------37:13----------
your drugs but absolutely bro dude after


---------37:17----------
after two years of college i had less


---------37:18----------
than a 2.0 gpa


---------37:22----------
well you gotta get into those uh groups


---------37:24----------
i this little secret society in college


---------37:26----------
right


---------37:26----------
there's like look there's this group


---------37:28----------
[ __ ] charged like 25 bucks per


---------37:29----------
class they'd give you


---------37:30----------
these guys had the [ __ ] intel right


---------37:33----------
they knew all the five credit courses


---------37:35----------
where the teacher didn't give a [ __ ]


---------37:37----------
right and if you get an a plus that's a


---------37:40----------
4.3


---------37:40----------
in a five credit course that's a huge


---------37:42----------
gpa boost right that's a huge pad


---------37:44----------
so you take a couple of those you know


---------37:48----------
boost you know the 2.0 2.5 to a 3.2 3.3


---------37:52----------
you know take a couple more of them you


---------37:54----------
know you end up graduating you know


---------37:55----------
whatever the [ __ ] cumulates


---------37:57----------
what the [ __ ] those are yeah i mean


---------38:00----------
first of all i didn't i didn't know


---------38:01----------
about that but secondly i mean my gpa


---------38:04----------
was pretty wrecked man like when you've


---------38:05----------
got


---------38:06----------
you know a string of 0.00 like when you


---------38:09----------
got a string of f's


---------38:11----------
on your transcript it's it's hard to i


---------38:13----------
mean i i sort of


---------38:14----------
i ended up graduating with like a 2.5


---------38:16----------
like


---------38:18----------
and that was busting my ass for three


---------38:20----------
years


---------38:21----------
didn't your school have the thing where


---------38:22----------
like like up to 12 credits they forgive


---------38:25----------
i mean it still shows in the transcript


---------38:26----------
but it shows that it counts the second


---------38:28----------
grade great


---------38:30----------
second grade if they did train i was so


---------38:32----------
disorganized that i didn't apply for it


---------38:36----------
i think it's yeah i think it's automatic


---------38:38----------
that well i mean it may be


---------38:40----------
it may have been something that they


---------38:42----------
instituted later


---------38:43----------
but like i went to college back in like


---------38:45----------
2000 like i started college in like


---------38:48----------
2001.


---------38:49----------
oh wow how did you get their horses


---------38:53----------
uh we would walk through the snow my


---------38:54----------
dude horses were too high-tech


---------38:58----------
yeah figured you know back when it


---------39:01----------
snowed in austin all the time


---------39:02----------
unlike this past week it just snowed two


---------39:04----------
days ago yeah insane i've been hearing


---------39:06----------
about it from everyone under the sun


---------39:08----------
yeah you know what's crazy though uh


---------39:11----------
before you


---------39:11----------
go off on those tangent um or whatever


---------39:14----------
anyways


---------39:15----------
what's crazy is uh in all of that


---------39:18----------
right now everything we talked about


---------39:19----------
there actually was a moment right where


---------39:21----------
i was


---------39:22----------
off the rails i remember it was


---------39:26----------
senior year right it was all done i was


---------39:29----------
graduating


---------39:30----------
i was working in a bar right it was the


---------39:32----------
hottest bar in


---------39:34----------
in the entire state of arizona right in


---------39:36----------
scottsdale town


---------39:38----------
and i was doing some crazy [ __ ]


---------39:42----------
like i was mixing we're talking


---------39:45----------
heroin xanax


---------39:48----------
drinking steroids like we're talking


---------39:51----------
four different things


---------39:53----------
hardcore and at this time


---------39:57----------
just to jump in train like seriously if


---------39:58----------
anyone there is watching that [ __ ] will


---------40:00----------
kill you


---------40:01----------
oh 100 i will and i'll tell you yeah


---------40:04----------
i'll tell you in a second what happened


---------40:06----------
at the time i wasn't very i wasn't too


---------40:07----------
serious about my bipolar


---------40:10----------
right and there's a huge thing that


---------40:11----------
happens with steroids and bipolar


---------40:13----------
i guess any of those drugs realistically


---------40:17----------
all of that all that mixing and [ __ ]


---------40:20----------
around i ended up having a psychotic


---------40:22----------
break


---------40:23----------
it was called acute psychosis it was a


---------40:24----------
temporary psychosis for two and a half


---------40:26----------
months


---------40:28----------
i remember my parents found me in the


---------40:29----------
living room banging and controller in my


---------40:31----------
head the remote control for the tv


---------40:34----------
and i was jibbering some [ __ ] i was


---------40:37----------
whatever saying some


---------40:38----------
whispering some [ __ ] like a [ __ ] cult


---------40:40----------
cult leader


---------40:42----------
man that psychotic break


---------40:45----------
you want to talk about hell [ __ ]


---------40:50----------
my entire like the best way i can


---------40:52----------
explain this


---------40:53----------
like in in short


---------40:59----------
there's a moment when you're kind of


---------41:01----------
like lucid dreaming asleep but like


---------41:04----------
you don't actually know that you're


---------41:05----------
asleep yet right


---------41:07----------
you think you're actually awake and this


---------41:10----------
is your real world right


---------41:11----------
there's a moment where you're in a


---------41:13----------
nightmare and in like at the precipice


---------41:15----------
of the nightmare


---------41:16----------
there is this just pure feeling of


---------41:19----------
terror


---------41:20----------
and evil in the pit of your stomach


---------41:22----------
right you just want to escape


---------41:24----------
you want to run you're praying that this


---------41:26----------
is a dream you want to wake up


---------41:28----------
that moment or literally when you


---------41:30----------
finally do wake up and


---------41:31----------
it kind of just like you know kind of


---------41:34----------
whatever the you know i'm trying to word


---------41:36----------
it


---------41:38----------
it slowly kind of dissipates right that


---------41:42----------
feeling was my it was my


---------41:47----------
state of mind it was my constant state


---------41:49----------
of mind for two and a half months


---------41:52----------
and all i was hoping for was one day


---------41:54----------
would i wake up did i


---------41:55----------
[ __ ] up is this permanent you know like


---------41:58----------
it was


---------41:59----------
it was hell it was sounds terrifying


---------42:02----------
i get goosebumps talking about it to


---------42:04----------
this day i was in


---------42:06----------
this two and a half month nightmare


---------42:10----------
where no matter what i did who i talked


---------42:13----------
to


---------42:14----------
where i was it was


---------42:17----------
like i'm about to cry it was scary it


---------42:20----------
was some [ __ ] up [ __ ] and the thoughts


---------42:22----------
i had


---------42:24----------
man some [ __ ] out of one of those


---------42:27----------
[ __ ] uh tarantino movies


---------42:29----------
and all of it to myself to others like


---------42:31----------
just some [ __ ] up [ __ ]


---------42:33----------
twisted [ __ ] like i was just


---------42:36----------
that was an insane two and a half months


---------42:38----------
of my life i


---------42:40----------
i don't think there was any hallucinogen


---------42:42----------
psychedelic any any none of that stuff


---------42:44----------
that has ever gotten me as close to


---------42:46----------
myself


---------42:46----------
as those two and a half months the


---------42:49----------
amount i learned


---------42:51----------
because those like those those


---------42:55----------
those those


---------43:00----------
locked chests lock deep deep into the


---------43:03----------
abyss of your mind are


---------43:04----------
rarely rarely even like gotten close to


---------43:08----------
you know in like self-reflection and


---------43:10----------
self-discovery and like looking inward


---------43:12----------
right and in that state of mind


---------43:16----------
all of them were like at my disposal i


---------43:18----------
was so deep


---------43:19----------
and so and i was in the darkest crevices


---------43:22----------
and all of them were unlocking like


---------43:24----------
just it was just some crazy [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------43:26----------
i can't even explain to you


---------43:28----------
it was some insane [ __ ] like it was just


---------43:30----------
[ __ ] that was some crazy


---------43:32----------
crazy [ __ ] i came back so hey


---------43:36----------
yeah you know train i i think it's


---------43:39----------
certainly


---------43:40----------
you know what you're describing i think


---------43:42----------
sometimes people don't


---------43:44----------
realize that hallucinogens and psychosis


---------43:47----------
and even meditation share some amount of


---------43:50----------
like common


---------43:52----------
aspects like if you look at the


---------43:53----------
neuroscience of it and how it affects


---------43:54----------
your brain


---------43:56----------
um but psychosis and hallucin and


---------43:58----------
hallucinogens are quite different


---------44:01----------
there is like yeah yeah i know i was


---------44:04----------
i was making a reference to it yeah


---------44:08----------
um and and so i'm really sorry you went


---------44:10----------
through that man that sounds


---------44:12----------
you know i can't imagine


---------44:15----------
i've had some scary experiences in


---------44:17----------
meditation but they they tend to last


---------44:19----------
at most 24 hours i don't think i've ever


---------44:22----------
had a negative experience that's lasted


---------44:25----------
longer than 24 hours


---------44:29----------
but for two and a half months to kind of


---------44:30----------
be trapped in that place i can imagine


---------44:32----------
it feels like quite hopeless and


---------44:34----------
traumatic


---------44:36----------
have you ever had your ear plugged


---------44:39----------
like your ears plugged like in a plane


---------44:41----------
your ears get plugged yeah yeah


---------44:44----------
have you ever tried a yawn and sometimes


---------44:45----------
it doesn't unclog


---------44:47----------
right that feeling where you yawn and it


---------44:50----------
doesn't


---------44:51----------
pop that was the feeling i had every


---------44:53----------
morning waking up


---------44:54----------
every morning when i woke up i was


---------44:56----------
hoping i'd open my eyes like that moment


---------44:57----------
where i kind of gained consciousness but


---------44:59----------
i'm not awake i was going to open my


---------45:00----------
eyes and i'd


---------45:01----------
look around and i was back to me yep


---------45:04----------
and that was that feeling that feeling


---------45:06----------
where you open your mouth


---------45:07----------
and it doesn't pop like that that


---------45:10----------
feeling you have that like you can't get


---------45:11----------
it to pop and there's no other way to


---------45:12----------
get it to pop and you're stuck in this


---------45:14----------
way until finally what somehow it pops


---------45:15----------
by itself


---------45:16----------
that's the feeling i had every day


---------45:18----------
trying to get back to me and hoping i'd


---------45:20----------
come back to me


---------45:20----------
and that was two and a half months it


---------45:21----------
was [ __ ] crazy it was insane


---------45:24----------
yeah i mean it sounds like you know you


---------45:26----------
know that


---------45:27----------
it's not your normal existence yeah i


---------45:30----------
was aware i was conscious


---------45:31----------
you can't get back there yeah and you're


---------45:34----------
wondering am i ever gonna be


---------45:36----------
normal again that's the scary part about


---------45:38----------
it right like if i was like ignorant to


---------45:39----------
it


---------45:40----------
and i just kind of pride myself and i


---------45:42----------
went brain you know whatever the hell


---------45:43----------
right


---------45:44----------
like i'm sure that'd be shitty and


---------45:46----------
[ __ ] up probably more so for those


---------45:47----------
around me


---------45:48----------
but i myself wouldn't know but being


---------45:51----------
hyper aware of the situation and being


---------45:53----------
trapped within myself


---------45:54----------
knowing that it's not me but being stuck


---------45:56----------
in this thing where i know how i should


---------45:59----------
feel


---------46:00----------
but what i do feel is this terror and


---------46:02----------
there's nothing i can do to make it go


---------46:03----------
away it's just this it's this terrible


---------46:05----------
terrible thing


---------46:08----------
and so um it sounds like you got


---------46:11----------
treatment at some point the psychotic


---------46:14----------
break i did


---------46:15----------
i went to the hospital and stuff and


---------46:18----------
yeah and then i ended up seeing a


---------46:19----------
psychiatrist psychiat i'mma give it a


---------46:21----------
buck 50 with you you're the best


---------46:23----------
psychiatrist i've ever


---------46:24----------
see you know obviously we're doing this


---------46:25----------
this isn't an actual session but you're


---------46:27----------
the best psychiatrist


---------46:28----------
i've ever seen in my entire life i've


---------46:29----------
been to hundreds


---------46:31----------
okay of psychiatrists and psychologists


---------46:34----------
every


---------46:34----------
no joke no exagger i know i exaggerate a


---------46:36----------
[ __ ] ton this one thing i'm not


---------46:37----------
exaggerating every psychiatrist i have


---------46:39----------
seen


---------46:40----------
i walk into the office okay because


---------46:42----------
they're all from referral


---------46:43----------
the ones i saw i couldn't just see i had


---------46:45----------
to go through you know and i get a


---------46:46----------
referral


---------46:46----------
to them i'd walk in


---------46:50----------
no eye contact you know sitting there


---------46:54----------
already writing a prescription right no


---------46:57----------
[ __ ] given of the context of what's


---------46:58----------
going on just kind of assuming the worst


---------47:00----------
right


---------47:01----------
you know ask me a question i try to give


---------47:04----------
him context just the typical


---------47:05----------
condescending patronizing


---------47:09----------
all right tyler you're going to take


---------47:10----------
this and this and this and then leave it


---------47:11----------
to me right it's like no shot


---------47:14----------
none of them listened none of them gave


---------47:16----------
a [ __ ] right like there's a big


---------47:17----------
difference between


---------47:18----------
you know an in you know an induced


---------47:20----------
psychotic break versus


---------47:21----------
you know some hereditary natural


---------47:24----------
occurrence of one right like there's a


---------47:25----------
difference but they didn't give a [ __ ]


---------47:27----------
about that right


---------47:27----------
they didn't care that mine was induced


---------47:29----------
through steroid usage and drug usage


---------47:31----------
right so like it was just this all of


---------47:33----------
them to all of them and these are like


---------47:35----------
top-rated psychiatrists they just didn't


---------47:36----------
give a [ __ ]


---------47:37----------
psychologist on their hand i loved right


---------47:39----------
i mean it took me it took me a long time


---------47:41----------
you know and i hear this this is common


---------47:42----------
between a lot of people and i think this


---------47:44----------
will actually help people


---------47:46----------
you know if you feel like your


---------47:47----------
psychologist doesn't you know connect


---------47:49----------
with you


---------47:50----------
listen keep moving around keep keep


---------47:53----------
keep testing out new ones you know


---------47:55----------
eventually you'll find one that's on


---------47:56----------
your wavelength right that understands


---------47:57----------
you you know there's some that


---------47:59----------
are very uh like what's what i'm trying


---------48:02----------
like


---------48:03----------
like mathematical they're very like


---------48:04----------
precise rational right like


---------48:06----------
there is no feeling and you know they


---------48:09----------
don't understand the irrationalness


---------48:10----------
right


---------48:10----------
and and i can't vibe with that kind of


---------48:12----------
person right i can't do it


---------48:14----------
so i have to find someone that's on my


---------48:15----------
wavelength understands my feelings my


---------48:17----------
impulses


---------48:18----------
no matter how irrational they are


---------48:20----------
understands them on that level


---------48:21----------
and it took me [ __ ] i probably it took


---------48:23----------
me about six seven months to find one


---------48:25----------
person that


---------48:26----------
ended up really really uh connecting


---------48:29----------
with me and i remember


---------48:30----------
i'm gonna cry the moment i found that


---------48:34----------
person


---------48:37----------
i remember i tried to say i try to say


---------48:40----------
one word


---------48:42----------
and i just bro i cried the entire


---------48:46----------
session for the first like two weeks


---------48:48----------
every session for the first two weeks i


---------48:49----------
had three sessions a week i cried


---------48:52----------
all of them just like six sessions i


---------48:54----------
only cried


---------48:55----------
like there's nothing else said he said


---------48:57----------
okay see you next week


---------48:58----------
i i just cried for six weeks it was for


---------49:01----------
succession


---------49:02----------
it was just insane yeah it was crazy but


---------49:04----------
yeah you'll find one if you hop around


---------49:06----------
there's someone out there for you that


---------49:07----------
will understand you so definitely uh


---------49:09----------
keep trying you know don't be


---------49:10----------
unmotivated if


---------49:12----------
if if you don't find the right


---------49:13----------
psychologist in the first go


---------49:15----------
yeah train i'm really glad you're kind


---------49:17----------
of sharing that message with everyone


---------49:19----------
because i'd echo at 100


---------49:21----------
um you know i think that fit is so


---------49:24----------
important


---------49:25----------
and there are so many different styles


---------49:27----------
of of therapy and styles of therapists


---------49:30----------
and even styles of psychiatrists


---------49:32----------
and and i think that like you know what


---------49:34----------
we meant the mental health


---------49:36----------
you know clinical training is is not


---------49:38----------
precise


---------49:39----------
right you have all these different


---------49:40----------
theories and all these different


---------49:42----------
perspectives and like you've got


---------49:43----------
freudian people and jungian people


---------49:45----------
and cognitive behavioral therapists and


---------49:47----------
psychodynamic therapists and


---------49:49----------
people who are a little bit mindfulness


---------49:50----------
oriented and there's just so many


---------49:52----------
different flavors and i think really


---------49:54----------
therapy because we don't have the


---------49:55----------
instruments that the rest of medicine


---------49:57----------
does


---------49:58----------
you know when you've got ct scans and


---------50:01----------
and blood tests and


---------50:02----------
and you know covet nasal swabs and


---------50:04----------
things like that there's a lot of


---------50:05----------
precision


---------50:06----------
about how to handle things right and how


---------50:08----------
to do things you know what's right and


---------50:09----------
what isn't


---------50:11----------
yeah whereas my experience in in therapy


---------50:13----------
has been that it's it's really


---------50:14----------
more or just as much art as it is


---------50:16----------
science there's a lot of science to it


---------50:18----------
but


---------50:19----------
you know we don't there it's interesting


---------50:21----------
there have been studies done where


---------50:22----------
people will try to classify like


---------50:24----------
characteristics of patients and classify


---------50:28----------
characteristics of of therapists


---------50:31----------
and they'll try to match them based on


---------50:33----------
using data


---------50:34----------
and it turns out that that doesn't work


---------50:38----------
you know you can try to do as much data


---------50:39----------
analysis as you want to you can say oh


---------50:41----------
like train has


---------50:42----------
a history of addictions and this therap


---------50:44----------
this therapist has a lot of experience


---------50:45----------
with addictions


---------50:46----------
maybe they'll be a good match turns out


---------50:48----------
that you can't really it just doesn't


---------50:49----------
work


---------50:50----------
can't match people um yep there's no uh


---------50:54----------
there's no formula well people haven't


---------50:56----------
figured it out yet i think that there's


---------50:58----------
still a formula out there


---------50:59----------
but you know we just haven't we don't


---------51:01----------
have the precision we haven't been able


---------51:03----------
to capture that


---------51:04----------
that secret sauce that allows you to see


---------51:06----------
therapists for six months


---------51:08----------
and and see this next person and then


---------51:10----------
like really open up to them for two


---------51:12----------
weeks and also for that therapist to


---------51:14----------
know how to respond to you opening up


---------51:17----------
for them to understand that you know


---------51:20----------
these tears have been built up


---------51:22----------
and the dam is opening up and that like


---------51:24----------
we got to just let them out


---------51:27----------
thank you so much for sharing your


---------51:29----------
perspective i think um


---------51:30----------
thank you no problem i actually uh after


---------51:34----------
i stopped using uh


---------51:35----------
drugs or hard drugs like that like


---------51:36----------
heroin and stuff like that like meth


---------51:38----------
after i stopped like entirely


---------51:40----------
i actually went back and helped some of


---------51:41----------
my old friends that were addicted and


---------51:43----------
you know obviously i tried to get them


---------51:45----------
to a psychologist you know after i


---------51:47----------
finally got them out of denial heroin


---------51:49----------
denial is one of those


---------51:50----------
it's like i don't i don't give a [ __ ]


---------51:53----------
like i don't


---------51:54----------
i've seen gambling denial i've seen


---------51:56----------
every drug denial heroin denial


---------51:58----------
is so frustrating


---------52:02----------
it just if they don't want it it's not


---------52:05----------
going to happen


---------52:05----------
you could put them you could force them


---------52:07----------
i've seen parents do it you could force


---------52:08----------
them two years of rehab


---------52:09----------
the moment they come out they might be


---------52:11----------
good for a week you better bet your ass


---------52:13----------
the first difficult thing that they face


---------52:15----------
they can't handle and they go right back


---------52:16----------
to it you have to


---------52:18----------
you have to want it what's up how did


---------52:20----------
you come out of your denial


---------52:23----------
well i wanted to


---------52:26----------
right like that's the difference like so


---------52:29----------
there's one thing that i had that helped


---------52:31----------
me a lot in that


---------52:34----------
and it's what i talked about earlier i


---------52:37----------
kind of have this


---------52:39----------
so my anchor


---------52:42----------
it's a dream it's an idea it's highly


---------52:46----------
improbable but not impossible and that's


---------52:49----------
my


---------52:50----------
anchor in life and i've taken that and


---------52:53----------
i've


---------52:53----------
buried it deep deep deep within me where


---------52:56----------
i can never be taken away you know


---------52:57----------
unless i'm killed


---------52:59----------
and that is what got me out of it


---------53:03----------
it's to achieve that to get that like


---------53:06----------
the wanting of that the


---------53:07----------
feeling that that gave me you know


---------53:10----------
it but was that always there yeah it was


---------53:14----------
it's been there since i can remember so


---------53:17----------
i'm going to


---------53:17----------
express a little bit of skepticism just


---------53:19----------
because i want to kind of push you on


---------53:21----------
this


---------53:21----------
and because i i'm sure that you'll have


---------53:23----------
the answer but i think it's important to


---------53:24----------
find because


---------53:25----------
like here's here's what i'm thinking


---------53:27----------
okay so the dream was always deep within


---------53:29----------
you


---------53:30----------
and then there's this period of time in


---------53:31----------
college where despite the dream


---------53:33----------
and then when i asked you how did you


---------53:34----------
get out of it you said well i started


---------53:36----------
wanting my dream


---------53:38----------
but then at the same time like i don't


---------53:40----------
see how that's different from when you


---------53:42----------
were in college


---------53:43----------
and you were using and finding that


---------53:45----------
balance and you the dream was always


---------53:47----------
there


---------53:48----------
so still like how did you move from like


---------53:50----------
where you were in college to like


---------53:52----------
wanting to quit i understand that you


---------53:54----------
say that you have to want to so then the


---------53:56----------
question


---------53:57----------
kind of i i ask sort of as a clinician


---------53:59----------
and i ask like theoretically and also


---------54:01----------
like educationally


---------54:02----------
is how does what was your journey to


---------54:05----------
change your wants


---------54:06----------
to value that over the heroin or other


---------54:10----------
things like


---------54:10----------
like how did you come out of the denial


---------54:13----------
i get that that's the anchor that was


---------54:15----------
your north star but like


---------54:17----------
why did you start caring about moving


---------54:19----------
towards the north star to begin with


---------54:22----------
um i think


---------54:24----------
it's


---------54:29----------
i i you know i've never really thought


---------54:32----------
about that but if i were to


---------54:33----------
try to think about it right now on the


---------54:35----------
spot and kind of give you a quick thing


---------54:37----------
i'd have to reflect on it a lot more to


---------54:38----------
give you an actual accurate answer but


---------54:40----------
if i were to guess right now


---------54:42----------
i would say it's how i was raised i


---------54:44----------
would say it's my parents it's the love


---------54:46----------
they kind of instilled within me


---------54:47----------
um you know they kind of taught me like


---------54:49----------
they gave me a self-worth that they gave


---------54:50----------
me you know like


---------54:52----------
i think that that's what it is because i


---------54:53----------
remember all the times that i stopped


---------54:56----------
it wasn't this thing where i planned it


---------54:57----------
okay i'm gonna do this for four days


---------54:59----------
because i have four days


---------55:00----------
right that's not how i went down i did


---------55:02----------
it day one i didn't think of the next


---------55:03----------
day


---------55:04----------
right and then each of these times


---------55:07----------
every time it never failed i'd wake up


---------55:10----------
randomly after day six or day five or


---------55:12----------
day seven or day four


---------55:14----------
i'm like what the [ __ ] am i doing right


---------55:16----------
like


---------55:17----------
it's like it was never me to begin with


---------55:19----------
i'd be like what the [ __ ] am i doing


---------55:22----------
and that one realization where the other


---------55:24----------
me kind of wakes up


---------55:25----------
right i don't know if we want to go as


---------55:27----------
deep as saying maybe it's the bipolar


---------55:28----------
split personality


---------55:29----------
i don't know but the other way like what


---------55:31----------
the [ __ ] going on here right


---------55:33----------
and that me would always come out


---------55:36----------
after the aftermath of me


---------55:39----------
[ __ ] my body and my body was weak and


---------55:41----------
i think like that weakness


---------55:43----------
allowed the other me to come out i don't


---------55:44----------
know i don't know it sounds like it's


---------55:45----------
some crazy talk i know it does but like


---------55:47----------
that was that was how it was done every


---------55:49----------
time okay cool yeah so that's what


---------55:51----------
happened every time


---------55:53----------
so so then but let me ask you another


---------55:54----------
question then i'm gonna keep pushing you


---------55:56----------
okay and and it's because i like i think


---------55:58----------
you're you're getting there


---------56:00----------
or i think this is like valuable because


---------56:01----------
i think this is this is the question


---------56:02----------
that everyone asks right train is like


---------56:04----------
how how did you quit


---------56:07----------
and what i'm gonna press you on now is


---------56:10----------
that like okay so you'd wake up you'd be


---------56:11----------
weak in your body


---------56:12----------
like you'd say like what the [ __ ] am i


---------56:14----------
doing and then like


---------56:16----------
the this like sort of this train that


---------56:18----------
was built up through


---------56:20----------
the love of your parents and like this


---------56:22----------
self-respect and things like that


---------56:24----------
basically like


---------56:25----------
shown through right it's almost like you


---------56:28----------
have cloudy skies and the sun's


---------56:29----------
always there and sometimes the clouds


---------56:32----------
part and you get this like ray of


---------56:33----------
sunshine so like after six days of a


---------56:35----------
bender


---------56:36----------
you get that ray of sunshine where


---------56:37----------
you're kind of like but then what


---------56:39----------
happens is the clouds always come back


---------56:40----------
right because then a month later two


---------56:42----------
months later three months later you


---------56:44----------
start using again


---------56:45----------
so what changed what what changed so


---------56:48----------
that


---------56:48----------
the awareness the awareness of it so


---------56:51----------
i'll tell you what i mean by that


---------56:53----------
what changed is


---------56:58----------
i've always so be you know


---------57:02----------
forgot what the [ __ ] it's called i think


---------57:03----------
it's called like hyper like


---------57:05----------
it's having bipolar and split


---------57:07----------
personality


---------57:08----------
you can have a version of it where


---------57:10----------
you're not aware and there's a version


---------57:11----------
or you're hyper aware


---------57:13----------
but you can't do anything about it still


---------57:14----------
right that's kind of been me in every


---------57:16----------
aspect of my life


---------57:17----------
so because of my hyper awareness


---------57:21----------
of the situation right like i understood


---------57:24----------
what the it's like i think i got lucky


---------57:27----------
and


---------57:27----------
my overthinking or i don't know what it


---------57:30----------
was i'm not sure what it was but


---------57:31----------
here's the point everyone says not even


---------57:35----------
once


---------57:35----------
everyone says this is addicting right


---------57:39----------
and because of my you know ability to go


---------57:41----------
on and off my because i you know


---------57:44----------
i never really got like that the urge


---------57:46----------
was never to do the


---------57:47----------
heroin the only urge i ever had was


---------57:49----------
maybe the withdrawals were [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------57:51----------
i wanted i didn't want to deal with them


---------57:52----------
today right but it was never the actual


---------57:54----------
heroine but i realized


---------57:56----------
a little bit later on what did not even


---------57:59----------
once meant i realized what the addiction


---------58:02----------
is


---------58:02----------
the addiction is what you just said


---------58:04----------
where the clouds come back


---------58:05----------
now what i've done is i've normalized


---------58:07----------
the new baseline


---------58:09----------
for my sorrows and for my escape right


---------58:12----------
for a lot of people that baseline is


---------58:14----------
alcohol it's weed


---------58:16----------
and that's it that's where they go


---------58:17----------
everything else is scary it's a no-no


---------58:20----------
but once you open up the realm and you


---------58:22----------
realize


---------58:23----------
holy [ __ ] i've popped this pill before


---------58:25----------
this feels the same this isn't that


---------58:26----------
scary thing on the commercial which it


---------58:27----------
is by the way


---------58:29----------
right once you do that that is your new


---------58:31----------
baseline so the next time that i


---------58:33----------
feel sad depressed and [ __ ] up with


---------58:36----------
nothing


---------58:36----------
going for me i'm not gonna think i'm


---------58:38----------
gonna have a drink i'm gonna think hey


---------58:39----------
where can i buy some heroin right


---------58:41----------
and i realized that is the lifelong


---------58:42----------
addiction


---------58:44----------
of the drug because it is now the


---------58:46----------
normalized new baseline for me


---------58:48----------
and once i realized that i understood


---------58:51----------
like that's kind of like that was like


---------58:52----------
half the part with it


---------58:54----------
i realized like it just needs to stop it


---------58:55----------
needs to be done otherwise


---------58:58----------
how did you realize it


---------59:06----------
i mean i this is gonna sound crazy but


---------59:18----------
this is a different i guess this is a


---------59:20----------
different talk i guess that this would


---------59:21----------
go into the bipolar split personality


---------59:23----------
ocd part of it all but


---------59:27----------
so every three to four months i'll wake


---------59:31----------
up


---------59:33----------
and i'll literally like


---------59:36----------
a whole new style whole new taste of


---------59:39----------
food


---------59:40----------
different body composition everything


---------59:43----------
different


---------59:44----------
everything you can think of favorite


---------59:45----------
color different what i'm into


---------59:48----------
right am i you know my poor girlfriend


---------59:50----------
you know i i feel so that she's such a


---------59:51----------
good girl she's such an amazing person


---------59:53----------
but she has to kind of deal with it but


---------59:56----------
i just get uninterested and


---------59:58----------
you know i i change completely like i'm


---------60:00----------
talking full body composition change


---------60:02----------
right like i'm talking like


---------60:04----------
from you know just normal body to like


---------60:06----------
everything tight athletic like it's it's


---------60:08----------
weird it's weird i don't understand it


---------60:10----------
i've been explaining to it 100 times


---------60:12----------
just wake up some days and you're ripped


---------60:14----------
no no no it's no


---------60:15----------
it's like every four months five months


---------60:17----------
that's like the cycle no i'm not ripped


---------60:18----------
but it's just like things are tighter


---------60:20----------
okay and my body composition is


---------60:22----------
different like tension


---------60:23----------
what the way i taste the way i smell


---------60:26----------
everything's different


---------60:26----------
okay i think


---------60:31----------
like i don't know how to answer how did


---------60:34----------
i know


---------60:34----------
i think that i i i i just kind of woke


---------60:38----------
up i'm like


---------60:38----------
what am i doing this is not this is


---------60:40----------
disgusting i just there was


---------60:41----------
there was a side of me i did not [ __ ]


---------60:43----------
with it it was it was it was a shame


---------60:45----------
right like and and that's that's that's


---------60:47----------
been the lifelong


---------60:49----------
[ __ ] it's been the curse of my [ __ ]


---------60:51----------
mental disease


---------60:53----------
i sit there for so long working


---------60:56----------
progressing


---------60:57----------
building on myself and then one day i


---------60:59----------
wake up


---------61:01----------
and i black out for like three months


---------61:03----------
and that three month me


---------61:05----------
ruins everything toss my money out don't


---------61:08----------
give a [ __ ]


---------61:08----------
go party [ __ ] my body up stop the gym


---------61:11----------
gamble everything away


---------61:12----------
i don't care and then i wake up again


---------61:14----------
right


---------61:15----------
three months after that not remembering


---------61:18----------
a [ __ ] thing


---------61:18----------
everything gone and i'm disgusted right


---------61:20----------
because that like there's


---------61:22----------
does that make any sense it's some crazy


---------61:24----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] that i can relate to


---------61:26----------
oddly enough i mean i i think for me it


---------61:28----------
was it was more with gaming but you know


---------61:30----------
in my first couple years of college and


---------61:32----------
even high school it was like


---------61:35----------
you know i disappear so start of the


---------61:37----------
semester this semester is going to be


---------61:38----------
different


---------61:40----------
right i'm going to study hard for the


---------61:42----------
first week i do fantastic


---------61:44----------
first weekend rolls around start playing


---------61:47----------
games


---------61:48----------
you know sunday night saturday night i


---------61:51----------
stay up super late


---------61:52----------
wake up late on sunday sunday night i


---------61:54----------
stay up super late


---------61:56----------
miss my class on monday ah [ __ ] it i


---------61:59----------
missed one class i can afford to miss a


---------62:01----------
class


---------62:02----------
skip the rest of my classes on monday


---------62:04----------
game tuesday rolls around


---------62:07----------
yep i did that too classic excuses i


---------62:09----------
like that


---------62:11----------
and then you know it's like now that


---------62:14----------
i've missed one class like i'll start


---------62:15----------
off it'll be better tomorrow it'll be


---------62:17----------
better tomorrow


---------62:18----------
and then like that's that doubt starts


---------62:20----------
creeping up at least for me i knew


---------62:22----------
i was making mistakes i was like it's


---------62:23----------
happening again


---------62:25----------
it's happening again and i'd be like


---------62:27----------
well well


---------62:29----------
that shows itself through like anxiety


---------62:31----------
depression like that


---------62:32----------
that's what it comes out as from your


---------62:34----------
subconscious right yeah so so so it


---------62:36----------
would start to come out from my


---------62:37----------
subconscious and i would say i'm doing


---------62:39----------
it again and i'd


---------62:40----------
snap the door closed on it i want


---------62:44----------
i definitely wanted that a lot myself


---------62:45----------
too yeah that's happened to me quite a


---------62:46----------
bit


---------62:47----------
and and then like anything to keep it


---------62:50----------
from coming out of the subconscious


---------62:51----------
so then i got to play more and more and


---------62:53----------
more and more and more


---------62:55----------
and then i found myself spiraling and i


---------62:56----------
knew i was [ __ ] up my life i think


---------62:58----------
the really interesting thing


---------63:01----------
is you know train i i know it sounds


---------63:04----------
like you're not making sense but this is


---------63:05----------
the story that i hear


---------63:06----------
over and over and over again this is why


---------63:09----------
addictions is so hard because i i think


---------63:11----------
at the end of the day like there are a


---------63:12----------
couple of questions that have been


---------63:14----------
bouncing around in my mind there are


---------63:16----------
going to be people watching


---------63:17----------
right now who may be where you were


---------63:21----------
in the middle of college where you


---------63:23----------
thought you were different you thought


---------63:25----------
you could handle it


---------63:26----------
and what i'm trying to figure out is


---------63:28----------
like what can we explore


---------63:30----------
in today's like discussion


---------63:33----------
that will help that person i got it i


---------63:35----------
got it yeah i got it cool


---------63:36----------
i got it now i got i i i know what


---------63:38----------
you're asking now okay so here is the


---------63:40----------
moment here's how


---------63:42----------
i realize it needs to stop here's how


---------63:46----------
i realized it needs to be done somewhere


---------63:49----------
so i actually wrote this thesis


---------63:53----------
um and


---------63:57----------
it was it was a very informal one um it


---------63:59----------
was kind of i was [ __ ] around i


---------64:01----------
shouldn't even call it a thesis i just


---------64:02----------
call it a paper


---------64:04----------
um delusions of grandeur and [ __ ] like


---------64:06----------
that call it what a nice train called


---------64:08----------
thesis and i i feel like that there's


---------64:11----------
this you know


---------64:12----------
obviously you know i don't have the


---------64:14----------
stats to back it but you know just just


---------64:15----------
from


---------64:16----------
you know it's anecdotal just say it


---------64:18----------
train i thought i feel like there's this


---------64:19----------
this age category from like


---------64:21----------
18 to like 24 where


---------64:24----------
we are as men at least suffering from


---------64:28----------
the most


---------64:28----------
just like the deepest denial delusions


---------64:31----------
of grandeur like we are


---------64:33----------
different and every justification like


---------64:35----------
that we can like


---------64:36----------
just everything that can like some crazy


---------64:38----------
[ __ ] like that


---------64:39----------
the point that allowed me to understand


---------64:41----------
and stop


---------64:43----------
is somewhere in the psychotic break


---------64:46----------
which i guess isn't


---------64:47----------
something you want to hear but like


---------64:49----------
someone on the scottish break


---------64:51----------
i realized i wasn't different i realized


---------64:55----------
that i was the the same as everyone


---------64:58----------
and


---------65:02----------
that's it like i literally i just


---------65:05----------
realized i was not


---------65:07----------
different i was not special there wasn't


---------65:08----------
this mystical force


---------65:10----------
guarding me and watching over me that


---------65:12----------
you know when i would survive a car


---------65:14----------
crash and i said someone's watch there's


---------65:15----------
a purpose right


---------65:16----------
that's all [ __ ] right like i mean


---------65:18----------
knock on wood you know god forbid maybe


---------65:20----------
there was someone but like


---------65:21----------
it doesn't tie into that right like or


---------65:24----------
how i passed this exam or how i did this


---------65:26----------
or how i guessed on this and that got it


---------65:27----------
right right


---------65:28----------
i just realized i was the same as others


---------65:29----------
when i realized that


---------65:31----------
i realized that this


---------65:34----------
rationalization i guess you shouldn't


---------65:36----------
call it that but this justification i


---------65:37----------
was making it


---------65:38----------
this excuse i was giving myself that i


---------65:39----------
can control this


---------65:42----------
is wrong because this can't be


---------65:45----------
controlled


---------65:46----------
and then that's kind of what led me down


---------65:47----------
that path i think was the discovery and


---------65:49----------
understanding that i am not different


---------65:51----------
right like you know your parents are


---------65:52----------
going to tell you that every day like


---------65:53----------
and maybe in different


---------65:54----------
different fields you are maybe in soccer


---------65:56----------
you're better than you know the one


---------65:57----------
percent right and you're great


---------65:59----------
right but i'm talking like you know


---------66:02----------
foundationally as a human


---------66:04----------
being right like i think the the most


---------66:06----------
common thing i've seen


---------66:07----------
from my friends is i can read people


---------66:09----------
that's the most common like delusion


---------66:11----------
and delusions of grandeur like the


---------66:12----------
denial i've seen from people who think


---------66:14----------
they're different


---------66:15----------
i can read people i know when you're


---------66:16----------
lying right but if you actually look


---------66:18----------
deeper into that


---------66:20----------
like the only reason you know someone's


---------66:21----------
lying and you can read into them is


---------66:23----------
because


---------66:23----------
you've seen traits from either things


---------66:25----------
that you've done you know


---------66:27----------
uh personality traits you have and


---------66:30----------
experiences you've lived through


---------66:31----------
uh lived through right and from that if


---------66:34----------
you're smart enough you'll realize holy


---------66:35----------
[ __ ]


---------66:36----------
i i'm not able to read him because i'm


---------66:39----------
different i'm another read them because


---------66:40----------
i am the same


---------66:42----------
right and then from there you kind of


---------66:44----------
humble


---------66:45----------
you get humble and you realize you need


---------66:46----------
to get your [ __ ] together that's kind of


---------66:48----------
what happened does that make sense


---------66:49----------
makes perfect sense yeah so good news is


---------66:52----------
that i don't think you have to have a


---------66:53----------
psychotic break to realize that


---------66:55----------
although i'm surprised that's why i want


---------66:57----------
to bring that up and i think there's a


---------66:58----------
lot of


---------66:58----------
cool stuff here train a lot that i think


---------67:01----------
needs to be


---------67:02----------
talked about can i kind of take the


---------67:03----------
reins for a second take the reins


---------67:05----------
or like can i grab ah yeah grab whatever


---------67:09----------
i'm taking yeah


---------67:15----------
let's do it okay so i'm just going to


---------67:16----------
kind of like feel free to jump in i'm


---------67:18----------
just going to sort of like think through


---------67:19----------
this because i think train you've said


---------67:20----------
so much man first of all


---------67:22----------
thank you so much for sharing all this i


---------67:24----------
think um you know i know a lot of it's


---------67:25----------
pretty heavy stuff i know a lot of it um


---------67:28----------
may seem embarrassing but i i think it's


---------67:31----------
not for me


---------67:31----------
it's been really enlightening


---------67:35----------
the first thing to understand is that


---------67:37----------
like okay so people are in denial right


---------67:39----------
that's the biggest problem it doesn't


---------67:40----------
really matter if you're talking about


---------67:42----------
addictions or other things


---------67:44----------
but people are in denial like you said


---------67:46----------
we we start off by sort of telling


---------67:47----------
ourselves


---------67:49----------
it's okay for us like we're different we


---------67:51----------
can handle it it's in balance


---------67:54----------
you know and then what happens is your


---------67:55----------
mind points to the things


---------67:57----------
that are in balance it's setting up kind


---------68:00----------
of like this kind of fake news sort of


---------68:02----------
like


---------68:03----------
situation where you're gonna point to


---------68:04----------
your gpa and you're gonna point to this


---------68:07----------
you're gonna point to that and your mind


---------68:08----------
is gonna tell you see


---------68:10----------
because of these things we're actually


---------68:12----------
fine you see those guys have their [ __ ]


---------68:14----------
together and they're using


---------68:16----------
it's going to selectively ignore on a


---------68:19----------
saturday you wake up bruised and


---------68:21----------
battered because you got into a fight


---------68:23----------
last night it's gonna gloss over that


---------68:24----------
part


---------68:25----------
it's gonna gloss over the parts where


---------68:27----------
like oh my my parents are like


---------68:29----------
you know think i have a problem or these


---------68:31----------
people it's gonna gloss over all kinds


---------68:32----------
of stuff


---------68:34----------
and that's what really denial is it's


---------68:36----------
sort of like this very selective


---------68:37----------
interpretation of your events and then


---------68:40----------
you kind of went on to


---------68:41----------
sort of say like yeah i'm i'm not sure


---------68:43----------
exactly


---------68:45----------
you use these terms like i realized


---------68:48----------
right i woke up one day and it just dot


---------68:51----------
dot and this is what makes addictions


---------68:53----------
really confusing is because when you ask


---------68:54----------
people about their journey


---------68:56----------
what they tell you is like a change in


---------68:58----------
their mind as opposed to actions


---------69:01----------
and as human beings we know how to


---------69:02----------
duplicate actions but we don't know how


---------69:04----------
to duplicate


---------69:05----------
realizations and and this is something


---------69:08----------
that in sanskrit


---------69:09----------
we talk about a lot which is that there


---------69:11----------
are two words for knowledge


---------69:13----------
one is vidya which is information and is


---------69:16----------
transmissible


---------69:17----------
and the second is nyan which is


---------69:20----------
understanding


---------69:21----------
and is subjective so vidya is objective


---------69:25----------
and nyan is subjective and as a society


---------69:28----------
generally speaking in western society or


---------69:30----------
just


---------69:30----------
globally now we value video over neon


---------69:34----------
we say that unless you can explain it to


---------69:36----------
me unless you can prove it to me


---------69:37----------
unless it is objective it does not have


---------69:40----------
value


---------69:41----------
so our our our society has evolved to


---------69:43----------
like appreciate science


---------69:45----------
over opinion right objectivity over


---------69:48----------
subjectivity


---------69:49----------
and in doing that we've lost the


---------69:51----------
subjective


---------69:52----------
we've lost because what happened in you


---------69:54----------
was not an object of change it was a


---------69:55----------
subject of change


---------69:57----------
it was in realizing right so realizing


---------70:00----------
is not


---------70:00----------
on a book information is on a book


---------70:03----------
and we value things like there was that


---------70:05----------
guy on youtube who was like


---------70:06----------
i read 300 books a day or whatever right


---------70:09----------
he talked about like reading all these


---------70:11----------
books and how like


---------70:12----------
because he's smart because he reads a


---------70:14----------
ton but the question is what do you


---------70:15----------
understand


---------70:17----------
what do you absorb how does change


---------70:18----------
happen inside you


---------70:20----------
and this is what's really challenging


---------70:21----------
about addictions if you talk to people


---------70:23----------
about their journey what they say is


---------70:24----------
i woke up one day and it was just


---------70:26----------
different


---------70:27----------
and then everyone who's struggling with


---------70:29----------
the addiction is like well what the [ __ ]


---------70:30----------
am i supposed to do with that


---------70:32----------
how do i wake up one day and be


---------70:34----------
different


---------70:36----------
and so this is where there are two


---------70:38----------
important pieces okay the first


---------70:40----------
is that i want you guys to understand


---------70:43----------
that that subconscious change


---------70:45----------
even though it it reaches a tipping


---------70:47----------
point like for train at a particular


---------70:49----------
point


---------70:49----------
that subconscious change is being built


---------70:52----------
over time


---------70:53----------
so what we hear from train is that


---------70:54----------
there's like this addictive force which


---------70:56----------
let's say like


---------70:57----------
has a strength of 58 and then there's


---------71:00----------
like the


---------71:01----------
insightful like loving train that's deep


---------71:03----------
down within him


---------71:04----------
that's got a strength of like 10. and


---------71:07----------
every time you have a bender you wake up


---------71:09----------
and then like that


---------71:09----------
that that strength of 10 sort of like


---------71:12----------
looks at your life and is like what's


---------71:13----------
going on here


---------71:14----------
and every moment you have that awareness


---------71:16----------
you level up to 12


---------71:18----------
and then you go on another bender and


---------71:20----------
then like because 58 is bigger than 12


---------71:22----------
right and then like you level up again


---------71:23----------
i have to re-clarify something yeah now


---------71:26----------
now i understand why you gave me that


---------71:28----------
example


---------71:28----------
um of you felt that so what i was


---------71:31----------
explaining to you of when i like black


---------71:33----------
out for three months and i'm different


---------71:34----------
everything


---------71:35----------
that wasn't i wasn't using drugs that


---------71:37----------
was me normal


---------71:38----------
sober right that was just my bipolar


---------71:40----------
right like that's what that was


---------71:42----------
right so four or five months does that


---------71:44----------
make sense i wasn't referring to my drug


---------71:45----------
use like this is


---------71:46----------
uh past the drug use this is what


---------71:49----------
happens to this day like right now what


---------71:50----------
happened sure sure


---------71:52----------
i think i teased that apart that you


---------71:54----------
still struggle with this because you


---------71:55----------
mentioned your girlfriend has to deal


---------71:56----------
with it and things like that so i i


---------71:57----------
think i was aware of that


---------71:59----------
yeah yeah um but i still think that this


---------72:01----------
sort of as you go through


---------72:02----------
the substance use like you're going to


---------72:04----------
have these moments where the sun shines


---------72:06----------
through


---------72:06----------
and every time that happens you level up


---------72:10----------
and eventually what happens is it one


---------72:12----------
day you wake up and then like the true


---------72:14----------
self


---------72:15----------
is it like a 59 or 60 and that's when


---------72:17----------
you start to win against the addiction


---------72:20----------
and what i see from people that i work


---------72:21----------
with with addictions is they'll kind of


---------72:23----------
say like oh i was sober for nine months


---------72:25----------
and then i


---------72:26----------
relapsed and they're filled with shame


---------72:28----------
and they're like oh i [ __ ] it up


---------72:29----------
i threw it all away right because we're


---------72:31----------
a society that values


---------72:33----------
quantifiable results it's all about


---------72:35----------
tesla's stock price


---------72:37----------
and you know where i am on the on the


---------72:39----------
latter for a particular video game


---------72:42----------
and how much money is in my bank account


---------72:44----------
it's all about numbers


---------72:45----------
and we say i threw away nine months of


---------72:47----------
sobriety but what i see with people that


---------72:49----------
i work with


---------72:50----------
is that you know you threw away nine


---------72:51----------
months of writing no big deal you


---------72:53----------
threw away nine months you don't have to


---------72:55----------
you you relapsed fine


---------72:57----------
you elapsed for like a day it doesn't


---------72:59----------
have to be like a nine-month bender


---------73:01----------
right you can still change that and


---------73:04----------
over time the duration of relapses and


---------73:07----------
the frequency of relapses


---------73:08----------
decreases as long as you keep on


---------73:11----------
becoming more aware


---------73:13----------
yes yeah and this is the key thing is


---------73:16----------
that this is this is an issue of nyan


---------73:17----------
not vidyas you can't learn it from a


---------73:19----------
book


---------73:20----------
and so what people need to understand is


---------73:21----------
that they can listen to a thousand


---------73:23----------
conversations with train


---------73:25----------
but trains answer is never gonna work


---------73:27----------
for for them because what they need to


---------73:28----------
do is not


---------73:29----------
learn they need to realize


---------73:34----------
yeah experience but the other


---------73:36----------
interesting thing about realization


---------73:38----------
is that learning implies that knowledge


---------73:40----------
is on the outside


---------73:42----------
realize implies that knowledge is


---------73:44----------
actually already within


---------73:46----------
you right so it's interesting when


---------73:48----------
people use the word i realize that means


---------73:50----------
you already


---------73:52----------
knew on some level you've always known


---------73:54----------
on some level


---------73:55----------
so instead of looking outside people


---------73:57----------
need to like


---------73:58----------
look within right i know it's kind of


---------74:00----------
scenario yes


---------74:01----------
that's that's that's it that's and then


---------74:03----------
if we listen to your psychotic break so


---------74:05----------
this is kind of interesting that


---------74:07----------
there's a shared realm between psychosis


---------74:10----------
meditation and hallucinogen use


---------74:14----------
which is the way that it affects this


---------74:15----------
part of your brain called the default


---------74:17----------
mode network


---------74:19----------
and the default mode network is the part


---------74:21----------
of your brain that


---------74:22----------
lets you look at you so when we kind of


---------74:25----------
say that like human beings are different


---------74:27----------
from animals because we're self-aware


---------74:29----------
and there's a particular cognitive test


---------74:31----------
you can do on some animals where they


---------74:33----------
can like recognize themselves in a


---------74:34----------
mirror


---------74:35----------
that implies that they have the capacity


---------74:37----------
to be


---------74:40----------
how can i say this they can look at


---------74:42----------
themselves so they can be the


---------74:44----------
object of your own observation and the


---------74:46----------
default mode network is the thing that


---------74:48----------
allows you to look at yourself


---------74:50----------
now this is kind of interesting because


---------74:52----------
in depression the default mode network


---------74:54----------
actually gets


---------74:55----------
really really overblown and someone in


---------74:58----------
depression is always thinking about


---------75:00----------
themselves


---------75:01----------
they're thinking oh i'm a piece of [ __ ]


---------75:02----------
these people don't like me they'd be


---------75:04----------
better off without me all that kind of


---------75:06----------
stuff


---------75:07----------
um and so hold on there's a lot of


---------75:10----------
what is going on


---------75:15----------
sorry i'm confused why there's a bunch


---------75:18----------
of stuff being


---------75:19----------
banned from chat well i'm actually


---------75:21----------
looking at uh the usernames and


---------75:23----------
your mods are doing a very good job


---------75:25----------
because i recognize that assad nine guy


---------75:27----------
he's


---------75:27----------
you know he's a fan of mine he's a good


---------75:29----------
dude but he's toxic so


---------75:31----------
that seems like a good band good job


---------75:32----------
moderator i'm gonna keep going


---------75:35----------
so um what what i was kind of saying is


---------75:38----------
that with the default mode network it's


---------75:40----------
like you get


---------75:41----------
to way too preoccupied with yourself and


---------75:43----------
in depression it gets way worse


---------75:45----------
so people are always thinking about like


---------75:47----------
if you're having a bad day


---------75:48----------
my default mode network is hyperactive


---------75:51----------
so i think that you having a bad day is


---------75:53----------
my fault


---------75:54----------
if my default mode network is active so


---------75:56----------
i can't shake


---------75:57----------
my own ego and what i'm really hearing


---------76:00----------
for you in that psychotic break is what


---------76:02----------
you got past was your own ego right like


---------76:04----------
when you say


---------76:05----------
i am different that's your ego and when


---------76:08----------
you shatter that ego and you begin to


---------76:10----------
say


---------76:11----------
i am no longer different i'm i'm the


---------76:13----------
same as everyone else


---------76:15----------
and so it seemed like for you that


---------76:16----------
happened through psychosis but this is


---------76:18----------
where


---------76:18----------
you know psychedelics can do it


---------76:20----------
meditation can do it self-reflection can


---------76:22----------
do it


---------76:22----------
journaling can do it community service


---------76:24----------
can do it


---------76:26----------
developing humility and sort of


---------76:28----------
performing an ego


---------76:30----------
egodectomy the removal of your ego


---------76:33----------
is actually like the most important


---------76:35----------
thing to gain insight


---------76:37----------
you need to stop doing that thing where


---------76:39----------
your your mind your ego goes to your


---------76:42----------
intellect and bullies


---------76:43----------
and says hey i need to come up with a


---------76:45----------
really really selective way for me to


---------76:47----------
feel good about me using the substance


---------76:50----------
and so you ignore a bunch of stuff and


---------76:52----------
when your ego gets removed from the


---------76:53----------
equation


---------76:54----------
then you stop ignoring that stuff you


---------76:56----------
start to see yourself as you are


---------76:58----------
with all of your flaws and all of your


---------77:00----------
strengths


---------77:01----------
and that's how you gain security that's


---------77:03----------
how you get self-acceptance that's how


---------77:05----------
you gain self-love


---------77:06----------
because we heard you kind of talk about


---------77:08----------
those concepts but i think these two


---------77:10----------
things


---------77:10----------
are are really really tied together and


---------77:13----------
the most bizarre thing train i think is


---------77:15----------
that like


---------77:16----------
when i listen to your story i think


---------77:18----------
about your karma


---------77:20----------
and just what your addiction has done


---------77:22----------
for you


---------77:23----------
in terms of your personal journey and


---------77:26----------
how you've grown


---------77:27----------
so much through walking this journey how


---------77:30----------
you've come to learn


---------77:31----------
so much about yourself how you've come


---------77:33----------
to learn and understand


---------77:35----------
other people you know and like have a


---------77:38----------
have like a back pocket full of wild ass


---------77:41----------
awesome stories


---------77:42----------
which you know on the one hand we kind


---------77:44----------
of don't want to glorify because that


---------77:45----------
doesn't you know i'm not advocating that


---------77:47----------
people do it but like


---------77:48----------
let's at least acknowledge that that's a


---------77:50----------
wild story to listen to right


---------77:51----------
i got some crazy [ __ ] for you dr k


---------77:53----------
believe me oh man dude like i


---------77:55----------
i hope you so like this is kind of weird


---------77:57----------
it's it's a strange value judgment to


---------77:59----------
place but i really hope that


---------78:01----------
you or someone in your family like your


---------78:02----------
immediate siblings have kids


---------78:04----------
and then they have kids because you


---------78:06----------
would make one hell of a grandad


---------78:09----------
i'm an only child unfortunately but yeah


---------78:12----------
i think like i could absolutely see you


---------78:14----------
at like 70 and like bent over and like


---------78:17----------
telling stories to your grandkids


---------78:19----------
they're like what


---------78:19----------
oh like 16 and they're like telling


---------78:22----------
stories about


---------78:23----------
you know how grandpa used to do this and


---------78:27----------
that'd be nuts i think one to kind of


---------78:30----------
touch up on what you're saying


---------78:32----------
i think i actually want to add something


---------78:33----------
because i you know i think it's one of


---------78:35----------
the


---------78:35----------
biggest biggest issues with today's


---------78:39----------
society and the way


---------78:40----------
you know i'm not sure if this is the way


---------78:41----------
the world is or just the way america is


---------78:43----------
um because because of america's social


---------78:45----------
structure and [ __ ] like that


---------78:47----------
but one of the biggest issues that i see


---------78:51----------
is the lack of communication and honesty


---------78:55----------
between people now what i mean by that


---------78:57----------
is


---------78:59----------
everybody has their issues


---------79:03----------
everybody has issues that if they


---------79:06----------
communicate with others


---------79:08----------
and if they were honest about right and


---------79:10----------
i'm not talking to people that aren't


---------79:11----------
ready to express them i'm talking about


---------79:12----------
people who are


---------79:13----------
uh uh um intentionally hiding them


---------79:16----------
in order to front that their life is


---------79:18----------
better than the other right


---------79:20----------
a good example of this is let's say um


---------79:22----------
back in school


---------79:24----------
there was always group of kids that they


---------79:26----------
were miserable


---------79:27----------
you knew that like i knew at least they


---------79:29----------
were miserable studying for this exam


---------79:31----------
they hated it


---------79:32----------
but when the kid that had you know


---------79:36----------
a harder time paying attention would go


---------79:38----------
ask them for help or say hey is this


---------79:39----------
really easy for you they'd say yeah this


---------79:41----------
is cake


---------79:41----------
i knew this [ __ ] like five years ago


---------79:43----------
right but in reality


---------79:45----------
so now that person is gonna think that


---------79:47----------
they're dumb that person is going to


---------79:49----------
think that there's an issue the person


---------79:50----------
is going to think the issues within


---------79:52----------
themselves


---------79:53----------
right everyone's fronting to each other


---------79:56----------
everyone's making their life seem


---------79:58----------
absolutely amazing like they're


---------79:59----------
absolutely perfect like they absolutely


---------80:01----------
understand everything they have no


---------80:02----------
stress they have no sadness they have no


---------80:04----------
happiness they have no this they have no


---------80:06----------
that


---------80:07----------
just to look good for others and what


---------80:09----------
this does is sure in the short term you


---------80:11----------
look good you look like everything's


---------80:12----------
great but you're the most sad


---------80:14----------
and that sadness would be cured if you


---------80:16----------
just can't get hey listen


---------80:18----------
right comfort in others is so powerful


---------80:21----------
if you can just be honest be like hey


---------80:22----------
yeah [ __ ] terrible i had to study for


---------80:24----------
eight hours my parents made me i would


---------80:25----------
be honest right


---------80:26----------
the dude will feel much better like oh


---------80:27----------
[ __ ] then i gotta go do the same right


---------80:30----------
but like that ripple effect of that


---------80:31----------
single lie just to look good


---------80:34----------
it causes so much [ __ ] i'm telling you


---------80:35----------
like and this applies to every field


---------80:38----------
in every social situation for everything


---------80:41----------
so i don't know how the [ __ ] we solve


---------80:42----------
that but


---------80:43----------
that's a big issue i've noticed


---------80:44----------
throughout my life


---------80:46----------
does that make any sense yeah i think it


---------80:47----------
makes a lot of sense so you know we have


---------80:49----------
an interesting thing that we


---------80:50----------
tell our coaches which is kind of like


---------80:53----------
so


---------80:53----------
we try not to be judgmental right like


---------80:56----------
as a society


---------80:57----------
we say that judgments are bad like you


---------80:58----------
shouldn't judge me like who are you to


---------81:00----------
judge me


---------81:02----------
you know what i mean yeah like like so


---------81:05----------
and like if we think about it


---------81:07----------
lying and fronting is about did i use


---------81:11----------
that term right


---------81:12----------
yeah fronting is about


---------81:16----------
avoiding a particular judgment or


---------81:18----------
creating a particular judgment right


---------81:20----------
if i if i walk in before the test and i


---------81:22----------
say oh yeah i didn't really study for it


---------81:24----------
but i'm going to crush it and secretly i


---------81:26----------
was like


---------81:26----------
laboring away for 80 hours yeah last


---------81:29----------
week yeah


---------81:29----------
and i want to make it look easy and i


---------81:31----------
want everyone to know you know how smart


---------81:33----------
i am oh


---------81:34----------
[ __ ] jobs you all have to study for


---------81:36----------
this [ __ ]


---------81:37----------
yep i do quantum mechanics on the toilet


---------81:40----------
you know scrubs


---------81:44----------
and it's so so we we say something


---------81:46----------
that's kind of interesting which


---------81:48----------
has been tricky for coaches to learn is


---------81:50----------
that i actually don't advocate for them


---------81:52----------
to be non-judgmental


---------81:54----------
what i advocate for is for them to be


---------81:56----------
authentic and compassionate


---------81:59----------
and if your client is doing something


---------82:00----------
bad


---------82:02----------
you absolutely judge them for it but you


---------82:04----------
do it with compassion you should be


---------82:05----------
authentic


---------82:07----------
like authentic and and authenticity and


---------82:10----------
compassion


---------82:11----------
i think are like our biggest antidotes


---------82:13----------
to a world


---------82:14----------
full of like lies and fronting


---------82:18----------
right we have to like we have to hold


---------82:20----------
people accountable for


---------82:22----------
what they say and they do but we should


---------82:24----------
do it in a compassionate way


---------82:26----------
because i think non-judgmentalness is


---------82:28----------
kind of tricky because


---------82:30----------
like if someone [ __ ] up what we're not


---------82:32----------
gonna judge them for it like how does


---------82:34----------
that help anyone any


---------82:35----------
you know it's kind of weird but i think


---------82:37----------
it's part of the


---------82:38----------
you know cancel culture and this kind of


---------82:40----------
stuff is that like on the one hand we


---------82:42----------
judge


---------82:42----------
really really harshly if it's sort of


---------82:43----------
like righteous


---------82:45----------
and then on the other hand it's like you


---------82:47----------
can't you know


---------82:49----------
if i give a talk on the internet about


---------82:52----------
the


---------82:52----------
you know mortality risk of obesity


---------82:55----------
with covid19 which there's an over


---------82:58----------
overwhelming amount of data for


---------83:00----------
suddenly i'm fat shaming and it's like


---------83:02----------
i'm not allowed to say that


---------83:04----------
because someone's feelings are hurt and


---------83:06----------
they feel judged


---------83:07----------
and that's sort of where like you know


---------83:09----------
as a as a psychiatrist i realized a long


---------83:11----------
time ago


---------83:12----------
you know part of my job is to judge


---------83:14----------
people but to do so like they deserve


---------83:17----------
honesty for me like they deserve


---------83:19----------
authenticity from me


---------83:21----------
you know they deserve for me to not lie


---------83:23----------
to them and then you have to be careful


---------83:24----------
because


---------83:25----------
that's how you can turn into one of


---------83:26----------
these blunt [ __ ] where like i'm


---------83:28----------
i'm a truth speaker i'm gonna go tell


---------83:30----------
everyone how ugly they are because


---------83:32----------
it is my ideal to be true but then you


---------83:35----------
have to temper that with compassion


---------83:37----------
i hate that yeah that's the biggest


---------83:39----------
problem i notice right that there's this


---------83:42----------
there are these uh differing definitions


---------83:45----------
of


---------83:46----------
you know real and fake you know


---------83:48----------
authentic and


---------83:49----------
you know uh disingenuous whatever the


---------83:51----------
[ __ ] right


---------83:52----------
and one of them is very childish and


---------83:55----------
immature and that's the one that i see


---------83:56----------
use the most


---------83:57----------
right and it's if you're real you know


---------84:00----------
you never you never lie you see how it


---------84:02----------
is right but it's like when you grow


---------84:03----------
older you realize it's not black and


---------84:04----------
white


---------84:05----------
right it's very subjective there's a lot


---------84:07----------
of gray area right if i meet my


---------84:08----------
girlfriend's parents and i hate them


---------84:10----------
right i can't be like hey what's up


---------84:12----------
[ __ ] i don't [ __ ] like you but


---------84:14----------
i'm [ __ ] your daughter


---------84:15----------
right that's that's not right it's not


---------84:17----------
right it might be how i


---------84:18----------
feel but not actually please don't kill


---------84:20----------
me you know but


---------84:22----------
right that's not right that says more


---------84:25----------
about me in a negative way than it does


---------84:26----------
a positive in a sense of realness right


---------84:29----------
like i like if if anything if i'm


---------84:32----------
someone that is real right or someone


---------84:34----------
that was authentic


---------84:36----------
i would have the maturity i'd have the


---------84:37----------
respect


---------84:39----------
to understand that it doesn't matter how


---------84:40----------
i feel about this individual right i'm


---------84:42----------
dating his daughter i need to have


---------84:43----------
respect for him


---------84:45----------
and i need to treat him kindly right and


---------84:47----------
it's it's that simple


---------84:48----------
right it's like so like these are the


---------84:51----------
players in today's society yeah go ahead


---------84:53----------
so like i see this a lot trained with


---------84:55----------
with um


---------84:57----------
with people that i work with that i


---------84:58----------
would call pseudo spiritual


---------85:00----------
so like a lot of people that you know


---------85:02----------
come across


---------85:04----------
my world or like spiritual people who


---------85:06----------
are like interested in spirituality


---------85:08----------
sometimes it'll be like


---------85:10----------
you know if we do consulting for like a


---------85:12----------
company or something like someone who's


---------85:14----------
spiritual will show up


---------85:15----------
like people in our community you know


---------85:17----------
there's kind of spiritual and sometimes


---------85:18----------
people are pseudo spiritual and what i


---------85:20----------
mean by that is they're like


---------85:22----------
they like they have a big ego about


---------85:24----------
being spiritual but they're not actually


---------85:26----------
like


---------85:27----------
they may work hard and they may like


---------85:28----------
talk the talk but they're not really


---------85:30----------
walking the walk in the most important


---------85:31----------
ways


---------85:32----------
and a good example of that is like so so


---------85:34----------
like you know people who sort of say


---------85:35----------
that


---------85:36----------
you know i'm gonna live in the present


---------85:39----------
and


---------85:39----------
and i want to be present focused and i


---------85:41----------
want to be like unattached


---------85:43----------
you know like they say these kinds of


---------85:44----------
like spiritual things so what that means


---------85:46----------
is that like


---------85:47----------
even though i have a girlfriend if like


---------85:49----------
in the in the present moment if i want


---------85:50----------
to [ __ ] someone else


---------85:52----------
i'm going to [ __ ] him you know because


---------85:54----------
that's like me being like authentic


---------85:55----------
to myself train i want to be like my


---------85:58----------
authentic self i don't want to be like


---------86:00----------
you know pinned down


---------86:04----------
by like worldly conceptions and i'm


---------86:05----------
going to be like in the present moment


---------86:07----------
and authentic to myself


---------86:09----------
and so this is like a classic example of


---------86:10----------
like a pseudo-spiritual person


---------86:13----------
and it's really interesting because if


---------86:14----------
you look at um you know the system of


---------86:16----------
yoga


---------86:17----------
and and like their they kind of have


---------86:19----------
this hierarchy and what they say is that


---------86:22----------
you know truthfulness is really


---------86:23----------
important but the


---------86:25----------
most important thing is ahimsa or


---------86:28----------
non-violence


---------86:29----------
so truthfulness should always be subject


---------86:32----------
to non-violence


---------86:34----------
and so not hurting another human being


---------86:38----------
trumps truthfulness and all truthfulness


---------86:41----------
should only be


---------86:42----------
shared if it is non-violent truthfulness


---------86:47----------
and so there's kind of this hierarchy


---------86:48----------
where like you're you're even if you're


---------86:50----------
trying to be an authentic person


---------86:52----------
so we kind of say authenticity with


---------86:54----------
compassion with our coaches and i think


---------86:55----------
that's a big part of like what they do


---------86:57----------
and like


---------86:57----------
i think that's a big part of what our


---------86:59----------
community needs and craves


---------87:01----------
is like you know this is something that


---------87:03----------
i sort of dislike a little bit about


---------87:04----------
therapy i sometimes feel like therapy is


---------87:06----------
way too non-judgmental


---------87:08----------
personally so i tend to be like a


---------87:10----------
judgmental therapist


---------87:11----------
where people will you know i'll be like


---------87:13----------
what the [ __ ] man


---------87:15----------
you kind of [ __ ] up there and and so


---------87:18----------
you know some of my colleagues will


---------87:19----------
never say that to a client


---------87:20----------
or therapist or patient and they'll be


---------87:22----------
like how could you ever you know


---------87:24----------
and it's like i kind of feel like you


---------87:27----------
know


---------87:27----------
they know they're [ __ ] up i know they


---------87:29----------
[ __ ] up we all know we [ __ ] up let's


---------87:31----------
call it what it is so that we can do


---------87:32----------
something about it


---------87:34----------
and especially in our community people


---------87:35----------
need to be called out for what they're


---------87:37----------
doing yes


---------87:37----------
you have to do that they're already


---------87:39----------
getting the babying treatment from their


---------87:41----------
parents and friends right like


---------87:42----------
they need something like what you're


---------87:43----------
doing i agree with that completely at


---------87:45----------
least yeah i mean so i think it's


---------87:46----------
important to be compassionate like it's


---------87:47----------
not calling them out for the sake of


---------87:49----------
like justice


---------87:50----------
it's calling them out because it's like


---------87:52----------
hey man if you made a mistake like let's


---------87:54----------
work on it


---------87:54----------
so that you don't have to make that


---------87:56----------
mistake anymore yes but pretending it's


---------87:58----------
okay


---------87:59----------
is not how you fix a problem you know


---------88:02----------
agreed


---------88:03----------
um so i'm with you i know we're kind of


---------88:05----------
off topic but i


---------88:06----------
i think from a you know an addiction


---------88:08----------
standpoint uh


---------88:10----------
trained i thought it was like wonderful


---------88:12----------
what you shared in kind of your journey


---------88:14----------
and stuff um you know i think i'm i'm


---------88:17----------
lucky that that you did


---------88:19----------
make it through right because it sounds


---------88:20----------
like a lot of the stuff that you were


---------88:22----------
doing was really dangerous i'm lucky


---------88:23----------
yeah


---------88:24----------
and i cannot emphasize this enough like


---------88:25----------
that is not an rng game that you guys


---------88:27----------
want to be playing


---------88:29----------
it is not it's not at all it's terrible

---------89:16----------

---------90:29----------
i don't know is there anything else is


---------90:31----------
there anything else for you


---------90:32----------
uh i mean i think so a lot of people i


---------90:34----------
think are going to be wondering


---------90:36----------
how do i get rid of my ego so i thought


---------90:40----------
i would just share


---------90:41----------
some like a different a slightly


---------90:42----------
different kind of meditative technique


---------90:44----------
um for those also there's i'm so sorry


---------90:47----------
to interrupt


---------90:48----------
there's also a tr so in between getting


---------90:50----------
rid of ego there's a trap door


---------90:52----------
okay it's the last hurrah for the ego


---------90:57----------
and that trap door it is damn near


---------91:00----------
same as losing your ego you understand


---------91:04----------
it is gaining an ego through the loss of


---------91:06----------
your ego when you lose your ego that's


---------91:08----------
differentiating you from most people


---------91:10----------
therefore you find a new justification


---------91:12----------
of why you're different


---------91:13----------
without actually knowing you're


---------91:14----------
different and thinking you've lost your


---------91:15----------
ego and that's the last trapdoor you


---------91:17----------
need to [ __ ] pass before you actually


---------91:18----------
lose it does that make sense


---------91:20----------
makes it's brilliant so this is


---------91:21----------
something that one of my teachers in


---------91:23----------
india


---------91:23----------
monk told me like 17 years ago


---------91:27----------
and it's it's awesome it feels really


---------91:28----------
full circle to hear it from you today


---------91:31----------
so he said there are two kinds of ego


---------91:33----------
there's the regular ego


---------91:35----------
and then there's the ego of having no


---------91:37----------
ego


---------91:40----------
