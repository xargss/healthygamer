---------00:00----------
today's talk is really about masculinity


---------00:05----------
but more importantly it's also like


---------00:07----------
digging into


---------00:08----------
how we form our views of masculinity


---------00:11----------
and where our opinions come from and a


---------00:13----------
lot of the opinions that we have and


---------00:15----------
feelings we have around gender roles


---------00:17----------
are actually deeply rooted in personal


---------00:19----------
experiences that have shaped the way


---------00:21----------
that we think


---------00:23----------
and so i want people to understand that


---------00:24----------
like if you really want to


---------00:26----------
start to feel more comfortable with


---------00:29----------
gender related


---------00:30----------
issues whether they be societal or the


---------00:31----------
ones that you sit with


---------00:33----------
exploring your own personal story is a


---------00:36----------
wonderful way to kind of get a handle on


---------00:38----------
how you see the world


---------00:45----------
yeah so how you been man i've been


---------00:48----------
pretty good


---------00:49----------
i um i've


---------00:52----------
i've been actually pretty good i uh for


---------00:54----------
the most part have just been


---------00:56----------
focused on working this pandemic


---------00:57----------
obviously being isolated has its own


---------00:59----------
set of issues but overall mental health


---------01:01----------
and physical health have been pretty


---------01:03----------
great so


---------01:04----------
can't complain and remind me last time


---------01:06----------
we talked a little bit about


---------01:07----------
um was it your dad and and grief and


---------01:10----------
stuff


---------01:11----------
yeah yeah so we talked about uh loved


---------01:13----------
ones dying how to process and handle


---------01:15----------
that


---------01:15----------
and uh how best to to manage the


---------01:18----------
um loss of somebody close to you


---------01:22----------
and was that did that help at all or


---------01:25----------
i mean you know i sort of feel like i'm


---------01:27----------
fishing for a yes there but i'm just


---------01:28----------
genuinely curious like


---------01:30----------
yeah yeah well i mean i think any


---------01:31----------
opportunity to discuss something that


---------01:33----------
you normally don't discuss is always a


---------01:34----------
good thing


---------01:35----------
uh it's always strange to discuss


---------01:37----------
something that's very like


---------01:38----------
intimate difficult on a very public


---------01:40----------
platform


---------01:42----------
because everyone wants to chime in with


---------01:44----------
their opinions which is a bit of a


---------01:45----------
strange thing for something you feel so


---------01:47----------
personal uh but beyond that in terms of


---------01:49----------
like how i feel on the inside


---------01:50----------
much better yeah when you say everyone


---------01:53----------
wants to chime in with their feelings


---------01:54----------
who are you talking about


---------01:56----------
uh you know i i honestly like i i feel


---------01:59----------
this way every time i i


---------02:01----------
generally dislike being uh in a


---------02:03----------
vulnerable state on the internet it uh


---------02:05----------
sure understands it's not it's not uh


---------02:07----------
it's not generally my thing


---------02:09----------
um so as a result i think when people


---------02:12----------
give me their feedback or they stop me


---------02:13----------
it's kind of weird to have a stranger


---------02:14----------
being like man that moment about you and


---------02:16----------
your dad really touched me i'm just like


---------02:18----------
but i don't know you you know it's kind


---------02:19----------
of a weird feeling to


---------02:21----------
have somebody because it feels like


---------02:23----------
someone saw me naked and i don't know


---------02:24----------
who they are


---------02:25----------
you know


---------02:29----------
you know but you're the one doing the


---------02:30----------
touching apparently yes


---------02:32----------
yes yes but it's just it feels very


---------02:35----------
voyeuristic in a way not


---------02:37----------
it's consensual but it's still strange


---------02:39----------
because yeah i feel


---------02:40----------
it's that parasocial relationship that


---------02:42----------
people talk about a lot


---------02:43----------
where people feel like they know you and


---------02:46----------
they come up to you and they say all


---------02:47----------
these like


---------02:48----------
things about themselves i have no idea


---------02:50----------
who you are but you know this intimate


---------02:51----------
part of my life so


---------02:52----------
that's a strange part about it yeah but


---------02:55----------
i'm also kind of hearing that


---------02:56----------
apparently people benefited from your


---------02:59----------
nakedness


---------03:01----------
uh yes i would i would i would agree


---------03:04----------
agree with that notion i think that's


---------03:06----------
weird man yeah


---------03:08----------
definitely definitely so yeah so that


---------03:10----------
was that was everyone's experience and i


---------03:12----------
think it was great to


---------03:12----------
hear that um folks had a a very positive


---------03:16----------
um experience listening to that so i'm


---------03:18----------
happy about that portion of it for sure


---------03:20----------
yeah and and just you know it's


---------03:22----------
interesting um and


---------03:24----------
what do you go by again uh i go by abba


---------03:27----------
normally that's yeah that's the thing


---------03:29----------
so abby you know just hearing you


---------03:32----------
now i'm sort of remembering how um


---------03:36----------
protective you are of other people it's


---------03:38----------
kind of interesting like


---------03:39----------
you know you you kind of you're it's


---------03:42----------
subtle but like the way that you're kind


---------03:43----------
of saying you know i appreciate that


---------03:45----------
other people are getting helped but i'm


---------03:46----------
also kind of acknowledging that


---------03:48----------
underneath that is sort of the


---------03:49----------
i was still naked and it feels really


---------03:51----------
awkward for me


---------03:52----------
yes yeah yeah that that feeling i don't


---------03:55----------
think any ever really goes away from me


---------03:57----------
uh because i'm still a fairly private


---------03:58----------
person even though i do


---------04:00----------
online stuff you know normally like


---------04:02----------
pictures of my family or things like


---------04:03----------
that that's going on my life i don't


---------04:05----------
really share with the whole world so to


---------04:06----------
share that sure


---------04:07----------
i think it was something that was good


---------04:08----------
for folks but i think for me it's always


---------04:10----------
trying to find that good line between


---------04:12----------
how much sharing is too much can you


---------04:14----------
hold on just one second i'm getting a


---------04:16----------
call from my


---------04:17----------
producer no worries go ahead thank you


---------04:19----------
very much


---------04:20----------
i appreciate it i might be peeking or


---------04:22----------
something like that i i only got uh


---------04:24----------
filters on my stream so


---------04:26----------
so so abba let me ask you guys this may


---------04:28----------
sound like a kind of a weird question


---------04:30----------
because i get that we're you know having


---------04:31----------
this conversation now but


---------04:33----------
um how do you feel about coming back and


---------04:35----------
maybe talking about something else and


---------04:37----------
and kind of being once again vulnerable


---------04:39----------
in front of


---------04:40----------
you know um i think i do things that


---------04:44----------
matter to me and so i think for me it's


---------04:46----------
fun to do them provided there's a


---------04:47----------
purpose to them i i wouldn't do this


---------04:48----------
gratuitously


---------04:50----------
so i think as long as there's a there's


---------04:51----------
a end goal in mind and there's something


---------04:54----------
you know i think the conversation is


---------04:55----------
beneficial i think it's something that


---------04:56----------
people could gain from then i'm fine


---------04:57----------
with having it on this kind of platform


---------04:59----------
okay okay so i'm really hearing that


---------05:02----------
there's sort of a greater good to be


---------05:04----------
served here


---------05:06----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely i think


---------05:07----------
there's a lot of people who identify


---------05:09----------
with some of the issues that i've


---------05:10----------
mentioned


---------05:11----------
in the email so you know it's something


---------05:12----------
i've discussed on my platform before so


---------05:14----------
i think having your take on it and a bit


---------05:16----------
of a back and forth would benefit a lot


---------05:18----------
of people


---------05:19----------
so you're doing this for other people uh


---------05:22----------
partially i think it's also good for me


---------05:23----------
uh


---------05:25----------
it's interesting i feel like with this


---------05:27----------
issue specifically i mean the one


---------05:28----------
regarding to


---------05:29----------
to to some of men's issues i think


---------05:33----------
i think i'm i'm okay with things in a


---------05:35----------
sense that i don't need a sense of


---------05:36----------
catharsis like i think i've gotten mine


---------05:38----------
per se


---------05:39----------
um but i see you know


---------05:43----------
it's weird because a lot of men you know


---------05:44----------
hit me up and they're like you're my


---------05:46----------
mentor and i'm like


---------05:46----------
i didn't sign up for all that but i


---------05:49----------
think


---------05:50----------
it's because i identify with some of the


---------05:52----------
stuff that we talk about and it it's


---------05:53----------
like it's on the first time for a lot of


---------05:54----------
them that they've heard it


---------05:56----------
so i recognize some folks do do need it


---------05:59----------
yeah


---------06:01----------
um yeah you're so precise with your


---------06:04----------
language and your thought you know it's


---------06:07----------
it's


---------06:08----------
it's interesting it you know yeah well


---------06:11----------
uh thank you i appreciate that i mean


---------06:13----------
just kind of like


---------06:14----------
when you say yeah i mean it i appreciate


---------06:17----------
it a lot


---------06:18----------
um and i'm also noticing abba maybe this


---------06:22----------
isn't really what


---------06:23----------
we kind of signed up for today and so we


---------06:25----------
don't have to talk about it but


---------06:27----------
i'm hearing also like a theme of like


---------06:29----------
people


---------06:30----------
um you know like here you are mentoring


---------06:32----------
people that you've never heard of and


---------06:34----------
and you know opening people's eyes to


---------06:36----------
things and you know


---------06:37----------
having them feel like touched and


---------06:39----------
they're growing and then you're you're


---------06:40----------
kind of like bewildered


---------06:42----------
and and i'm just a little bit curious


---------06:44----------
about um


---------06:47----------
you know what kind of expectation or


---------06:49----------
pressure or like how do you


---------06:51----------
you know how do you deal with that um


---------06:54----------
and i know it's kind of separate from


---------06:55----------
maybe what we're going to be talking


---------06:56----------
about today but it's just it's so


---------06:57----------
interesting because i'm hearing that


---------06:58----------
theme kind of pop


---------06:59----------
up over and over like what are you to


---------07:01----------
people and and how do you


---------07:03----------
sit with what you are for other people


---------07:06----------
yeah well you know


---------07:07----------
i definitely get a sense of imposter


---------07:09----------
syndrome mostly because i don't think


---------07:11----------
i've


---------07:11----------
really had proper mentors most of my


---------07:13----------
life and so the idea of being a mentor


---------07:15----------
to somebody else is definitely


---------07:16----------
a little intimidating at times um and


---------07:19----------
and it doesn't feel consensual in some


---------07:21----------
ways this sets that up


---------07:24----------
i didn't choose this i didn't accept


---------07:25----------
anything but you you have these


---------07:27----------
expectations


---------07:28----------
and i think i'm managing it by by


---------07:30----------
reminding myself that i matter


---------07:32----------
and that my well-being matters so if it


---------07:35----------
ever becomes too much to take time and


---------07:36----------
to


---------07:37----------
embrace that and i think i also manage


---------07:39----------
it by


---------07:40----------
accepting that i i've i've in a sense


---------07:43----------
already been doing it with the things


---------07:44----------
that i'm doing so i just need to keep


---------07:45----------
doing that


---------07:46----------
you know and i don't have to pile on


---------07:48----------
myself a large amount of extra work


---------07:50----------
because i think what i've been doing is


---------07:52----------
enough for a lot of tricks


---------07:54----------
well said really well said and once


---------07:56----------
again well thought out


---------07:58----------
nuanced you know that you're okay doing


---------08:01----------
this


---------08:02----------
and then there are certain boundaries


---------08:03----------
that you're going to maintain and


---------08:04----------
respect


---------08:06----------
and that you know cool so what did you


---------08:08----------
want to talk about in terms of men's


---------08:10----------
issues today


---------08:12----------
um i sent a video that i kind of


---------08:14----------
summarized that had you had an


---------08:16----------
opportunity to watch it by any chance no


---------08:18----------
so i actually purposely go into this


---------08:20----------
stuff blind


---------08:21----------
blind okay yeah the other reason is


---------08:23----------
because um sometimes i hate the idea of


---------08:24----------
feeling redundant


---------08:26----------
with some of the stuff but i guess it is


---------08:27----------
good to explain it for folks who haven't


---------08:29----------
seen it


---------08:29----------
um well if it's short we could also just


---------08:31----------
watch it together if you want


---------08:33----------
no no it's about 10 minutes so probably


---------08:35----------
best for me to just explain it but um


---------08:38----------
but my pet peeve with with these kinds


---------08:40----------
of discussions is also feels like when


---------08:42----------
they're had


---------08:43----------
uh if you talk about it too often people


---------08:45----------
will start to be like oh here he goes


---------08:46----------
again on this topic and uh


---------08:48----------
you know i never want to seem whiny


---------08:51----------
because in my day-to-day life i don't


---------08:52----------
think this is something i necessarily


---------08:53----------
talk about that often but when i'm on


---------08:54----------
the internet it seems to come up a lot


---------08:56----------
um yeah so


---------09:00----------
are you familiar with the with the red


---------09:01----------
pill community uh yeah at least in terms


---------09:03----------
of the dating sense yeah


---------09:04----------
um and so some people would like sent me


---------09:06----------
links and they they asked for my


---------09:07----------
critique of it and how toxic some of it


---------09:10----------
may be what not


---------09:11----------
and um essentially the the rebuttal i


---------09:14----------
had


---------09:15----------
was that i think for a long time men


---------09:17----------
haven't had spaces on any kind of


---------09:19----------
platforms or media


---------09:20----------
to see their issues and their problems


---------09:22----------
reflected in any kind of form


---------09:24----------
and they also oftentimes haven't had


---------09:27----------
too many opportunities for guidance on


---------09:30----------
how to approach women


---------09:31----------
on how to date effectively on you know


---------09:34----------
especially


---------09:35----------
when you're expected to make the first


---------09:36----------
step and to kind of put yourself out


---------09:38----------
there and a lot of the times like


---------09:39----------
it's not that much guidance for uh young


---------09:42----------
men


---------09:42----------
and i know it's an issue that i dealt


---------09:43----------
with for a long time and so i say that


---------09:46----------
uh


---------09:46----------
essentially even though um i think the


---------09:49----------
community has


---------09:50----------
issues and some of the rhetoric isn't


---------09:51----------
always good i think there is no


---------09:53----------
alternative for a lot of men or they


---------09:55----------
feel like there isn't one


---------09:56----------
and therefore until something is


---------09:57----------
presented i think the idea of


---------09:59----------
taking down the one space where men see


---------10:01----------
these topics reflected


---------10:02----------
uh wouldn't be a good idea that's the


---------10:05----------
gist of it


---------10:06----------
can you just um help me understand or


---------10:08----------
just help with people


---------10:09----------
who don't understand what red pill is


---------10:11----------
can you just explain


---------10:13----------
explain it yes yeah yeah yeah so it's


---------10:15----------
born from the


---------10:16----------
matrix and the idea of the red pill


---------10:18----------
versus the blue pills like


---------10:20----------
neo the main character gets a choice


---------10:21----------
between choosing to see the world for


---------10:23----------
what it is the truth with the red pill


---------10:25----------
or blue pill which is to stay in this


---------10:27----------
kind of virtual reality fiction type


---------10:28----------
world


---------10:29----------
and so the term uh had a political


---------10:32----------
meaning for some time


---------10:32----------
just for people who want to see the


---------10:34----------
truth in life in general but over the


---------10:36----------
last like i would say seven or


---------10:37----------
eight years um in a dating sense


---------10:40----------
a lot of men go there for pickup artist


---------10:43----------
stuff


---------10:43----------
you know seeing the world for what it is


---------10:46----------
in the sense uh


---------10:47----------
like how women are doing really well and


---------10:49----------
men are failing


---------10:50----------
so that's some of the ideas that would


---------10:51----------
be common in the red pill dating yeah


---------10:54----------
yeah so i i'm really um i'm really


---------10:57----------
excited for this conversation because


---------10:58----------
this is actually one of my favorite


---------11:00----------
things to think about


---------11:02----------
and my favorite things to talk about


---------11:04----------
okay why is that


---------11:05----------
i you know it's it's it's interesting


---------11:08----------
i'm not quite sure but


---------11:10----------
about two years ago i sent an email to


---------11:13----------
like a group of like close friends of


---------11:15----------
mine


---------11:16----------
just trying to figure out like what's


---------11:18----------
like i felt like something is happening


---------11:20----------
with men


---------11:21----------
and it for me it started actually in a


---------11:23----------
really bizarre way


---------11:24----------
i was doing um i was working in a prison


---------11:28----------
and i was uh you know doing therapy with


---------11:31----------
something like an


---------11:32----------
inmate and i was talking to him and he


---------11:35----------
was in


---------11:35----------
in prison for dealing drugs um


---------11:39----------
and so as we kind of like started


---------11:40----------
talking and i started getting to know


---------11:42----------
him


---------11:42----------
so it turned out that he had three older


---------11:44----------
sisters and


---------11:45----------
his older sisters kind of said to him


---------11:47----------
that you know like it's your job as like


---------11:49----------
the man of the family


---------11:50----------
to like provide and so here he is at


---------11:53----------
like


---------11:53----------
16 and he's expected to provide for


---------11:57----------
you know three older sisters or they're


---------11:59----------
they're sort of


---------12:00----------
telling him that and so he's not really


---------12:03----------
kind of sure


---------12:03----------
like how to go about doing that feels


---------12:06----------
kind of overwhelmed but there is like


---------12:07----------
one opportunity within his community so


---------12:09----------
he's like


---------12:10----------
low a socioeconomic status um also like


---------12:13----------
an


---------12:13----------
ethnic minority and and so started


---------12:17----------
you know dealing and then kind of got


---------12:19----------
caught you know had a couple of


---------12:21----------
infractions i was meeting him when he


---------12:22----------
was like 24 or 23


---------12:25----------
yeah and so we kind of talked about it


---------12:26----------
and then he sort of like felt this


---------12:28----------
big big burden like his biggest issue


---------12:30----------
like when he was talking about being


---------12:32----------
depressed is like


---------12:33----------
i have to provide and it's like my


---------12:35----------
responsibility to provide


---------12:37----------
and the really bizarre thing is that a


---------12:38----------
few months later i was


---------12:40----------
working with um you know like a


---------12:42----------
middle-aged investment banker


---------12:44----------
and like the same words were coming out


---------12:46----------
of his mouth


---------12:47----------
yeah and it just struck me as like


---------12:50----------
bizarre that


---------12:51----------
these two people from so different


---------12:54----------
backgrounds actually oddly enough the


---------12:56----------
investment banker's background was


---------12:57----------
actually not very different from these


---------12:59----------
kids which is interesting


---------13:01----------
um so also grew up like poor and


---------13:04----------
and things like that and and just so


---------13:07----------
interesting that


---------13:08----------
that like these two people from such


---------13:10----------
different walks of like


---------13:11----------
life like different ethnicities um you


---------13:14----------
know somewhat different backgrounds very


---------13:16----------
different you know day-to-day


---------13:17----------
experiences of life


---------13:18----------
we're essentially like suffering from a


---------13:20----------
common problem and that just struck me


---------13:22----------
as very strange


---------13:24----------
and and it caused me to really like stop


---------13:26----------
and think a little bit about like


---------13:28----------
you know how um


---------13:31----------
with all the discussions of privilege


---------13:33----------
and stuff like that that you could


---------13:34----------
kind of say like how can you even


---------13:36----------
compare those but just


---------13:38----------
you can certainly say that these people


---------13:40----------
aren't similar at all


---------13:42----------
but just as a therapist you know part of


---------13:44----------
what i try to do is like see the person


---------13:46----------
behind all of the labels and


---------13:50----------
skip color of their skin and things like


---------13:51----------
that and what really shocked me was that


---------13:54----------
you know if i closed my eye if i made a


---------13:56----------
transcript of each session


---------13:58----------
and i went back and read them i would


---------14:00----------
not know which person i was talking to


---------14:02----------
just based on the transcript of their


---------14:04----------
words yeah


---------14:06----------
and so something about that i realized


---------14:08----------
like something is going on here like i


---------14:09----------
don't know what but there's like a


---------14:10----------
bizarre like it's so


---------14:12----------
and and i realize that the further apart


---------14:14----------
that these people


---------14:15----------
appear to be the bigger the issue is


---------14:18----------
because it's gotta it's gotta


---------14:20----------
you know bridge the gap of these vastly


---------14:22----------
different


---------14:23----------
experiences um and so i started to just


---------14:26----------
kind of


---------14:27----------
talk to people and sort of explore and


---------14:29----------
things like that and


---------14:30----------
and it's been just really fascinating to


---------14:32----------
sort of try to figure out


---------14:34----------
you know for essentially a privileged


---------14:37----------
class like why do men suffer so much why


---------14:41----------
why is the suicide rate you know why do


---------14:43----------
four out of three or four


---------14:44----------
three out of four or four out of five


---------14:46----------
people who kill themselves or men


---------14:49----------
um and so you know what like i feel like


---------14:51----------
we're missing something here and that


---------14:53----------
there's something going on that there's


---------14:54----------
actually a lot of like


---------14:56----------
evidence for but that people don't talk


---------14:58----------
about


---------15:00----------
yeah well i think i think it's an


---------15:03----------
oversimplification of the issue in the


---------15:04----------
sense that


---------15:06----------
we love to look at things as hierarchies


---------15:07----------
that are very clear-cut in the sense


---------15:09----------
like we got a pyramid


---------15:10----------
we got we got men at the top and then we


---------15:12----------
got women right below and then we got


---------15:14----------
people who are minorities and then we


---------15:15----------
got people are disabled right


---------15:16----------
but the truth is uh i think when people


---------15:19----------
internalize these issues and people


---------15:20----------
won't live these issues they don't


---------15:22----------
necessarily live


---------15:22----------
on a macro scale things happen on a


---------15:24----------
micro skills and so


---------15:26----------
you know even when i try to have these


---------15:27----------
discussions for example and you say the


---------15:29----------
problem seems very vast and complex


---------15:31----------
i think it's a lot more simple in the


---------15:33----------
sense that


---------15:34----------
as a whole men deal with certain issues


---------15:36----------
but because they're perceived as the


---------15:38----------
privileged class a lot of that is


---------15:40----------
underserved and it's rarely


---------15:42----------
discussed in a sense so you know when i


---------15:44----------
talk about this stuff and people are


---------15:45----------
like well women suffer more i'm like i


---------15:47----------
don't disagree that women may have more


---------15:48----------
problems inciting that means


---------15:50----------
but when i'm dealing with problems and


---------15:52----------
they're very real whether it be


---------15:53----------
depression or my friends killing


---------15:54----------
themselves or things like that


---------15:56----------
i internalize things on a micro scale i


---------15:58----------
internalize things on an individual


---------16:00----------
basis i can't think of like men as a


---------16:02----------
whole


---------16:02----------
i'm thinking about man people around me


---------16:03----------
are dying my male friends are dying


---------16:05----------
that's what i see


---------16:06----------
and so you can understand concepts on a


---------16:09----------
macro level but i think


---------16:10----------
seeing the folks as individuals is


---------16:12----------
important this because it makes you


---------16:13----------
realize that


---------16:15----------
even though a perceived class can can


---------16:16----------
have these advantages and they're quite


---------16:18----------
real


---------16:18----------
on an individual scale the suffering can


---------16:21----------
be just as


---------16:22----------
heavy if that makes sense you know


---------16:26----------
and i think that's important and to me


---------16:28----------
what you said about like the investment


---------16:30----------
banker


---------16:30----------
and the dues on the drugs like it's not


---------16:32----------
surprising you know as my income level


---------16:34----------
has changed and as i've spent time


---------16:36----------
from the military to civilian life and


---------16:38----------
stuff i'm like it's the same problems


---------16:40----------
it's really not that drastically


---------16:41----------
different i see a lot of the same


---------16:43----------
patterns


---------16:44----------
in regards to that idea of male


---------16:45----------
responsibility um


---------16:47----------
and feeling the need to provide even


---------16:49----------
though i'm a middle child and i got


---------16:50----------
older sisters


---------16:51----------
you know i have that exact same


---------16:53----------
responsibility but i'm supposed to take


---------16:54----------
care of my mom


---------16:55----------
i'm supposed to take care of my siblings


---------16:56----------
you know and they haven't


---------16:58----------
didn't even have to explicitly say i


---------17:00----------
just feel like that is my response that


---------17:02----------
is my burden to bear


---------17:04----------
um and so i think a lot of this stuff is


---------17:06----------
just understood


---------17:07----------
on the side of the level for all men


---------17:09----------
irrespective of income level


---------17:12----------
yeah so what what do you think is the


---------17:14----------
problem abba


---------17:16----------
help me understand your understanding of


---------17:18----------
the situation


---------17:19----------
and i think i think men are expected to


---------17:22----------
do these things we're just often


---------17:24----------
ill-equipped


---------17:25----------
and not given any guidance on how to do


---------17:27----------
them do what whether


---------17:29----------
uh from everything from making the first


---------17:32----------
move and being a leader like


---------17:33----------
you know the whole idea of leading even


---------17:35----------
within a small


---------17:36----------
like just within a relationship like


---------17:38----------
that expectation


---------17:39----------
is definitely imposed on us through


---------17:41----------
dating standards through


---------17:43----------
media imagery um and then even if you


---------17:45----------
take it from


---------17:46----------
a work standpoint you know meeting a


---------17:48----------
certain level of income the idea of what


---------17:49----------
success for a man looks like


---------17:51----------
is to defeat others in a way uh and to


---------17:55----------
be better


---------17:55----------
and when you consider all these


---------17:57----------
expectations it's like okay i'm 18 i


---------17:59----------
just finished high school


---------18:01----------
i don't know how to approach we're going


---------18:03----------
to be good at it i don't know


---------18:05----------
how to make money i get anxiety about


---------18:07----------
the idea of like how am i going to take


---------18:09----------
care of the people around me i got to


---------18:10----------
take care of a wife and a girlfriend


---------18:12----------
and kids um and so those are the


---------18:15----------
girlfriend wow i know imagine both at


---------18:17----------
the same time depending on culture right


---------18:19----------
um yeah so those expectations are


---------18:23----------
are quite the cross to bear when there's


---------18:26----------
no resources on how to do it that's what


---------18:28----------
i think


---------18:29----------
okay so what what are the expectations


---------18:31----------
that you


---------18:32----------
feel so i'm also hearing kind of a


---------18:35----------
threat you talked about


---------18:36----------
red pill and you know red pill is a i


---------18:38----------
still remember when i was back in


---------18:39----------
college like a couple of my friends got


---------18:41----------
into the pickup artist scene


---------18:43----------
yeah and and so it's it's been


---------18:45----------
interesting to see the


---------18:46----------
evolution of like pickup artists


---------18:49----------
into red pill into i think in cell


---------18:52----------
like i think that there's a lot of


---------18:54----------
common sort of threats there


---------18:57----------
and uh so so what are the expectations


---------19:01----------
that you


---------19:02----------
feel like you've been placed upon your


---------19:05----------
shoulders without


---------19:06----------
insufficient i mean without sufficient


---------19:08----------
guidance


---------19:11----------
um the the two things that come to mind


---------19:14----------
right away


---------19:16----------
are one two to to lead to


---------19:20----------
uh kind of be the trailblazer to be the


---------19:23----------
one who


---------19:25----------
is going to take charge of a situation


---------19:29----------
you know uh that's one and the second


---------19:31----------
thing would be


---------19:32----------
just in a romantic sense um


---------19:36----------
just the idea of knowing how to court


---------19:40----------
somebody


---------19:41----------
you know because i think a lot of us are


---------19:43----------
often starved for affection or do want


---------19:45----------
that kind of like reciprocity in terms


---------19:46----------
of love and things like that


---------19:48----------
but speaking to most men i know they


---------19:50----------
don't know how to do it


---------19:52----------
they don't know how to start that


---------19:54----------
initiative and they get so much anxiety


---------19:56----------
and nervousness about it it's like


---------19:58----------
like what do you know and they know


---------19:59----------
nothing and i'm like i'm not surprised


---------20:01----------
because i knew nothing at 18 or 19 or


---------20:03----------
20.


---------20:04----------
and yeah so those would be like two


---------20:06----------
prime examples i can think of on top of


---------20:08----------
my head


---------20:09----------
and so can you tell us a little bit


---------20:11----------
about um


---------20:13----------
uh can you tell us just a little bit


---------20:16----------
about


---------20:17----------
your kind of sense of what not knowing


---------20:20----------
how to court someone at 18 sort of felt


---------20:22----------
like


---------20:22----------
and kind of where you are now and what


---------20:25----------
that journey has been like


---------20:26----------
oh man oh man so you talk about the pick


---------20:28----------
up fire stuff i i picked up on that


---------20:31----------
you know i the one thing i had in the


---------20:33----------
sense was like thankfully for me and my


---------20:35----------
case like a rejection didn't


---------20:37----------
like murder my self-esteem uh but uh


---------20:39----------
back in the day before like a lot of the


---------20:41----------
tinder stuff really got really popular


---------20:42----------
uh we just had to go up to


---------20:44----------
to women and try to be like hi i think


---------20:46----------
you're gorgeous right or whatever


---------20:48----------
and um i remember what my first couple


---------20:51----------
rejections felt like just just


---------20:53----------
just being like oh man oh


---------20:56----------
i just brutal brutal brutal brutal stuff


---------20:59----------
i remember one time i um


---------21:01----------
i asked this girl at my gym and she


---------21:03----------
accepted she's like yeah you know i get


---------21:04----------
off on friday


---------21:06----------
at five so you can just come meet me


---------21:08----------
there and i was like cool and uh


---------21:11----------
and friday came along and i text her in


---------21:13----------
the morning but she didn't respond but


---------21:14----------
i'm like it's okay we already agreed on


---------21:15----------
the spot so i'll just go there


---------21:16----------
and i came around when her shift ended


---------21:18----------
which is like 5 p.m


---------21:19----------
and waited outside and uh texted up like


---------21:22----------
hey i'm outside she still didn't respond


---------21:23----------
i just remember her walking out with


---------21:25----------
another dude and get in the car and


---------21:26----------
leaving


---------21:26----------
anywhere he got in the cabin i remember


---------21:28----------
jumping into the bushes to hide


---------21:30----------
just brutal stuff man um just the idea


---------21:33----------
of being in a club you know and going up


---------21:34----------
to a girl and


---------21:35----------
and be like hey and just very very


---------21:38----------
mildly


---------21:39----------
and you know they they they snap


---------21:42----------
and and to be clear i just want to say


---------21:44----------
this i i don't get mad at


---------21:45----------
um some people who take


---------21:48----------
will reject very aggressively because i


---------21:50----------
understand sometimes during the night


---------21:52----------
you might get approached 100 times and


---------21:53----------
it can be very


---------21:54----------
taxing to have to say no to people who


---------21:56----------
constantly want something from me but


---------21:58----------
as a dude to try to approach very kindly


---------21:59----------
just to hear that just be like no and


---------22:01----------
it's like


---------22:01----------
yelled in a way that everyone else can


---------22:03----------
hear it's just you just slunk and i've


---------22:05----------
seen it happen so many people around me


---------22:06----------
so


---------22:07----------
um yeah yeah even if i look back on it i


---------22:11----------
just


---------22:11----------
sometimes i still cringe yeah i'm


---------22:14----------
curious what did it


---------22:15----------
what did it feel like when you know you


---------22:17----------
saw her walk out of the gym with another


---------22:19----------
dude


---------22:22----------
uh shame embarrassment uh


---------22:25----------
inadequacy those are like a couple of


---------22:27----------
words that come to mind


---------22:28----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah did you ask yourself


---------22:31----------
did you actually hide


---------22:33----------
oh yeah yeah i hit because uh the way it


---------22:34----------
works is they got a loop around in the


---------22:36----------
cab to come by


---------22:37----------
and i was standing right beside the


---------22:39----------
bushes and so i was far enough to see


---------22:41----------
them


---------22:41----------
and i'm oh man yeah i don't want it


---------22:44----------
brutal i jumped in those bushes


---------22:45----------
yeah because i felt so embarrassed you


---------22:47----------
know what i mean i was like here i am


---------22:48----------
for a date she's leaving some other dude


---------22:50----------
you know


---------22:51----------
so i uh so yeah i remember being 19 of


---------22:54----------
that happening


---------22:55----------
i'll never forget that there's always


---------22:56----------
one of those stories i'm like


---------22:58----------
yeah i i have a fair number of cringe


---------23:01----------
stories myself


---------23:02----------
um and and so then what you know so


---------23:06----------
how did you being such a thoughtful guy


---------23:10----------
how did you like think about you know


---------23:12----------
what


---------23:13----------
how did you approach that so like you


---------23:14----------
clearly saw like there's a problem here


---------23:16----------
right


---------23:17----------
like and and what did you understand was


---------23:19----------
the problem at 19.


---------23:24----------
i just felt like i had no idea what i


---------23:26----------
was doing


---------23:27----------
like i i didn't i felt like i had no


---------23:29----------
game plan i didn't feel


---------23:31----------
it sounds like yeah yeah yeah that's


---------23:33----------
really what it was i had no game


---------23:35----------
one thing i had going in my favor was


---------23:37----------
like even if i took a huge


---------23:38----------
l like that i i would be fine with going


---------23:40----------
back the next day and trying again with


---------23:42----------
somebody different you know sure


---------23:43----------
um so i think that's what but i know


---------23:44----------
dudes who get that once and it was over


---------23:46----------
and


---------23:46----------
my problem was i just didn't have any


---------23:49----------
skill set to understand


---------23:51----------
because i feel like now where i'm at i


---------23:52----------
can understand way more variables


---------23:54----------
than what i could then i couldn't read


---------23:56----------
the social cues i didn't understand


---------23:57----------
what it looked like when someone was


---------23:59----------
interested or what they weren't little


---------24:01----------
signs that i could pick up on to


---------24:04----------
better handle the situation uh and


---------24:07----------
at 19 i just didn't have that skill set


---------24:09----------
so i would go in blind and i would leave


---------24:11----------
blind and just with a bunch of things i


---------24:13----------
saw and i can't make sense of so


---------24:15----------
that was my issue at the time and how


---------24:17----------
did you think about approaching it like


---------24:19----------
you know what did you think about what


---------24:22----------
were you going to do about it like


---------24:23----------
you're like okay i'm blind


---------24:26----------
yeah i'm going to look for for guidance


---------24:28----------
i'm going to look for for for


---------24:29----------
instructions you know


---------24:30----------
i come from a gamer background when you


---------24:32----------
can't figure something out you look for


---------24:33----------
a walk-through


---------24:34----------
you know yeah absolutely so it was the


---------24:36----------
same idea i just


---------24:37----------
i needed some advice and you know i'm


---------24:40----------
sure folks google this on all ends how


---------24:42----------
do i make someone like me or how do i do


---------24:43----------
this right we all looking for answers to


---------24:46----------
find acceptance for somebody and that's


---------24:47----------
what i did


---------24:49----------
and did you feel like uh you kind of


---------24:51----------
alluded to the fact that maybe you


---------24:52----------
didn't have


---------24:53----------
sort of personal guidance or kind of


---------24:55----------
mentorship sort of growing up


---------24:57----------
so did you feel like you there wasn't


---------24:59----------
anyone you could kind of talk to in your


---------25:01----------
personal life that could maybe guide you


---------25:03----------
like yeah i think it's twofold i think i


---------25:05----------
didn't have that and secondly i think i


---------25:06----------
would have felt shame to ask someone


---------25:08----------
directly that i'm like i feel inadequate


---------25:10----------
approaching women you know yeah i think


---------25:13----------
it's those two things


---------25:14----------
because it's kind of it sounds pathetic


---------25:16----------
like man i don't know how to approach


---------25:17----------
ghosts to somebody


---------25:18----------
you know yeah it doesn't sound great


---------25:22----------
yeah so i think a lot of people look for


---------25:23----------
those resources but don't want to admit


---------25:24----------
that they're looking for them


---------25:25----------
so so i think that too uh if you know


---------25:28----------
just what i'm hearing there is there's


---------25:29----------
actually like a really subtle


---------25:30----------
expectation there yeah that it is oddly


---------25:33----------
enough


---------25:34----------
everyone's ignorant and it's completely


---------25:36----------
unacceptable to be ignorant


---------25:38----------
even amongst men that would be shameful


---------25:40----------
to another dude it would be like so


---------25:42----------
pathetic if you're like


---------25:43----------
hey man how do you pick up chicks like i


---------25:45----------
don't know how to pick up chicks


---------25:47----------
yeah yeah and then they'd look at you


---------25:48----------
and they'd be like you're a loser


---------25:50----------
yeah and even worse than that i've


---------25:53----------
watched


---------25:53----------
guys go up to folks in clubs right and


---------25:56----------
and just go very kindly it's like hey


---------25:58----------
can i get you a drinking


---------25:59----------
girl says no and i understand that but


---------26:01----------
sometimes i would hear the girls


---------26:02----------
afterwards like


---------26:03----------
i was such a [ __ ] creep and and and


---------26:05----------
the guy would be with an earshot to hear


---------26:07----------
it but i was just


---------26:08----------
like oh he just doesn't know what he's


---------26:09----------
doing and


---------26:12----------
and i and i think oftentimes women don't


---------26:14----------
know


---------26:15----------
how much we don't know what we're doing


---------26:19----------
and sometimes a lack of skills is seen


---------26:22----------
as


---------26:23----------
predatory or somehow like very gross and


---------26:26----------
disgusting when it's just like man


---------26:28----------
i feel bad for the hobie like he's he's


---------26:30----------
21 this is his first time inside a club


---------26:32----------
he doesn't know


---------26:33----------
so yeah yeah i feel bad i feel oh yeah i


---------26:36----------
feel bad


---------26:37----------
yeah i can see it i can see there's


---------26:39----------
something you know you're really


---------26:40----------
resonating with something there


---------26:43----------
because that was me so i know what he's


---------26:44----------
thinking you know i know what he's


---------26:46----------
feeling right now that when you


---------26:48----------
when you get rejected the the the the


---------26:50----------
dejection that you feel afterwards


---------26:53----------
and i'm not talking about when someone


---------26:54----------
says no to you on tinder because you


---------26:56----------
know


---------26:56----------
even that's manageable you're in the


---------26:58----------
privacy of your own home i think that's


---------27:00----------
why a lot of people actually don't


---------27:01----------
you know go up to folks in person as


---------27:03----------
much anymore is because they have


---------27:05----------
they can better preserve themselves by


---------27:07----------
doing things online but


---------27:08----------
when i used to watch it all the time it


---------27:10----------
was very difficult to watch at times


---------27:12----------
yeah i think tinder has its own set of


---------27:14----------
you know toxicity but


---------27:16----------
what i'm really hearing from you is that


---------27:18----------
there's sort of this expectation of


---------27:20----------
competence from both your male peers


---------27:23----------
and from the women that you approach


---------27:24----------
that like you should know how to do this


---------27:26----------
better


---------27:27----------
like yeah even looking at the idea like


---------27:30----------
men have to be the leaders of the


---------27:32----------
household and that's like a common thing


---------27:33----------
that people


---------27:34----------
still hold on to despite the fact that


---------27:35----------
women are extremely successful in terms


---------27:37----------
of like


---------27:37----------
i think they're outpacing men for


---------27:38----------
degrees now and and out earning men


---------27:40----------
coming straight out of university and


---------27:42----------
college so


---------27:42----------
there's still that idea that men still


---------27:44----------
got to do all this stuff even though


---------27:45----------
they seem to be failing perpetually and


---------27:47----------
gradually getting worse in some regards


---------27:49----------
and so even just that expectation is


---------27:51----------
daunting for a lot of men


---------27:53----------
yeah you know this is kind of i don't


---------27:55----------
want to charge


---------27:57----------
the discussion but one thing that i've


---------27:58----------
noticed is really interesting is that


---------28:01----------
you know sometimes being a psychiatrist


---------28:03----------
i get the opportunity to ask


---------28:05----------
men and women sort of personal questions


---------28:07----------
about their


---------28:08----------
you know who they would date and things


---------28:10----------
like that it's a common


---------28:11----------
concern and i'm really surprised by um


---------28:14----------
the


---------28:14----------
you know the high high percentage of


---------28:16----------
women that


---------28:18----------
uh really feel like if a man is not


---------28:20----------
financially successful


---------28:22----------
that they're not an acceptable like


---------28:25----------
partner


---------28:26----------
um and and the interesting thing is that


---------28:28----------
when i talk you know so


---------28:30----------
i feel like oftentimes i hear keep in


---------28:33----------
mind this isn't data or anything that's


---------28:34----------
just anecdotal


---------28:35----------
could have a lot to do with the


---------28:36----------
selection bias and the you know the


---------28:38----------
people who wind up in my office


---------28:40----------
um but that it's kind of completely


---------28:41----------
acceptable to


---------28:43----------
a lot of my male patients that they have


---------28:45----------
a partner that doesn't


---------28:46----------
earn money and that a homemaker is like


---------28:50----------
a laudable position but


---------28:53----------
women that that i have as patients don't


---------28:55----------
really feel the same way they're


---------28:57----------
actually very few


---------28:58----------
um but some of them you know are okay


---------29:00----------
with that yeah


---------29:01----------
yeah so that's good that's been my


---------29:04----------
experience and and um


---------29:05----------
i don't think it's necessarily wrong or


---------29:07----------
evil i i'm this is not a critique of a


---------29:09----------
woman or anything like that


---------29:10----------
to me it just speaks to the expectation


---------29:12----------
that's placed on men to


---------29:13----------
live up to a certain role um and


---------29:17----------
and and yeah if you look at the


---------29:18----------
hierarchy of needs uh like within data


---------29:20----------
but if you don't want to go there we


---------29:21----------
don't have to it's like yeah there is


---------29:23----------
that expectation on much of a societal


---------29:25----------
level even in like a


---------29:26----------
as progressive as countries as you can


---------29:29----------
imagine there's still a lot of those uh


---------29:30----------
same roles uh being existing


---------29:34----------
you know the interesting thing just to


---------29:35----------
toss this out speaking of anecdotal


---------29:37----------
experiences when i talk to


---------29:38----------
women about who they're accepted


---------29:42----------
who they're willing to date the


---------29:43----------
interesting thing is that half of their


---------29:44----------
hesitation doesn't come from a personal


---------29:46----------
standard and actually now that i think


---------29:48----------
about it


---------29:48----------
comes from a societal standard yeah so


---------29:51----------
it's it's more about like


---------29:53----------
you know what are my parents gonna think


---------29:55----------
kind of thing


---------29:56----------
yeah um and


---------30:00----------
anyway yeah it's interesting yeah


---------30:04----------
um so and then what what did you


---------30:08----------
do about it so it sounds like you


---------30:09----------
googled how do i get someone to like you


---------30:11----------
and what else did you do about


---------30:12----------
you know learning how to do this thing i


---------30:15----------
had nobody i felt like i could talk to


---------30:17----------
about this kind of stuff


---------30:18----------
because of the shame so i think i went


---------30:20----------
on to online forums and internet


---------30:21----------
because one it gave me anonymity and two


---------30:23----------
it reflected my lived experience


---------30:25----------
so with those two things i was like okay


---------30:27----------
i'm not alone in this which is already a


---------30:28----------
great feeling


---------30:29----------
other people feel super inadequate like


---------30:31----------
me and we could talk it out and kind of


---------30:33----------
share ideas


---------30:34----------
and then the third thing is then


---------30:36----------
afterwards i was led to some resources


---------30:37----------
um i don't know if you've ever heard of


---------30:39----------
the show there's a show that used to be


---------30:40----------
called keys to the vip


---------30:41----------
lasted i think three seasons it was a


---------30:43----------
show where you know


---------30:44----------
two guys would be sent to a nightclub


---------30:46----------
and they would you know be asked to


---------30:48----------
you know try to pick up women and try to


---------30:50----------
do so in creative ways


---------30:51----------
and i would watch every episode just so


---------30:53----------
i'm like oh okay i'm i'm


---------30:54----------
i'm learning you know uh and it got


---------30:57----------
cancelled uh obviously because some


---------30:58----------
people felt the show was unacceptable in


---------31:00----------
that regards even though these guys


---------31:01----------
weren't being pigs or anything weird


---------31:02----------
um what kind of stuff were they doing


---------31:06----------
ah they go up and then sometimes they


---------31:07----------
would pretend that they were deaf and


---------31:09----------
they did


---------31:09----------
like can i get they'd have to write on a


---------31:11----------
cute car to see if they could talk to


---------31:12----------
the person they would basically handicap


---------31:14----------
themselves


---------31:16----------
they would handicap themselves to see


---------31:17----------
like see how i can do it how easy it is


---------31:19----------
so um it would be stuff like that and a


---------31:23----------
lot of times i would just be out there


---------31:24----------
laughing


---------31:24----------
um and so yeah it was just that would be


---------31:27----------
the kind of stuff that they were doing


---------31:29----------
and um i think i think the idea of


---------31:31----------
picking up women is just revolting to


---------31:33----------
people you know


---------31:34----------
like learning skills we're expected to


---------31:36----------
be confident


---------31:37----------
but learning skills to do it is seen as


---------31:39----------
gross or trying too hard


---------31:42----------
that's like the the weird dichotomy i


---------31:44----------
see


---------31:45----------
yeah so i think some of that has to do


---------31:47----------
with what the implication of picking up


---------31:49----------
women is


---------31:50----------
you know i think that there's there's


---------31:52----------
sort of an implication in the pickup


---------31:53----------
artist community in the red pill


---------31:55----------
community that


---------31:56----------
most relationships should be like


---------31:58----------
relatively temporary and and


---------32:00----------
be especially in the red pill community


---------32:02----------
it seems like there's sort of a


---------32:03----------
it's a zero-sum game so the more you get


---------32:06----------
out of the relationship the more she


---------32:07----------
loses


---------32:09----------
um and vice versa right like in the red


---------32:11----------
pill community there's a winner and a


---------32:12----------
loser and either you're the loser in the


---------32:15----------
relationship or you're the winner in the


---------32:16----------
relationship


---------32:18----------
um but but i i think that you know


---------32:21----------
picking up women sort of has a certain


---------32:23----------
connotation to it which i think evokes


---------32:26----------
i i i mean when you say picking up women


---------32:29----------
i don't


---------32:30----------
hear i don't assume that that means


---------32:33----------
you're looking for a girlfriend


---------32:35----------
what do you think i think if you use


---------32:38----------
that term


---------32:39----------
no yeah you know to me to me just


---------32:42----------
strikes me as like


---------32:44----------
bad branding in this sense because if


---------32:47----------
you think about all those dudes who did


---------32:48----------
most of that pick up our stuff they're


---------32:50----------
all married with kids or they've all had


---------32:51----------
to settle down


---------32:52----------
um and well a lot of the ones that i


---------32:56----------
used to follow often times too and even


---------32:58----------
people i follow within the red pill


---------32:59----------
community advocate for the ideas of


---------33:00----------
relationships and stuff like that


---------33:02----------
though i can't understand that


---------33:02----------
connotation and there's definitely been


---------33:04----------
you know bad examples


---------33:06----------
and in bad representation that regards i


---------33:09----------
would argue


---------33:09----------
that the idea of being in a relationship


---------33:11----------
and being married is definitely


---------33:12----------
wanted by most men even within those


---------33:14----------
communities it's just uh


---------33:16----------
i don't think it's necessarily put to


---------33:17----------
the forefront or prioritized or


---------33:20----------
it's not nearly as appealing in terms of


---------33:23----------
the brochure for why you would apply do


---------33:26----------
you know what i mean


---------33:27----------
yeah absolutely i think the brochure


---------33:30----------
i mean there's i have a lot of thoughts


---------33:32----------
um we're actually hopefully coming out


---------33:34----------
with a research paper on some of the


---------33:35----------
stuff


---------33:36----------
in the next couple months um but


---------33:39----------
i so let's just i'm just a little bit


---------33:41----------
curious about your personal journey so


---------33:42----------
like what happened next


---------33:45----------
yeah um you know i think as i


---------33:49----------
started being more bold and started


---------33:52----------
just trying different things i would


---------33:55----------
once again still fail a tremendous


---------33:56----------
amount but


---------33:57----------
i started to feel like i was


---------34:02----------
the affection or interest i would show


---------34:04----------
towards women would be reciprocated more


---------34:06----------
often so i was like oh this stuff is


---------34:07----------
working


---------34:08----------
uh and you know i think as you


---------34:11----------
get more involved with that stuff um


---------34:15----------
then you start to to fall on some pit


---------34:17----------
traps uh i


---------34:20----------
i would say that i got to a point where


---------34:25----------
it's like it's like when you're when you


---------34:28----------
want something for so long and you're


---------34:29----------
starved for it and then you get it you


---------34:30----------
don't know how to


---------34:32----------
hold the floodgate so i think i just


---------34:33----------
started dating way too often i was doing


---------34:34----------
too much and i was too


---------34:36----------
engrossed in the idea of of wanting to


---------34:38----------
be liked


---------34:39----------
um so i think that became something that


---------34:42----------
i was really involved i was dating all


---------34:43----------
the time i was


---------34:44----------
going out i was on tinder so um


---------34:48----------
yeah i was like oh i can do this now i


---------34:50----------
can do what a lot of dudes can't do so


---------34:51----------
i'm not going to stop and


---------34:53----------
uh yeah so i'm going to kind of ask you


---------34:56----------
i have a


---------34:58----------
this is a sort of a hypothesis-driven


---------35:00----------
question but


---------35:01----------
so when you say it it was working or it


---------35:04----------
worked what do you think


---------35:05----------
was working what do you think was


---------35:07----------
responsible for your


---------35:09----------
change in fortune like it sounds like


---------35:11----------
you were able to date a lot


---------35:13----------
you know was it the pickup artist kind


---------35:15----------
of like was it watching this tv show or


---------35:17----------
like


---------35:18----------
how did you learn to get better


---------35:22----------
um repetition i'm going to be honest


---------35:26----------
it was repetition and


---------35:29----------
um coming more into myself and being


---------35:31----------
able to share more of myself with folks


---------35:34----------
uh that was it because i feel like when


---------35:36----------
you have all this anxiety


---------35:37----------
and you're constantly nervous and you're


---------35:38----------
getting in your own way they don't get


---------35:40----------
to see you they just see


---------35:41----------
confusion and i and i think i just felt


---------35:44----------
much more calm


---------35:45----------
in circumstances uh when i had


---------35:47----------
conversations it wasn't necessarily


---------35:49----------
somebody i was trying to


---------35:50----------
date or be sleep with it was i'm just


---------35:52----------
talking to a person and i think as i


---------35:53----------
got to that sense of comfort then it was


---------35:56----------
fine yeah


---------35:57----------
so i i that was sort of what i was


---------36:00----------
imagining yeah that's been sort of


---------36:03----------
you know in a sense my experience


---------36:05----------
although it's very limited


---------36:06----------
and really like observing other people's


---------36:08----------
experiences


---------36:10----------
right um is that there isn't sort of a


---------36:12----------
magic trick it really is


---------36:14----------
about kind of being your best self


---------36:17----------
um and you know the more that you can


---------36:20----------
just be your best self like people will


---------36:21----------
be


---------36:22----------
you know that's going to be attractive


---------36:23----------
to hopefully some people


---------36:25----------
usually some people yeah but it's


---------36:27----------
getting there


---------36:28----------
it's getting there that's the problem


---------36:30----------
it's getting there it's a problem and


---------36:31----------
when you feel an adequate


---------36:33----------
you know it's like you first it's like


---------36:35----------
this even with artistic


---------36:37----------
approaches to to like singing or dancing


---------36:40----------
you you start off by imitating others


---------36:42----------
and then as you do so through that


---------36:43----------
process you start to find your own voice


---------36:45----------
and i felt like dating is like that too


---------36:47----------
like you know or like approaching and me


---------36:49----------
you know breaking that ice that tension


---------36:51----------
that awkwardness


---------36:52----------
it's very difficult at first if you have


---------36:54----------
nothing to lean on that's what i found


---------36:57----------
yeah and and so then what happened it


---------37:00----------
sounded like you were dating quite


---------37:01----------
successfully


---------37:03----------
yeah you'd become you you'd become the


---------37:05----------
chad of your dreams


---------37:07----------
yeah yeah we didn't have that


---------37:08----------
terminology back then but yeah yeah i


---------37:10----------
suppose so


---------37:11----------
and then how did you what was that like


---------37:13----------
for you


---------37:15----------
it was just a lot of excess it was just


---------37:17----------
too much of of


---------37:18----------
of something that's not the best way i


---------37:20----------
could describe it what do you mean by


---------37:22----------
that can you help us understand a little


---------37:23----------
bit


---------37:24----------
uh yeah it's just too much time too much


---------37:26----------
energy


---------37:27----------
um it's like i got lost in the sauce you


---------37:31----------
know i


---------37:32----------
my day would be spent and the day would


---------37:33----------
pass by i'm like what did i do today


---------37:35----------
okay


---------37:36----------
and i just and a lot of it was


---------37:37----------
meaningless like which


---------37:39----------
not everything has to be meaningful but


---------37:41----------
i think i value my time


---------37:42----------
and as i discovered other things that i


---------37:45----------
was passionate about interested in i


---------37:46----------
started to realize my priorities weren't


---------37:48----------
in the right place


---------37:49----------
i um yeah i was too busy chasing a high


---------37:53----------
if you will i think that's yeah


---------37:54----------
i felt it was the the mark of a true


---------37:56----------
chat is to be like oh i'm dating too


---------37:58----------
much


---------37:59----------
yeah yeah yeah yeah i know i know and i


---------38:02----------
have this conversation all the time


---------38:03----------
because like people who who haven't been


---------38:04----------
there are like yeah you're just saying


---------38:06----------
that i'm like


---------38:07----------
it's hard for me to tell them that the


---------38:08----------
grass is not green on the other side if


---------38:10----------
they haven't been there


---------38:11----------
uh because their whole life they've been


---------38:13----------
told this is the ideal thing to go for


---------38:14----------
so yeah yeah and and what i'm hearing is


---------38:17----------
that you know you got to the other side


---------38:19----------
you thought the grass was greener and


---------38:20----------
you're like actually this isn't


---------38:22----------
yeah yeah same thing happened to all my


---------38:24----------
friends too all my friends had the same


---------38:26----------
experience


---------38:27----------
and that experience was dating a lot and


---------38:29----------
dating intensively and


---------38:30----------
yeah yeah they were starved for


---------38:34----------
for females attention and then


---------38:35----------
afterwards once they got it


---------38:37----------
and they they started being very


---------38:38----------
gratuitous with it they realized like oh


---------38:41----------
this is not that great and i was like i


---------38:42----------
know


---------38:43----------
we had this conversation but sometimes


---------38:45----------
you got to experience it to understand


---------38:46----------
it so i try not to be too preachy about


---------38:48----------
it


---------38:50----------
and then what happened um


---------38:55----------
okay so i think i need to go backwards a


---------38:57----------
little bit as you start to enter the red


---------38:58----------
pill environment you know one idea is


---------39:00----------
like you see the truth of what it is


---------39:01----------
you're not supposed to go up to a girl


---------39:02----------
just like


---------39:03----------
here's some flowers you know like


---------39:04----------
there's a way you can come with some


---------39:05----------
confidence and things like that


---------39:07----------
to garner that affection but then that


---------39:09----------
also


---------39:11----------
trickles into more political uh


---------39:13----------
discussions about


---------39:14----------
you know what are men's struggles and


---------39:17----------
why you're struggling and


---------39:18----------
why is the city society is built this


---------39:20----------
way and what your burden and


---------39:21----------
responsibility are


---------39:23----------
and how women really are so you'd hear


---------39:25----------
that kind of rhetoric a lot and that


---------39:26----------
would be engrossed into some of the


---------39:28----------
um pickup artist ideas that you would


---------39:30----------
hear about often


---------39:31----------
so as i would hear that it began to


---------39:41----------
i would i would sometimes within my


---------39:43----------
dating experiences have things happen


---------39:44----------
that i was like


---------39:45----------
what was that you know whether it be


---------39:47----------
being groped or


---------39:49----------
uh women being physically uh abused i


---------39:51----------
don't like using the word abusive but


---------39:52----------
you know like getting slapped


---------39:55----------
for a disagreement you know within like


---------39:57----------
a dating context i was like


---------39:59----------
how do you feel this comfortable hitting


---------40:00----------
me in front of other people and when i


---------40:02----------
would bring this up to folks i would be


---------40:04----------
almost often gaslit into thinking like


---------40:06----------
oh this is not that big of a deal and


---------40:08----------
i'm like and i'm someone who


---------40:12----------
i really dislike it when people put


---------40:15----------
their hands on me


---------40:17----------
in a non like in a non-intimate sense


---------40:21----------
you know when they do it as a sense of


---------40:22----------
control whether or a sense of like


---------40:24----------
aggression


---------40:25----------
it triggers me to to a point i can't


---------40:27----------
explain even if it's like little stuff


---------40:28----------
like


---------40:29----------
like oh i don't have to you know just


---------40:31----------
little things like that can really set


---------40:32----------
me off and


---------40:33----------
i couldn't under imagine me grabbing


---------40:36----------
somebody when they didn't want to be


---------40:37----------
grabbed or


---------40:38----------
and i would see this stuff and when i


---------40:39----------
would bring it up to people and i would


---------40:40----------
see the nightclubs and stuff like that


---------40:41----------
i'm just like


---------40:43----------
and the only time i ever saw that issue


---------40:44----------
reflected or people talking about


---------40:46----------
some of the comfort that people feel


---------40:48----------
touching others i was when i was in the


---------40:49----------
red pill community so


---------40:50----------
it started warping my perception of um


---------40:55----------
of women to some degree and uh made me


---------40:57----------
resentful


---------40:59----------
um even the idea that i had to be the


---------41:01----------
one who makes the first move and i had


---------41:02----------
to be


---------41:03----------
the one who puts my self-esteem on the


---------41:06----------
line when i go up to somebody i'm like


---------41:07----------
hey i'm really interested in


---------41:08----------
and i get yelled at and i'm supposed to


---------41:09----------
just accept that that's my job as a man


---------41:12----------
to do that


---------41:12----------
i became resentful of like the the


---------41:16----------
burden that society placed on me and i


---------41:18----------
think


---------41:19----------
that community kind of fueled it with


---------41:20----------
some of the ideas because i found other


---------41:22----------
people


---------41:23----------
who felt the exact same way uh and so


---------41:25----------
you have this like kind of echo chamber


---------41:27----------
and


---------41:28----------
as i grew older i decided to kind of


---------41:30----------
slink away from that because i started


---------41:32----------
to realize it was clouding my judgment


---------41:34----------
how did you make that realization it was


---------41:37----------
progressive you know i i i'd like to


---------41:40----------
believe


---------41:40----------
that i'm introspective enough to


---------41:42----------
acknowledge when i'm holding on to a bad


---------41:44----------
idea


---------41:44----------
and i was questioned on things i can't


---------41:47----------
tell you an exact moment but i remember


---------41:48----------
being questioned on certain things and


---------41:50----------
i would sit with those ideas and i'm


---------41:51----------
like if i look at this logically it


---------41:53----------
doesn't make sense


---------41:54----------
and so i just had to re-examine things


---------41:56----------
uh you know


---------41:57----------
try to study a little bit and be like am


---------41:59----------
i holding on to this because


---------42:02----------
it's it's reflective of some of my


---------42:03----------
experiences and and


---------42:05----------
you know am i holding on to this due to


---------42:07----------
like


---------42:08----------
anger resentment or am i holding on to


---------42:10----------
this because it's a sound idea and i


---------42:11----------
think just a bit of that reflection kind


---------42:13----------
of made me realize you weren't


---------42:14----------
there were great ideas yeah so you know


---------42:17----------
it's it's kind of


---------42:18----------
staggering but i want to share like one


---------42:20----------
or two experiences that really terrified


---------42:22----------
me


---------42:23----------
so i one time was talking to a sexual


---------42:25----------
assault victim who was


---------42:27----------
um uh you know


---------42:30----------
a tall


---------42:34----------
you know well-built man who was


---------42:37----------
um sexually assaulted by like a five


---------42:39----------
foot three woman


---------42:41----------
and uh they were at a party and she um


---------42:44----------
basically climbed on top of him


---------42:47----------
and he felt really scared and like he


---------42:50----------
felt like you know he couldn't explain


---------42:51----------
to other people that like


---------42:53----------
because they would look at the physical


---------42:54----------
difference and they would say how on


---------42:56----------
earth could you


---------42:58----------
not defend yourself in that situation


---------43:00----------
yep


---------43:01----------
and then so i i asked him i was like you


---------43:03----------
know when people sit like so i just


---------43:04----------
asked him


---------43:05----------
why didn't you feel like you could


---------43:06----------
defend yourself and he was like if i


---------43:08----------
defended myself my chances of going to


---------43:10----------
jail were so much higher


---------43:12----------
because what would it look like if i if


---------43:14----------
i like pick her up


---------43:16----------
and throw her off like like she was


---------43:18----------
persistent like he pushed her away


---------43:21----------
she didn't and she falls awkwardly yep


---------43:24----------
and and so like what is like is he


---------43:26----------
supposed to hit her across the face


---------43:29----------
like he can absolutely physically


---------43:30----------
overpower her he can knock her


---------43:32----------
unconscious


---------43:34----------
but what happens then um


---------43:37----------
and and so he felt incredibly powerless


---------43:40----------
incredibly


---------43:42----------
he felt stuck like he couldn't do


---------43:44----------
anything about it


---------43:46----------
um and so it was it was just really


---------43:49----------
i never until i you know until i heard


---------43:51----------
him say something like that i had never


---------43:54----------
thought you know i never thought about


---------43:57----------
that


---------43:58----------
yeah yeah there's a there's a layer even


---------44:00----------
above that i


---------44:01----------
am there's this one lady who i knew who


---------44:05----------
was a


---------44:06----------
teacher at a at a school she basically


---------44:08----------
taught like the


---------44:09----------
progressive ideas of um gender studies


---------44:12----------
and uh me and her some conversations in


---------44:14----------
the past and i remember on new year's


---------44:16----------
eve i think it's like 2018.


---------44:18----------
i was uh i was at a club and and she


---------44:20----------
came up to me and she was like oh it's


---------44:21----------
good to see you i'm good to see you as


---------44:22----------
well


---------44:23----------
and um she's a little bit intoxicated i


---------44:25----------
was very sober and she kind of


---------44:26----------
approached me


---------44:27----------
trying to get close and i was like i'm


---------44:29----------
i'm not interested in i remember like


---------44:31----------
just before the countdown hit i was


---------44:32----------
heading towards the bathroom she was


---------44:33----------
coming out of it she said oh good to see


---------44:34----------
you and i'm like yeah good to see you as


---------44:35----------
well


---------44:36----------
and and she just went right away and


---------44:38----------
groped me right and


---------44:39----------
i remember being like what are you doing


---------44:41----------
and she immediately just lunged at me to


---------44:43----------
make out right


---------44:44----------
and and as her lifts my mind i pushed


---------44:45----------
her off um


---------44:48----------
and i just remember thinking like what


---------44:51----------
just happened right now right


---------44:52----------
and


---------44:56----------
maybe a week later i just remember


---------44:58----------
seeing her on social media just talking


---------45:00----------
about boundaries and how it's important


---------45:01----------
for men to respond i just


---------45:03----------
i remember being so angry at that moment


---------45:06----------
i remember he's so mad


---------45:07----------
and and i think it kind of reflected an


---------45:11----------
experience that i had in my life where i


---------45:12----------
i would look at things that would happen


---------45:14----------
like that


---------45:16----------
and the the really difficult thing for


---------45:18----------
me was accepting that


---------45:19----------
some of the women who would do this


---------45:20----------
stuff weren't necessarily bad people


---------45:24----------
you know like whether it be slapping a


---------45:25----------
guy or things like that when they get


---------45:26----------
really angry they weren't necessarily


---------45:28----------
bad people


---------45:30----------
but i also saw how nobody held them


---------45:32----------
accountable when they did some of these


---------45:34----------
things


---------45:34----------
because of the perceived size difference


---------45:37----------
because of the idea that


---------45:38----------
a man being hit really doesn't have any


---------45:40----------
implications or his boundaries being


---------45:42----------
violated doesn't really


---------45:43----------
matter you know and


---------45:47----------
i when i had a conversation with one


---------45:48----------
person i was like do you not realize


---------45:50----------
that you


---------45:51----------
are doing something wrong when you put


---------45:52----------
your hands on me that way and the person


---------45:54----------
has to sit with it and come to the real


---------45:55----------
understanding like oh i did something


---------45:57----------
[ __ ] up


---------45:57----------
but it dawned on me that this person at


---------45:59----------
27 had never been told that before


---------46:01----------
and it felt comfortable doing that in


---------46:03----------
the past and it was like


---------46:05----------
we got a bigger problem this is not just


---------46:07----------
a matter of like individuals it's also a


---------46:09----------
matter of like messaging and


---------46:10----------
and and and how we have these


---------46:13----------
conversations


---------46:14----------
you know every guy i've ever spoken to


---------46:16----------
could tell me of experiences where


---------46:17----------
they've had


---------46:18----------
people place their hands on them you


---------46:19----------
know from the opposite section um


---------46:22----------
and they just they just never talk about


---------46:24----------
it like uh it is what it is


---------46:26----------
i'm like oh okay yeah yeah


---------46:29----------
yeah that was a tough one it was a tough


---------46:31----------
one to be like i can't hate this person


---------46:32----------
because they're not evil


---------46:34----------
but that what they do what they're doing


---------46:35----------
is terrible


---------46:37----------
yeah so what i'm i'm hearing is that you


---------46:40----------
know also like it in a sense i i think


---------46:42----------
you can't really blame someone if you


---------46:43----------
never give them feedback


---------46:45----------
and what i'm hearing is that people


---------46:46----------
aren't really getting feedback


---------46:48----------
that yeah it's it's hard though it's


---------46:50----------
hard to give someone feedback who


---------46:52----------
violated your boundaries because then it


---------46:53----------
means that you as a man have to accept


---------46:55----------
the idea that


---------46:56----------
someone did something wrong to you which


---------46:58----------
is not a conversation you want to have


---------47:00----------
like i don't even like to refer to it as


---------47:01----------
abuse


---------47:02----------
even though by definition it would


---------47:03----------
technically be categorized like that's


---------47:05----------
not how i perceived it but


---------47:06----------
you know it is what it is and to have


---------47:09----------
that conversation should mean


---------47:10----------
i have to relive that and then i also


---------47:12----------
have to confront them which is


---------47:14----------
why don't you see it as abuse


---------47:18----------
maybe maybe it's more so because of my


---------47:22----------
response to it isn't like


---------47:26----------
to me just i guess this is how i


---------47:28----------
interpret it but maybe i'm lying to


---------47:29----------
myself i just


---------47:30----------
see it as like blatantly disrespectful


---------47:32----------
that's what i think when i


---------47:33----------
when i think back to that experience i


---------47:35----------
would never do that to you i would never


---------47:38----------
like


---------47:38----------
not care about your boundaries so much


---------47:40----------
that i would just do that i just


---------47:41----------
couldn't imagine


---------47:42----------
but for you to do that like where do you


---------47:44----------
get off feeling that comfortable and i


---------47:45----------
think that's why i don't necessarily


---------47:46----------
categorize abuse because i didn't feel


---------47:47----------
necessarily


---------47:49----------
violated per se so i think that's why i


---------47:52----------
would see them


---------47:53----------
and maybe that's wrong but that's just


---------47:55----------
my perception of it


---------47:56----------
and so where so it sounds like you kind


---------47:58----------
of cooled off on dating you had a couple


---------48:00----------
of


---------48:01----------
relatively you know negative experiences


---------48:03----------
here and there like where are you


---------48:04----------
nowadays


---------48:06----------
oh things are really peaceful you know


---------48:08----------
like i i think one thing i value within


---------48:10----------
my day in life now is just um


---------48:12----------
peacefulness you know not that there's


---------48:14----------
never conflict but that we can like


---------48:16----------
get through this stuff in in a in a


---------48:19----------
peaceful way if you will


---------48:20----------
and um it's good


---------48:24----------
it's good um i


---------48:28----------
i don't feel any compulsive needs like i


---------48:29----------
used to i mean you know sometimes the


---------48:31----------
ego flares up and you want to dabble a


---------48:32----------
little bit but


---------48:33----------
for the most part things are pretty


---------48:35----------
quiet and i'm kind of grateful for that


---------48:37----------
because i get to put my


---------48:38----------
energy towards things that matter a


---------48:39----------
little bit more and then i don't like


---------48:41----------
that


---------48:42----------
um you know about this may sound a


---------48:43----------
little bit weird but you know we're


---------48:45----------
talking about how people don't have


---------48:47----------
guidance and i'm curious is there


---------48:48----------
something that


---------48:49----------
um you want guidance on now


---------48:53----------
like um


---------48:57----------
i think for me in the next chapter of my


---------48:59----------
day in life my relationship


---------49:00----------
i think it's just a matter of going


---------49:02----------
through it i don't think i necessarily


---------49:03----------
need


---------49:04----------
guidance at the moment per se i just


---------49:08----------
i just constantly see people suffering


---------49:09----------
and they're coming to me with their


---------49:10----------
suffering and i'm just like man there's


---------49:11----------
a lot a lot of people are going through


---------49:13----------
what i went through before so


---------49:14----------
i think that's more and what is it what


---------49:17----------
is it that they're going through


---------49:21----------
uh that feeling of inadequacy that


---------49:22----------
feeling of not knowing you know we do


---------49:24----------
these call-in shows and


---------49:25----------
and every day without fail i get i've


---------49:27----------
been surprised by this i get 16 to 21


---------49:30----------
year olds hitting me up like i don't


---------49:31----------
know what i'm doing and i feel not


---------49:33----------
confident and i feel like i suck


---------49:35----------
and i just want to give up on this all


---------49:36----------
together what do you say to them


---------49:40----------
i tell them to have patience with


---------49:41----------
themselves because this is going to proc


---------49:44----------
is a process


---------49:44----------
and i also remind them like if you don't


---------49:46----------
put yourself out there there's no chance


---------49:48----------
for you to really have any sense of


---------49:49----------
success in this regard you know like


---------49:51----------
you can't shield yourself from from love


---------49:53----------
and also get the benefits of it you have


---------49:55----------
to


---------49:56----------
take some form of a leap so to give up


---------49:58----------
is not in your best interest but also


---------50:00----------
understand you have a lot of time ahead


---------50:01----------
of you


---------50:02----------
even though the world tells you as an 18


---------50:03----------
year old you're an adult and you need to


---------50:04----------
know what you're doing like most 18 year


---------50:05----------
olds don't know


---------50:06----------
you know and so just to be patient with


---------50:08----------
themselves and to to remind themselves


---------50:10----------
that there's time for them to to grow


---------50:13----------
and and so that's a great response i


---------50:15----------
think it's it's kind of interesting


---------50:18----------
because there's also sort of like uh i


---------50:20----------
don't know if this is


---------50:22----------
maybe this is my own bias where i i'm


---------50:26----------
interpreting what you're saying is


---------50:28----------
having a certain like masculine quality


---------50:31----------
you know of and maybe that's unfair


---------50:33----------
maybe it's


---------50:34----------
it's neither masculine or feminine but


---------50:36----------
just human is really when i stop and


---------50:37----------
think about it but i noticed that


---------50:40----------
i had sort of a masculine response to


---------50:42----------
that which is like that's what men do


---------50:43----------
right like you got to put yourself


---------50:44----------
out there you gotta you gotta brave the


---------50:47----------
danger if you want the reward


---------50:49----------
yeah and and that's something that you


---------50:51----------
know sort of a very like masculine ethos


---------50:54----------
that i think we kind of project but at


---------50:56----------
the end of the day i don't think it's


---------50:57----------
really masculine at all it's really just


---------50:59----------
human


---------51:00----------
um right and but oddly enough i


---------51:03----------
i was just surprised a little bit by my


---------51:05----------
mind's reaction and then


---------51:06----------
seeing how like how right that felt like


---------51:08----------
that's a manly thing to say


---------51:10----------
like when i heard you say like you know


---------51:11----------
you got to put yourself out there like


---------51:12----------
sure you can you can't shield yourself


---------51:14----------
and get the benefit you have to be brave


---------51:16----------
you have to be courageous yeah um


---------51:19----------
and like i said i clearly don't i mean i


---------51:21----------
don't think it applies just to men but


---------51:22----------
it's interesting


---------51:23----------
how that's kind of uh you know that's


---------51:26----------
where we kind of go


---------51:27----------
you got to be manly bro yeah well i mean


---------51:30----------
the idea of putting yourself out there


---------51:31----------
is what men are are repeatedly told all


---------51:34----------
the time whether it be like making the


---------51:35----------
first move whether it's protecting your


---------51:37----------
family and shielding them with your life


---------51:38----------
whether it's


---------51:39----------
being the one to provide financially


---------51:41----------
it's like you're the one who


---------51:42----------
has to put yourself on the limb in an


---------51:44----------
outward perspective i think women do it


---------51:45----------
as well


---------51:46----------
i think it just doesn't manifest as like


---------51:48----------
outwardly as


---------51:50----------
it would with men traditionally i think


---------51:51----------
that's what it is yeah


---------51:53----------
and so i want to go back to this like so


---------51:55----------
someone asked you what you thought about


---------51:56----------
red pill and what was your answer again


---------51:59----------
um


---------52:03----------
i think it is the only


---------52:06----------
source of resources that


---------52:09----------
um that men have and i think it has its


---------52:13----------
imperfections as a community


---------52:14----------
but some of their ideas are very valid


---------52:16----------
and um you know


---------52:20----------
that that was my stance on it it's got


---------52:22----------
its problems but it's only spot


---------52:24----------
fermented to hear some of the stuff they


---------52:25----------
need to hear


---------52:26----------
and what is it that you think they need


---------52:28----------
to hear to take accountability


---------52:30----------
to understand that they have a


---------52:32----------
responsibility towards


---------52:34----------
self-improvement if they want the


---------52:36----------
results that they feel they should get


---------52:38----------
that they that it's not going to be


---------52:40----------
handed to them but they have to work


---------52:42----------
you know i got that from the military


---------52:43----------
and other stuff they most folks don't


---------52:45----------
get at that age


---------52:46----------
you know they don't get at the days they


---------52:48----------
don't get told like if you want to meet


---------52:50----------
somebody or find love you have to put in


---------52:51----------
some work


---------52:52----------
you know some people just feel entitled


---------52:54----------
like i'm supposed to find a partner and


---------52:55----------
i'm supposed to just be


---------52:56----------
it's like no there's things you got to


---------52:57----------
do so i think this idea of


---------52:58----------
accountability and responsibility


---------53:00----------
towards self-improvement


---------53:01----------
is two ideas that men desperately want


---------53:03----------
to hear and want to be told


---------53:06----------
and this community provides that what


---------53:09----------
are some of the things in the community


---------53:10----------
that you think are


---------53:12----------
not as helpful okay this is when it gets


---------53:16----------
to the minute stuff because you know


---------53:18----------
you have so many different voices kind


---------53:19----------
of writing things so it's hard to


---------53:22----------
pinpoint one or two things i often agree


---------53:24----------
with some of the rhetoric that


---------53:25----------
individuals say


---------53:26----------
as creators and i think sometimes i push


---------53:28----------
back on that even the idea of like


---------53:31----------
um necessarily having to embrace


---------53:35----------
uh traditional uh gender roles and the


---------53:37----------
idea that if you don't you're somehow


---------53:39----------
beta or inferior


---------53:40----------
or that if you happen to have a wife


---------53:43----------
who's a little bit more masculine


---------53:44----------
that makes you somehow less of a man


---------53:46----------
it's just all these ideas that seem a


---------53:48----------
little bit too rigid i'm not a big fan


---------53:49----------
of


---------53:51----------
so so what i'm it's interesting because


---------53:54----------
when you when you talk about the


---------53:54----------
positives


---------53:55----------
once again i think it's like stuff that


---------53:57----------
i don't think is really


---------53:58----------
masculine i think it's human that you


---------54:01----------
have to take


---------54:02----------
accountability for your actions and if


---------54:03----------
you want something in life you probably


---------54:05----------
have to work towards it


---------54:06----------
i i agree the issue is they don't get


---------54:10----------
told that there's nobody there to tell


---------54:11----------
them that and if nobody's saying that to


---------54:13----------
them


---------54:14----------
then they'll go where they can find it


---------54:16----------
so i think that's the


---------54:17----------
lament yeah i i i'm not i just i get


---------54:20----------
what you're saying


---------54:21----------
yeah so so so the the the reason i kind


---------54:23----------
of bring that up is because i i'm also


---------54:25----------
hearing that some of the stuff


---------54:27----------
that is maybe a little bit more rigid


---------54:29----------
that you're not on board with


---------54:30----------
seems in a definition standpoint like


---------54:33----------
more masculine


---------54:35----------
like gender roles like it's gendered by


---------54:37----------
nature


---------54:38----------
but that that does that make sense


---------54:41----------
what do you mean what do you mean by


---------54:43----------
itself so so like you were kind of


---------54:45----------
talking about how like


---------54:46----------
you know traditionally like there's an


---------54:48----------
idea of masculinity if you don't meet


---------54:50----------
that ideal your beta


---------54:52----------
so the things that you don't really kind


---------54:54----------
of agree with as much


---------54:55----------
are like the things that are inherently


---------54:57----------
more gendered


---------55:00----------
sure sure yeah i'm just drawing that


---------55:04----------
kind of observation right yeah gender


---------55:06----------
conformative yeah sure


---------55:07----------
yeah right right so it's kind of


---------55:09----------
interesting because i i mean i'm with


---------55:10----------
you in terms of like


---------55:11----------
people need a place where they can be


---------55:13----------
supported


---------55:14----------
um in sort of a compassionate way and


---------55:16----------
still held accountable


---------55:19----------
and this is something that you know it's


---------55:20----------
interesting because in our in our


---------55:21----------
coaching program part of what


---------55:23----------
like our values are a little bit weird


---------55:26----------
because


---------55:26----------
being nice is not one of them being


---------55:30----------
polite is not one of them


---------55:32----------
so one of the things that we actually


---------55:34----------
work really really hard with our coaches


---------55:35----------
to train them in is to be authentic and


---------55:37----------
compassionate


---------55:39----------
so what that means is like being


---------55:41----------
authentic is like if you think someone


---------55:43----------
like if your client is messing up then


---------55:45----------
you


---------55:46----------
hold them accountable like you have to


---------55:47----------
be authentic with them you can't brush


---------55:49----------
it over


---------55:50----------
but that that authenticity should be


---------55:51----------
tempered with compassion


---------55:53----------
so like it's walking the road of like


---------55:55----------
not blaming them


---------55:56----------
but also holding them accountable like


---------55:58----------
be like hey man like you're kind of


---------56:00----------
you know you're kind of screwing up here


---------56:02----------
like let's work on that


---------56:04----------
but like not let it slide yeah you know


---------56:07----------
i think


---------56:08----------
one thing they do well within the red


---------56:09----------
community which works for some people


---------56:11----------
is that they say things authentically in


---------56:13----------
a way that


---------56:14----------
they think you need to hear it and that


---------56:16----------
a lot of people do like so i've heard


---------56:17----------
coaches be like


---------56:19----------
what's your problem young man and the


---------56:20----------
man will be like well you know i'm not


---------56:22----------
getting girls together like well


---------56:23----------
all right what's your what's your


---------56:24----------
physical stature like are you doing well


---------56:26----------
physically and he's like uh


---------56:28----------
you know i could stand the workout he's


---------56:29----------
like are you saying that you're fat and


---------56:31----------
i remember when he said that to the man


---------56:34----------
a lot of people in the chat with crazy


---------56:35----------
like you can't say that but young my mom


---------56:37----------
you know what i feel like that's what i


---------56:38----------
needed to hear because i didn't want to


---------56:39----------
acknowledge it and what i'm saying is


---------56:40----------
i'm not saying it's necessarily the


---------56:41----------
right way


---------56:42----------
what i'm saying is that for some people


---------56:44----------
they feel like eating that


---------56:45----------
directly is what they want and i


---------56:48----------
remember also being an army and like


---------56:50----------
having people talk to you that way


---------56:51----------
sometimes is the thing that you need in


---------56:53----------
some circumstances and so


---------56:55----------
um what you thought about in terms of


---------56:57----------
authenticity and saying things


---------56:59----------
and holding people accountably


---------57:00----------
accountable they definitely have that a


---------57:02----------
lot in the uh


---------57:03----------
in that community yeah so i in my


---------57:06----------
experience you can be


---------57:07----------
you can certainly temper it with


---------57:08----------
compassion and you know


---------57:11----------
you know i i think i think there are a


---------57:12----------
lot of things and maybe i'm wrong here


---------57:14----------
but there are a lot of things that i say


---------57:16----------
to people in interviews that tend to be


---------57:18----------
clipped out of context and sound really


---------57:20----------
mean and


---------57:21----------
you know if you just look at the


---------57:22----------
transcript it certainly does sound mean


---------57:23----------
but they're usually said with compassion


---------57:25----------
which is why people


---------57:26----------
are okay with it yeah right but you


---------57:27----------
gotta kind of you gotta


---------57:29----------
call it what it is you gotta you know if


---------57:31----------
someone's got cancer you gotta diagnose


---------57:33----------
it and like face that


---------57:35----------
that reality before you treat it


---------57:38----------
yeah um and and so


---------57:42----------
hmm yeah i mean i feel like we've


---------57:46----------
i really appreciate kind of everything


---------57:48----------
that you've shared and i sort of


---------57:49----------
understand what you're saying i think i


---------57:50----------
agree with you that


---------57:52----------
you know men for sure and not to say


---------57:55----------
that women


---------57:56----------
that this is an exclusive need of men


---------57:58----------
which i think is another big problem


---------57:59----------
with these


---------58:00----------
kind of gender conversations is that


---------58:02----------
people tend to draw comparisons


---------58:04----------
um okay and and so i i think that it's


---------58:07----------
completely


---------58:08----------
possible for us because i see this you


---------58:10----------
know i see


---------58:12----------
women having gender norms that are


---------58:14----------
challenging in an uphill struggle


---------58:16----------
that cause them a lot of personal


---------58:17----------
suffering and i think that men have


---------58:19----------
gender norms that are challenging and


---------58:21----------
suffer and and cause them a lot of


---------58:23----------
suffering or uphill battle


---------58:24----------
and somewhere along the way i think some


---------58:26----------
people feel like there's like


---------58:28----------
it's a zero-sum game and so the more men


---------58:30----------
struggle


---------58:31----------
you're sort of devaluing women's


---------58:33----------
struggles or vice versa


---------58:35----------
and i just don't really see it that way


---------58:36----------
i just kind of think that you know


---------58:38----------
there are some cases of of male


---------58:40----------
privilege in some cases of


---------58:41----------
female privilege there are some cases of


---------58:43----------
minority privilege and some cases of


---------58:45----------
majority privilege


---------58:47----------
it's kind of interesting being india and


---------58:48----------
i kind of felt this


---------58:50----------
in a bizarre way in like medicine so


---------58:53----------
everyone


---------58:54----------
looks at me and assumes when i'm a


---------58:55----------
medical student that i'm a doctor


---------58:57----------
because i'm indian


---------58:58----------
which is fantastic um but


---------59:01----------
you know from a standardized test


---------59:03----------
perspective like in terms of


---------59:05----------
like the standardized test score that i


---------59:07----------
need to get is like


---------59:08----------
20 higher than like other ethnicities


---------59:11----------
who are underrepresented in medicine


---------59:13----------
so i have to score above average to be


---------59:16----------
competitive right um and then still on


---------59:19----------
my first day


---------59:20----------
of training at harvard medical school a


---------59:22----------
third of the room was south asian


---------59:25----------
and so you know it's like i don't know


---------59:27----------
whether it's right or wrong i've


---------59:28----------
certainly felt both sides of it


---------59:30----------
and in terms of minority privilege and


---------59:33----------
racism and


---------59:34----------
yeah all that kind of stuff you know


---------59:36----------
it's kind of interesting


---------59:38----------
yeah i i think the issue with this more


---------59:41----------
than


---------59:41----------
i agree that everyone has a struggle i


---------59:43----------
think i think


---------59:45----------
the problem is i just remember never


---------59:47----------
having many resources to look towards


---------59:50----------
whereas when i think when i when i spoke


---------59:52----------
to women on you


---------59:53----------
i think they saw themselves in a lot of


---------59:55----------
like


---------59:57----------
talk shows for example or resources that


---------59:59----------
they could look towards


---------60:00----------
for information and i think you know


---------60:03----------
it's just the idea of me having to go on


---------60:05----------
youtube to learn about this stuff in


---------60:06----------
2012 which is so weird to me


---------60:09----------
um you know because you can't really


---------60:10----------
think of like tv talk shows for men or


---------60:12----------
stuff like that


---------60:13----------
and and more than just you know you know


---------60:15----------
what i mean


---------60:16----------
yeah i was just thinking like what's the


---------60:18----------
male equivalent of the view


---------60:20----------
that there is none that's my and i made


---------60:22----------
the comparison i said joe rogan which is


---------60:24----------
funny because it just used to be like a


---------60:26----------
shitty podcast in some dude's basement


---------60:28----------
and now it's like this worldwide thing


---------60:29----------
but it's inception it really wasn't um


---------60:32----------
and and and more than that i think


---------60:35----------
oftentimes


---------60:37----------
um it's like


---------60:40----------
the little that we do have almost feels


---------60:42----------
like it's constantly being threatened


---------60:44----------
to be cancelled and so it's just like


---------60:46----------
you get a little bit defensive


---------60:48----------
you know uh and so i understand that


---------60:52----------
uh i mean yeah in terms of like the red


---------60:55----------
pill community sometimes


---------60:56----------
diversif deservedly so people just are


---------60:59----------
gone in terms of like their presence


---------61:00----------
online


---------61:01----------
um take the rogan podcast another great


---------61:04----------
example which is like you know it's been


---------61:06----------
in the news a few times for


---------61:07----------
you know people trying to have it


---------61:08----------
removed from online platforms and so


---------61:10----------
there's just this perception even if


---------61:11----------
it's not reality


---------61:12----------
i'll grandchild could be wrong and this


---------61:14----------
is anecdotal but there's a perception


---------61:17----------
that male spaces are not safe


---------61:23----------
that's how a lot of folks feel and


---------61:27----------
what's your understanding of of like joe


---------61:29----------
rogan and like


---------61:30----------
like why it why it's been in the news


---------61:34----------
for being cancelled


---------61:36----------
because it's a male space i'm gonna i'm


---------61:39----------
gonna draw a parallel


---------61:40----------
and um there's another individual


---------61:43----------
creates content online and sometimes


---------61:45----------
people feel like he


---------61:46----------
when he's coaching people or when he's


---------61:48----------
talking to people right um that he


---------61:49----------
has a strong dislike for for women and


---------61:52----------
so i


---------61:53----------
went to go watch his content and i went


---------61:55----------
to go watch his like coaching with with


---------61:57----------
men and


---------61:57----------
a lot of the verbiage was the same i


---------61:59----------
think sometimes in male space we have a


---------62:00----------
way of talking and we have a way with


---------62:02----------
engaging with each other that's often


---------62:03----------
seen


---------62:04----------
as unacceptable or wrong


---------62:07----------
when it's just for some people it's like


---------62:09----------
it's a perfectly fine temperament


---------62:10----------
and


---------62:14----------
i think men feel like they're being


---------62:15----------
policed in a sense like


---------62:17----------
does that make sense what i'm saying


---------62:19----------
sure yeah so but give me an example of


---------62:21----------
of what you think is like you know just


---------62:24----------
is the language of men


---------62:25----------
that other people take offense to or


---------62:28----------
that other people are trying to police


---------62:31----------
i couldn't give you an example of like


---------62:33----------
words we use i could just give you in


---------62:34----------
terms of like a


---------62:36----------
like a bluntness so i had the same thing


---------62:38----------
in the army the way we talk among


---------62:40----------
soldiers perfectly acceptable


---------62:42----------
if it ever made it online there was no


---------62:44----------
way we would keep our jobs but it is how


---------62:46----------
we speak on a regular basis


---------62:48----------
it is how we talk to each other you know


---------62:50----------
behind closed doors or whatever


---------62:51----------
and so there's this need to hide some of


---------62:53----------
that constantly


---------62:55----------
um and to temper our way of being online


---------62:59----------
uh which would most like that's toxic


---------63:01----------
and i'm like is it though


---------63:02----------
or are we just fine with how we talk to


---------63:04----------
each other so


---------63:06----------
uh and i've just seen it so much over


---------63:08----------
the years like shows that i used to love


---------63:09----------
that i think geared towards men's


---------63:11----------
experience i remember this one on


---------63:12----------
on on bet the man show like gone you


---------63:15----------
know and and and people were like


---------63:16----------
this kind of talking isn't except i'm


---------63:18----------
like is it though so i think that's the


---------63:20----------
perception


---------63:21----------
even if not accurate that is the


---------63:23----------
perception that a lot of men have yeah


---------63:25----------
so i think that's


---------63:26----------
that's uh i i'd really love to hear some


---------63:30----------
examples abba because i think it's like


---------63:31----------
if you're making the argument that


---------63:33----------
some people behind closed doors say


---------63:35----------
certain things which they're okay with


---------63:37----------
with


---------63:37----------
which other people aren't okay with i


---------63:40----------
think that there's like


---------63:41----------
something to really be explored there


---------63:43----------
right so even if we look at the incel


---------63:45----------
community


---------63:47----------
um or like the red pill community so


---------63:49----------
there's this sense


---------63:50----------
of so this is part of like what we've


---------63:52----------
kind of uncovered in our research is


---------63:54----------
that


---------63:54----------
you know there's a sense of online drift


---------63:57----------
so what tends to happen


---------63:58----------
is that you know we start out like i'll


---------64:00----------
look at let's say like a jordan peterson


---------64:02----------
video


---------64:02----------
on youtube and then what'll happen is


---------64:05----------
like my youtube will start recommending


---------64:07----------
other things to me


---------64:08----------
and depending on what i i click on like


---------64:12----------
i'm going to go


---------64:13----------
like down this rabbit hole right


---------64:16----------
i don't know you just kind of you almost


---------64:18----------
described jordan peterson as a gateway


---------64:19----------
it was kind of funny to hear that but


---------64:21----------
you know


---------64:21----------
i i i'm not i that wasn't it was i used


---------64:24----------
him as a good example because like


---------64:26----------
here's a good example yeah right so so


---------64:28----------
like what i'm not i'm not making a


---------64:30----------
judgment or anything i'm saying like


---------64:31----------
literally from a youtube algorithm


---------64:33----------
standpoint this is literally what we're


---------64:34----------
researching


---------64:35----------
is how online drift occurs so this is


---------64:38----------
what content creation platforms do so


---------64:40----------
they curate content and they say like


---------64:42----------
oh for people who watch jordan peterson


---------64:44----------
videos like half of them


---------64:46----------
also like something else and then


---------64:49----------
half of them like something else and you


---------64:52----------
also see this in


---------64:53----------
in political drift right so if i watch


---------64:55----------
like


---------64:56----------
fox news like a fox news clip that


---------64:59----------
is making fox news look good on youtube


---------65:02----------
then


---------65:02----------
like youtube will populate with


---------65:04----------
something else


---------65:05----------
and then so over time what happens is


---------65:07----------
like we get and you kind of mention this


---------65:09----------
echo chamber over time it's kind of


---------65:10----------
weird i don't think people


---------65:11----------
realize this is happening but because of


---------65:13----------
the nature of content


---------65:14----------
curation and platforms are trying to you


---------65:17----------
know


---------65:18----------
do this on purpose we start to be


---------65:20----------
surrounded by voices that are similar to


---------65:22----------
our own


---------65:23----------
sure i agree with that oh notion and


---------65:26----------
over time as that radicalization happens


---------65:28----------
i think that like you'll see in some of


---------65:30----------
these like


---------65:30----------
you know so then you'll get like the


---------65:32----------
in-cell subreddit gets banned and things


---------65:34----------
like that


---------65:35----------
um and and so what ends up happening is


---------65:37----------
over time people will like go to


---------65:39----------
esoteric like further and further


---------65:41----------
like remove from the front page of the


---------65:44----------
internet


---------65:45----------
and then sometimes in those spaces you


---------65:47----------
know you'll talk about people routinely


---------65:49----------
discussing things like violence towards


---------65:50----------
women and stuff like that


---------65:52----------
and i i imagine that those people feel


---------65:55----------
very comfortable with their language


---------65:56----------
behind closed doors


---------65:58----------
sure um and that people from out you


---------66:01----------
know on the other side of the door would


---------66:02----------
find it unacceptable


---------66:04----------
but you know how do they get from that


---------66:06----------
point part of it is also your drift but


---------66:08----------
a part of it is even the more modest


---------66:10----------
examples sometimes


---------66:12----------
of like masculine discussions sometimes


---------66:15----------
get


---------66:16----------
removed from platforms jordan peterson's


---------66:17----------
example you used as a starting point but


---------66:19----------
i remember a time when he would get


---------66:21----------
you know boot out of universities and


---------66:22----------
colleges for


---------66:24----------
for rhetoric which i didn't think was


---------66:25----------
crazy extreme but that's what i'm


---------66:27----------
talking about when i say


---------66:29----------
it almost feels like our language is


---------66:31----------
being policed is that even the modest


---------66:33----------
example that you started with


---------66:34----------
was often being removed from campuses i


---------66:36----------
remember seeing one guy who went in


---------66:38----------
for a discussion and they just barred


---------66:39----------
the doors and so um


---------66:41----------
you know when i see this stuff it it it


---------66:44----------
changes my perception of


---------66:48----------
how i think masculinity is viewed


---------66:50----------
whether accurate or not it is how i


---------66:52----------
see it yeah sure so so how do you think


---------66:54----------
masculinity is viewed


---------66:58----------
toxic i think it's very and


---------67:02----------
and


---------67:05----------
here's what i'll say i think you know


---------67:07----------
when you look at the uh


---------67:08----------
my mom are you dabbling in your world


---------67:09----------
but i think this is the five big big


---------67:11----------
personality traits


---------67:16----------
oh yeah yeah i just want to make sure


---------67:17----------
you know because that's what you studied


---------67:19----------
so i just want to make sure i do it


---------67:20----------
right


---------67:20----------
it's just as much as your world um


---------67:24----------
i think if you see an


---------67:24----------
over-representation on any of those axes


---------67:27----------
i think you're going to see negative um


---------67:30----------
behavior and i think


---------67:31----------
um you know one example i gave is like


---------67:34----------
when you


---------67:35----------
i take mothers for example i think their


---------67:37----------
need to protect


---------67:39----------
and to nurture sometimes if taken to an


---------67:41----------
extreme can turn into a turning


---------67:43----------
to a concept i think it's called


---------67:44----------
maternal gatekeeping


---------67:47----------
i think about a helicopter parent okay


---------67:49----------
so a maternal cancer was an idea but but


---------67:51----------
yeah


---------67:51----------
like the idea like you it's like the


---------67:53----------
idea that you insulate your your child


---------67:55----------
from


---------67:56----------
society's problems so much you protect


---------67:58----------
them that you stunt their


---------67:59----------
growth as a kid and i actually grew up


---------68:01----------
with a friend who went through that


---------68:02----------
uh and had to be diagnosed then i was


---------68:04----------
like whoa and


---------68:06----------
it just taught me the idea that yes of


---------68:08----------
course if you take


---------68:09----------
traditionally masculine traits and you


---------68:10----------
push them to an extreme i could


---------68:11----------
definitely see how they're negative for


---------68:13----------
society


---------68:13----------
um but i think even the more modest


---------68:16----------
forms


---------68:17----------
are sometimes seen as bad and like


---------68:19----------
competitive sports


---------68:20----------
is another interesting example where


---------68:23----------
like they


---------68:24----------
they don't like the idea of things being


---------68:25----------
too competitive for young boys and i'm


---------68:27----------
like


---------68:28----------
i feel like sometimes you rob them


---------68:29----------
something that they desperately need you


---------68:30----------
know whether it's video games


---------68:33----------
i'm not going to say women or anything


---------68:35----------
like that it just you know i remember


---------68:37----------
when when these ideas were removed


---------68:39----------
you know like oh we're no longer giving


---------68:40----------
out trophies or things like that


---------68:41----------
everyone gets a little participate


---------68:43----------
i was like ew like i loved it at school


---------68:45----------
when i even if i didn't come in first


---------68:47----------
just the idea of like trying to go for


---------68:48----------
it


---------68:49----------
meant something to me and i think ideas


---------68:51----------
that like men traditionally value so


---------68:53----------
much


---------68:53----------
uh i think men feel like are being


---------68:55----------
attacked that's what i think


---------68:57----------
i'm not saying theaters and like i can


---------68:58----------
point to a group of people or say it's


---------69:00----------
this gender or anything like that this


---------69:02----------
is just the perception i have of


---------69:04----------
that yeah so so what i'm because i i was


---------69:06----------
kind of thinking about the sabbath like


---------69:08----------
we're trying to figure out


---------69:09----------
to like how to support people right at


---------69:11----------
healthy gamer it's what we do


---------69:13----------
we try to offer people guidance i've


---------69:16----------
been toying around with like making a


---------69:17----------
guide to dating relationships which is


---------69:20----------
you know because i think there's a lot


---------69:21----------
of basics that


---------69:23----------
i'll teach because we're not taught


---------69:25----------
these things yeah


---------69:26----------
so i don't do couples counseling which i


---------69:28----------
explain to all the couples who wind up


---------69:30----------
in my office because i don't do that


---------69:32----------
but i definitely teach people how to


---------69:34----------
work on themselves to be


---------69:35----------
like better partners in relationships


---------69:38----------
and there are a lot of like


---------69:39----------
you know quips that i've come up with


---------69:40----------
one is that you know everyone's looking


---------69:42----------
for the right partner but in my


---------69:43----------
experience


---------69:44----------
the right partner is not something you


---------69:46----------
find it's something that you become


---------69:48----------
and and so i think that there's a lot of


---------69:50----------
like anyway so there's


---------69:52----------
kind of a random aside but what i'm kind


---------69:53----------
of hearing from you is that


---------69:56----------
so it is part of the struggle of trying


---------69:57----------
to figure out how to support people in


---------69:59----------
our community


---------70:01----------
men women transgender folks kind of


---------70:03----------
everyone


---------70:04----------
um part of what we're what i've been


---------70:06----------
trying to understand is like what is


---------70:08----------
toxic masculinity and what is


---------70:09----------
masculinity


---------70:11----------
and and because there's this sort of


---------70:14----------
idea that there's


---------70:15----------
what's your cringe um


---------70:18----------
i'm i'm i'm such a stickler for words


---------70:22----------
and and so i understand it conceptually


---------70:24----------
but every time i hear it i cringe


---------70:26----------
but i understand what it is no no no no


---------70:28----------
i think we should explore the cringe


---------70:30----------
that's where the money is


---------70:31----------
i think i think people don't understand


---------70:34----------
i think people


---------70:34----------
have this idea conceptually what the


---------70:36----------
word means but they don't understand how


---------70:38----------
it's internalized


---------70:39----------
by our brains inherently meaning you


---------70:42----------
know i remember taking a marketing class


---------70:43----------
and how important it was for a company


---------70:45----------
to get the right slogan and the right


---------70:46----------
words at the same spot


---------70:48----------
and no matter what a company may mean by


---------70:51----------
their slogan they understand that people


---------70:52----------
interpret words


---------70:53----------
and it just goes right to their core


---------70:55----------
irrespective of what spin


---------70:56----------
or what idea you want to put with it and


---------70:58----------
i think whether it's you know


---------71:00----------
toxic masculinity or men are trash i


---------71:02----------
think the ideas behind the sentiment i


---------71:04----------
can understand


---------71:05----------
i just think people don't understand the


---------71:09----------
implications it has subconsciously and


---------71:10----------
how it makes us feel viscerally when we


---------71:12----------
hear these ideas


---------71:14----------
how do you feel viscerally when you hear


---------71:16----------
the phrase toxic masculinity


---------71:19----------
i'm going to use men or trash because i


---------71:20----------
think that's like a much more


---------71:22----------
poignant one and i think a more extreme


---------71:23----------
one but um i think when i hear that for


---------71:26----------
example


---------71:27----------
i immediately think we're not redeemable


---------71:29----------
i think of the word trash and i think of


---------71:31----------
throwing it out


---------71:32----------
you know i think it's like it's over for


---------71:33----------
that and i and it's just such a tough


---------71:35----------
thing to


---------71:36----------
to hear especially when you're young in


---------71:38----------
development you see it online men are


---------71:40----------
trash men are trash and


---------71:41----------
masculinity's toxic or toxic masculinity


---------71:43----------
you're just like woof


---------71:44----------
it's very it's very polarizing language


---------71:47----------
that's why


---------71:48----------
so so you you you equate toxic


---------71:50----------
masculinity like in


---------71:51----------
when you hear the phrase toxic


---------71:53----------
masculinity your mind goes to men or


---------71:54----------
trash


---------71:56----------
okay men are trash is a separate phrase


---------71:58----------
but they're often coupled with each


---------71:59----------
other


---------72:00----------
online and platforms so for me yeah for


---------72:02----------
me it's like part of that whole ensemble


---------72:04----------
kind of of of polarizing terms that


---------72:07----------
people use


---------72:08----------
um that i think uh has a more of a


---------72:10----------
negative effect than anything else


---------72:12----------
yeah because it reinforces it reinforces


---------72:14----------
an idea that i think a lot of people


---------72:16----------
already hold in their heads


---------72:17----------
and what is that idea uh


---------72:20----------
you know it's like it goes back to that


---------72:22----------
idea of like policing and and


---------72:24----------
and and men have these


---------72:28----------
that men are the problem you know and


---------72:30----------
it's just like i said


---------72:32----------
i understand it conceptually as like as


---------72:34----------
a macro scale but as a micro skill


---------72:36----------
someone with dealing with struggles it


---------72:37----------
just constantly feels like i'm hearing


---------72:38----------
like your men's problems don't matter


---------72:40----------
that's what i hear when i hear that


---------72:41----------
stuff


---------72:41----------
even i know it's not what they're saying


---------72:42----------
i get it that's what it feels like just


---------72:45----------
considering the


---------72:46----------
other societal stuff that i deal with


---------72:47----------
have you felt like


---------72:50----------
people have treated you like your


---------72:51----------
problems don't matter


---------72:53----------
oh yeah oh yeah every all the time all


---------72:56----------
the time


---------72:57----------
still i mean sometimes i get sick of


---------72:58----------
talking about men's issues or men's


---------73:00----------
problems like i don't even want to


---------73:01----------
discuss them at times because it's just


---------73:02----------
like


---------73:03----------
you're always going to have a role


---------73:04----------
people like oh man are complaining again


---------73:05----------
i'm like


---------73:06----------
men are committing suicide too you know


---------73:08----------
like it's crazy to me


---------73:10----------
that there's all these things and you


---------73:12----------
could verifiably like quantify them in


---------73:14----------
some ways


---------73:15----------
and people are still like you guys don't


---------73:17----------
really have problems and i'm just like


---------73:18----------
what or or the worst one i don't think


---------73:21----------
it's worse but


---------73:22----------
it's it's somewhat but the the thing i


---------73:23----------
hate them even more sometimes is


---------73:25----------
it's like we get that you suffer but


---------73:27----------
because women suffer more like


---------73:28----------
let's put that on the back burner i'm


---------73:30----------
just like bruh um


---------73:32----------
so so yeah it's just it's just things


---------73:34----------
that peeved me but i i don't


---------73:36----------
want to get about it how does it how


---------73:38----------
does it feel when people


---------73:41----------
invalidate your struggles


---------73:45----------
i think i'm fortunate that i'm at the


---------73:46----------
age that i am now and that i've dealt


---------73:48----------
with so much


---------73:49----------
because i'm able to handle it up better


---------73:50----------
but sometimes it takes me back to how i


---------73:52----------
was when i was much younger


---------73:54----------
and i was dealing with stuff and i had


---------73:56----------
nothing


---------73:58----------
and it's just be like man 20 world me


---------73:59----------
would have never survived a lot of this


---------74:01----------
like this would have really


---------74:02----------
wrecked me um and it makes me


---------74:06----------
it makes me sad it makes me sad because


---------74:09----------
i think i recognize a lot of people are


---------74:10----------
young and in a vulnerable state


---------74:12----------
and the language we use doesn't help to


---------74:15----------
make them feel accepted or to feel okay


---------74:20----------
you know i think these conversations are


---------74:21----------
important they're absolutely necessary


---------74:23----------
to have


---------74:24----------
but i think we don't it's like what you


---------74:26----------
said there's a way to do things with


---------74:27----------
compassion


---------74:30----------
that's what's lacking with the discourse


---------74:32----------
and also understanding that the person


---------74:33----------
that you're talking to yes


---------74:35----------
you know they exist within a larger


---------74:36----------
group whether it be gender or sex or


---------74:38----------
whatever


---------74:39----------
but they're also individuals who are


---------74:40----------
dealing with their own problems that you


---------74:42----------
don't know about


---------74:43----------
and uh i just think the way we have


---------74:45----------
these conversations uh just makes me sad


---------74:47----------
more than anything


---------74:49----------
are there particular things kind of that


---------74:51----------
happened to you when you were


---------74:53----------
like 20 or maybe even younger where you


---------74:55----------
felt like you had a particular struggle


---------74:57----------
that was very important to you that


---------74:59----------
people didn't seem to


---------75:01----------
you know i can't i can't pinpoint a


---------75:03----------
moment i just know what it's like to go


---------75:04----------
through life without a mentor


---------75:06----------
and to go through life having to figure


---------75:08----------
it out as a young adult


---------75:10----------
and to have no resources to help you


---------75:12----------
like i know how lonely that is and how


---------75:14----------
frightening that is and how inadequate


---------75:16----------
and like shitty you feel it's not a


---------75:18----------
one-time thing it's like an everyday


---------75:20----------
thing for a lot of young folks and


---------75:23----------
it just seems like um when you're in


---------75:26----------
that little


---------75:27----------
what do they live with every day just


---------75:30----------
tremendous anxiety about like not


---------75:32----------
knowing where the future is going


---------75:33----------
and and and feeling like they're


---------75:35----------
supposed to have their [ __ ] together but


---------75:36----------
they don't


---------75:37----------
and feeling like


---------75:42----------
feeling like they're not good enough


---------75:43----------
while everyone else is like because you


---------75:45----------
just


---------75:46----------
you know you go to instagram and you


---------75:47----------
just like damn everyone's popping they


---------75:48----------
live in their best life right and it's


---------75:49----------
just like that's not what's happening


---------75:50----------
behind closed doors that's the


---------75:52----------
perception you have you feel alone and


---------75:53----------
struggling


---------75:54----------
that's what it is you just feel


---------75:55----------
inadequate talk to any like 18 to 21


---------75:57----------
year old and they'll say they'll be like


---------75:59----------
i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing


---------76:00----------
i'm in school and i don't like my major


---------76:02----------
i'm in debt


---------76:03----------
i don't know what i want to do with my


---------76:05----------
future women don't like me it's like god


---------76:07----------
damn it's a lot of struggles


---------76:09----------
you know i understand that women go


---------76:10----------
through on the same side i'm not


---------76:11----------
discounting that


---------76:12----------
for me it's just as a man i understand


---------76:14----------
that experience a little bit better so


---------76:15----------
that's just why i speak to well so i


---------76:17----------
think there's there is a big difference


---------76:18----------
and you know here i may say


---------76:20----------
something that will get me canceled but


---------76:21----------
what i'm hearing from you is that


---------76:23----------
the response so like i think i agree


---------76:25----------
with you that men and women all share


---------76:26----------
that i've had


---------76:27----------
you know my lion's share of men and


---------76:29----------
women who each struggle with 18 years


---------76:31----------
old and being directionless and being in


---------76:33----------
debt and whatnot


---------76:34----------
yeah but what i am hearing is that i i


---------76:36----------
do think there's a certain amount of


---------76:38----------
acceptableness to invalidate


---------76:41----------
men's struggles so what i'm hearing from


---------76:45----------
you is that


---------76:46----------
you know if you complain there are going


---------76:48----------
to be people out there who will say men


---------76:49----------
are trash what are you complaining about


---------76:52----------
and and and i think that we all struggle


---------76:55----------
and we all suffer this is what buddha


---------76:57----------
said he said that


---------76:58----------
you know there are two guaranteed things


---------76:59----------
in life and he didn't really break


---------77:02----------
things down by race or class or


---------77:04----------
ethnicity or gender


---------77:06----------
and the two things that all human beings


---------77:08----------
are entitled to in life are suffering


---------77:09----------
and death


---------77:12----------
and and i think that you know i tend to


---------77:14----------
agree with him


---------77:15----------
that suffering is sort of a universal


---------77:17----------
human condition


---------77:19----------
but what i'm kind of hearing from you is


---------77:21----------
that


---------77:23----------
because what seems like what really


---------77:24----------
grates you is the invalidation of your


---------77:26----------
struggle like the struggle is shared but


---------77:28----------
the way that people listen to your


---------77:30----------
struggle and that's sort of what i'm


---------77:31----------
hearing is that


---------77:32----------
you know even if we think about these


---------77:33----------
like sexual assault victims who are who


---------77:35----------
are men and who kind of


---------77:36----------
are like you know you should be happy


---------77:41----------
that your teacher is sleeping with you


---------77:43----------
that's your teacher 15.


---------77:45----------
sure you know you know even i hold some


---------77:48----------
of these bad ideas


---------77:50----------
what do you mean i hold some of these


---------77:51----------
bad like like conceptually i agree with


---------77:54----------
you that it's terrible that a teacher


---------77:55----------
would sleep with a fifth year old


---------77:56----------
in my mind for whatever conditioning i'm


---------77:58----------
just like hey man good job and it's a


---------78:00----------
terrible sentiment


---------78:01----------
terrible and i can acknowledge it's not


---------78:03----------
based on anything but it's just


---------78:05----------
i've been programmed i had a teacher i


---------78:07----------
liked i wish she would


---------78:09----------
it's not it's not a good thing to think


---------78:12----------
but i also participate that at times so


---------78:14----------
i have to check myself


---------78:15----------
um yeah but what you said about the


---------78:16----------
suffering is something i agree


---------78:18----------
i agree that it's it's part of our


---------78:20----------
experience i just think


---------78:21----------
i wish we wouldn't go to such lengths


---------78:25----------
create more suffering for others or if


---------78:28----------
people are suffering


---------78:29----------
to make them feel like they're suffering


---------78:31----------
doesn't matter you know like i think my


---------78:32----------
goal in life is to try to alleviate


---------78:34----------
people suffering as much as i can even


---------78:35----------
though people need to have a certain


---------78:36----------
level of it


---------78:37----------
and to not to not try and create more


---------78:40----------
for others


---------78:41----------
i think that's my goal so yeah i just


---------78:44----------
have a hard time when people


---------78:46----------
actively don't realize in which ways


---------78:48----------
they may be creating some and uh


---------78:49----------
don't seem to care at all that's like


---------78:51----------
the struggle i have sure


---------78:52----------
so just something for you to think about


---------78:54----------
abba you know i don't think we need to


---------78:55----------
get into this but i i would really


---------78:58----------
uh invite you to explore kind of on your


---------79:00----------
own if there have been


---------79:01----------
so the emotional energy when we talked


---------79:04----------
about the invalidation of people's


---------79:05----------
struggles and when i mentioned toxic


---------79:07----------
masculinity


---------79:09----------
when i see that emotional energy in


---------79:11----------
people oftentimes it stems from like


---------79:13----------
actually like a


---------79:14----------
bizarrely unrelated personal experience


---------79:17----------
and i think we're hearing the themes of


---------79:19----------
you kind of being alone


---------79:21----------
and and maybe they're because i i i


---------79:23----------
think you know oddly enough we didn't


---------79:24----------
really get into this but


---------79:26----------
you kind of said that you felt ashamed


---------79:28----------
of reaching out to other people for help


---------79:30----------
and the interesting thing is that shame


---------79:32----------
is learned


---------79:34----------
right so like like like we human beings


---------79:36----------
aren't


---------79:37----------
born with that in fact babies reach out


---------79:38----------
for help all the time


---------79:40----------
so that shame of being inadequate and


---------79:42----------
needing help from someone else


---------79:44----------
is something that we're taught and


---------79:46----------
conditioned to do


---------79:47----------
and so oddly enough you know if we think


---------79:49----------
about why did you feel ashamed asking


---------79:51----------
for help it's probably because if we


---------79:53----------
kind of track that back


---------79:55----------
it's probably because there were times


---------79:56----------
in your life where you did reach out for


---------79:58----------
help


---------79:59----------
and then your struggle was essentially


---------80:01----------
invalidated


---------80:02----------
and someone made you feel like right


---------80:05----------
like that's that's how you're going to


---------80:06----------
develop that


---------80:07----------
shameful condition okay can i ask you


---------80:11----------
something in your practice when you're


---------80:12----------
speaking to men do you not feel like


---------80:14----------
they have that same experience


---------80:15----------
of reaching out for help because


---------80:18----------
okay so that's why i'm telling you okay


---------80:21----------
okay all right


---------80:22----------
all right that's why i'm telling you


---------80:23----------
that i've walked this journey with many


---------80:25----------
men


---------80:26----------
and the fact that you respond very


---------80:28----------
emotionally to like when i mention toxic


---------80:30----------
masculinity you just get pissed right


---------80:32----------
like


---------80:32----------
it's like some slumbering giant wakes up


---------80:34----------
within you and like


---------80:36----------
you equate that to men and trash that


---------80:38----------
goes to an


---------80:39----------
invalidation of the struggle and pain


---------80:41----------
that you feel which in turn probably


---------80:43----------
relates i'm


---------80:43----------
i'm making a real stretch here okay so


---------80:46----------
each step at these is like 10


---------80:48----------
chance of being right but because it is


---------80:51----------
a shared experience which is why i can


---------80:52----------
lay this out for you


---------80:53----------
or other people that are watching right


---------80:55----------
so like if that pisses you off then


---------80:57----------
chances are like you're


---------80:58----------
you have personally felt like that's


---------81:01----------
personal emotional energy


---------81:03----------
about you've been on the receiving end


---------81:05----------
of that stick which is why it hurts so


---------81:07----------
much


---------81:07----------
when you see other people doing it you


---------81:10----------
know like


---------81:11----------
like victimizing like 20 year olds you


---------81:13----------
imagine 20


---------81:14----------
year old you who's seeing on twitter


---------81:16----------
that men are trash and like he doesn't


---------81:18----------
have


---------81:19----------
the fortitude that you have to like not


---------81:21----------
internalize that


---------81:23----------
yeah yeah and oddly enough that's


---------81:25----------
something that you understand because at


---------81:27----------
one point


---------81:28----------
you didn't have the internal fortitude


---------81:30----------
to internalize it


---------81:31----------
which is exactly what you did


---------81:34----------
and and that's sort of why we get to 18


---------81:37----------
year olds because


---------81:38----------
it's interesting because it's not like a


---------81:39----------
catastrophic emotional moment that we're


---------81:42----------
gonna have an emotional catharsis about


---------81:44----------
it's gonna be like these little bits of


---------81:46----------
like conditioning that happen


---------81:48----------
about you know when you were seven years


---------81:50----------
old there was one day that you like


---------81:52----------
didn't know how to do your math homework


---------81:54----------
and then like you know you tried to talk


---------81:56----------
to someone about it and they were like


---------81:57----------
shouldn't you know how to do this


---------81:59----------
okay i actually got something for you


---------82:01----------
okay this is the one that stuck


---------82:02----------
it's one of the few childhood numbers so


---------82:05----------
i remember oh man this is taking me so


---------82:08----------
far back this is the first time i was


---------82:12----------
12. i was 12 i think could be wrong


---------82:14----------
about the age it doesn't matter


---------82:16----------
uh we would do this thing at school


---------82:18----------
where once it would snow real bad we


---------82:19----------
would make these snow forts


---------82:21----------
and everyone would make their own and


---------82:22----------
then obviously a little bit of like


---------82:24----------
water would fall and it would get iced


---------82:26----------
up and um there was this girl who lived


---------82:28----------
across the street from me and my


---------82:30----------
neighborhood we take the bus the whole


---------82:31----------
group of us take a bus but she'd be part


---------82:33----------
of that group


---------82:34----------
and uh man i remember having a crush on


---------82:38----------
this girl


---------82:39----------
i'll never forget i used to have a big


---------82:40----------
question on this girl but i never talked


---------82:41----------
about it


---------82:42----------
and um you know when you're a kid and


---------82:45----------
you have a crush on somebody sometimes


---------82:47----------
you might be like a little bit mean to


---------82:48----------
them and so i had a little habit of like


---------82:50----------
going back and forth with her like that


---------82:51----------
as a kid i remember this


---------82:53----------
and one morning


---------82:56----------
we came to school and her fort had been


---------82:59----------
destroyed as well as like two other


---------83:00----------
three-fourths


---------83:01----------
she went to the principal and she said


---------83:04----------
abba did it


---------83:05----------
abba destroyed my fort and so i got


---------83:07----------
called into the principal's office and


---------83:09----------
i'm just standing here she's there so i


---------83:10----------
was like oh


---------83:11----------
what's she doing here and the prisoner


---------83:14----------
asked me why i destroyed the forts and i


---------83:16----------
was like what are you talking about


---------83:17----------
and and he's like he's like well people


---------83:20----------
want to know i


---------83:21----------
was like i didn't do anything do you


---------83:22----------
think i came to school early to destroy


---------83:23----------
things you think i walked here


---------83:25----------
and they're like well everyone's saying


---------83:26----------
it's you and i was like i didn't do it


---------83:27----------
okay i don't know what to tell you i


---------83:29----------
didn't do it


---------83:30----------
and um i remember they called my parents


---------83:32----------
and it turned into something


---------83:36----------
and i'll never forget this i think it


---------83:38----------
was like two days later


---------83:40----------
i got called back into the office and


---------83:44----------
the girl was there she was crying the


---------83:46----------
principal's


---------83:47----------
standing there and her dad's there and


---------83:48----------
i'm just like what'd i do this time


---------83:51----------
and uh he says she has something she


---------83:53----------
would like to say


---------83:54----------
and she said uh i'm sorry and i'll say


---------83:56----------
what happened and it's like


---------83:58----------
turns out the janitor was getting tired


---------84:00----------
of these snow forts when he was cleaning


---------84:01----------
the yard


---------84:02----------
so he just ran over them just to flatten


---------84:04----------
them out and clear them out of the way


---------84:07----------
and i remember being so mad i just


---------84:10----------
remember being so angry because i'm like


---------84:11----------
everybody looked at me like i was


---------84:12----------
garbage for a couple days just like


---------84:15----------
she's that being accused and like how


---------84:16----------
her word was inherently taken as true


---------84:19----------
and i just remember being so mad that


---------84:21----------
day and uh


---------84:22----------
i accepted her apology and went back but


---------84:24----------
i don't know why that memory always


---------84:25----------
stuck with me as the first time


---------84:26----------
i was accused of something i didn't do


---------84:29----------
and i just


---------84:30----------
i remember being so mad about that now


---------84:32----------
that's probably the experience


---------84:35----------
yeah so that's it


---------84:40----------
yeah that's a good one i have never


---------84:43----------
brought that up before


---------84:44----------
yeah so it's interesting right like how


---------84:46----------
the mind works how like your mind just


---------84:47----------
like jumps to that experience because


---------84:49----------
what i'm hearing so so i'm gonna try to


---------84:51----------
interpret this a little bit for you okay


---------84:52----------
because like it feels a little bit


---------84:54----------
off to me but i think it's actually it


---------84:56----------
it's that emotional energy like


---------84:58----------
now i'll ask you abby you know just


---------85:00----------
something for you to think about when


---------85:01----------
you hear the word toxic masculinity


---------85:03----------
does the quality color and flavor of the


---------85:06----------
emotion you feel


---------85:07----------
feel similar to what you felt in that


---------85:10----------
second principal's office


---------85:12----------
oh yeah for sure you know because the


---------85:14----------
idea is the idea that like


---------85:15----------
you're wrong without any concept of who


---------85:18----------
i am like you're wrong it's that


---------85:19----------
similar idea i would be inclined to


---------85:21----------
agree with you right so which is why


---------85:22----------
your mind jumped there because it's


---------85:24----------
it's but like there's there's a lot of


---------85:26----------
subtlety there right because like what


---------85:27----------
i'm hearing is that like


---------85:28----------
when she had a grievance what happened


---------85:33----------
when she was hurt


---------85:36----------
and then what happened she was she was


---------85:38----------
hurt she was hurt right you were called


---------85:41----------
in


---------85:41----------
there was a trial people were called in


---------85:44----------
everyone said you do it there was an


---------85:45----------
investigation


---------85:47----------
and when you were hurt what happened


---------85:50----------
people thought you were trash for days


---------85:54----------
what happened when you were hurt


---------86:00----------
yeah i think i was just i was given a


---------86:03----------
small apology and then i shut out the


---------86:04----------
door


---------86:05----------
absolutely yeah right


---------86:08----------
yeah no no and let me ask you another


---------86:11----------
question


---------86:12----------
were you pressured or forced into


---------86:14----------
accepting her apology


---------86:25----------
i think yeah i think i was just expected


---------86:27----------
to accept it


---------86:28----------
right so like when you're a 12 year old


---------86:30----------
boy and there's a girl crying and she


---------86:32----------
apologizes


---------86:33----------
you don't get to say [ __ ] you


---------86:36----------
no right


---------86:39----------
even though that's how you feel so in


---------86:42----------
that moment it's sort of like it's it's


---------86:44----------
incredibly invalidating


---------86:47----------
right and and it's it's like it's just


---------86:50----------
it's like


---------86:50----------
night and day yeah and and i think it it


---------86:54----------
speaks to a lot of like


---------86:55----------
resentment that you carry with you which


---------86:58----------
is justified


---------86:59----------
but i think still is going to color the


---------87:01----------
way that you look at things


---------87:03----------
for sure undoubtedly undoubtedly i mean


---------87:06----------
you know and and similar experience like


---------87:07----------
that i've played out throughout my life


---------87:09----------
where culpability is just automatically


---------87:12----------
assumed


---------87:13----------
for reasons i can't explain so i


---------87:15----------
attribute to gender


---------87:16----------
but it's just like um it's a tough thing


---------87:19----------
to accept when you think of yourself as


---------87:20----------
like somebody who has some measure of


---------87:22----------
integrity


---------87:23----------
and that's immediately thrown out the


---------87:25----------
window because for whatever reason


---------87:27----------
it's a hard thing to stomach it's like i


---------87:29----------
didn't do anything wrong this moment but


---------87:31----------
i'm immediately seen as evil


---------87:32----------
it's a hard thing to accept and to


---------87:37----------
yeah this is hard it's a very difficult


---------87:39----------
thing for me to accept


---------87:40----------
yeah i mean what i'm hearing is that


---------87:42----------
you're being blamed for men being trash


---------87:47----------
yeah yeah definitely definitely and


---------87:50----------
it's compounded by the idea that


---------87:52----------
sometimes


---------87:54----------
it's like you know because i don't i


---------87:55----------
don't necessarily experience it


---------87:57----------
when men are trash i'm not there in


---------87:58----------
those intimate moments with women where


---------88:00----------
they're being violent so i don't


---------88:01----------
i don't know what that feels like i can


---------88:02----------
hear about it and i can sympathize


---------88:05----------
but i do know what it feels like to


---------88:08----------
to be falsely accused by somebody who


---------88:10----------
did something terrible to you


---------88:11----------
and and because they're a woman they're


---------88:13----------
like inherently seen as like they


---------88:14----------
couldn't have done it


---------88:15----------
and it's a tough thing to stomach so i


---------88:17----------
think that's why i probably feel more


---------88:18----------
strongly about that


---------88:19----------
because that's what i have visceral


---------88:21----------
experiences with absolutely


---------88:22----------
you know like my my negative experiences


---------88:24----------
with men could have probably been


---------88:25----------
ranging


---------88:26----------
from when i was like 14 to 17.


---------88:29----------
and there was always a catharsis we got


---------88:31----------
into a fight we exhausted all our energy


---------88:33----------
one person one one person lost and i


---------88:35----------
move away but there was never this idea


---------88:37----------
that


---------88:37----------
you're evil because you did this it was


---------88:38----------
like we're gonna just duke it out as


---------88:40----------
equals and then that's it you know and i


---------88:41----------
could live with that


---------88:42----------
what i couldn't understand was like no


---------88:44----------
this person was wrong


---------88:46----------
but i'm seen as a guilty party that's a


---------88:47----------
hard thing to stomach and not only


---------88:49----------
talking about like when i was like 17


---------88:50----------
i'm like talking about even later on in


---------88:52----------
life so


---------88:52----------
um that's a tough part i think for me


---------88:55----------
has there been another


---------88:56----------
time where you know you've been right


---------88:58----------
yeah yeah yeah


---------88:59----------
yeah it was crazy it was crazy this girl


---------89:01----------
tried to pressure me to kiss her i'm


---------89:02----------
like


---------89:02----------
i don't want to like i told her multiple


---------89:04----------
times i'm not interested


---------89:06----------
and you know because i felt like it was


---------89:09----------
too soon for me that i just didn't want


---------89:10----------
to in that moment


---------89:11----------
and but i was interested in this person


---------89:13----------
but i just felt like the way she was


---------89:14----------
going about it i wasn't feeling


---------89:15----------
and i remember a week later right we


---------89:17----------
were having this conversation and she


---------89:19----------
was like


---------89:19----------
this is like a 2018 so prime time you


---------89:22----------
know harvey weinstein's out there


---------89:24----------
and she was having this conversation


---------89:25----------
about like men have to be more conscious


---------89:27----------
about the fact that they're pressuring


---------89:28----------
women and i was like


---------89:29----------
you did that to me like a week ago


---------89:33----------
you know i couldn't believe it in that


---------89:34----------
moment you know


---------89:36----------
and it was just such a weird thing to me


---------89:39----------
it was like


---------89:40----------
it it that even to this day triggers me


---------89:43----------
yeah i see that the audacity for you to


---------89:46----------
have this speech for me right now when


---------89:48----------
you're not even taking culpability for


---------89:49----------
the things that you've done and it's


---------89:50----------
just


---------89:51----------
that's the frustrating part but like i


---------89:53----------
said


---------89:54----------
i feel this viscerally because of the


---------89:56----------
fact that there are my experiences


---------89:58----------
with women right and i feel this


---------90:00----------
viscerally because i only date women so


---------90:02----------
the things that men are doing that maybe


---------90:04----------
merit the whole


---------90:05----------
amount of trash i don't see them because


---------90:06----------
a lot of this stuff happened happens


---------90:08----------
behind closed doors or things like that


---------90:09----------
and


---------90:10----------
you know there are too many parties


---------90:11----------
present so i'm not discounting the idea


---------90:13----------
that these things happen


---------90:14----------
or that women are suffering i would


---------90:15----------
never do that but i'm like i can only


---------90:17----------
speak to what i see


---------90:18----------
and that's what's going to cover my


---------90:19----------
perspective so yeah so i just want to


---------90:22----------
share


---------90:22----------
you know a couple of like maybe academic


---------90:24----------
thoughts sure for sure go for it


---------90:26----------
um so you know the first is that that i


---------90:29----------
want to just


---------90:30----------
invite you to question your earlier


---------90:33----------
assertion


---------90:34----------
like the assertion you just made that i


---------90:35----------
don't see that so i think this is


---------90:37----------
something where you know


---------90:38----------
a lot of men i know certainly since i've


---------90:41----------
started looking for it that like


---------90:43----------
if you actually look at it objectively


---------90:45----------
there may be more of it than you realize


---------90:47----------
um and i think it's true of of women too


---------90:49----------
where where you know like


---------90:52----------
sometimes it's kind of interesting


---------90:53----------
because when i work with my female


---------90:55----------
clients sometimes i'll ask a question


---------90:57----------
like we'll be talking about something in


---------90:58----------
therapy and i'll ask them like


---------91:00----------
what would your girlfriend say about


---------91:02----------
this and like you know


---------91:03----------
their response is always like their


---------91:05----------
girlfriends are overwhelmingly


---------91:06----------
supportive


---------91:07----------
irrespective of like how this person may


---------91:10----------
have screwed up


---------91:11----------
and you know in some cases you'll have


---------91:13----------
like married women that have affairs and


---------91:14----------
stuff and their girlfriends are like 100


---------91:16----------
supporting them right and and so you


---------91:19----------
know i'm i'm a big fan of being


---------91:20----------
authentic and then i'm you know so i'll


---------91:22----------
ask for permission to be like a little


---------91:24----------
bit more judgmental i don't even ask


---------91:26----------
them


---------91:26----------
like can i be judgmental in this moment


---------91:29----------
and so if you really


---------91:31----------
so i think like we have a tendency when


---------91:34----------
we're with our group


---------91:36----------
to you know gloss over a lot of things


---------91:39----------
and say we haven't seen them because you


---------91:41----------
haven't been on the receiving end


---------91:42----------
but behind some of these closed-door


---------91:45----------
conversations that may get people


---------91:46----------
canceled


---------91:47----------
there may be more evidence of toxicity


---------91:51----------
you know directed from men towards women


---------91:54----------
that we sort of like pass off based on


---------91:57----------
our language


---------91:58----------
so i'd encourage you to just really be a


---------92:00----------
little bit like careful and objective


---------92:01----------
about that


---------92:02----------
i'm not saying that you know you're


---------92:05----------
sometimes there's more toxicity that we


---------92:06----------
take for granted because it's so


---------92:08----------
normative


---------92:09----------
right and like certainly we've been


---------92:10----------
talking about the normative toxicity


---------92:12----------
that men


---------92:13----------
put on themselves and there may be other


---------92:16----------
kinds of toxicities there's just


---------92:17----------
something to think about


---------92:18----------
no no no you're right and and biases


---------92:21----------
like that


---------92:23----------
probably have clouded my conversations


---------92:25----------
with people in my


---------92:26----------
uh my time on earth and


---------92:29----------
i would be inclined to agree i think


---------92:31----------
it's just hard to recognize where those


---------92:33----------
blinders


---------92:34----------
are because a lot of this happens in


---------92:36----------
gray areas


---------92:37----------
you know even when i recount the story


---------92:39----------
of the girl to other people


---------92:40----------
sometimes they don't even see it even


---------92:41----------
after explaining them to so it can be


---------92:43----------
difficult


---------92:44----------
to see that and and i would i would be


---------92:46----------
inclined to agree with you that i could


---------92:47----------
do a better job in that regards


---------92:48----------
yeah so but that's the nature of


---------92:50----------
blinders right like we don't blame you


---------92:52----------
for having blinders because that's just


---------92:53----------
what the mind does it has all these


---------92:55----------
kinds of blinders and that's the nature


---------92:56----------
of bias


---------92:58----------
and and so that's number one so the


---------93:00----------
second thing that i just want to


---------93:01----------
touch on which is you know i'd love to


---------93:03----------
get your thoughts so you know i tossed


---------93:04----------
out this term


---------93:05----------
toxic masculinity we went on a beautiful


---------93:07----------
tangent my favorite of the day


---------93:11----------
uh it was it really abbott's lovely to


---------93:13----------
see how


---------93:14----------
like animated and passionate and like


---------93:16----------
when you get that plus the


---------93:17----------
thoughtfulness like i


---------93:19----------
i don't know why i mean the stories


---------93:20----------
really weren't positive in any way shape


---------93:22----------
or form but just


---------93:24----------
hearing the way is something about your


---------93:25----------
storytelling capability or something i


---------93:27----------
just really enjoyed hearing that and i i


---------93:29----------
felt like


---------93:30----------
i felt oddly enough happy that you were


---------93:32----------
able to sort of share that even though


---------93:34----------
it's kind of an ugly story if you really


---------93:35----------
think about it


---------93:36----------
yeah yeah you know


---------93:40----------
but you know it's interesting even even


---------93:42----------
your response to the story


---------93:44----------
indicates the different perception


---------93:47----------
of it because i i feel like


---------93:50----------
again this is probably my biases again


---------93:52----------
but it's one of those things where it's


---------93:53----------
like


---------93:53----------
we can have this conversation and it not


---------93:55----------
be too much of an issue i think


---------93:57----------
precise maybe i'm wrong precisely


---------94:00----------
because of the different genders


---------94:01----------
do you know what i mean wha what do you


---------94:03----------
mean


---------94:04----------
meaning like i'm talking about as i'm


---------94:07----------
talking about this right and we're


---------94:08----------
having this conversation about being


---------94:09----------
pressured like


---------94:11----------
even though intellectually we might look


---------94:12----------
at it and be like yeah that was terrible


---------94:14----------
and toxic i think


---------94:15----------
subconsciously we don't we don't infer


---------94:18----------
that same implication


---------94:20----------
we don't actually see it as necessarily


---------94:22----------
being as terrible


---------94:23----------
as the action itself would normally


---------94:25----------
dictate does that make sense


---------94:28----------
i i say it's terrible right i think i


---------94:30----------
think you see it as terrible too


---------94:34----------
i don't even think i do that's that's


---------94:35----------
the [ __ ] up part yeah that's the part


---------94:37----------
about that


---------94:38----------
so so so here's here's the reason i


---------94:40----------
think you think it is terrible


---------94:42----------
on a subconscious or unconscious level


---------94:44----------
there are parts of you that don't


---------94:46----------
but like the fact that i mentioned to


---------94:48----------
you that there's going to be


---------94:49----------
you know maybe you can look for a time


---------94:51----------
in your life where your struggles were


---------94:53----------
horribly invalidated


---------94:55----------
right and and your mind goes there that


---------94:57----------
tells us that like you do


---------94:59----------
feel on some level like your mind can


---------95:01----------
like i'm talking about a position where


---------95:03----------
your struggles are invalidated


---------95:05----------
and you're unfairly judged and your mind


---------95:07----------
is like here we've got it we found the


---------95:08----------
file


---------95:09----------
right yeah it jumps right there so that


---------95:11----------
that i think even though i don't doubt


---------95:14----------
that society has taught you because


---------95:15----------
that's what happened right in that


---------95:17----------
moment


---------95:17----------
is society taught you that like she's


---------95:20----------
been this


---------95:21----------
entire school has thought you're an


---------95:22----------
[ __ ] for two days and


---------95:24----------
it's not like the apology should be


---------95:26----------
public in front of the


---------95:27----------
school assembly because they've been you


---------95:30----------
know


---------95:30----------
and like did anyone know that she


---------95:33----------
apologized did anyone know that


---------95:35----------
you were falsely accused no so the


---------95:37----------
shaming was public but the apology was


---------95:39----------
private and then you were expected to


---------95:41----------
move on


---------95:42----------
that is society's response to you being


---------95:44----------
wronged


---------95:45----------
right and so no no surprise that you


---------95:49----------
were


---------95:49----------
taught or conditioned to feel like


---------95:54----------
you don't get to complain like who are


---------95:56----------
you to complain


---------95:58----------
does that make sense so i get that your


---------96:00----------
condition but i i


---------96:01----------
also think that your mind's ability to


---------96:03----------
connect those two dots means that


---------96:05----------
there's also


---------96:06----------
some amount of like authentic like you


---------96:08----------
recognize that that


---------96:10----------
really was not fair and was uh i


---------96:13----------
i agree i think my question lies more in


---------96:15----------
the fact do other people have that


---------96:17----------
connection and if they don't


---------96:18----------
how do they perceive it because i think


---------96:20----------
it's fine for you to feel like something


---------96:22----------
unjustly happened to you


---------96:23----------
but if other people around you don't


---------96:25----------
acknowledge it it can feel very


---------96:27----------
you start to question it i start to


---------96:29----------
guess like myself to be like


---------96:31----------
did anything really happen uh and so i


---------96:33----------
think that's more so my issue


---------96:35----------
uh more than anything sure sure so so i


---------96:37----------
think that too


---------96:39----------
i'm guessing that there's going to be


---------96:40----------
other stories about that


---------96:42----------
yeah right there are going to be stories


---------96:44----------
where as you grow older and you become


---------96:46----------
more


---------96:46----------
like assured of yourself yeah i bet you


---------96:49----------
if we dug around we would find stories


---------96:51----------
where like you


---------96:52----------
felt a particular way i mean we've even


---------96:53----------
heard a couple right we're like


---------96:55----------
they're these people publicly talking


---------96:56----------
about bound setting and respecting


---------96:59----------
you know people and then like here they


---------97:01----------
are like groping you and


---------97:03----------
you know trying to get a piece of abba


---------97:06----------
yeah because that's that's a fine piece


---------97:07----------
of meat


---------97:08----------
and and then they're like you know


---------97:10----------
they're they're talking one way


---------97:13----------
and you know what i question i


---------97:16----------
question whether or not that kind of


---------97:18----------
stuff


---------97:19----------
has any kind of subconscious negative


---------97:22----------
um


---------97:25----------
consequences in the sense that like it's


---------97:27----------
one thing to say things but i think


---------97:29----------
people really resonate with how you


---------97:30----------
act and in terms of the messaging i


---------97:33----------
wonder if that's not


---------97:34----------
backwards it's like we can say things


---------97:35----------
intrinsically like oh we can say like oh


---------97:37----------
you know


---------97:37----------
we shouldn't do this to each other or


---------97:39----------
like oh you know i know plenty of people


---------97:40----------
like gender roles are terrible and then


---------97:42----------
like you see their dating life and they


---------97:43----------
subscribe to them 150


---------97:44----------
all their choices and how they want to


---------97:46----------
live and i'm like are we doing something


---------97:48----------
that's super confusing


---------97:49----------
in the sense that you know we can say


---------97:50----------
whatever we want but the way that we act


---------97:52----------
really encourages people to not act in


---------97:55----------
line with what we


---------97:55----------
aspire to be but more so how we're being


---------97:57----------
does that make sense yeah i didn't quite


---------97:59----------
follow you but i think i know what


---------98:01----------
you're saying so here's what i would say


---------98:02----------
to that


---------98:03----------
it is very common for someone to


---------98:05----------
publicly support a righteous cause


---------98:08----------
and their ego to excuse them being an


---------98:10----------
[ __ ] in their personal life


---------98:11----------
because they support a good cause


---------98:15----------
i don't know if that's speaking to what


---------98:16----------
you're saying but i think that we see


---------98:18----------
this


---------98:18----------
i see this like a seeming contradiction


---------98:20----------
very often


---------98:22----------
and there's even a term for it in


---------98:23----------
psychology which is reaction formation


---------98:25----------
so it's a defense mechanism okay um


---------98:28----------
where like the the classic example of of


---------98:31----------
reaction formation is the person who's


---------98:33----------
actually gay who becomes a homophobe


---------98:36----------
no okay yes right so like they feel so


---------98:39----------
ashamed of like what they are on the


---------98:40----------
inside that they like they're taught to


---------98:42----------
hate it and then they like resent


---------98:43----------
themselves


---------98:44----------
they're very kind of like ugly on the


---------98:46----------
inside they have a lot of resentment a


---------98:48----------
lot of pain a lot of suffering


---------98:50----------
and then they channel that towards the


---------98:51----------
outside world and like hate gay people


---------98:54----------
right and and so yeah i i think it's not


---------98:57----------
necessarily what i'm going i think where


---------98:58----------
i'm trying to go is like


---------98:59----------
you can have a parent that tells you to


---------99:01----------
not be physically violent with others


---------99:02----------
but if they beat you


---------99:05----------
do you go on to say that's an acceptable


---------99:07----------
response


---------99:08----------
or do you like do you base your reality


---------99:10----------
off of what they did rather than what


---------99:12----------
they said does that make sense


---------99:13----------
absolutely no yeah you base your reality


---------99:15----------
off of the [ __ ] confusion of being in


---------99:17----------
that situation


---------99:18----------
okay okay cool right and and so i i'll


---------99:21----------
give you just another example most of


---------99:22----------
the advice that we give to other human


---------99:24----------
beings is based on the resentment for


---------99:27----------
what we


---------99:28----------
of the mistake mistakes that we've made


---------99:30----------
in the past


---------99:31----------
sure i would agree with that right so


---------99:33----------
like there's there's definitely like


---------99:35----------
some kind of


---------99:36----------
connection and tension between what you


---------99:38----------
say and what you do


---------99:39----------
and there's a reason why human beings


---------99:41----------
are like hypocritical like there's all


---------99:42----------
kinds of psychological reasons why we're


---------99:44----------
hypocritical


---------99:45----------
reaction formation is one one is like it


---------99:48----------
har


---------99:48----------
you know it comes from our own


---------99:49----------
resentment even the political not


---------99:51----------
political but like the views that we're


---------99:52----------
talking about today i think


---------99:54----------
if we really look at the map are deeply


---------99:56----------
rooted in your personal experiences


---------99:57----------
which is


---------99:58----------
reasonable right that's just how we


---------100:00----------
learn to care about particular things


---------100:02----------
that's right that's true um kind of the


---------100:04----------
last sort of academic point that i


---------100:06----------
wanted to mention was kind of back to


---------100:07----------
toxic masculinity


---------100:09----------
and it was sort of like we're trying to


---------100:10----------
figure out what to do about this because


---------100:13----------
the term means so many different things


---------100:15----------
to so many different people


---------100:17----------
right so some people equate toxic


---------100:19----------
masculinity as masculinity is toxic


---------100:22----------
sure right so that's sort of the men is


---------100:24----------
trash masculinity


---------100:26----------
is inherently evil patriarchal whatever


---------100:30----------
you know paternal whatever then there's


---------100:33----------
kind of another perspective on it which


---------100:34----------
is that there's like healthy masculinity


---------100:36----------
and there's


---------100:37----------
toxic masculinity that there are some


---------100:40----------
gender roles which are actually like


---------100:41----------
okay to have and and can even be healthy


---------100:44----------
like


---------100:45----------
competitiveness taking accountability


---------100:47----------
which don't necessarily have to be


---------100:48----------
gendered but


---------100:49----------
sort of are gendered


---------100:52----------
and that somewhere along the way like


---------100:54----------
you know


---------100:55----------
learning to be self-sufficient crosses a


---------100:58----------
certain like gray area


---------101:00----------
into the bridge of like self-isolation


---------101:03----------
you know


---------101:04----------
and and sort of like being in control of


---------101:06----------
your emotions starts to mean like i


---------101:08----------
think a good example is


---------101:09----------
sort of this apology that you were kind


---------101:11----------
of forced into because you can't really


---------101:14----------
like you can't really say no i don't


---------101:16----------
accept your apology right you're not


---------101:18----------
allowed to do that


---------101:19----------
yeah and and so there are certain


---------101:21----------
aspects of masculinity which can


---------101:23----------
become toxic but that masculinity in and


---------101:26----------
of itself is not inherently bad


---------101:28----------
which isn't a separate argument but and


---------101:31----------
so i'm not quite


---------101:32----------
sure because i i do think there's a lot


---------101:33----------
of confusion around these terms and like


---------101:36----------
what it means


---------101:37----------
um you know you're smiling again so


---------101:40----------
penny for your thoughts


---------101:43----------
uh no no i'm actually just listening


---------101:45----------
intently uh while i'm okay


---------101:46----------
yeah so so i think this is something


---------101:49----------
that we're kind of working through


---------101:50----------
um it's something that we do research on


---------101:52----------
and i'm just kind of curious so i i


---------101:53----------
you know i understood your reaction but


---------101:55----------
i just wanted to share sort of how we're


---------101:57----------
thinking about it which is like trying


---------101:58----------
to figure out


---------102:00----------
you know is certain amount okay and then


---------102:01----------
like what is the difference between


---------102:03----------
healthy masculinity and toxic


---------102:05----------
masculinity


---------102:07----------
yeah yeah i think i think even getting


---------102:10----------
to that point


---------102:11----------
having that discussion is difficult for


---------102:12----------
people because the terms are so loaded


---------102:14----------
and because like again you know so many


---------102:16----------
varying definitions and


---------102:18----------
oftentimes we're having these


---------102:19----------
discussions on public platforms and 140


---------102:21----------
characters it's tough to


---------102:23----------
get a good perception of the term and i


---------102:25----------
think branding wise


---------102:26----------
because i i think people hate marketing


---------102:29----------
terms in terms of civil discourse but i


---------102:30----------
think it matters


---------102:31----------
i think how things are branded


---------102:33----------
inherently creates biases and


---------102:35----------
and natural reactions to things that


---------102:38----------
cloud


---------102:39----------
the possibility of like good discourse


---------102:41----------
um


---------102:43----------
and i think most men's reaction when


---------102:44----------
they hear that term is viscerally


---------102:46----------
negative


---------102:47----------
and so you can't even get past the layer


---------102:49----------
of like explaining what's going on


---------102:50----------
behind it


---------102:51----------
because they're so reactionary to the


---------102:54----------
term you've just used


---------102:55----------
you know um so i think


---------102:59----------
i think that's one hurdle that's like


---------103:01----------
very difficult to cross for most people


---------103:03----------
i think i can intellectually do it and


---------103:05----------
and be able to hear that i get what


---------103:07----------
you're saying you know what


---------103:07----------
i agree with you but i also know for


---------103:10----------
most folks that they're not going to get


---------103:11----------
to that point and that's a tough thing


---------103:12----------
to


---------103:14----------
to hear yeah


---------103:17----------
that's my thoughts on on that that first


---------103:19----------
hurdle seems to be the one that most


---------103:20----------
people have difficult with difficulty


---------103:22----------
with


---------103:22----------
and there's also a question to be asked


---------103:23----------
like are we using the right words


---------103:26----------
and some people like what does it matter


---------103:27----------
there's a problem i'm like it does


---------103:29----------
matter though


---------103:30----------
every the the words you use have


---------103:32----------
visceral reactions for everyone


---------103:34----------
you know whether you use words like


---------103:36----------
moist and people are just instantly


---------103:37----------
grossed out even though you're talking


---------103:39----------
about a


---------103:39----------
countertop that is moist just say i did


---------103:41----------
that people like they hear the word


---------103:43----------
our words matter what words we use


---------103:45----------
matter and i think


---------103:46----------
that's such a seems like such a minor


---------103:48----------
detail but i think it's like one of the


---------103:50----------
largest impediments to a real discussion


---------103:52----------
on what i think i agree with you which


---------103:53----------
is the


---------103:54----------
idea is like sometimes you know


---------103:56----------
masculine


---------103:57----------
traditionally masculine traits can be


---------103:58----------
taken too far they do become bad


---------104:01----------
aggression is a perfect example i think


---------104:02----------
men you might correct me if i'm wrong


---------104:04----------
men are overrepresented on one end of


---------104:06----------
the scale in terms of aggression correct


---------104:08----------
i i don't know what you mean by that


---------104:10----------
question when we talk about um


---------104:13----------
the big five right uh i'm pretty sure


---------104:15----------
when it comes to like aggressive type


---------104:16----------
behaviors are men not overrepresented


---------104:18----------
what do you mean by over-represented do


---------104:20----------
you mean greater than 50 percent of


---------104:22----------
aggressive


---------104:22----------
figures are done by men yeah i actually


---------104:24----------
don't know that statistic off the top of


---------104:26----------
my head okay


---------104:27----------
i could be wrong i think i know with


---------104:28----------
like conscientiousness or like you know


---------104:30----------
ideas like compassion i think women


---------104:31----------
might be more represented in some


---------104:32----------
regards like men when it comes to


---------104:33----------
violence like


---------104:34----------
they're much more represented on the


---------104:36----------
extremes if i remember correctly that's


---------104:37----------
what i remember


---------104:38----------
so at times like violent crime


---------104:39----------
traditions why so why men are present


---------104:41----------
there whatever


---------104:42----------
um where was i going with this okay yes


---------104:46----------
i could agree that if you if you over


---------104:48----------
represent men in certain areas


---------104:50----------
uh certain personality traits that yes i


---------104:53----------
could definitely understand that the


---------104:54----------
okay toxic masculine i can see how


---------104:55----------
that's represented


---------104:57----------
um and i think the discussion is valid


---------104:59----------
again i i just think it really comes


---------105:00----------
down to the the


---------105:02----------
the um the branding more than anything


---------105:04----------
that'd be my


---------105:06----------
yeah so i think when it gets to


---------105:08----------
statistics we get into a really tricky


---------105:10----------
situation so like just to give you an


---------105:12----------
example


---------105:12----------
there was a paper that showed that being


---------105:15----------
on


---------105:16----------
antidepressants during pregnancy doubled


---------105:18----------
your risk of having an autistic child


---------105:22----------
so people like when this paper came out


---------105:25----------
people freaked out because like doubling


---------105:27----------
your risk and the other thing that you


---------105:28----------
have to remember is that like


---------105:29----------
media organizations are not about


---------105:32----------
accurate representation


---------105:34----------
of knowledge they're about clicks


---------105:37----------
right so like they're gonna make things


---------105:39----------
as inflammatory as possible certainly


---------105:40----------
one interpretation of the paper


---------105:42----------
the thing that people don't really get


---------105:44----------
though is that


---------105:47----------
if you look at statistically doubling


---------105:48----------
the risk sounds really really bad


---------105:50----------
right but i still think like 98


---------105:54----------
of autistic children are born to women


---------105:57----------
without antidepressants


---------105:59----------
and 98 to 99 of women on antidepressants


---------106:02----------
do not have


---------106:04----------
an autistic child so it's kind of


---------106:07----------
interesting because depending on how you


---------106:08----------
look at the numbers like the vast


---------106:10----------
majority of autistic children are still


---------106:11----------
born to people


---------106:13----------
it doubles your risk but the risk is


---------106:14----------
very very small


---------106:16----------
and so just from an epidemiological


---------106:18----------
perspective it's still like


---------106:19----------
you know 99 out of 100 autistic kids are


---------106:22----------
born to mothers


---------106:23----------
without antidepressants and if you have


---------106:26----------
a 99 if you have it if you're taking


---------106:27----------
antidepressants


---------106:28----------
during pregnancy you have like a less


---------106:30----------
than one percent risk of having an


---------106:32----------
autistic child and so i think when


---------106:35----------
when people ask these questions about


---------106:37----------
you know males are over represented on


---------106:39----------
on


---------106:40----------
the aggression scale i don't know the


---------106:41----------
data but i know that you have to be


---------106:43----------
really careful about interpreting that


---------106:44----------
kind of data


---------106:46----------
because my general perception about men


---------106:48----------
in aggressiveness


---------106:49----------
is that people


---------106:53----------
overestimate the percentage of men who


---------106:55----------
are aggressive


---------106:58----------
yes yes that's been my anecdotal


---------107:00----------
experience


---------107:01----------
is that like yeah i i i want to


---------107:04----------
understand


---------107:05----------
i think that's why i was more so talking


---------107:06----------
about the extremes where it's like a


---------107:07----------
very small minute


---------107:08----------
population size but i get what you're


---------107:10----------
saying yes yeah so you just have to be


---------107:12----------
i just don't know what that means and so


---------107:13----------
i'm hesitant to say yes to that because


---------107:15----------
like


---------107:16----------
i think you know the vast vast majority


---------107:18----------
of men are not


---------107:19----------
violent in any way yeah what i meant to


---------107:23----------
say and maybe


---------107:24----------
i'll just try to clear it up is that


---------107:25----------
idea like when you see extremely high


---------107:28----------
levels of


---------107:29----------
aggressive or violent behavior um


---------107:32----------
traditionally men are overrepresented in


---------107:34----------
that very small


---------107:35----------
population that that i could would


---------107:37----------
completely believe so that's what i was


---------107:38----------
trying to say i just didn't use my words


---------107:40----------
well so what you're saying is that


---------107:42----------
that if you take the most the one


---------107:44----------
percent of the most violent human beings


---------107:46----------
on the planet


---------107:47----------
most of them or more than 50 percent


---------107:49----------
will be men


---------107:50----------
yeah yeah which i i i would completely


---------107:53----------
believe that statistic


---------107:54----------
yeah it's just and i think yeah i think


---------107:56----------
we both agree on that and then


---------107:58----------
you know one thing that was really


---------107:59----------
interesting for me to read up on is the


---------108:00----------
idea that like


---------108:01----------
we're more alike than we are different


---------108:02----------
in terms of like how


---------108:04----------
um those personality traits are


---------108:07----------
represented the idea like uh


---------108:09----------
yes sir go ahead yeah so i mean i was


---------108:11----------
gonna say just as a clinician like


---------108:12----------
that's been my experience is that i


---------108:14----------
certainly think that there are unique


---------108:15----------
gender issues but at the end of the day


---------108:17----------
i'm sort of in buddhist camp which is


---------108:19----------
that if you're born


---------108:22----------
you're sol yeah yeah and


---------108:26----------
you know i'm not mad at that i'm not mad


---------108:28----------
at that and so it's kind of like


---------108:30----------
you know everyone sort of deserves


---------108:32----------
support and help


---------108:34----------
um yeah yep yeah so how are you feeling


---------108:37----------
about today's


---------108:38----------
conversation i mean did we cover most of


---------108:40----------
what you were kind of looking for


---------108:41----------
or yeah no i think it was a great


---------108:43----------
discussion and uh when


---------108:44----------
depth on certain things that i haven't


---------108:46----------
had an opportunity to discuss before so


---------108:47----------
that was great


---------108:48----------
yeah yeah i i mean i i sort of feel like


---------108:50----------
we're at a natural stopping point or


---------108:51----------
pausing point maybe is a better way to


---------108:53----------
to talk about it makes me think back to


---------108:57----------
you know these emails that i wrote to my


---------108:59----------
friends and a couple years ago and i


---------109:01----------
remember i


---------109:02----------
i showed them to one of my uh


---------109:06----------
one of my colleagues and i was like you


---------109:08----------
know i was thinking about talking about


---------109:10----------
some of this stuff publicly and


---------109:11----------
and i was like you know but i i'm not


---------109:13----------
ready to yet because i'm pretty sure i'm


---------109:15----------
going to lose my job


---------109:16----------
you know at harvard and academic


---------109:19----------
position and he was like oh no no


---------109:20----------
if you talk about this you're not going


---------109:22----------
to just lose your academic position


---------109:23----------
you're going to lose


---------109:24----------
all of your positions


---------109:30----------
and so i was like oh okay interesting so


---------109:32----------
yeah


---------109:33----------
gotta make strategic moves um i know i


---------109:36----------
know we're probably nearing the end so i


---------109:37----------
don't want to keep you too long but


---------109:38----------
there's one last thing i want to touch


---------109:39----------
on i think yeah please


---------109:41----------
and this is not related to this topic um


---------109:43----------
but i wanted to know


---------109:44----------
i think oftentimes we talk about


---------109:45----------
depression and uh issues like that


---------109:47----------
affecting us in the first person but i


---------109:49----------
wanted to know what you think about


---------109:52----------
having people around you that are


---------109:53----------
depressed like i have a someone who is


---------109:55----------
almost like a little brother uh going


---------109:57----------
through i don't know i say it's


---------109:58----------
depression but


---------109:59----------
clearly he according to him huge bounce


---------110:02----------
of anxiety he has a hard time


---------110:03----------
functioning in


---------110:04----------
i as his friend um as somebody who loves


---------110:08----------
him i


---------110:09----------
have a hard time knowing how to help him


---------110:12----------
in those situations or what i can't do


---------110:14----------
beyond listening


---------110:16----------
because he feels i feel like he's so


---------110:19----------
deep in it you know and


---------110:23----------
just to give you an idea like i'm


---------110:24----------
convinced i i i believe it's


---------110:26----------
wholeheartedly like i'll get a call any


---------110:27----------
day and just hear that he's gone you


---------110:29----------
know


---------110:29----------
and as a friend it's kind of hard to


---------110:32----------
deal with that kind of powerlessness


---------110:34----------
because i see him suffering and i just


---------110:35----------
don't know


---------110:36----------
how to manage that


---------110:40----------
is that too much to ask at the end no i


---------110:42----------
mean in a sense yes but


---------110:44----------
it needs to be asked and it sounds


---------110:46----------
certainly important so


---------110:47----------
ask it um


---------110:52----------
can i just think for a second


---------110:56----------
by all means


---------111:04----------
what's it what's it like being in the


---------111:07----------
position you're in


---------111:08----------
what's it like sort of trying to support


---------111:10----------
him and


---------111:12----------
him being kind of in a dark place


---------111:16----------
to tile


---------111:19----------
futile because i know he has to take


---------111:21----------
those steps


---------111:23----------
but as someone who's watching the


---------111:24----------
suffering happening in front of them


---------111:26----------
it's like uh


---------111:27----------
difficult what are the stuff he has to


---------111:30----------
take


---------111:31----------
i i'm not sure i know i know how i


---------111:34----------
function so i know how i can move


---------111:35----------
forward


---------111:36----------
i can't i don't want to impose my


---------111:37----------
experience or my way of viewing things


---------111:39----------
on him considering he might have a


---------111:40----------
different experience or


---------111:42----------
might have different needs you know so


---------111:44----------
just so so i don't know what those steps


---------111:46----------
are but i know that


---------111:47----------
there may be things that he has to


---------111:48----------
accept or do things that i don't know


---------111:50----------
you feel powerless yeah i mean i think


---------111:54----------
as a friend you always want to be able


---------111:55----------
to lend a helping hand


---------111:57----------
and and so you want to lend a helping


---------112:01----------
hand what are you doing


---------112:03----------
aside from listening and checking in i


---------112:05----------
don't know what else to do you know i


---------112:06----------
say hey man if you need to talk what's


---------112:08----------
your


---------112:08----------
what's the value of listening and


---------112:10----------
checking it checking in


---------112:14----------
i think there's huge value in it i think


---------112:16----------
it definitely helps people feel like


---------112:19----------
they matter in some sense i hope


---------112:22----------
i think i think i'm worried it'll feel


---------112:24----------
futile or not enough


---------112:25----------
if that person is gone


---------112:28----------
do you do what i'm saying yep i yeah


---------112:32----------
so here's here's here's what i'm hearing


---------112:34----------
that you're doing okay


---------112:36----------
you're helping him understand that he


---------112:38----------
matters


---------112:42----------
your words right


---------112:46----------
what do you think about that


---------112:50----------
it it feels like the most i can do


---------112:54----------
because i i've pondered it and i don't


---------112:56----------
feel


---------112:57----------
i don't think i can do anything else


---------112:59----------
yeah so i i think that


---------113:01----------
um i'm going to give you just a little


---------113:03----------
bit of maybe additional stuff you can do


---------113:05----------
but i think the first thing to


---------113:06----------
understand for people in your situation


---------113:09----------
is that you are doing more way more than


---------113:12----------
you realize


---------113:13----------
like way way more and


---------113:17----------
and the reason is because like so we


---------113:19----------
tend to view


---------113:20----------
our value like you know what you're


---------113:22----------
doing it just doesn't appear to be


---------113:24----------
helping


---------113:26----------
right because it seems like he's not


---------113:28----------
getting better


---------113:29----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------113:31----------
sometimes like if you look at


---------113:32----------
psychiatric treatment like people will


---------113:33----------
be in psychiatric treatment for a year


---------113:35----------
or two and they're not getting better


---------113:37----------
and so one way to interpret that is that


---------113:40----------
you know we're not helping him because


---------113:41----------
treatment doesn't seem to be working


---------113:44----------
but the other thing that sometimes you


---------113:46----------
discover is that your treatment is the


---------113:47----------
only thing that's keeping them afloat


---------113:51----------
right so they're taking on a bunch of


---------113:52----------
water and you're baling it with a bucket


---------113:54----------
on a daily like weekly basis with


---------113:56----------
treatment so this is something that i


---------113:58----------
see very very commonly when friends ask


---------114:00----------
me what more can i do the first thing is


---------114:02----------
that they almost universally


---------114:05----------
grossly underestimate the impact that


---------114:07----------
they're having


---------114:10----------
so you're saying i can't i feel like i'm


---------114:13----------
not doing anything whereas my estimation


---------114:16----------
is you're doing actually like eighty


---------114:18----------
percent of it


---------114:19----------
because i want you to imagine what it's


---------114:21----------
like to be in that person's shoes


---------114:24----------
and be in such a dark spot and to have


---------114:27----------
one


---------114:28----------
beacon of pers someone who no matter


---------114:30----------
what their mind tells them


---------114:32----------
there's one person in their life that is


---------114:34----------
listening to them and is


---------114:35----------
is signaling to them you matter


---------114:40----------
like that's all a human being needs and


---------114:42----------
when when people


---------114:44----------
really like kill themselves and stuff


---------114:45----------
like that what they lose is they lose


---------114:47----------
that last beacon


---------114:49----------
it becomes completely dark


---------114:53----------
right so so i i want to really emphasize


---------114:55----------
that like one beacon


---------114:57----------
and i i've been you know once again


---------114:59----------
anecdotal experience


---------115:01----------
but i've you know i've heard from people


---------115:03----------
who because you know i talk to people


---------115:04----------
who are deeply suicidal for long periods


---------115:06----------
of time


---------115:07----------
about like what keeps them going and i


---------115:10----------
cannot


---------115:11----------
tell you how many times i've heard just


---------115:13----------
the most


---------115:14----------
random things that seem so insignificant


---------115:17----------
like their cat


---------115:20----------
right like what would happen to their


---------115:22----------
cat if they died


---------115:25----------
and that a lot of times like people will


---------115:27----------
say like this is the one person


---------115:29----------
you should go back i forget if it's the


---------115:32----------
porn addiction stream or the burnt out


---------115:34----------
gifted kids stream


---------115:35----------
we had a stream where some guy was


---------115:37----------
talking about like he was so close to


---------115:39----------
suicide


---------115:40----------
except there was one random person on


---------115:42----------
the internet that they would like talk


---------115:43----------
to every single day


---------115:45----------
and like i remember we were joking at


---------115:47----------
the end of the stream about how like


---------115:49----------
that person is the hero


---------115:50----------
and the thing is like that person is


---------115:52----------
never gonna know


---------115:54----------
yeah right because you're just not gonna


---------115:55----------
get that feedback


---------115:57----------
um and and this is where


---------116:00----------
you know i hate to break it to you but


---------116:02----------
i'm very good at my job and i can't


---------116:04----------
keep someone alive right right so that


---------116:08----------
outcome


---------116:08----------
there's another subtle thing that your


---------116:10----------
mind is doing which is that


---------116:12----------
if i do more i can prevent a particular


---------116:14----------
outcome


---------116:15----------
no you can't can you do more sure can


---------116:18----------
you do less


---------116:18----------
sure but you can't your


---------116:22----------
fear that you're gonna wake up one day


---------116:24----------
and discover that he's gone is not


---------116:26----------
something that you can actually control


---------116:28----------
you can be really good and believe me


---------116:30----------
i'm really good and i've learned that


---------116:32----------
lesson the hard way


---------116:33----------
right right that as human being i


---------116:35----------
fundamentally cannot control the actions


---------116:38----------
of another human being no matter how


---------116:40----------
many years i spent studying in india and


---------116:41----------
what institutions i've trained at


---------116:44----------
i cannot keep someone from ending their


---------116:47----------
life


---------116:47----------
i mean i can in sort of acute in


---------116:49----------
specific situations


---------116:50----------
and i do have a good impact on it but at


---------116:52----------
the end of the day there's a certain


---------116:53----------
amount that you just can't do i think i


---------116:56----------
understand that intellectually


---------116:58----------
these are things i know i think it's


---------117:00----------
just coping with that reality that's


---------117:02----------
difficult


---------117:04----------
yeah so that's where so i i get that you


---------117:06----------
are so then i think that


---------117:08----------
this is where the conversation really


---------117:09----------
becomes a longer conversation because


---------117:13----------
in the same way that some of these like


---------117:14----------
views around men's issues are tied to


---------117:16----------
your personal experiences


---------117:19----------
there may be something here about you


---------117:22----------
know when you were so alone


---------117:25----------
and when you were so you know isolated


---------117:28----------
and in a dark place that there may be


---------117:31----------
something there that


---------117:34----------
you know may i i don't know i mean i


---------117:36----------
think there if it's


---------117:37----------
if you want to understand it


---------117:38----------
intellectually but you feel a particular


---------117:40----------
way like there's an exploration process


---------117:43----------
around those feelings that can lead us


---------117:46----------
to some kind of


---------117:47----------
understanding which will then like


---------117:48----------
decompress the feelings


---------117:50----------
is it not possible that it's just a fear


---------117:53----------
of the inevitable


---------117:55----------
inevitability in the sense that like


---------117:58----------
this is someone i just care deeply about


---------118:02----------
and i see them suffering and it and i


---------118:04----------
what you said is 100 correct maybe


---------118:06----------
my impact is way higher than i'm


---------118:07----------
estimating i could actually probably


---------118:09----------
concede that to you but i think it


---------118:12----------
doesn't


---------118:15----------
even though i know that and i know i


---------118:17----------
can't have a white


---------118:19----------
why do you think it's inevitable


---------118:22----------
just just the way i hear him speak and


---------118:27----------
just the way i hear him speak


---------118:30----------
there's a certain like era of


---------118:32----------
hopelessness that that he has when he


---------118:33----------
speaks


---------118:34----------
and sometimes it fades but then it comes


---------118:36----------
back so strongly


---------118:38----------
so and then he and then and then there's


---------118:40----------
like a disappearance yeah go ahead


---------118:42----------
so you said the words we use matter


---------118:44----------
right sure


---------118:45----------
yeah so they matter the


---------118:49----------
the way we interpret words is based on


---------118:50----------
our own experience


---------118:52----------
right so if you're hearing his words


---------118:56----------
why does your mind interpret that as


---------119:00----------
hopelessness


---------119:02----------
see if you want to get to the bottom of


---------119:03----------
this that's where you have to go


---------119:06----------
right because i i feel like i'm watching


---------119:09----------
somebody in the loop


---------119:11----------
and the loop seems never ending like


---------119:14----------
where they were at day one


---------119:16----------
and day 95 seems exactly identical or


---------119:19----------
progressively getting worse


---------119:20----------
does that seem possible how long has


---------119:22----------
this person been on this


---------119:24----------
in this loop a few years a few years and


---------119:27----------
so


---------119:29----------
a few years but i've watched it


---------119:30----------
progressively get worse and more intense


---------119:32----------
and


---------119:33----------
and this person has like reiterated the


---------119:35----------
idea that it's getting more intense and


---------119:38----------
is this person getting professional help


---------119:40----------
i think they tried and


---------119:43----------
didn't like the experience so they quit


---------119:44----------
so you know i've offered to


---------119:46----------
to pay for it and whatever you know but


---------119:48----------
it's one of those things where


---------119:49----------
unless they take the olive branch i


---------119:50----------
can't force it on them so um


---------119:53----------
sure but there are ways you can get them


---------119:54----------
to take the olive branch so here are a


---------119:56----------
couple things you can do


---------119:57----------
okay very practically all right so i


---------119:59----------
know like


---------120:00----------
i think this is definitely a longer


---------120:01----------
discussion but um let me try to at least


---------120:04----------
give you a couple things because this is


---------120:05----------
a question we get a lot how can i help


---------120:06----------
someone


---------120:07----------
so the first is i think you can share


---------120:09----------
with them


---------120:10----------
how you feel so you can tell them that


---------120:14----------
you know you


---------120:15----------
i hear that you're getting worse i hear


---------120:17----------
you've been struggling with this


---------120:18----------
a long time i'm trying to be here for


---------120:20----------
you i want to support you


---------120:21----------
i'm always here to listen and also i'm


---------120:24----------
terrified


---------120:26----------
that one day i'm gonna wake up and


---------120:29----------
you're not gonna be here anymore


---------120:32----------
could i ask just one thing right there


---------120:34----------
does that not place


---------120:35----------
more pressure on them yes


---------120:40----------
yeah and is that a good or a bad thing


---------120:43----------
it's a good thing okay so here's why


---------120:47----------
so in relationships we have caregivers


---------120:49----------
and caretakers


---------120:52----------
right what are you in the relationship


---------120:55----------
the caregiver


---------120:56----------
the caretaker uh the caregiver i would


---------121:00----------
assume


---------121:00----------
and then they are the caretake caretaker


---------121:04----------
so who's responsible for making things


---------121:06----------
right


---------121:09----------
uh


---------121:13----------
hmm are they okay actually i i guess it


---------121:16----------
would be me yep yeah


---------121:21----------
that needs to change right yeah because


---------121:24----------
even the framing of how you said it kind


---------121:25----------
of threw me off a little bit but okay


---------121:27----------
yep


---------121:28----------
right so like like this is where because


---------121:30----------
he does


---------121:31----------
so it's authentic can it be dangerous


---------121:33----------
absolutely can it pressure him more


---------121:35----------
absolutely


---------121:36----------
could it tip him over the edge


---------121:38----------
absolutely


---------121:41----------
and this is a relationship you aren't


---------121:43----------
his doctor


---------121:45----------
right you're his friend right and so one


---------121:48----------
of the best things you can do for


---------121:50----------
another human being is let them take


---------121:52----------
care of you


---------121:55----------
right like he has to understand that


---------121:57----------
like like this is the problem is it's


---------121:59----------
all one way right now


---------122:02----------
and he's got to understand that like he


---------122:04----------
he carries some of this weight in this


---------122:06----------
relationship


---------122:08----------
you can't carry it all on your own and


---------122:09----------
it's healthy


---------122:11----------
for you to tell him like i don't want to


---------122:14----------
wake up and not have you there


---------122:16----------
that day and so it's like his


---------122:18----------
responsibility to like


---------122:20----------
alleviate that fear in you and is that


---------122:22----------
going to put pressure on him


---------122:24----------
absolutely and so then you talk about


---------122:26----------
that


---------122:27----------
and you even say i was afraid that if i


---------122:30----------
shared this with you


---------122:31----------
it would be like too much for you to


---------122:32----------
handle but i've been sitting with this


---------122:35----------
for a long time


---------122:36----------
and like i'm i'm afraid


---------122:40----------
and because you're my friend like i hope


---------122:43----------
i can share this with you is it okay


---------122:44----------
that i shared it with you


---------122:49----------
right so i think this is a real problem


---------122:50----------
with like mental illness i see this a


---------122:52----------
lot as a psychiatrist is like


---------122:54----------
speaking of accountability too many


---------122:56----------
psychiatrists take accountability away


---------122:58----------
from their patients


---------123:01----------
and it's not healthy it's how you create


---------123:03----------
a dependent patient


---------123:05----------
and part of what i have to do is like


---------123:07----------
give that power back to them


---------123:10----------
right like you have to give him you're


---------123:12----------
saying that the issue is he's powerless


---------123:13----------
like give him some of that power


---------123:15----------
but here's the problem if you give him


---------123:17----------
that power he could do something with it


---------123:19----------
he could do the wrong thing


---------123:21----------
but you're basically like you're


---------123:22----------
surrendering


---------123:24----------
that piece of the relationship to him


---------123:27----------
and could it be too much


---------123:28----------
for him to handle absolutely but is it


---------123:29----------
healthy in the long run i think so


---------123:32----------
you know if you're really dealing with


---------123:34----------
issues of suicidality and stuff i think


---------123:35----------
what he really needs is professional


---------123:37----------
help


---------123:37----------
but from uh from a more you know macro


---------123:41----------
level like taking that kind of off the


---------123:43----------
table


---------123:44----------
i want you and everyone else to


---------123:45----------
understand that a lot of times the most


---------123:47----------
important thing that you can do for


---------123:48----------
someone is have faith in them to do it


---------123:50----------
themselves


---------123:52----------
and sometimes that means like not


---------123:53----------
protecting them from it


---------123:55----------
right because you're like so protective


---------123:57----------
you're like we talked about oh


---------123:59----------
parental gatekeeping in here you are


---------124:02----------
yeah because you're treating him like


---------124:04----------
he's frail but like it sounds to me like


---------124:06----------
he's actually incredibly strong that


---------124:08----------
he's been


---------124:09----------
sinking further and further below water


---------124:11----------
for years and he's still around


---------124:13----------
sounds incredibly resilient yeah


---------124:16----------
but you know i agree i think he's


---------124:18----------
resilient i think he's dealt with so


---------124:20----------
much and


---------124:20----------
you know me knowing his lifestyle i


---------124:22----------
agree um


---------124:24----------
i just worry that he gets to a point


---------124:26----------
where enough becomes enough and he's


---------124:27----------
tired of struggling you know


---------124:29----------
and i can't tell somebody to keep


---------124:30----------
suffering but um


---------124:32----------
so i think that that too is a reasonable


---------124:34----------
thing for you to share with him that you


---------124:36----------
sh you have that fear that enough is


---------124:38----------
enough


---------124:38----------
and then the more practical thing is i


---------124:40----------
would really talk to him about


---------124:42----------
you know asking about his experience of


---------124:45----------
mental health treatment and and try to


---------124:47----------
really direct him that way because this


---------124:48----------
is


---------124:49----------
really you know i i don't know exactly


---------124:52----------
what the situation is but it sounds like


---------124:54----------
you're afraid and that he really needs


---------124:55----------
help and so there's like


---------124:57----------
you know one bad experience doesn't you


---------124:59----------
know


---------125:00----------
yeah it's like they're good burgers and


---------125:02----------
they're bad burgers you shouldn't write


---------125:03----------
off all burgers based on just having one


---------125:05----------
bad burger


---------125:06----------
i agree i agree so that's really what i


---------125:09----------
would encourage him to do is to try to


---------125:12----------
you know try to understand what his


---------125:14----------
negative experience was and try to push


---------125:16----------
him in the right direction


---------125:17----------
okay well that was uh wonderful advice


---------125:20----------
and it's something i'll probably get to


---------125:21----------
right


---------125:22----------
probably today so thank you for that


---------125:24----------
yeah well thanks a lot for the


---------125:26----------
conversation


---------125:27----------
and you know i hope things work out well


---------125:30----------
yeah and good luck to you and your


---------125:33----------
friend


---------125:34----------
yeah again so thank you for doing this i


---------125:35----------
honestly mean a lot of people in my


---------125:37----------
community reached out when they heard i


---------125:38----------
was going to talk about


---------125:39----------
the last subject so um you just taken


---------125:41----------
the time to talk about that was good for


---------125:42----------
me and
