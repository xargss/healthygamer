what are you feeling when you talk about


---------00:22----------
your dad when you tell that story you be


---------00:24----------
I feel let down


---------00:25----------
I feel abandoned right I feel vulnerable


---------00:31----------
again as I did more I see anger oh yeah


---------00:37----------
oh yeah fair


---------00:43----------
of course one two three hi I'm Ethan


---------00:45----------
Evans I'm happy to be here this is gonna


---------00:47----------
be fun my whole community is waiting too


---------00:49----------
so we're all good to go


---------00:51----------
is that better keep talking yeah sure


---------00:54----------
let's see what's reet auch about today


---------00:57----------
you were asking about the weather it's


---------00:58----------
cold here we've had a ton of snow it's


---------01:00----------
skiing time at the end of the day oh


---------01:02----------
where are you located Seattle Washington


---------01:04----------
actually I know you through Devin he and


---------01:07----------
I were lucky enough to be in the same


---------01:08----------
city it's how we stream together


---------01:10----------
oh cool very cool oh okay he's too loud


---------01:13----------
now I'm too loud okay all right okay how


---------01:16----------
about okay I think we're good now


---------01:19----------
so okay so so yeah so we're talking a


---------01:25----------
little bit about sort of stress


---------01:26----------
management and burnout we're talking


---------01:28----------
about workplace stress yeah yeah not so


---------01:30----------
much burnout but I'm an executive at


---------01:33----------
Amazon and so I wanted I thought it'd be


---------01:37----------
a good topic for us to talk about about


---------01:39----------
how people could handle their stress at


---------01:41----------
work and of course people would love for


---------01:43----------
you to advise me how to be a less


---------01:45----------
stressful boss for them okay like what


---------01:48----------
can executives do differently and then I


---------01:49----------
have my own stress issues I'm happy to


---------01:52----------
share okay and learn about cuz we have


---------01:55----------
this time and we have next Friday - yeah


---------01:57----------
so I think the first thing is oddly


---------01:59----------
enough what I do want which is not


---------02:01----------
actually what my area of expertise is


---------02:03----------
what my area of expertise is is what we


---------02:06----------
are talking about yes so I know that in


---------02:08----------
my day job I I do some work at different


---------02:11----------
kinds of corporations investment banks


---------02:13----------
startups hospitals in sort of stress


---------02:18----------
management programs and sort of helping


---------02:20----------
people optimize their performance manage


---------02:21----------
stress things like that so this is I


---------02:24----------
love talking about this stuff because


---------02:25----------
it's kind of right up my alley so what


---------02:26----------
is - yeah go ahead


---------02:28----------
all right that's that's that's that's


---------02:31----------
what I thought would be good is this is


---------02:32----------
like your sweet spot and yet I have to


---------02:35----------
think because the stream I do on Twitch


---------02:37----------
is like what Devin does a lot we're


---------02:39----------
trying to help people build their


---------02:40----------
careers and be successful at work so


---------02:43----------
it's not classic gaming at all and


---------02:45----------
stress and managing stress is a lot


---------02:48----------
about having a successful career


---------02:49----------
absolutely so


---------02:52----------
having occur a successful career is also


---------02:54----------
about managing stress yes true yeah so I


---------02:58----------
tend to work best when I use actual like


---------03:01----------
scenarios as opposed to abstract


---------03:03----------
examples yep so can you just tell me a


---------03:05----------
little bit about what you find stressful


---------03:07----------
or what people in your workplace might


---------03:09----------
may find stressful yeah I thought a lot


---------03:11----------
about this so Amazon is famously known


---------03:14----------
as a difficult workplace and we have a


---------03:17----------
number of leadership principles one of


---------03:19----------
which is called high standards and the


---------03:23----------
leadership principle reads Amazon has


---------03:27----------
relentlessly high standards standards


---------03:29----------
that others may find unreasonable and so


---------03:33----------
as a leader I'm supposed to hold people


---------03:35----------
to this and also my managers also hold


---------03:38----------
me to it


---------03:38----------
so then being specific like a specific


---------03:42----------
situation would be performance of a


---------03:45----------
program I'm working on I'll have to be a


---------03:50----------
little circumspect about you know


---------03:52----------
financial details and stuff but if a


---------03:54----------
program isn't hitting financial goals or


---------03:57----------
isn't hitting growth goals you have a


---------04:01----------
ton of stress because you know you're


---------04:03----------
going to be asked about it you know


---------04:04----------
you're going to spend time writing long


---------04:06----------
explanations of why it is and culturally


---------04:11----------
it is common for leaders to still


---------04:14----------
express disappointment to say well okay


---------04:17----------
you've explained it all but it's still


---------04:18----------
like the fundamental problem is it's


---------04:20----------
still not good enough results do better


---------04:22----------
and often their feedback is more you go


---------04:27----------
do better or not I can help you okay so


---------04:32----------
so I think so this is your culture


---------04:34----------
sounds a lot like the culture of you


---------04:38----------
know top tier academic medical centers


---------04:40----------
yes so so you know I think any any time


---------04:43----------
you go to sort of the top of a field if


---------04:45----------
you're talking about like a place like


---------04:47----------
Goldman Sachs or Mass General Hospital


---------04:49----------
which are amazing institutions they have


---------04:52----------
a very sort of outcome oriented approach


---------04:55----------
right and and results are what matters


---------04:59----------
so like in the world of academic


---------05:00----------
medicine research funding can be very


---------05:02----------
cutthroat and whether like whether you


---------05:04----------
get you live or die by your grand


---------05:06----------
and if you don't get a grant you don't


---------05:07----------
have a job yep and it can be very hard


---------05:10----------
and so that's just sort of the culture


---------05:11----------
because it's a culture of performance


---------05:13----------
right yeah absolutely and that's our


---------05:16----------
culture too yeah so the first question


---------05:18----------
that I have for you is does a culture of


---------05:21----------
performance lead to the best performance


---------05:23----------
I don't know the thought would be of


---------05:28----------
course it does right the performance is


---------05:30----------
important then that you're setting the


---------05:31----------
standard and that you're talking about


---------05:33----------
it and so a culture of performance


---------05:35----------
should create performance that would be


---------05:38----------
the idea that's generally what people


---------05:40----------
think right which is why they have


---------05:42----------
cultures of performance because they


---------05:44----------
believe that if we have a culture of


---------05:47----------
performance then people will live up to


---------05:48----------
the standard that we set and it's all


---------05:50----------
about meeting standards yeah so let's


---------05:52----------
just talk about you for a second okay


---------05:54----------
when have you done when do you do your


---------05:56----------
best work so huh I love how you put me


---------06:03----------
on the spot I actually do my best work


---------06:07----------
outside of work like not in the office


---------06:11----------
when I can get clear thinking time I do


---------06:14----------
the best work in my lounge chair sitting


---------06:17----------
over here in my house okay so let's just


---------06:19----------
think about what that means yeah you say


---------06:22----------
I do my best work when I get clear


---------06:25----------
thinking time yep right so the question


---------06:28----------
is what are the risk factors for clear


---------06:30----------
thinking time and what are the risk


---------06:32----------
factors for unclear thinking time okay


---------06:35----------
so what leads to unclear thinking


---------06:40----------
distractions sure and mental pressure or


---------06:46----------
feeling attacked or judged because then


---------06:51----------
you're spending your time on your


---------06:53----------
emotions and on how you're gonna get


---------06:55----------
yourself feeling better so that you can


---------06:59----------
focus on the actual work okay so when


---------07:03----------
you're thinking about how your boss is


---------07:05----------
going to respond to your work product


---------07:07----------
yeah what does that do to your thinking


---------07:15----------
well it adds stress it can add clarity


---------07:20----------
in the sense that you can reason through


---------07:22----------
like okay what is my boss need if I


---------07:25----------
think he's going to respond this way can


---------07:27----------
i address that so it can add clarity but


---------07:31----------
particularly if the feedback from a


---------07:33----------
leader is negative it can also just get


---------07:37----------
you churning and cycling on absolutely


---------07:39----------
I feel judged I feel inadequate so just


---------07:43----------
to be clear like if we're talking about


---------07:45----------
those feelings do those put us in a


---------07:46----------
clear thinking mindset earn unclear


---------07:48----------
thinking unclear


---------07:49----------
uncaps aloo right now so if we stop and


---------07:52----------
we actually think about you you do your


---------07:55----------
best work when you're thinking clearly


---------07:56----------
which is sort of a no-brainer and the


---------07:59----------
interesting thing is that you you sort


---------08:00----------
of talk about sitting particularly in a


---------08:02----------
lounge chair so there's a space that's


---------08:04----------
sort of like a stress-free space where


---------08:06----------
you're not actually concerned about how


---------08:08----------
your bosses are gonna respond to


---------08:10----------
something so you can actually devote


---------08:12----------
yourself to the thing that your bosses


---------08:14----------
want you to do yep right you can devote


---------08:17----------
yourself to the work as opposed to


---------08:19----------
devoting yourself to performance yes


---------08:23----------
what do you think about that is that I


---------08:24----------
mean disagree let's think about caveats


---------08:28----------
restate the proposition ones so you do


---------08:32----------
your best work when you have a clear


---------08:34----------
head and when you have a clear head


---------08:35----------
you're not actually thinking about


---------08:37----------
performance in fact what I would say


---------08:39----------
that a clear head is for you is that


---------08:41----------
you're not worried about performance and


---------08:42----------
you're worried about the task at hand or


---------08:44----------
the actual work there's doing the work


---------08:47----------
and then there's whether the work lives


---------08:49----------
up to standards right you know it's like


---------08:51----------
creating a good product and whether my


---------08:52----------
boss is gonna be happy with these are


---------08:54----------
separate things in your mind yep you


---------08:55----------
should be focused on doing the best work


---------08:58----------
not what people are gonna think of it if


---------09:01----------
you focus on work product you get the


---------09:02----------
best work


---------09:03----------
what does Amazon's work culture well


---------09:08----------
it's hard to generalize 600,000 people


---------09:10----------
what


---------09:12----------
Amazon's work culture has a lot of


---------09:15----------
review another principle we have is


---------09:18----------
called dive deep and so leaders


---------09:21----------
including myself were expected to audit


---------09:23----------
others okay expected to dig into what


---------09:26----------
they're doing and then my leaders above


---------09:27----------
me or


---------09:28----------
to dig into and audit what I'm doing


---------09:31----------
absolutely and so you can anticipate or


---------09:34----------
expect being audited yeah and and so


---------09:38----------
that puts the culture is one where you


---------09:42----------
end up thinking about the standards not


---------09:45----------
just about the work and how do you think


---------09:48----------
that impacts the work that's the


---------09:50----------
operative question to the I think so I


---------09:58----------
feel like you're fishing in a sense and


---------10:00----------
I want to give a dual answer fine


---------10:02----------
overly stressing about it lowers the


---------10:05----------
quality of work being aware of the


---------10:07----------
standards so that you know what the goal


---------10:09----------
is has value but when that tips over


---------10:13----------
into fear or worry it becomes a


---------10:16----------
distraction yeah so I think I think


---------10:19----------
you're you're sort of right that I'm


---------10:21----------
kind of fishing for something and in a


---------10:23----------
sense I think that in my mind that's the


---------10:25----------
right answer


---------10:25----------
so I think one thing that we oftentimes


---------10:28----------
forget about stress is that we use the


---------10:31----------
word stress to actually mean distress so


---------10:34----------
there are two types of stress there's


---------10:36----------
you stress and distress but we've lost


---------10:38----------
that distinction yes you stress I've


---------10:41----------
heard that term and know about it but


---------10:43----------
you're right I never hear it and so


---------10:46----------
that's just because we sort of forget


---------10:47----------
that like okay so when you have


---------10:49----------
capabilities and you have a task the


---------10:53----------
relationship between your capabilities


---------10:56----------
and your task results in a number of


---------10:58----------
different things if the task outweighs


---------11:00----------
your capabilities your D you're in


---------11:02----------
distress because your handle it if the


---------11:06----------
task is too easy then what happens to


---------11:08----------
your performance you become bored and


---------11:12----------
you may do the task okay but your


---------11:16----------
motivation drops absent or so would you


---------11:18----------
say that that your effort towards the


---------11:20----------
task and your success at the task if the


---------11:23----------
easier the task gets what happens to the


---------11:26----------
quality of the work that you produce


---------11:28----------
does it just get higher and higher no I


---------11:32----------
think it flatlines if the task is really


---------11:35----------
easy you sort of take it to a limit and


---------11:39----------
then you move on and you look for


---------11:41----------
something else


---------11:41----------
ABB's


---------11:42----------
right so that's kind of weird because if


---------11:43----------
we're saying that the difficulty of the


---------11:45----------
task is like a like if we talk about a


---------11:47----------
slope right now and if and this is our


---------11:50----------
capability and here's the difficulty of


---------11:52----------
the task know that as we go to high our


---------11:55----------
performance drops but interestingly


---------11:56----------
enough if we go to low our performance


---------11:58----------
actually drops yep makes sense that


---------12:00----------
middle zone is what's called you stress


---------12:03----------
so this is when the body and brain are


---------12:05----------
literally primed to wear so you have a


---------12:08----------
certain amount of stress hormones that


---------12:10----------
are active so one example of this is


---------12:12----------
like adrenaline where adrenaline causes


---------12:14----------
you to literally lose your peripheral


---------12:17----------
vision and focus on a narrow perspective


---------12:19----------
like literally if you look at the stunt


---------12:22----------
the physiology of the eye when you have


---------12:24----------
adrenaline at a high level in your body


---------12:26----------
normally your peripheral vision is


---------12:28----------
actually about 180 degrees which a lot


---------12:30----------
of people don't realize right and then


---------12:31----------
as adrenaline increases it narrows down


---------12:34----------
to a field of view of 30 degrees yep and


---------12:37----------
so i've experienced this yeah so at 180


---------12:42----------
it's easy to become distracted because


---------12:44----------
you're seeing this over there and you're


---------12:45----------
seeing this over there but if your


---------12:47----------
adrenaline level is too too high then


---------12:50----------
you also get this sort of tunnel vision


---------12:52----------
when it's easy to lose perspective and


---------12:54----------
when you talk about an unclear mind I


---------12:57----------
think you're kind of hitting it right on


---------12:59----------
the head where you know you want to know


---------13:01----------
that people are gonna be checking your


---------13:04----------
work you want to know that your bosses


---------13:06----------
are gonna be expecting a lot from you


---------13:08----------
but then you can easily collapse down in


---------13:11----------
a tunnel vision where you start worrying


---------13:13----------
about that and then we tip into the


---------13:15----------
distress we tip into non optimal


---------13:18----------
performance no and I think I've thought


---------13:23----------
about it right I've been at Amazon 15


---------13:24----------
years I've had a lot of time to think


---------13:26----------
about the culture I think a lot of the


---------13:30----------
culture and I think this is common in


---------13:32----------
workplaces leaders lead through a


---------13:35----------
scarcity mindset where they believe that


---------13:37----------
if they say too much positive about your


---------13:39----------
work you'll get lazy in other words if


---------13:43----------
they're not constantly pushing you'll


---------13:46----------
you won't do it out of your own


---------13:47----------
motivation you're only doing it because


---------13:49----------
you're being challenged and the result


---------13:53----------
is most of the


---------13:56----------
in many cases I hear this Donnell ID not


---------13:58----------
only see it I hear it a lot most of the


---------14:00----------
feedback is okay that was great


---------14:02----------
now here's 12 more things that could be


---------14:05----------
better right in other words when


---------14:08----------
something gets evaluated it's one good


---------14:10----------
thing about it and then ten possible


---------14:12----------
improvements yeah so I think the that's


---------14:16----------
you know I understand how that works


---------14:19----------
because I think that's also how the


---------14:21----------
cultures of like most top and companies


---------14:25----------
or institutions in their field function


---------14:27----------
time and at the same time I don't


---------14:31----------
believe in my experience I think there's


---------14:33----------
another way which is actually better


---------14:36----------
tell me more so so this is sort of


---------14:38----------
finding that area of you stress where


---------14:41----------
the degree of stress that you have


---------14:42----------
actually Prime's your mind enough and


---------14:44----------
gets you to I think a good example of


---------14:47----------
this is the flow State so you stress


---------14:49----------
facilitates a flow State yes so you


---------14:51----------
can't be bored and get into a flow


---------14:53----------
straight I can't be panicked and get


---------14:56----------
into a flow State that there are good


---------14:57----------
studies that show that optimal work


---------14:59----------
product comes from a flow State but I


---------15:02----------
think the culture that Amazon has and


---------15:04----------
it's not my place to judge but you know


---------15:06----------
we're talking about I'm not saying it's


---------15:07----------
good I think it's common so MGH is the


---------15:09----------
same way Harvard Medical School is the


---------15:10----------
same way is that they have a very


---------15:13----------
performance oriented culture that often


---------15:15----------
times tips people into distress and


---------15:17----------
impostor syndrome and these kinds of


---------15:19----------
things and that at the end of the day


---------15:21----------
someone who is that that's not going to


---------15:24----------
be the best work product that I think


---------15:26----------
that like the best work product comes


---------15:28----------
when you have an employee who's actually


---------15:30----------
inspired to do the thing that they want


---------15:32----------
to do and you do have a certain amount


---------15:35----------
of kind of oversight that keeps people


---------15:38----------
honest because there's also studies that


---------15:40----------
show that if you really give people a


---------15:42----------
free rein that are gonna start slack off


---------15:43----------
and they're gonna work just as hard as


---------15:45----------
they can to like not get fired now so


---------15:48----------
both - yep and I think it also depends


---------15:52----------
on on what level you're talking about


---------15:54----------
within an organization because I think


---------15:57----------
that when people have demonstrated a


---------15:59----------
high degree of internal motivation and


---------16:02----------
value with like putting out like they


---------16:04----------
demonstrate personal pride and doing


---------16:06----------
good work I think you can be more


---------16:08----------
encouraging


---------16:09----------
because they're gonna have that natural


---------16:11----------
for lack of a better term like


---------16:12----------
neuroticism so an in medical school for


---------16:15----------
example medical students are highly


---------16:16----------
highly neurotic which is how we get


---------16:18----------
there so we worry a lot on the inside


---------16:20----------
we're afraid that we didn't study enough


---------16:22----------
we're afraid that we're not gonna do


---------16:24----------
well enough on the test our neuroticism


---------16:25----------
is already high enough in it and it


---------16:27----------
strives us to be successful in the world


---------16:29----------
it's not a negative trait in terms of


---------16:31----------
performance but once you get to medical


---------16:33----------
school you would be amazed at how much


---------16:36----------
you can get a medical student to perform


---------16:38----------
because their neuroticism is already


---------16:39----------
high they don't need it from their boss


---------16:42----------
in fact encouragement in like lets them


---------16:46----------
do better so like when you say hey like


---------16:49----------
I can see that you learned a lot about


---------16:51----------
lisinopril and ace inhibitors that's


---------16:54----------
awesome I think this patient is really


---------16:56----------
going to do better because you kind of


---------16:58----------
know this information it's really useful


---------16:59----------
information and then I'm like what's


---------17:02----------
that like what's that what they're gonna


---------17:03----------
do is go home the next day and they're


---------17:05----------
gonna be like since they're so starved


---------17:07----------
for positive reinforcement there that is


---------17:10----------
gonna reinforce their behavior to be


---------17:11----------
like tomorrow when I go to work I want


---------17:13----------
them to say that again and I want them


---------17:16----------
to say it again and I want them to say


---------17:17----------
it again that's like an endorphin hit


---------17:19----------
right positive feedback in a high and a


---------17:22----------
high performance culture yeah and and I


---------17:27----------
think interestingly I don't think we do


---------17:32----------
a very good job of that in corporate


---------17:33----------
America in other words what you're


---------17:35----------
describing in the medical school is


---------17:36----------
actually more positive than what and of


---------17:39----------
course I'm generalizing I'm speaking for


---------17:42----------
my own experience and not on behalf of


---------17:44----------
the company but I see some leaders do


---------17:48----------
better than others but overall it's it's


---------17:51----------
a there's an opportunity for improvement


---------17:53----------
there and that's what I'm interested


---------17:54----------
both in sharing with our audiences and


---------17:56----------
also your advice on how we can like


---------17:58----------
change corporate America a little bit


---------18:00----------
over time yeah so I think let's I'm


---------18:03----------
gonna take a step back that's really


---------18:05----------
useful to know so first of all you know


---------18:07----------
the main question is does the culture of


---------18:10----------
performance actually lead to optimal


---------18:12----------
performance right and my aunt's I think


---------18:15----------
that while we see it widely amongst


---------18:17----------
corporate America and top-tier


---------18:18----------
institutions so I think that the data


---------18:21----------
sort of would imply that the answer is


---------18:23----------
the


---------18:23----------
I think there's a lot of interesting


---------18:25----------
work work happen to get like HBS and


---------18:27----------
other places where I do a little bit of


---------18:29----------
work here there right it that suggests


---------18:33----------
otherwise so like I know that when I go


---------18:35----------
to actual like investment banks or


---------18:37----------
private equity fund firms and I teach


---------18:40----------
them how to meditate and I teach them


---------18:42----------
sort of a different way to look at


---------18:43----------
things they their performance actually


---------18:45----------
improves so like their metrics get


---------18:47----------
better and what I mean by that is so I


---------18:51----------
think the real challenge here so Ethan


---------18:55----------
let me ask you a question so first of


---------18:57----------
all a couple questions one is that I can


---------18:59----------
like kind of talk and if that's good and


---------19:02----------
what you're interested in I can continue


---------19:03----------
to do that so I was gonna explain like


---------19:05----------
one very important nuance that I think a


---------19:08----------
lot of corporate America doesn't


---------19:10----------
understand the other thing that I can do


---------19:13----------
is ask you more personal questions about


---------19:15----------
like your specific stress and and


---------19:17----------
because I think we're gonna we can get a


---------19:19----------
lot of rich information there I don't


---------19:20----------
know what you're interested in or what


---------19:22----------
you signed up for so I'm I did sign up


---------19:25----------
you know I've watched a bunch of your


---------19:27----------
shows because I co stream with Devin


---------19:31----------
like you did in the past


---------19:34----------
so I'm perfectly happy to talk about


---------19:37----------
myself and reveal personal get out my


---------19:40----------
own struggles since I'm an executive I'm


---------19:44----------
not sure that's always the most helpful


---------19:47----------
to our audiences who aren't always there


---------19:49----------
I don't know but I'm happy to do that


---------19:52----------
so I'll let you be the judge of what's


---------19:53----------
most effective to help people because I


---------19:55----------
know that's your goal as well as mine


---------19:57----------
you can also just talk a little bit if


---------20:00----------
you want I don't have any problem having


---------20:03----------
a bit of a lecture so okay sure


---------20:05----------
so I'm gonna explain one concept which I


---------20:08----------
suspect may lay the foundation for our


---------20:11----------
discussion may or may not and as it


---------20:13----------
crops up and then I'll start asking you


---------20:15----------
more personal perfect let's do questions


---------20:17----------
so I'm gonna just lay a little bit of a


---------20:19----------
foundation for with like a five minute


---------20:21----------
segment so what a clear mind does the


---------20:27----------
best work right yes totally one of the


---------20:31----------
biggest problems that


---------20:33----------
clouds of mind is attachment to


---------20:35----------
particular things and so one of the


---------20:38----------
goals of meditative practice is to be


---------20:40----------
detached from the outcomes of your


---------20:42----------
actions so this is a Sanskrit word


---------20:45----------
called Vairagya and they see they


---------20:46----------
believe that like peace comes from


---------20:48----------
Vairagya so just to give you an example


---------20:50----------
you know if I like a girl and I want to


---------20:53----------
ask her out


---------20:54----------
I can torture myself all kinds of ways


---------20:57----------
about whether she's gonna say yes how to


---------20:58----------
get her to say yes things like that


---------21:00----------
well some of that could be calculated


---------21:02----------
like I could do certain nice things I


---------21:03----------
can dress a certain way I can get her


---------21:05----------
flowers whatever so there is some value


---------21:07----------
to sort of that that kind of


---------21:09----------
self-flagellation that I put myself


---------21:10----------
through but at the end of the day the


---------21:13----------
best course of action is probably just


---------21:15----------
to ask her out with confidence and then


---------21:18----------
let her decide right I don't try to


---------21:20----------
control whether she says yes or whether


---------21:23----------
she says no but that's not how we


---------21:25----------
actually operate we try to control


---------21:27----------
whether she is going to say yes or say


---------21:30----------
no and in the process of controlling how


---------21:33----------
another human being reacts we torture


---------21:36----------
ourselves so much up with me yeah it's


---------21:40----------
the it's the rain the rain acronym from


---------21:43----------
meditation right rain is uh recognize


---------21:47----------
acknowledge introspect and then


---------21:50----------
non-attachment


---------21:51----------
yeah perfect right so fight argue is


---------21:53----------
that last part yeah where are you


---------21:55----------
ultimately you kind of say and the funny


---------21:57----------
thing is that if you think about like


---------21:58----------
what kind of person is gonna say yes


---------22:00----------
like I realized this in my own life


---------22:02----------
shockingly so you know I had a very


---------22:04----------
unsuccessful dating life until I sort of


---------22:08----------
and entered into a relationship and then


---------22:10----------
really stopped caring because I was in a


---------22:12----------
relationship right and then started


---------22:14----------
hanging out with people and then


---------22:15----------
suddenly like women are treating me very


---------22:18----------
differently and I was trying to think


---------22:21----------
about like why is that the most extreme


---------22:24----------
of which was I don't even know if I


---------22:27----------
should share this because I don't have


---------22:29----------
this person but so one day I was on call


---------22:31----------
at the hospital right and someone that I


---------22:34----------
had worked with showed up intoxicated at


---------22:38----------
2:00 in the morning okay and was playing


---------22:40----------
Pokemon go and I was like woman what are


---------22:44----------
you doing here I


---------22:46----------
and she was just and so then I was like


---------22:49----------
look I'm busy but it's great to see you


---------22:51----------
have fun catching your Pokemon and you


---------22:53----------
know as much as I don't I mean I have to


---------22:55----------
think that people don't just show up at


---------22:58----------
the hospital when you're working like


---------22:59----------
they know you're on call right oh it's


---------23:02----------
the middle of the night and so I have to


---------23:03----------
think about like how does that happen


---------23:05----------
right did I suddenly magically become


---------23:07----------
more attractive I don't think so


---------23:09----------
I think what happened is like I stopped


---------23:10----------
I you know I started just behaving with


---------23:12----------
confidence and that actually like gets


---------23:15----------
the outcome that you sort of want but


---------23:17----------
the more that you worry about the


---------23:18----------
outcome the harder the outcome is to


---------23:20----------
attain totally yeah yeah that


---------23:23----------
overanalyzing an analysis paralysis


---------23:27----------
those things [ __ ] people it happens a


---------23:30----------
lot in public speaking absolutely right


---------23:33----------
so so when when public speaking is


---------23:35----------
another great example of like the goal


---------23:37----------
is to just go up there and talk about


---------23:38----------
what you want to talk about don't worry


---------23:39----------
about the thousands of people so one bit


---------23:41----------
of advice that I got about public


---------23:43----------
speaking is pretend you're talking to


---------23:44----------
one person don't talk to an audience


---------23:46----------
talk to one person works really well so


---------23:49----------
the the challenge though is a lot of


---------23:50----------
people say if I become detached from the


---------23:53----------
consequences of my actions doesn't that


---------23:55----------
mean that I stopped caring and this is a


---------23:59----------
big challenge where people say like but


---------24:01----------
caring about the outcome is what has


---------24:04----------
driven me to succeed so far so like if I


---------24:06----------
stopped caring about the outcome doesn't


---------24:08----------
it mean that I'm not gonna be successful


---------24:10----------
and the short answer is no because


---------24:12----------
there's a difference between apathy


---------24:14----------
which is not caring and attachment which


---------24:17----------
is detachment is giving it your all and


---------24:19----------
not worrying about the consequence not


---------24:21----------
being paranoid about the consequence


---------24:23----------
such reality to do absolutely it's a


---------24:27----------
hard duality absolutely so I suspect


---------24:30----------
that when we come to you know this is


---------24:34----------
just because I've done a lot of kind of


---------24:35----------
corporate consulting and stuff and


---------24:37----------
generally this conundrum comes up where


---------24:39----------
people recognize that fear of


---------24:42----------
consequence and a particular consequence


---------24:45----------
is what has allowed them to get to this


---------24:47----------
point but that like they can still


---------24:49----------
perform but it causes them intense


---------24:51----------
personal suffering and it's my


---------24:54----------
hypothesis that intense personal


---------24:56----------
suffering doesn't actually lead to


---------24:57----------
optimal performance and


---------24:59----------
when I talked to more and more people


---------25:00----------
like you and I asked you when do you do


---------25:02----------
your best work it's not when you're


---------25:04----------
suffering it's when you're devoted to


---------25:06----------
the action at hand and you're calm and


---------25:08----------
you're thinking clearly


---------25:09----------
well it's flow State it's magic set me


---------25:11----------
high and and flow state for sure so


---------25:15----------
let's talk a little bit about your


---------25:16----------
personal any questions about that so far


---------25:18----------
not for me no I got it okay so let's


---------25:21----------
talk a little bit about your personal


---------25:22----------
situation and kind of what you find


---------25:24----------
stressful within the bounds of what you


---------25:25----------
can yeah of course


---------25:27----------
the the thing that stresses me out the


---------25:30----------
most I guess is you every human well I


---------25:35----------
don't know I will talk about me I want


---------25:36----------
credit for good intentions now what that


---------25:39----------
means is when I bust my ass on something


---------25:41----------
and I attempt to do my best work and it


---------25:43----------
falls short I already know that and so I


---------25:47----------
want help fixing it not repeated


---------25:52----------
pointing out that it didn't meet the bar


---------25:55----------
until my highest stress specifically


---------25:59----------
comes from feeling misjudged so here's


---------26:06----------
an example I can talk about that's


---------26:08----------
outside of work but very crystalline I


---------26:12----------
had a doctor's appointment and the


---------26:16----------
doctor had two offices small medical


---------26:18----------
procedure doesn't matter what I was


---------26:19----------
getting I was getting something removed


---------26:21----------
off my skin but I went to the wrong


---------26:24----------
office because they had two offices and


---------26:28----------
I confused the office so I was there on


---------26:29----------
time but at the wrong office and so as


---------26:33----------
an example you can excavate that has


---------26:34----------
nothing to do with the Amazon but shows


---------26:36----------
the problem is I just beat myself up


---------26:39----------
like oh my god this has to be


---------26:41----------
rescheduled and he's a specialist and


---------26:43----------
it's gonna take three months to get back


---------26:44----------
on his calendar and how could I be so


---------26:47----------
Dominus to go to the wrong office and I


---------26:50----------
just got into a very because I'm a


---------26:52----------
high-performance person I was down on


---------26:54----------
myself for having


---------26:57----------
done something so foolish or small as to


---------27:00----------
pick the wrong doctor's office and the


---------27:04----------
same thing happens at work where you


---------27:07----------
have total right intentions you do


---------27:09----------
everything you set up the appointment or


---------27:11----------
you do the work you deliver the work and


---------27:14----------
then it falls slightly short or there's


---------27:17----------
a good intention but small mistake and


---------27:23----------
basically in our workplace added to my


---------27:26----------
own maybe recriminations on myself would


---------27:29----------
be workplace negative feedback of likes


---------27:34----------
little you know you've made an error and


---------27:36----------
we need to make sure that you know


---------27:37----------
you've made an error because we're busy


---------27:39----------
setting the standard the performance


---------27:41----------
culture okay I see a little bit of a


---------27:45----------
fork in the road in terms of we're


---------27:47----------
talking more about you because I think a


---------27:49----------
lot of this so I think that so I mean do


---------27:55----------
you want to talk about the workplace and


---------27:56----------
stress or do you want to talk about you


---------27:57----------
like I kind of I want to talk about I


---------27:59----------
thought that would be a good I think


---------28:01----------
it's a great yeah it's great


---------28:04----------
well I thought it would be good about


---------28:05----------
how to manage stress and I think because


---------28:09----------
I think most of the stress comes from


---------28:11----------
inside ourselves ABS right it's it's yes


---------28:14----------
other people may add to it or attempt to


---------28:18----------
add to it but how we process that


---------28:21----------
determines how much it impacts us


---------28:24----------
beautiful right so that's the that's the


---------28:26----------
fork in the road that I see is I think a


---------28:28----------
lot of this comes from you it has


---------28:29----------
nothing to do with Amazon's work culture


---------28:31----------
like all those work culture probably


---------28:34----------
like is synergistic with it but this


---------28:39----------
comes from you okay let's talk about


---------28:41----------
that I wanted something so and how long


---------28:44----------
how long have you been beating yourself


---------28:45----------
up for making silly mistakes


---------28:47----------
oh geez my whole life okay yeah I know


---------28:51----------
my family particularly my father did


---------28:54----------
that so going all the way back to like


---------28:56----------
childhood experience my father was very


---------28:59----------
down on himself for simple mistakes


---------29:04----------
[Music]


---------29:05----------
he believed that there was no such thing


---------29:07----------
as an accident


---------29:08----------
that that there was only carelessness


---------29:12----------
and so I grew up in a culture and the


---------29:15----------
classic example we talk about my family


---------29:17----------
of this is his coffee cup our family


---------29:22----------
coffee cups had saucers and if he


---------29:24----------
spilled coffee bumped his cup so that


---------29:26----------
coffee went over the edge end of the


---------29:28----------
saucer he would say oh what an idiot


---------29:31----------
what a complete fool and that was his


---------29:34----------
judgment of himself for having spilled


---------29:36----------
coffee which you're like oh my god you'd


---------29:38----------
you know wipe it up throw it out like


---------29:40----------
who cares but I grew up in a family


---------29:44----------
culture where there wasn't any such


---------29:47----------
thing as a mistake there was only


---------29:48----------
carelessness so that's kind of


---------29:52----------
interesting because you're talking about


---------29:54----------
your dad modeling yes self-critical


---------29:58----------
nests and sort of a lack of compassion


---------30:00----------
or forgiveness or a lack of acceptance


---------30:02----------
that everything isn't perfect correct


---------30:05----------
and that you know life sometimes has a


---------30:08----------
certain amount of randomness to it but


---------30:10----------
in his mind there's no such thing as


---------30:12----------
randomness there was just a lack of


---------30:13----------
preparation to account for randomness


---------30:16----------
right right right so that's him what


---------30:20----------
about you


---------30:21----------
uh I definitely internalize that but


---------30:26----------
don't you say that about stuff that you


---------30:28----------
did oh yeah for sure


---------30:29----------
like what


---------30:34----------
so I grew up on a farm and we used to


---------30:38----------
have a lot of power tools and sharp


---------30:41----------
things and his advice to me all through


---------30:43----------
my life was it's not if it's when


---------30:46----------
meaning it's not if you cut yourself


---------30:48----------
it's win and so eventually when I was 17


---------30:53----------
I cut I was I was out cutting brush and


---------30:58----------
I cut the end off my thumb like just a


---------31:00----------
little chunk but I didn't know how much


---------31:03----------
I'd cut off so I ran into the house like


---------31:05----------
holding my thumb inside my hand and I


---------31:07----------
said dad I need you to take me to the


---------31:09----------
hospital I cut off part of my thumb and


---------31:12----------
he started a lecture like he started to


---------31:16----------
say I've told you and I told you this


---------31:19----------
was come


---------31:19----------
and how could you be so stupid now I was


---------31:23----------
I was older at that point I was 16 so I


---------31:26----------
was mature enough to say dad you can


---------31:29----------
yell at me later we need to go and he


---------31:33----------
was able to cut it off at that point


---------31:35----------
until it you know he had enough


---------31:37----------
rationality like okay that's a good


---------31:39----------
point


---------31:40----------
but his initial instinct was lecture me


---------31:43----------
on carelessness can so I think that


---------31:47----------
carries forward how does it feel to tell


---------31:49----------
that story well knowing uh you know I


---------31:53----------
have my audience on your audience I how


---------31:57----------
does it feel it feels embarrassing right


---------32:01----------
that that was the environment because


---------32:03----------
we're trained not to share I we I don't


---------32:07----------
know I am trained not to share internal


---------32:09----------
family skeletons and so to talk poorly


---------32:12----------
of your father or an experience you had


---------32:15----------
it's embarrassing it's humiliating who's


---------32:18----------
being humiliated I don't know I feel


---------32:22----------
humiliated like I feel that whether I


---------32:24----------
should or not I feel like oh I'm part of


---------32:27----------
a family that had flaws that was not


---------32:30----------
that had this weird behavior and so


---------32:34----------
that's embarrassing yeah so I think that


---------32:37----------
feeling makes a lot of sense how did you


---------32:40----------
feel when your dad started lecturing you


---------32:43----------
at that moment I felt shocked I felt


---------32:47----------
like wow this is inappropriate and


---------32:49----------
that's in fact why I was able to


---------32:51----------
interrupt it uh-huh because what's led


---------32:55----------
to a lot of my career success is I'm


---------32:57----------
very processed and outcome oriented and


---------33:00----------
so I was able to prioritize and say so


---------33:03----------
yeah sometimes I interrupt people when


---------33:06----------
they're talking right go ahead


---------33:08----------
okay please so when when someone is


---------33:11----------
lecturing you for a mistake that you


---------33:13----------
know you made how do you feel


---------33:20----------
lecture for them is I feel bad I feel


---------33:22----------
doubly bad because I already know okay


---------33:25----------
so what is bad so bad as an umbrella


---------33:27----------
motion what is the emotion underneath


---------33:30----------
the bat


---------33:30----------
what a feeling the feeling I'm feeling


---------33:34----------
is inadequate that if I had done better


---------33:39----------
not only would the results have been


---------33:41----------
better but now I would not be getting


---------33:43----------
told that the result was not good I


---------33:45----------
wouldn't be getting lectured okay so I


---------33:48----------
think there's in adequacy which is what


---------33:50----------
you put on yourself right I think


---------33:52----------
there's another shade of an emotion


---------33:54----------
there which has to do with the


---------33:55----------
interaction of reporting okay right so


---------34:00----------
in once again I'm fishing right but


---------34:04----------
there's a second feeling right one is


---------34:06----------
you know you [ __ ] up that's the


---------34:07----------
inadequacies at the carelessness that's


---------34:09----------
what you guys do you want to know what


---------34:10----------
the other feeling is there's some


---------34:12----------
another feeling feeling when you walk


---------34:13----------
into the room and you have to report to


---------34:15----------
your superiors that the program that


---------34:16----------
you're running isn't up to par you felt


---------34:20----------
inadequate the night before yes you


---------34:22----------
realized it wasn't there there's another


---------34:24----------
feeling when you go in there's a fear of


---------34:29----------
being judged so there's fearfulness


---------34:31----------
and/or shame because you're about to


---------34:33----------
expose your feeling of inadequacy to


---------34:36----------
someone else


---------34:37----------
uh-huh and so remind me again what were


---------34:39----------
you feeling as you told that story


---------34:42----------
humiliation and what were you afraid of


---------34:45----------
exposing that exposing exposing the


---------34:47----------
family weakness yeah yeah do you think


---------34:50----------
those are related


---------34:51----------
of course particularly when you draw


---------34:53----------
them out that way


---------34:54----------
yeah well because I and I think a lot of


---------35:00----------
people that I project I try to project


---------35:03----------
competence


---------35:04----------
I try to be competent and I wish to be


---------35:06----------
viewed as competent and so when I have


---------35:09----------
to admit to an error I do it but it puts


---------35:15----------
a hole in my shell or image of


---------35:17----------
competence at least to myself even if


---------35:20----------
not to others


---------35:21----------
absolutely okay so


---------35:23----------
so I know I mean I'm sorry cuz I go for


---------35:26----------
it tricks to what I do but I think that


---------35:28----------
when you were telling that story you


---------35:29----------
were not just experiencing emotions from


---------35:31----------
the present I think you were


---------35:34----------
experiencing the emotions of that moment


---------35:36----------
because that's what happens when we


---------35:37----------
remember things right you replay yep


---------35:39----------
right so I think there's a certain


---------35:41----------
amount of humiliation that you feel


---------35:43----------
because you're airing your dirty laundry


---------35:44----------
on stream right there's a certain amount


---------35:46----------
of recalled humiliation because that's


---------35:49----------
how it feels when someone tell like just


---------35:51----------
think about this for a second when I cut


---------35:55----------
off a piece of my thumb right and I go


---------35:58----------
to someone and they say hey dumbass you


---------36:00----------
cut off a piece of your thumb right like


---------36:04----------
humiliation is at the top of the list


---------36:06----------
for how you feel it's like yeah I know


---------36:09----------
all right and you're telling me that


---------36:13----------
like your biggest problem is that like


---------36:15----------
you don't get credit for trying your


---------36:17----------
biggest problem is that like you know


---------36:20----------
you know you messed up you know it's not


---------36:22----------
good enough you don't actually have a


---------36:24----------
beef with that because you know given


---------36:26----------
time and support you will fix it because


---------36:28----------
that is what you [ __ ] do yes you will


---------36:30----------
fix it yourself yeah it's just why can't


---------36:34----------
other people see that correct you nailed


---------36:37----------
it so then the question becomes where


---------36:41----------
does that come from right so the only


---------36:44----------
person who is concerned about their


---------36:47----------
image the maintenance of their image is


---------36:49----------
the person who doesn't actually have


---------36:51----------
confidence in themselves okay


---------36:54----------
and the weird thing is that you do have


---------36:56----------
confidence in yourself except for the


---------36:58----------
times that you don't of course yes does


---------37:01----------
that make sense yes like because I know


---------37:02----------
I can tell already that like I know that


---------37:05----------
you get the job done like I know that


---------37:06----------
you will double down and you will make


---------37:08----------
sure that given time like you just have


---------37:10----------
to account for certain variables market


---------37:12----------
forces changes in X Y Z you will get it


---------37:15----------
done right and so I know that you're


---------37:17----------
confident in yourself but something


---------37:18----------
happens something awakens within you


---------37:21----------
that makes you feel the same way that


---------37:23----------
you did when you cut off your thumb and


---------37:25----------
your dad is lecturing yes and even in


---------37:27----------
that moment there's that feeling of


---------37:29----------
humiliation and then there's the there's


---------37:31----------
like the functional executive at Amazon


---------37:34----------
Ethan that was


---------37:36----------
already alive at the age of 16 and says


---------37:38----------
hey dad you can lecture me later right


---------37:41----------
now this [ __ ] needs to get taken care of


---------37:42----------
yep and even now when you feel that


---------37:45----------
humiliation when you walk into that


---------37:47----------
boardroom there's a part of you that's


---------37:48----------
like your 16 year old self which says


---------37:50----------
this just needs to get addressed and


---------37:52----------
it'll be okay if you guys just cut me


---------37:53----------
some slack and then there's the part of


---------37:56----------
you that feels humiliated right that's


---------37:58----------
right let's jive yeah I've definitely


---------38:04----------
had that experience at work also they're


---------38:06----------
like oh yeah yeah yeah what is that that


---------38:12----------
you said so much there but I don't I


---------38:13----------
didn't understand it I don't know people


---------38:15----------
understood


---------38:16----------
what is that that's it what is that well


---------38:19----------
it's for me that uh was I do it to


---------38:23----------
myself and at some level I'm choosing


---------38:28----------
the feel the way I feel I'm choosing I


---------38:31----------
know I can get the job done but the


---------38:35----------
process of having other people give me


---------38:37----------
feedback or be skeptical of that fact


---------38:42----------
for a minute


---------38:43----------
hurts yeah absolutely so let's dig into


---------38:49----------
that right because you said something


---------38:51----------
about I forget exactly your exact


---------38:53----------
phrasing but you were saying something


---------38:54----------
along the lines of that you know when


---------38:59----------
what you know you're gonna get it done


---------39:01----------
but they don't see that so you have to


---------39:04----------
try extra hard to like feel like but use


---------39:07----------
the word shell I think yeah right


---------39:10----------
he's right can you share that can you


---------39:12----------
just say a little bit more about that I


---------39:13----------
think that's important so because of our


---------39:17----------
performance culture and because of the


---------39:19----------
patterns you've observed you know and


---------39:21----------
can predict that when a mistake has been


---------39:24----------
made or something isn't going as planned


---------39:26----------
or isn't achieving goals that that


---------39:29----------
feedback about that is coming and so


---------39:32----------
there is absolutely a psychological


---------39:35----------
process of armoring yourself putting up


---------39:39----------
your shell whatever you want to call it


---------39:41----------
and say okay I know we have a we have a


---------39:43----------
leadership principle again or it's


---------39:46----------
talked about a lot in Amazon it's been


---------39:48----------
written down before called vocally


---------39:49----------
self-critical where we expect leaders in


---------39:54----------
the company to acknowledge their


---------39:59----------
mistakes and and we call it vocally


---------40:01----------
self-critical where we expect them to


---------40:03----------
actually talk about I and my team's


---------40:06----------
performance was not good enough itemize


---------40:09----------
how because the concept is make sure


---------40:13----------
that we don't call things good when


---------40:16----------
they're not or that we don't have


---------40:18----------
defensiveness about performance in other


---------40:24----------
words the goal is whether it works or


---------40:26----------
not the mental goal is that we want


---------40:33----------
leaders that can introspect and accept


---------40:36----------
the fact that it may not have worked or


---------40:38----------
may not be meeting goals and can then


---------40:40----------
take steps to address it but vocally


---------40:45----------
self-critical has unfortunately built


---------40:48----------
into it a bit of a public abasement


---------40:51----------
element right like it and I don't know I


---------40:57----------
don't know how to disentangle those two


---------40:59----------
yeah so I think that you know once again


---------41:01----------
that's kind of a cultural thing where I


---------41:03----------
think that you know being self-critical


---------41:05----------
in and having like external audits and


---------41:08----------
things like that or a healthy part of


---------41:11----------
becoming better at your job


---------41:13----------
so in psychiatry for example we have


---------41:15----------
something called supervision so in


---------41:17----------
supervision what happens you can have


---------41:18----------
peer supervision so a group of


---------41:19----------
psychiatrists will get together right


---------41:22----------
and like one of them will present a case


---------41:23----------
they'll say like okay I'm I'm working


---------41:25----------
with this case she has anxiety this this


---------41:26----------
this I've tried this I've tried this I


---------41:28----------
don't know what's going on it doesn't


---------41:29----------
seem to be working so we also vocally


---------41:33----------
share our shortcomings in terms of work


---------41:35----------
performance yep and and we also are


---------41:38----------
inviting people to actually audit so


---------41:41----------
usually if you do a really formal


---------41:43----------
supervision like you'll write up between


---------41:45----------
three and five pages about a case from


---------41:47----------
start to finish and you'll hand it to


---------41:50----------
someone and say like okay I started this


---------41:51----------
medication at this time I did this at


---------41:53----------
this time I did this at this time right


---------41:56----------
oh I I guess I'm sorry my I'm speaking


---------42:00----------
too loudly it's okay you're excited I do


---------42:03----------
the same thing so and and so what


---------42:06----------
happens is there's also like an audit


---------42:09----------
process yeah there's also a self


---------42:12----------
critical aspect to it but I think that


---------42:16----------
something has happened in in y'all's


---------42:18----------
culture where it does become shaming in


---------42:20----------
some way yes and that's that's both what


---------42:24----------
I experienced myself personally and at


---------42:26----------
work yeah and I think it's true of parts


---------42:30----------
of the culture and so I'm looking for


---------42:31----------
how to address that for myself and


---------42:34----------
ideally at least for my section of the


---------42:37----------
culture so let's just take a step back


---------42:39----------
away from culture because I think that's


---------42:41----------
a number of conversation let's focus on


---------42:43----------
you for me yep when did you start


---------42:45----------
putting your armor on I definitely put


---------42:53----------
on armor very early in my childhood I'm


---------42:56----------
the youngest child my house was


---------42:58----------
combative verbal no didn't have physical


---------43:02----------
abuse but verbal arguments amongst


---------43:06----------
siblings and parents was common and so


---------43:13----------
[Music]


---------43:15----------
so I developed a very thick armor the


---------43:19----------
result of which is as an example I can


---------43:23----------
generally do things many people can't if


---------43:26----------
you and I were to meet and you were to


---------43:28----------
yell at me like literally yell at me or


---------43:30----------
get red in the face or shout or or I


---------43:33----------
could


---------43:35----------
mostly turn that off and expert later


---------43:40----------
but I could experience it and not run


---------43:43----------
from the room or be broken down or


---------43:45----------
because I'm used to that environment


---------43:46----------
yeah I mean it almost sounds like a


---------43:48----------
dissociative capacity yes I don't know


---------43:51----------
all the right words but that is correct


---------43:53----------
I can I can just sort of leave the room


---------43:55----------
mentally and be like okay this is going


---------43:57----------
on how does it feel to say that well


---------44:00----------
I've talked about it with it's not new


---------44:03----------
to me to discuss it because I I've


---------44:04----------
discussed it with other professionals


---------44:07----------
but it's weird I will admit I have a


---------44:11----------
certain I value it and also don't want


---------44:17----------
it because I know it's built up from


---------44:20----------
adverse experiences but I also know its


---------44:23----------
utility in a crisis mm-hmm very good


---------44:26----------
right so there's a certain amount of


---------44:27----------
almost pride and comfort in it yes I got


---------44:32----------
what I thought was just a hint of


---------44:33----------
sadness sure yes there's a it's cut me


---------44:38----------
off from people in other words I've been


---------44:40----------
described as cold and certain I spent my


---------44:42----------
whole life at some level adapting


---------44:47----------
because when I left my household and


---------44:49----------
went to college I having grown up on a


---------44:52----------
farm you could even say I was poorly


---------44:55----------
socialized or a relatively few social


---------44:58----------
interactions compared to others I didn't


---------45:02----------
understand that the whole world didn't


---------45:03----------
interact that way hmm so like I would


---------45:06----------
resolve conflict by shouting or you know


---------45:08----------
by getting animated and I had to quick


---------45:10----------
and I'm a big guy you can't necessarily


---------45:12----------
tell but I'm six-two


---------45:13----------
I also used to be heavier and so I was I


---------45:19----------
was obese basically so I was I was about


---------45:22----------
280 pounds and I was kind of a huge guy


---------45:24----------
and so when that huge young man got


---------45:27----------
fired up other people were like what the


---------45:29----------
hell is this and so I had to learn to


---------45:33----------
dial back like oh the rest of the world


---------45:35----------
doesn't actually interact by shouting at


---------45:36----------
abuse newsflash


---------45:38----------
that's impressive that you were able to


---------45:42----------
because a lot of people aren't able to


---------45:44----------
rewire like that lifetime journey


---------45:48----------
right you know I'm 50 now and you know


---------45:51----------
that's a 20 year old me that had to


---------45:53----------
learn those lessons Ethan can you tell


---------45:55----------
me about your mom sure my mother so I'm


---------45:59----------
the youngest and so both my parents have


---------46:02----------
passed away essentially of old age at


---------46:04----------
this point my mom died last summer she


---------46:08----------
was very critical and specifically at


---------46:16----------
some point I don't know my late 30s or


---------46:18----------
40s I said mom you never actually say


---------46:20----------
you love me or you love your kids and


---------46:21----------
she said yeah I can't my mom never did


---------46:23----------
it for me I can't say I physically


---------46:25----------
cannot say I love you so that was an


---------46:28----------
interesting and for my mom nothing was


---------46:32----------
ever good enough


---------46:33----------
she was the matron of the family the


---------46:37----------
stronger personality and yeah so she


---------46:44----------
drove she drove people very hard I think


---------46:52----------
the best ensured it well I probably


---------46:54----------
given you everything you need to know by


---------46:56----------
saying she felt she couldn't say you


---------46:57----------
love she loved you but I do you think


---------47:01----------
what do you think I need well I mean


---------47:03----------
just enough information about my mom a


---------47:05----------
president only about your mom uh it


---------47:10----------
tells me she had her own issues right


---------47:14----------
that they she expressed that her mom had


---------47:17----------
never expressed love for her


---------47:19----------
very unusual for that generation my my


---------47:26----------
grandfather actually divorced my


---------47:28----------
grandmother which in the 1920s and 30s


---------47:30----------
was unusual and so in reconstructing it


---------47:35----------
my mom doesn't did not have a positive


---------47:40----------
relationship with any male in her life


---------47:43----------
Ethan what is what does all this say


---------47:46----------
about her son


---------47:47----------
what can I understand about her son from


---------47:51----------
understanding who she is


---------47:52----------
uh that's a question I haven't thought


---------47:56----------
about yeah you thought


---------48:00----------
a lot about this haven't you oh yeah


---------48:02----------
sure


---------48:03----------
well I'm so I should share I guess I'm


---------48:07----------
an insight junkie like in other words


---------48:09----------
what I specifically mean by that is I


---------48:12----------
was excited to talk to you not only


---------48:13----------
because I think it's good twitch and


---------48:14----------
good for my community good for yours


---------48:16----------
but because I'm always interested to


---------48:18----------
learn more about myself


---------48:19----------
yeah and so like my whole team yesterday


---------48:22----------
is a different I'll come back to your


---------48:24----------
point took the disc test together


---------48:27----------
yesterday my whole leadership team about


---------48:28----------
30 of us in a room going through


---------48:30----------
personality profiles because I'm always


---------48:33----------
looking for more insight so I said it's


---------48:37----------
been a lifetime journey to modify my


---------48:40----------
behavior that is true and so what you're


---------48:44----------
seeing is yes 30 years of working to


---------48:47----------
understand why do I behave like I do


---------48:50----------
what part is valuable and innate and I


---------48:54----------
should keep an enhance and what part


---------48:55----------
should I control or filter the


---------48:58----------
relentless pursuit of positivity and


---------49:01----------
growth yes and the relentless part is


---------49:04----------
fairly strong they're like I'm over


---------49:06----------
index on it


---------49:07----------
mmm-hmm yeah so well so the that you


---------49:12----------
know the the the unfortunate thing about


---------49:15----------
the relentlessness is that it's fueled


---------49:17----------
by a sense of inadequacy I agree with


---------49:20----------
that yes I'm aware of that so that's a


---------49:23----------
problem right so then then like so now


---------49:25----------
we get to Vairagya and apathy because


---------49:28----------
the question is if we take away your


---------49:29----------
sense of inadequacy what happens ah so


---------49:35----------
I'd like to think I've matured to where


---------49:37----------
I'll continue to work on be if I could


---------49:42----------
take away your inadequacy with a snap of


---------49:44----------
a finger would you want me to in this


---------49:46----------
moment yeah totally I am because I


---------49:51----------
believe I I still do a lot of the things


---------49:55----------
I do I have inadequacy


---------50:01----------
is not my only motivation so I don't


---------50:04----------
fear collapse into inaction but because


---------50:07----------
my only motivation is covering my


---------50:09----------
inadequacy the inadequacy is deep and


---------50:11----------
real yeah but I've matured no I know


---------50:14----------
that but it's it's I've matured enough


---------50:16----------
to where I want to be I want to


---------50:18----------
contribute positively to the world


---------50:20----------
because I have skills and value I can


---------50:22----------
offer and not because I must in order to


---------50:26----------
validate myself good so that's the


---------50:29----------
Dharma for anyone who's curious you guys


---------50:30----------
just heard it okay um and but let's kind


---------50:34----------
of go back to so so we kind of so you


---------50:36----------
have a tendency to kind of abstract and


---------50:38----------
explain things to me yes like I analyze


---------50:40----------
yeah very much so


---------50:42----------
right and and I think the challenge here


---------50:44----------
is gonna be that you have you don't


---------50:47----------
actually give me data you give me


---------50:49----------
conclusions okay so that that's sort of


---------50:53----------
a double-edged sword because when I ask


---------50:55----------
you a little bit about where does this


---------50:56----------
come from you already have the perfect


---------50:58----------
story you're like oh it's this story and


---------51:00----------
you also youselves a very interesting


---------51:01----------
thing when you related the story about


---------51:02----------
the coffee cup this is the story that my


---------51:05----------
family talks about yeah okay right so it


---------51:09----------
sounds like this has been well discussed


---------51:11----------
mauled over chewed yeah so the challenge


---------51:14----------
here is gonna be that we have to get to


---------51:16----------
the questions that you haven't asked


---------51:17----------
yourself yet okay that go function once


---------51:20----------
again is this one which is what does


---------51:22----------
that say about her son so you were


---------51:24----------
talking about your mom as someone who's


---------51:26----------
incapable of saying I love you who has


---------51:28----------
never had so so many like analytics


---------51:30----------
about me I feel unloved right I was


---------51:34----------
always seeking it's the same thing at


---------51:37----------
work I'm seeking positive feedback and I


---------51:40----------
have an endless desire an unmet desire


---------51:43----------
for it like I'm a I'm a black hole of


---------51:46----------
wanting more positive feedback that's


---------51:49----------
how it says yes you're so good at


---------51:51----------
sterilizing how you feel you're a black


---------51:53----------
hole for wanting positive feedback like


---------51:56----------
I didn't know black like what are you a


---------51:57----------
black hole for even feeling loved III


---------52:00----------
want oh yeah I'm glad you can say it you


---------52:04----------
see how your mind did that yeah I'm not


---------52:09----------
exactly sure what you're driving at


---------52:11----------
about sterilizing but I get the point


---------52:12----------
that I I step away from


---------52:15----------
the person using the words of deep


---------52:16----------
personal emotions yes


---------52:18----------
right which is back to your dissociative


---------52:20----------
capability okay right so like you step


---------52:24----------
away and that's also the how you feeling


---------52:26----------
you feeling okay


---------52:29----------
yeah I'm fine okay yeah I know I mean I


---------52:31----------
feel a little bit of anxiety but nothing


---------52:35----------
that's distressing me has that changed


---------52:37----------
recently in this talk yeah


---------52:41----------
is that anxiety you felt at the


---------52:43----------
beginning or is it changing there's a


---------52:45----------
little there's a little bit of anxiety


---------52:48----------
about addressing feeling deep personal


---------52:52----------
emotions and talking about them yeah


---------52:54----------
because it's vulnerability its


---------52:57----------
vulnerability to talk to you and to


---------53:00----------
anyone about deeply personal not to


---------53:03----------
anyone I but is it that also I think is


---------53:06----------
a great intellectual analysis of


---------53:09----------
yourself so close your eyes for a second


---------53:11----------
okay tell me what you feel what is that


---------53:14----------
anxiety what is Vault because it's not


---------53:15----------
anxiety its vulnerability okay right


---------53:18----------
that's what you feel okay and tell you


---------53:22----------
what about it what does it feel like


---------53:23----------
physically it's in the pit of my stomach


---------53:28----------
there's a tightness there's a there's a


---------53:33----------
there's a tightness in my stomach about


---------53:36----------
that comes from feeling exposed alright


---------53:40----------
eyes closed yeah and feeling exposed


---------53:43----------
good yeah right so you don't want to


---------53:45----------
feel exposed there's a part of you so


---------53:47----------
that tightness in your stomach is kind


---------53:48----------
of fear yeah it's fear how long how


---------53:52----------
familiar is that sensation in your


---------53:57----------
stomach before yes do you remember the


---------54:01----------
first time that or an early time that


---------54:03----------
you felt it I certainly remember the


---------54:07----------
first time I can consciously remember


---------54:10----------
feeling afraid


---------54:13----------
I don't know if I felt a pit in my


---------54:16----------
stomach does those were fear of physical


---------54:19----------
things okay so do you remember feeling


---------54:23----------
this sensation in particular before yeah


---------54:26----------
I think even early as time would be when


---------54:29----------
I was five okay we're talking about this


---------54:32----------
sensation right yeah tell me about when


---------54:36----------
you were five what happened um when I


---------54:40----------
was five it's a dramatic memory I've


---------54:42----------
kept all this time I first got an


---------54:46----------
understanding of the concept of death


---------54:48----------
and I became afraid of what it meant for


---------54:55----------
the world to go on without me I had this


---------54:57----------
I had this sense of like oh one day I


---------55:00----------
will end and the world will continue and


---------55:02----------
that was a fearful of realization for me


---------55:06----------
so that's the first thing I can think of


---------55:08----------
where I'm like Oh what did you do with


---------55:11----------
that feeling


---------55:14----------
talk to someone about it I went and


---------55:16----------
talked to my dad about it and What did


---------55:18----------
he say


---------55:19----------
so I asked my dad what happens when we


---------55:23----------
die and he gave me a scientific answer


---------55:27----------
he said oh well first your heart stops


---------55:29----------
then your brain stops and I interrupted


---------55:32----------
him I said no no dad what happens to me


---------55:35----------
and he said well some people believe


---------55:39----------
there's a heaven


---------55:40----------
I believe you're just gone


---------55:44----------
gruffly do you remember how you felt


---------55:48----------
when he said that uh I don't remember


---------55:53----------
clearly I remember you time after like I


---------55:57----------
can't tell you what I felt at that


---------55:58----------
instant sure of course what I what I


---------56:01----------
felt in gears that followed was wow


---------56:05----------
that's horrible that's not a feeling


---------56:10----------
that's a thought that's okay I continue


---------56:12----------
to feel afraid right I'm I I continue to


---------56:19----------
feel afraid of non-existence of losing


---------56:25----------
that sense of myself and that drove yeah


---------56:30----------
well that's going into what happened


---------56:31----------
after but I felt worried about that


---------56:33----------
concern and in fact that was an origin


---------56:38----------
of my disassociative ability because


---------56:41----------
that thought was scary enough for me


---------56:43----------
that I learned to put it aside and say


---------56:45----------
okay I've thought about that enough for


---------56:47----------
the moment or I felt it enough it's


---------56:49----------
becoming uncomfortable I'm going to


---------56:52----------
package that aside and come back to it


---------56:55----------
when I'm ready for more so I got very


---------56:58----------
good at turning that feeling off yeah


---------57:01----------
right so and and you're doing it you're


---------57:03----------
doing a great job I'm tying everything


---------57:05----------
together if I don't have to tie together


---------57:06----------
anything for you you're doing it all by


---------57:08----------
yourself


---------57:08----------
all right so I think we have two


---------57:11----------
challenges Ethan one is that so you're


---------57:13----------
tying I mean beautiful like I should


---------57:15----------
just jot this down and fuss about it in


---------57:17----------
peer supervision because it's all laid


---------57:18----------
out right so yeah our experience when


---------57:20----------
you were five you felt I mean so I think


---------57:23----------
there's there's there's a staggering


---------57:24----------
amount of being left hanging by your dad


---------57:29----------
yeah of being like alone in the wind it


---------57:36----------
wasn't a supportive answer for sure yeah


---------57:38----------
yeah did did nothing to make me feel


---------57:39----------
better made me feel worse like cuz he


---------57:42----------
was my idol right he's my father I'm a


---------57:44----------
young kid a boy and here he is like I'm


---------57:47----------
like dad what happens when we die and


---------57:50----------
he's like well you cease to exist in


---------57:53----------
your body brats


---------57:57----------
what are you feeling now now we're


---------57:59----------
getting somewhere now you're feeling now


---------58:01----------
the armor is coming down what is that


---------58:03----------
what are you feeling when you talk about


---------58:05----------
your dad when you tell that story you be


---------58:06----------
I feel let down


---------58:07----------
I feel abandoned right I feel vulnerable


---------58:13----------
again as I did war


---------58:16----------
I see anger oh yeah oh yeah fair yeah


---------58:21----------
yeah I know yes I agree with that I I


---------58:29----------
like I'm gonna over intellectualize bear


---------58:34----------
with me a second I feel like my parents


---------58:36----------
did the best they knew how and they gave


---------58:40----------
me a financially secure home with a big


---------58:44----------
drive for education but emotionally they


---------58:46----------
did a fairly [ __ ] job how do you feel


---------58:49----------
about that uh I feel like it left me


---------58:54----------
with that lifetime of work to try and


---------58:56----------
put it back together that I've discussed


---------58:58----------
and so and I have kids myself so I feel


---------59:02----------
motivated not to inflict that on them


---------59:04----------
right to be a different person


---------59:08----------
Ethan if someone treated your kids the


---------59:11----------
way that your parents treated you how


---------59:14----------
would you Ronald that I'd throttle them


---------59:16----------
I the rage with I guess I would enter


---------59:18----------
that would be like Papa Bear is coming


---------59:20----------
to clear the room yeah and how do you


---------59:25----------
feel that no one did that for you yeah


---------59:28----------
one was there yeah your parents treated


---------59:34----------
you the way that they did and there was


---------59:36----------
no papa bear that's right


---------59:42----------
yeah I feel that brings on more sadness


---------59:46----------
I feel more less anger than more just


---------59:50----------
God that sucks and so I don't want that


---------59:53----------
for anyone else so I think we've got to


---------59:57----------
two challenges with you okay okay only


---------60:00----------
two


---------60:00----------
I'm doing well yeah so one is like what


---------60:03----------
all these feelings are and I think you


---------60:04----------
do a very good job of divorcing yourself


---------60:06----------
from some of your feelings right because


---------60:08----------
like I don't like I can point and I


---------60:10----------
think it's clear to me that you've done


---------60:12----------
a lot of reflection I think you've come


---------60:14----------
a very long way because just that what


---------60:16----------
you're saying is like your gift you're


---------60:18----------
not giving me a rough draft you're


---------60:20----------
giving me like something for something


---------60:22----------
very close to a final product there's a


---------60:24----------
lot of the people that I talk to they're


---------60:25----------
giving me like really rough drafts and


---------60:27----------
our goal is to get to where you are 15


---------60:30----------
minutes into the interview okay so and


---------60:33----------
I'll just say like an example of this is


---------60:35----------
that you're not able to notice the anger


---------60:36----------
right away but if I point it out to you


---------60:38----------
you're like yeah it's there and we can


---------60:40----------
get closer to it if I ask certain


---------60:41----------
questions that actually do the


---------60:44----------
depersonalization for you so if I ask


---------60:46----------
you how you feel what kind of answer do


---------60:48----------
I get uh you get a feeling nope nope


---------60:53----------
good again okay when you ask me how I


---------60:57----------
feel you get a story and a picture of


---------61:00----------
what I've learned sure yeah what you've


---------61:02----------
learned that's the operative thing right


---------61:04----------
I get an intellectual answer yeah okay


---------61:06----------
and then like they're there moments


---------61:10----------
where you have your feelings and those


---------61:14----------
moments are actually when you step


---------61:16----------
outside of yourself and you look at the


---------61:17----------
situation so when you imagine how your


---------61:21----------
dad like it's almost like you're being


---------61:23----------
Papa Bear for yourself when you talk


---------61:26----------
about like that anger that I get from


---------61:28----------
you that visceral anger is like when


---------61:31----------
you're recalling how your dad treated a


---------61:34----------
five-year-old that's what gets the Papa


---------61:36----------
Bear anger out okay and that Papa Bear


---------61:39----------
anger is there yeah


---------61:41----------
right but when you just view it from


---------61:43----------
yourself you're it's like hard for you


---------61:45----------
to embrace that Papa Bear anger I don't


---------61:47----------
think you are letting yourself feel that


---------61:49----------
and then if I ask you about the kitten


---------61:51----------
are you getting emotional now no no not


---------61:53----------
at all I'm laughing I'm laugh


---------61:54----------
myself because you're right and I you


---------61:57----------
know yeah so so if I ask you about your


---------62:00----------
kids then the Papa Bear anger is like


---------62:02----------
that's what you feel for yourself right


---------62:05----------
and then you also make these kind of


---------62:07----------
interesting statements which I think


---------62:08----------
you've done a lot of processing on right


---------62:10----------
like you kind of say oh my parents


---------62:11----------
didn't do good enough right which is


---------62:14----------
sort of an analytical statement but at


---------62:16----------
the same time like that's such a watered


---------62:22----------
down diet version whether your life was


---------62:26----------
right like so yeah they didn't do good


---------62:28----------
enough but like think about what it was


---------62:29----------
actually like for you to grow up in that


---------62:31----------
household okay yeah you're right I'm I'm


---------62:37----------
reticent to whine on stream I guess yeah


---------62:42----------
my my childhood I could tell again no


---------62:45----------
physical abuse really but I could tell


---------62:48----------
bad household stories yeah yeah so I


---------62:52----------
grew up in a you know in a verbal II and


---------62:56----------
intellectually abusive environment yes


---------62:58----------
and hurt and I yeah good so and I think


---------63:02----------
once again like even that like the


---------63:04----------
subtle thing there is you say I don't


---------63:05----------
want to whine on stream where no one's


---------63:07----------
whining I lurve four thousand eight


---------63:09----------
hundred and nineteen people watching on


---------63:11----------
my end I don't think a single one of


---------63:13----------
them thinks you're whining okay that


---------63:15----------
whining is your self judgment and your


---------63:18----------
distancing of the way that you feel okay


---------63:22----------
that's why you use the word one cuz


---------63:23----------
you're like [ __ ] Ethan like why are


---------63:25----------
you whining about this [ __ ] right okay


---------63:29----------
that's like what your dad or mom told


---------63:31----------
you the whole time like I don't care


---------63:33----------
about your feelings like why do you feel


---------63:36----------
that way like Ethan that's unproductive


---------63:39----------
okay fair yes so there are two things


---------63:43----------
here one is like you know what the


---------63:45----------
source and you've done it just once


---------63:46----------
again masterful job like you know when


---------63:48----------
we talk about the void like the void of


---------63:49----------
I forgot what how you black hole black


---------63:52----------
hole of hunger in for positive reading


---------63:56----------
or for love hunger for positive yeah


---------63:58----------
there's that kind of stuff right which


---------64:00----------
is like generally speaking when we talk


---------64:02----------
about feelings like that's the Epiphany


---------64:04----------
that we want people to have right they


---------64:06----------
say oh I have a black hole in my heart


---------64:07----------
for a lot


---------64:08----------
that's what people tune in for from a


---------64:09----------
voyeuristic aspect I don't know I don't


---------64:12----------
know that that I mean I think that can


---------64:13----------
be significant for you but I think what


---------64:15----------
is far more significant for you is not


---------64:17----------
to try to do the things that other


---------64:19----------
people here do on soon because you're


---------64:20----------
not them like most of the people that I


---------64:22----------
interview in there earn their 20s right


---------64:24----------
I haven't they just haven't gotten there


---------64:26----------
/ played when it comes to life is just


---------64:29----------
way smaller than yours right and you


---------64:31----------
have lived a life of reflection


---------64:33----------
introspection and dedication to


---------64:35----------
self-improvement which is remarkable and


---------64:38----------
so I think the thing that we need to


---------64:40----------
teach you more than anything else is


---------64:42----------
like show you how you step away from


---------64:45----------
just huge parts of yourself okay


---------64:48----------
the goal here for you is no long is not


---------64:50----------
like revelation it's integration because


---------64:53----------
I think you already know you just choose


---------64:55----------
not to like let that be a part of you


---------64:57----------
okay I have you know I would think that


---------65:01----------
someone in your shoes would feel angry


---------65:03----------
with their parents like you have every


---------65:07----------
right to be angry with your parents I


---------65:09----------
guess I but you're not angry with your


---------65:12----------
parents because what you do you're so


---------65:14----------
[ __ ] understanding that you when I


---------65:16----------
asked you about your parents you say she


---------65:18----------
didn't grow up in a household of love so


---------65:22----------
you give them excuses for their behavior


---------65:24----------
just help is helpful it allows you to


---------65:28----------
forgive but also should not be done to


---------65:30----------
the exclusion of your feelings okay both


---------65:33----------
of those have to be there right you have


---------65:35----------
to understand ago I disassociated I'm


---------65:38----------
like well yeah I got it I give them a


---------65:41----------
pass and so then being angry with them


---------65:43----------
has no point because being angry with


---------65:45----------
someone who didn't I make excuses for


---------65:47----------
them I got absolutely yeah right so


---------65:50----------
you're doing fantastic so now it comes


---------65:52----------
to back to your job and our stress yeah


---------65:55----------
and when you walk into that boardroom


---------65:56----------
yeah and I think the reason that those


---------65:58----------
feelings because it's kind of weird


---------66:00----------
right you're able to handle so many


---------66:02----------
different things you're able to grow in


---------66:05----------
spite of so many different challenges


---------66:06----------
you're able to achieve so why is it that


---------66:10----------
you know armor wearing shell owning


---------66:16----------
dissociative Ethan has trouble when he


---------66:20----------
walks into that room


---------66:21----------
because you're the one who says if


---------66:23----------
someone's yelling in your face you can


---------66:24----------
handle that why is it so hard for you to


---------66:27----------
do this thing and put on your armor at


---------66:29----------
that point because there's a part of me


---------66:38----------
that says well maybe it goes a little


---------66:41----------
bit well what is hard I'm afraid maybe


---------66:44----------
they're right


---------66:45----------
I'm afraid maybe the attack is right


---------66:48----------
maybe oh boy if you go all the way back


---------66:53----------
to it I guess you and there's a part of


---------66:58----------
me that feels like well maybe I earned


---------67:01----------
or or maybe my parents didn't do wrong I


---------67:06----------
I was the problem right so there's a


---------67:09----------
there's a confidence problem or a


---------67:11----------
self-value again those are intellectual


---------67:14----------
words the fear that the root fear is


---------67:22----------
maybe they're right maybe I'm not worthy


---------67:25----------
maybe it's it's all of that and so it's


---------67:30----------
fear that you're not good enough that I


---------67:32----------
am not good enough


---------67:34----------
and and where did you learn that home


---------67:38----------
absolutely right so now we understand


---------67:41----------
that like I think so part of the problem


---------67:42----------
here is that you dissociate parts of


---------67:45----------
yourself


---------67:45----------
but those dissociated parts don't go


---------67:48----------
away they just lie dormant right and


---------67:50----------
there are some situations that cause the


---------67:52----------
volcano to erupt because all that


---------67:54----------
magnets down there yes and so the


---------67:57----------
solution to you no longer feeling that


---------68:00----------
way is to like you know like drain the


---------68:03----------
abscess do you know what an abscess is


---------68:05----------
yeah I do and I can hear my wife


---------68:07----------
laughing downstairs cuz we talked about


---------68:09----------
the volcano inside me and she just she


---------68:12----------
just the stream just caught up to those


---------68:13----------
words and and she was busted out okay


---------68:17----------
cuz it's real yeah so so yeah I can have


---------68:22----------
a dramatic rage outbursts yeah they're


---------68:30----------
they're very rare and tightly controlled


---------68:33----------
but that's like the button-up armor


---------68:35----------
and if that gets out you know I'm a


---------68:39----------
booth the gaming term I go berserk I'm a


---------68:42----------
beserker and I like when I tip over it's


---------68:46----------
all that's what happens right like with


---------68:48----------
the dissociation with the armor there


---------68:50----------
all of the feelings that you understand


---------68:53----------
and are okay with and then there's all


---------68:55----------
the stuff that doesn't help you


---------68:56----------
that cannot be intellectualized the


---------68:59----------
stuff that's a little bit irrational and


---------69:01----------
all that stuff goes beneath the surface


---------69:03----------
and that stuff sometimes gets a vocht


---------69:08----------
when you walk into a particular room at


---------69:10----------
work it hits too close to home so


---------69:12----------
there's some there are some avenues


---------69:14----------
there are some tunnels to like the magma


---------69:16----------
at the center of the earth that evoke


---------69:18----------
that more often and if you're wanting to


---------69:20----------
stop feeling that way like sure you can


---------69:23----------
go to thing I mean you can go to therapy


---------69:25----------
and maybe you should I mean I don't know


---------69:26----------
if you've seen people in the past or


---------69:27----------
yeah you can talk about the absence of


---------69:30----------
love in your life in the black hole of


---------69:32----------
love and that's such beautiful juicy


---------69:33----------
like some juicy therapy imagery it's


---------69:35----------
like oh my god it just gets therap is so


---------69:37----------
excited when we yeah this is what we got


---------69:41----------
into it for but I think oddly enough


---------69:43----------
ethan i think your path is actually more


---------69:45----------
not so much the path of therapy although


---------69:47----------
that can be helpful but it's the path of


---------69:48----------
meditation is that a path of yoga is the


---------69:51----------
path of understanding how your mind


---------69:53----------
functions and then once you understand


---------69:56----------
how your mind functions changing a


---------69:58----------
couple of levers so it stops doing the


---------70:00----------
things that it's doing right now and the


---------70:02----------
simplest of that is to stop dissociating


---------70:04----------
and start integrating to understand that


---------70:07----------
just because you're a level-headed guy


---------70:09----------
doesn't mean like it's weird because


---------70:11----------
you're a level-headed guy in you're a


---------70:13----------
berserker like you got a that's got a


---------70:15----------
meet somewhere in the middle for you to


---------70:17----------
be integrated like that's the goal yeah


---------70:22----------
yes there was a period earlier in my


---------70:25----------
life where I sought perfection and


---------70:26----------
absolutely said your point about


---------70:28----------
disassociation people would say to me


---------70:32----------
you're only well you're only human and


---------70:34----------
I'd say yeah that's a flaw


---------70:37----------
yeah but then then yeah there's a lot


---------70:40----------
other stuff too like these patterns that


---------70:43----------
you have about yourself and where you


---------70:44----------
learned that right well I was trying to


---------70:48----------
be unemotional


---------70:49----------
in other words because done you've done


---------70:52----------
a very good job because knowing that the


---------70:56----------
emotion is volcanic and uncontrolled the


---------70:58----------
first path is well just don't be that


---------71:01----------
yeah because because there's no scuzz


---------71:04----------
it's careless to be emotional yeah it's


---------71:09----------
the definition of carelessness


---------71:10----------
uncontrolled no coffee on the saucer


---------71:13----------
Ethan not allowed no no coffee on the


---------71:16----------
saucer so but I am very interested I


---------71:21----------
would like to be more integrated right I


---------71:23----------
strive to be a whole person I want that


---------71:28----------
and not to just intellectualize I not


---------71:31----------
only strive to be it I actually want it


---------71:33----------
I want to be at peace with myself yacht


---------71:36----------
in two pieces


---------71:37----------
yeah so beautifully set beautifully set


---------71:40----------
right and and that's that I don't know


---------71:42----------
if you read that something like you know


---------71:44----------
that's somewhere no that's like that's


---------71:45----------
that's great nice that's like you know


---------71:47----------
Lama level don't be in be with what do


---------71:53----------
you I don't even remember what you said


---------71:54----------
but we can we can clip that that was


---------71:57----------
profound you said something you said


---------71:58----------
something by saying I strive to be


---------72:00----------
integrated I want to be a whole person


---------72:02----------
not live in two pieces yeah yeah yeah it


---------72:07----------
was great right and I think it's yeah so


---------72:12----------
we're gonna start do you meditate I have


---------72:14----------
a little bit not regularly okay I really


---------72:18----------
I read what is it Dan Harris and 10%


---------72:22----------
happier you must know this book yeah


---------72:23----------
yeah so we're gonna teach you one form


---------72:26----------
of meditation today okay I don't mm I


---------72:32----------
think you should just start here


---------72:34----------
although I don't think this is the right


---------72:37----------
end game practice for you this is like


---------72:39----------
the preparatory practice okay the other


---------72:41----------
thing just in general that I think you


---------72:43----------
need to be doing is feeling more what


---------72:46----------
emotion do you think you need to feel


---------72:47----------
more of what do you think what right so


---------72:53----------
emotions are mad sad glad etc what


---------72:59----------
emotion do I need to feel more of


---------73:02----------
what do you need to let yourself feel


---------73:04----------
what's the anger absolutely good I'm


---------73:06----------
glad you got him right now my wife's not


---------73:09----------
gonna laugh so so it doesn't mean be


---------73:12----------
angry it means feel feel it okay because


---------73:15----------
here's the thing when you walk into the


---------73:16----------
boardroom and you're your performance is


---------73:20----------
not as good is it supposed to be we've


---------73:24----------
been talking about humiliation is how I


---------73:26----------
feel right but there's another thing


---------73:29----------
there when you walk in there and your


---------73:31----------
boss is saying hey Ethan you didn't do X


---------73:34----------
why is he like what's the other thing


---------73:36----------
that you feel pissed off that they're


---------73:38----------
observing the obvious and not helping


---------73:40----------
yes right there's anger there there's


---------73:43----------
total anger anger it's bizarre because


---------73:46----------
for most people anger covers up the


---------73:48----------
shame anger is a protective mechanism


---------73:50----------
you're so spiritually advanced that it's


---------73:52----------
gotten like reverse where do you feel


---------73:55----------
the inadequacy you see yourself and then


---------73:57----------
like you just don't let yourself feel


---------73:58----------
anger because I'm because the behavior


---------74:03----------
that follows really feeling angry is


---------74:05----------
confrontational so that's where you have


---------74:09----------
to learn that's your barrier of growth


---------74:11----------
right so just like like shame does not


---------74:15----------
lead to tears does it even know you can


---------74:18----------
control that yeah so the separation


---------74:20----------
between behaviors and feelings is there


---------74:23----------
for you in all emotions except for one


---------74:26----------
anger that's completely true and that's


---------74:29----------
why that's the one you need to feel okay


---------74:31----------
that's the great barrier of your growth


---------74:33----------
right so to feel angry to let yourself


---------74:35----------
feel angry because it's not it's not


---------74:38----------
about a lack of love it's not about any


---------74:40----------
of that juicy juicy Freudian


---------74:43----------
psychological goodness not being loved


---------74:46----------
by your mother and not being loved by


---------74:47----------
your father


---------74:48----------
it's about anger okay it's about being


---------74:51----------
pissed at the injustice of the world and


---------74:54----------
that's what you're angry at is the


---------74:56----------
injustice of it yeah okay that it's not


---------74:59----------
with their that your parents treated you


---------75:02----------
the way that they did and they shouldn't


---------75:04----------
have and it's not [ __ ] fair and you


---------75:08----------
understand that very well as soon as I


---------75:09----------
put your kids into their shoes no but


---------75:13----------
you don't let yourself feel that way


---------75:15----------
about


---------75:15----------
yourself yeah it seems disrespectful I


---------75:20----------
guess sure there are all kinds of good


---------75:23----------
reasons to not feel it up right there


---------75:25----------
there are good reasons why an


---------75:26----------
intellectual introspective reflective


---------75:29----------
and experienced person like yourself has


---------75:31----------
concluded to not feel those feelings and


---------75:34----------
you've got to feel okay okay so just


---------75:39----------
notice it throughout the week and then


---------75:41----------
from a very sort of like psycho physics


---------75:45----------
kind of perspective in my experience the


---------75:47----------
more that you experience those emotions


---------75:50----------
throughout the week and acknowledge them


---------75:53----------
when you have the opportunity to the


---------75:55----------
last blow ups you're gonna have okay


---------75:57----------
that's good and also the less cuz the


---------76:00----------
problem here is that right now the


---------76:01----------
reason that anger is so tied to behavior


---------76:03----------
is because the only time that anger you


---------76:06----------
like it rise lay there's a dam and


---------76:08----------
angers like rising on the other side and


---------76:10----------
then it floods over right and so no


---------76:13----------
wonder it's in controllable because it's


---------76:14----------
like the only time you see you get wet


---------76:17----------
is when it's flooded yes so that's got


---------76:20----------
to change right so you've got to start


---------76:22----------
irrigating a little bit letting it out a


---------76:24----------
little bit acknowledging a little bit on


---------76:25----------
a day-to-day basis I'm imagining


---------76:29----------
you're you're like colorblind for anger


---------76:31----------
in your day-to-day life people probably


---------76:34----------
call you for the most part a pretty


---------76:35----------
level-headed calm collected guy right


---------76:39----------
yeah usually yes yes with exceptions if


---------76:45----------
they've ever seen the damn bridge yeah


---------76:47----------
exactly so the way to get the dam from


---------76:50----------
breaking is to actually let the water


---------76:51----------
out from time to time that you have to


---------76:53----------
process your emotions as they arise that


---------76:55----------
acknowledge that you're feeling them


---------76:56----------
okay and so look for what the feeling of


---------76:59----------
anger is in your body and so notice like


---------77:01----------
your physical sensations kind of like we


---------77:03----------
did with the pit in the stomach that's


---------77:04----------
not anger that's something else yeah and


---------77:07----------
and just notice your anger and I'd say


---------77:09----------
that's the first step forward for you


---------77:10----------
okay and then I can teach you meditation


---------77:14----------
do you have any questions for me no I'm


---------77:18----------
super I mean I have a ton about how to


---------77:22----------
integrate the personality but I


---------77:27----------
I want to know more I don't think I


---------77:30----------
understand how to form a good question


---------77:32----------
other than to say yes I'm eager to learn


---------77:35----------
about that and to be able because I


---------77:38----------
don't like having the the disassociated


---------77:45----------
shell right I don't like and I try like


---------77:48----------
I try to share honestly who I am but


---------77:51----------
some parts of me are hard to let out


---------77:53----------
absolutely because that too is that's


---------77:56----------
adaptive like I think use fantastic work


---------77:59----------
so that was necessary for you to survive


---------78:02----------
and and now it's starting to you know


---------78:05----------
like most adaptations they're they're


---------78:08----------
adaptive in one area and then like


---------78:11----------
maladaptive maladaptive yeah that makes


---------78:13----------
perfect sense yeah so I think at this


---------78:15----------
stage in your life you know you've


---------78:18----------
managed a lot of different emotions


---------78:19----------
you've dealt with inadequacy and shame


---------78:20----------
and things like that but oddly enough I


---------78:22----------
think the you know the way for it is to


---------78:24----------
feel a little bit more anger and I'm


---------78:25----------
gonna teach you this I'll teach you a


---------78:29----------
very simple meditation practice that if


---------78:31----------
you do on a day-to-day basis will I


---------78:33----------
think help you a little bit with


---------78:35----------
managing your emotions as well


---------78:37----------
okay so sit up straight sit up straight


---------78:39----------
got it and then I can you do this and I


---------78:47----------
do yep good so with your right hand I


---------78:52----------
want you to block your right right


---------78:53----------
nostril and breathe in through your left


---------79:00----------
just breathe in and then switch and then


---------79:06----------
breathe out breathe in through the same


---------79:12----------
nostril switch breathe out in through


---------79:25----------
the same switch breathe out in switch


---------79:44----------
out in


---------79:55----------
switch out go ahead and close your eyes


---------80:02----------
continue at your own pace remember that


---------80:06----------
you inhale with the same nostril that


---------80:09----------
you exhale and that you switch on a full


---------80:14----------
breath


---------80:16----------
everybody's watching at home should do


---------80:18----------
this too


---------81:31----------
go ahead and do two more breaths and let


---------81:37----------
your eyes remain closed let your hands


---------81:41----------
relax


---------82:00----------
you


---------82:12----------
notice the natural slowing of your


---------82:15----------
breath and just sit with the person that


---------82:19----------
you are


---------82:37----------
now put your palms together in front of


---------82:40----------
you touching rub them together feel the


---------82:45----------
heat the friction and then cut them over


---------82:47----------
your eyes slowly open your eyes as you


---------82:52----------
exhale let your hands come down okay


---------83:03----------
feeling that's good that's very relaxing


---------83:08----------
you look different


---------83:10----------
well I think I bet that's true how do


---------83:13----------
you do - for the record yeah yeah works


---------83:16----------
on me - thoughts questions before we


---------83:21----------
wrap out for the day


---------83:22----------
uh no I'm eager to follow up in a week


---------83:25----------
like okay to try it some and and the


---------83:30----------
integration questions to have questions


---------83:35----------
don't even don't judge yourself for not


---------83:40----------
having questions just now I was just


---------83:42----------
checking I was checking with myself like


---------83:44----------
do I have a well formed question or some


---------83:46----------
heaven okay I know I wasn't I was I


---------83:49----------
judge myself plenty maybe but I was not


---------83:51----------
in that case good sorry for jumping to


---------83:54----------
conclusions no no it's actually when you


---------83:57----------
asked me to sit with myself I generally


---------84:04----------
like myself like that was not unpleasant


---------84:06----------
sitting with the person I am


---------84:09----------
was not a big running list of ways I


---------84:13----------
need to be different it was okay I'm I'm


---------84:17----------
fine how I am maybe I can also be better


---------84:19----------
but I'm fine how I am yes right yes so


---------84:25----------
that is you cultivate that sensation


---------84:28----------
more and more in meditation walking into


---------84:32----------
that room when your your product isn't


---------84:34----------
performing is gonna get easier and


---------84:36----------
easier okay that makes good that makes


---------84:39----------
complete sense because you're what


---------84:42----------
you've said in other words is you're no


---------84:45----------
longer attached to the result right


---------84:49----------
you're not attached to what's going on


---------84:50----------
in the room from a self valuation view


---------84:53----------
process you are just what you are right


---------84:57----------
that is the way that you actually exist


---------84:58----------
in this world and keep going on this


---------85:02----------
path and you'll even discover what


---------85:05----------
happens to you after death oh really all


---------85:09----------
right that's what they say


---------85:11----------
that's what it well eventually I'll


---------85:13----------
discover one way or the other one way or


---------85:15----------
the other


---------85:15----------
okay take care of it all right thank you


---------85:18----------
so much have a nice day bye well next


---------85:21----------
week same time yeah next week same time


---------85:22----------
I'll see you there bye okay so okay


---------85:31----------
we're gonna go to so regarding beating


---------85:33----------
yourself up for carelessness can you


---------85:35----------
explain what a healthy and productive


---------85:37----------
version of scolding yourself would look


---------85:39----------
like I will temporarily beat myself up


---------85:41----------
for stupid mistakes but move on quickly


---------85:43----------
so there's a difference between


---------85:45----------
reflecting and understanding that you


---------85:48----------
made a mistake and beating yourself up


---------85:50----------
those are like completely different


---------85:51----------
things right so you can do nothing wrong


---------85:54----------
and beat yourself up you can do a lot


---------85:57----------
wrong and not beat yourself up you can


---------86:01----------
do something wrong and beat yourself up


---------86:03----------
or you can do something wrong and not


---------86:04----------
beat yourself up right there's a


---------86:06----------
two-by-two table and just think about


---------86:08----------
this for a second completely independent


---------86:10----------
functions of the mind so if I like you


---------86:13----------
know


---------86:14----------
well let's say that I was I mean I use


---------86:17----------
some examples over and over again but


---------86:18----------
well I think infidelity is a good one so


---------86:21----------
if I'm unfaithful there are lots of ways


---------86:23----------
that I can do mental gymnastics and


---------86:25----------
convince myself that even though I did


---------86:28----------
something wrong objectively I won't beat


---------86:30----------
myself up for it I'll justify it I'll


---------86:32----------
give myself excuses right so you can do


---------86:35----------
something wrong and not beat yourself up


---------86:37----------
then there's like people who are highly


---------86:39----------
neurotic because like they don't


---------86:45----------
actually do something wrong like though


---------86:47----------
though walk down the street and they I


---------86:50----------
opened a door and I walked through the


---------86:53----------
door and I let go of the door and I


---------86:55----------
didn't realize someone was behind me and


---------86:57----------
that person put their hand on the door


---------86:59----------
kind of at the last second and opened it


---------87:01----------
and then walked out and I didn't hold


---------87:03----------
the door open for them and I'm like


---------87:05----------
beating myself up because oh my god that


---------87:07----------
person must think I'm a complete [ __ ]


---------87:08----------
and and things like that so even though


---------87:11----------
objectively you may not have really done


---------87:13----------
much like you just walked through the


---------87:15----------
door you're not responsible necessarily


---------87:17----------
for holding it like sure it's nice if


---------87:18----------
you hold it but you can still beat


---------87:20----------
yourself up over it right that's kind of


---------87:23----------
like social anxiety or you know


---------87:26----------
stealing's of inadequacy so you can have


---------87:28----------
a cognitive bias where even though


---------87:30----------
you're not doing anything wrong that


---------87:32----------
that you're you know you're still sort


---------87:35----------
of beating yourself up and then you can


---------87:37----------
do something wrong and you can beat


---------87:39----------
yourself up over it or you can do


---------87:42----------
something wrong and then you cannot beat


---------87:43----------
yourself up over it so case in point of


---------87:46----------
the last one at the beginning of the


---------87:48----------
stream if you guys were around you saw


---------87:51----------
the train wreck of the century in terms


---------87:55----------
of or not I mean onthe century but


---------87:56----------
probably the stupidest thing that I've


---------87:59----------
ever done on stream and I completely


---------88:01----------
acknowledge it was a terrible thing to


---------88:04----------
do and boy was that a mistake


---------88:06----------
like there is no question that what I


---------88:09----------
did was a terrible idea


---------88:12----------
and it's like did I beat myself up for


---------88:15----------
it no I'm not gonna do it again I'm


---------88:17----------
gonna learn from it I'm gonna learn


---------88:20----------
about how to do things better but I'm


---------88:25----------
not gonna beat myself up over it because


---------88:28----------
I acknowledge that I'm a boomer and as


---------88:31----------
we've talked about before boomer is my


---------88:33----------
armor right boomer is my excuse I'm a


---------88:36----------
boomer and I don't know how these I


---------88:38----------
don't know how the internet works uh


---------88:40----------
discord uh right and and then you know


---------88:48----------
like that's just I'm like there's this


---------88:50----------
gonna be like growing pains right


---------88:53----------
there's gonna be growing pains like I'm


---------88:56----------
gonna make mistakes on stream like this


---------88:57----------
is new to me like you know trying to


---------89:00----------
save the internet through AoE healing is


---------89:03----------
gonna like have a learning curve folks


---------89:05----------
so that's gonna happen from time to time


---------89:08----------
so question is how do you so yeah I


---------89:12----------
think what is like reflective and one is


---------89:14----------
like a sense of beating yourself up


---------89:16----------
which has to do with like ego and sense


---------89:18----------
of self like do you just acknowledge so


---------89:20----------
you have to acknowledge that there's a


---------89:22----------
difference between incompetence and


---------89:24----------
inexperience this is where I think a lot


---------89:26----------
of people get tripped up so the question


---------89:28----------
is like are you incompetent which is how


---------89:30----------
a lot of times how you feel about


---------89:31----------
yourself like you feel like oh I'm dumb


---------89:33----------
or like I'm socially bad right I'm


---------89:35----------
socially incompetent whereas if you


---------89:38----------
really stop and look at it like if you


---------89:39----------
spend ten hours a day playing video


---------89:41----------
games your social function isn't gonna


---------89:44----------
be good but that's not because you're


---------89:46----------
like socially like defunct in some way


---------89:49----------
it's because you're inexperienced


---------89:50----------
because you spend most of your time


---------89:52----------
behind a computer screen it's like you


---------89:55----------
wouldn't blame like a first year medical


---------89:58----------
student for not doing a good job in


---------90:00----------
surgery because they're just new to this


---------90:03----------
and if you spend most of your time


---------90:04----------
behind a computer screen like why would


---------90:06----------
you think that you're good with people


---------90:08----------
right so try to be a little bit


---------90:11----------
compassionate towards yourself try to


---------90:13----------
understand that there's a difference


---------90:14----------
between like you socking it life and you


---------90:16----------
being inexperienced at life and if you


---------90:18----------
guys saw like this interview is


---------90:19----------
different from any of the others and why


---------90:21----------
is that it's because Ethan has like more


---------90:23----------
XP he's like higher level he's


---------90:25----------
doing this a while his slash played is


---------90:28----------
like way higher than your slash blade so


---------90:31----------
the way that he manages his emotions in


---------90:33----------
the way that he understands himself is


---------90:34----------
gonna be different right yeah so just so


---------90:41----------
someone's saying we're news yes so let's


---------90:43----------
remember somewhere along the way newb


---------90:47----------
changed its meaning


---------90:49----------
remember noob has its origins I know


---------90:51----------
this because I'm a boomer and I was


---------90:53----------
there in the days when new book was born


---------90:57----------
I remember right so noob is a newbie


---------91:02----------
someone who's new someone who's


---------91:04----------
inexperienced but now what noob means no


---------91:07----------
noob no longer means inexperienced new


---------91:10----------
means new means you suck like not


---------91:13----------
inexperienced you suck so what you guys


---------91:18----------
have to do is remember there's a


---------91:19----------
difference between incompetent


---------91:20----------
inexperienced and are you allowed to


---------91:23----------
make mistakes given the situation and


---------91:25----------
chances are the answer is almost always


---------91:27----------
yes that like even in social situations


---------91:31----------
even in marriage and relationships like


---------91:34----------
you can have fights with your


---------91:35----------
significant other and you can have


---------91:37----------
challenges in your marriage and that


---------91:39----------
doesn't mean that like even though you


---------91:40----------
get better at marriage you continue


---------91:42----------
having challenges like that's how it


---------91:44----------
works


---------91:44----------
life continues throwing new things at


---------91:47----------
you which is how life is so you're gonna


---------91:49----------
continually make mistakes so don't worry


---------91:54----------
about it man relax a little bit have


---------91:57----------
some fun laugh at it okay can shaming


---------92:04----------
ever be productive and healthy for


---------92:06----------
self-improvement okay so this is a great


---------92:08----------
question okay can shaming ever be


---------92:10----------
productive and healthy for


---------92:12----------
self-improvement okay so the the tricky


---------92:15----------
thing here is the statement itself okay


---------92:17----------
so I'm gonna do this again or hopefully


---------92:21----------
this works okay I don't know if you guys


---------92:24----------
actually like this or not but I think


---------92:25----------
this is too good to pass up


---------92:26----------
okay alright let's look at the sentence


---------92:31----------
can Oh God


---------92:39----------
can shaming ever be productive and


---------92:46----------
healthy for self-improvement so now


---------92:49----------
we're gonna do something I have faith in


---------92:51----------
you chat so you guys tell me what do you


---------92:54----------
think the answer to this is okay so ah I


---------93:11----------
see some people are getting it okay so


---------93:13----------
what do you guys think about this right


---------93:16----------
can shaming ever be productive for


---------93:18----------
self-improvement and then what do you


---------93:22----------
guys think about this


---------93:25----------
[Music]


---------93:31----------
right there you have it well done twitch


---------93:36----------
chat beautiful answer the question so


---------93:40----------
now we get to like a couple of things so


---------93:43----------
a lot of times when we are asking


---------93:45----------
ourselves questions and we have


---------93:46----------
conceptions of the world we tie things


---------93:48----------
together like I this is gonna sound kind


---------93:50----------
of weird and abstract but a lot of your


---------93:53----------
growth is gonna come when you take the


---------93:55----------
things that your mind automatically


---------93:57----------
spits out so this is important to


---------93:58----------
understand this person just spat out


---------94:00----------
that sentence right so something in


---------94:03----------
their mind they think that like okay


---------94:04----------
productive because they acknowledge that


---------94:05----------
shaming can be productive but they know


---------94:08----------
that it's you're not supposed to do that


---------94:09----------
so they're like confused about like how


---------94:11----------
do you move forward right so like


---------94:14----------
separate out what is going in on in your


---------94:17----------
mind and like actually look at it


---------94:19----------
actually look at your thoughts and


---------94:21----------
you'll be amazed at what you can


---------94:22----------
discover when you apply your analytical


---------94:25----------
power which is what gamers are really


---------94:26----------
good at so I could give you like this is


---------94:29----------
a person this is a question that someone


---------94:31----------
asked me because I'm an expert right I'm


---------94:33----------
super smart Harvard and II hear yoga and


---------94:36----------
E meditation and E seven years in India


---------94:38----------
so you become a monk and E all of the


---------94:40----------
Andes and you can come to the answer


---------94:43----------
just that easily you can do it you could


---------94:45----------
do it all you have to do is analyze it


---------94:46----------
y'all are brilliant you just have to


---------94:48----------
know how to analyze it you just have to


---------94:50----------
give yourself the chance to reflect upon


---------94:52----------
your thoughts right you have to like


---------94:57----------
this is important it's hard to study


---------95:00----------
everything in your mind so put it out on


---------95:03----------
something and then leverage your full


---------95:05----------
analytical capability on it you will be


---------95:07----------
amazed at what you're able to accomplish


---------95:08----------
what you will understand about yourself


---------95:11----------
so can shaming ever be productive and


---------95:15----------
healthy for self-improvement


---------95:16----------
both of those things I don't think so


---------95:19----------
I think shame can definitely drive


---------95:22----------
productivity for self-improvement for


---------95:24----------
sure right that absolutely is it gonna


---------95:27----------
be healthy for self-improvement I don't


---------95:29----------
think so so shame can be like sort of


---------95:32----------
healthy in the sense that shame is a


---------95:34----------
regular part of life and we should


---------95:35----------
experience it but if you're using shame


---------95:38----------
to fuel self-improvement I don't think


---------95:40----------
that's usually healthy right maybe but


---------95:43----------
generally speaking no so I think the rub


---------95:45----------
is that how can you find


---------95:47----------
self-improvement


---------95:48----------
how can you motivate yourself towards


---------95:50----------
self-improvement without a negative


---------95:52----------
emotion driving it which kind of goes


---------95:55----------
back to the thing about anger okay


---------95:58----------
regarding a sense of inadequacy fueling


---------96:00----------
personal growth what does a relentless


---------96:02----------
pursuit of personal growth look like


---------96:03----------
when it's fueled in a healthy way


---------96:05----------
instead of fueled by an adequacy okay


---------96:07----------
okay this is good fun all right we're


---------96:09----------
gonna do this again okay you guys ready


---------96:11----------
this one's harder okay so you guys have


---------96:15----------
to give yourself some slack you can't do


---------96:17----------
it but okay okay


---------96:20----------
regarding sense of inadequacy fueling


---------96:34----------
personal growth what does relentless


---------96:40----------
pursuit for purse rope look like when


---------96:49----------
it's fueled in a healthy way


---------96:53----------
okay so twitch chat now this is gonna be


---------96:57----------
hard okay maybe cuz it's gonna be a


---------97:01----------
little bit read my mind I'm gonna tell


---------97:03----------
you guys that for


---------97:06----------
healthy personal growth there is one


---------97:10----------
word in this question which is wrong


---------97:19----------
that's just leet speak there we go okay


---------97:28----------
so fueled is misspelled but twitch at


---------97:30----------
figured it out look at that that's it


---------97:35----------
beautiful beautiful you guys see that


---------97:38----------
like you see how [ __ ] there we go like


---------97:44----------
like this person you can see this


---------97:47----------
person's psychology in terms of this you


---------97:52----------
did it you did it you did it you fix it


---------97:54----------
that's healthy ready


---------97:57----------
unhealthy healthy unhealthy healthy


---------98:02----------
unhealthy healthy good job good job dude


---------98:13----------
good job Twitter chat I wish I could


---------98:18----------
donate to twitch at I'd like sub and sub


---------98:22----------
the twitch chat was streaming I would


---------98:23----------
sub right there well done team but you


---------98:27----------
guys see that


---------98:28----------
so inadequacy is about like the the


---------98:33----------
relentless pursuit like why do you need


---------98:37----------
to be relentless if you're adequate but


---------98:40----------
you don't need to be relentless if


---------98:41----------
you're adequate like you're fine you


---------98:43----------
don't need to do anything just chill man


---------98:44----------
and like grow and improve when you feel


---------98:47----------
like it and when life demands it of you


---------98:51----------
and like that's it


---------98:58----------
so it's the relentlessness that's the


---------99:00----------
problem because relentless oh serious up


---------99:02----------
thanks for gifting


---------99:05----------
um relentlessness is like that's that's


---------99:11----------
from inadequacy right because you're


---------99:12----------
never good enough so you have to be


---------99:15----------
relentless the relentless pursuit so


---------99:17----------
anytime people are like relentlessly


---------99:19----------
pursuing self growth like I'm like dude


---------99:20----------
why do you need to grow like what's


---------99:22----------
wrong with you that you need to grow why


---------99:24----------
can't you just be good enough the way


---------99:25----------
you are that's healthy and then you can


---------99:28----------
grow like when you know there are times


---------99:30----------
that I mean I generally have a pretty


---------99:32----------
good opinion of myself and there are


---------99:33----------
times that like I need to learn and grow


---------99:35----------
like hey dr. K don't just chop a hop-on


---------99:38----------
discord when you're live on stream and


---------99:39----------
let the internet just say whatever it


---------99:41----------
wants to because that's just it's just


---------99:44----------
too good to pass up for some of those


---------99:47----------
people out there it's just too good


---------99:48----------
you just can't they just can't pass it


---------99:52----------
up right and come on can we really like


---------99:55----------
is that my mistake or is that their


---------99:57----------
mistake like let's be honest that's


---------99:58----------
probably on me because you know it's


---------100:03----------
just too good to pass up okay what do I


---------100:09----------
think about Ethan's level of


---------100:13----------
self-consciousness so in I think Ethan I


---------100:20----------
don't know what you mean by


---------100:20----------
self-consciousness but I mean I think


---------100:25----------
Ethan is highly self-aware of all of the


---------100:28----------
parts that he's self-aware of and that


---------100:32----------
he's unaware of something relatively


---------100:35----------
large in his psychology which is usually


---------100:37----------
how it works so Carl Jung talked about


---------100:40----------
something called the shadow which is


---------100:41----------
like the part of our mind that we sort


---------100:43----------
of don't acknowledge and he also said


---------100:46----------
that most of the growth comes from


---------100:48----------
exploring our shadows which sort of


---------100:50----------
makes sense because if you were aware of


---------100:52----------
it you would have like worked on it and


---------100:53----------
reflected and fixed it anyway so the


---------100:56----------
role of like an analyst a psychoanalyst


---------100:58----------
is to like help people explore their


---------101:00----------
shadows because that's the part that


---------101:02----------
they don't understand and I think that


---------101:03----------
sort of makes sense but it's not like


---------101:05----------
any sort of drastic you know deep


---------101:07----------
psychological concept or the shadow it's


---------101:09----------
just like if your house you know if you


---------101:12----------
have a leaky faucet you're not gonna fix


---------101:13----------
it unless you know it's leaking so the


---------101:16----------
things that you're unaware of


---------101:18----------
or where your kind of barrier of growth


---------101:19----------
is or where your opportunity of growth


---------101:21----------
is I think overall he's like quite


---------101:24----------
reflective and you guys could see that


---------101:25----------
like most of the correlations that I


---------101:28----------
draw for people on stream he was saying


---------101:30----------
on his own right and sometimes he had to


---------101:32----------
be pushed and prodded like he said I


---------101:34----------
have a black hole of relentless


---------101:36----------
something he's some lack of positive


---------101:39----------
reinforcement or something he said


---------101:41----------
something weird some weird you know


---------101:43----------
corporate speak about love and he's like


---------101:46----------
I'm like what is that and he's like oh


---------101:48----------
it's love so he's like pretty good at at


---------101:49----------
pushing the envelope but then there are


---------101:51----------
some areas where he has trouble right


---------101:53----------
because we have to kind of get to him in


---------101:55----------
different ways we can't ask him about


---------101:57----------
himself because if we ask him hey Ethan


---------102:00----------
what's going on in your head he's gonna


---------102:01----------
give us an answer that's gonna be like


---------102:04----------
all correct and like no flavor it's


---------102:08----------
gonna be like intellectually brilliant


---------102:10----------
and no I don't know if you guys saw but


---------102:14----------
like what there was a couple of times


---------102:16----------
during the interview where like he could


---------102:17----------
became animated and that's what we're


---------102:18----------
looking for that's what he's missing


---------102:24----------
okay when it comes to the Harma and some


---------102:27----------
scar is there a day when something just


---------102:29----------
clicks or is it something you notice


---------102:31----------
over time slowly and only realize it's


---------102:34----------
getting better after reflecting on it


---------102:36----------
okay we want to try discord again your


---------102:40----------
mods have have set up a veteran system


---------102:42----------
yeah okay so we're gonna answer both of


---------102:44----------
those questions at the same time but I'm


---------102:46----------
gonna get to this last question real


---------102:47----------
quick okay and then we're gonna move to


---------102:49----------
disco we're gonna try this again so


---------102:53----------
[Music]


---------102:55----------
how do I get rid of my sense of


---------102:56----------
inadequacy you have to figure out where


---------102:57----------
it comes from right so where did you


---------103:00----------
learn that you were inadequate the


---------103:04----------
second thing that you can do is meditate


---------103:05----------
because when you meditate I don't know


---------103:06----------
if you guys saw this but you know when


---------103:09----------
you meditate you don't feel inadequate


---------103:10----------
anymore right like you just feel like


---------103:12----------
yourself feel like you're just you


---------103:13----------
there's no inadequacy there's no


---------103:15----------
inadequacy you're just you you're just


---------103:17----------
like neutral adequacy and inadequacy


---------103:20----------
don't really apply like that's just not


---------103:22----------
a thing and so that's what happens when


---------103:25----------
you meditate a lot so like even though I


---------103:26----------
made a catastrophic mistake at the


---------103:28----------
beginning of stream like what buffers me


---------103:30----------
against that is just like that


---------103:32----------
meditative sense they're just like oh


---------103:33----------
that's just something that happens in


---------103:34----------
life sometimes you get on stream and you


---------103:37----------
you know shoot yourself in the foot and


---------103:39----------
other times you get on stream and


---------103:40----------
they're like 15,000 people watching just


---------103:43----------
what it is like you just sit there and


---------103:45----------
you just be yourself and let the rest of


---------103:49----------
the world like revolve around you


---------103:51----------
however the [ __ ] it wants to that's fine


---------103:53----------
no big deal okay okay we're gonna try


---------103:58----------
discord again okay okay
