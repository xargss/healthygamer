---------00:10----------
question


---------00:11----------
yeah i'm hinted


---------00:14----------
okay um i'll give a second cause now


---------00:18----------
i've got to figure out how i'm gonna do


---------00:19----------
that


---------00:26----------
welcome


---------00:29----------
um thank you sorry i'm really nervous


---------00:32----------
actually


---------00:32----------
yeah most people tend to be nervous


---------00:34----------
we'll we'll we'll get over that don't


---------00:36----------
worry about it bro


---------00:37----------
um so and why don't you start by telling


---------00:39----------
me what do you go by


---------00:42----------
um i'm uh i'm struggling to i i probably


---------00:46----------
don't want to


---------00:46----------
uh reveal my real name on stream just


---------00:49----------
yeah um


---------00:51----------
something like doc okay that's totally


---------00:53----------
fine man yeah that's why i just ask you


---------00:54----------
know i'm not it's just like what do you


---------00:56----------
want me to call you so doc is totally


---------00:57----------
fine


---------00:58----------
so no problem what were you hoping to


---------01:01----------
talk about today or what are we talking


---------01:03----------
about bro


---------01:04----------
um so as


---------01:08----------
as you've already properly titled it's


---------01:09----------
um i do have


---------01:11----------
i would say it's just a very uh


---------01:14----------
i don't know it's a probably just a


---------01:15----------
traumatic experience uh


---------01:17----------
after another it's pretty much my whole


---------01:20----------
life and


---------01:21----------
at least for like the first half of it


---------01:23----------
and then a little bit of like what's


---------01:25----------
been going on


---------01:26----------
recently okay um and


---------01:29----------
to a degree maybe my um


---------01:34----------
obviously i can say for sure but it


---------01:36----------
feels like i have a very uh


---------01:37----------
unnatural reaction to it almost and


---------01:41----------
just the way that i've been dealing with


---------01:43----------
it is it's um


---------01:45----------
i've sort of been troubling i've been


---------01:47----------
sort of troubled with um


---------01:49----------
how do i say that just in general how to


---------01:52----------
even approach others about my own [ __ ]


---------01:53----------
if that makes sense


---------01:55----------
how to approach others about the things


---------01:56----------
that you internally deal with


---------01:59----------
yeah mostly because i


---------02:02----------
tend to be very open about what happens


---------02:04----------
to me


---------02:05----------
okay in a in a way that's not very


---------02:10----------
i would say that outwardly doesn't


---------02:11----------
really seem very emotional


---------02:13----------
um and it's it feels like there's like a


---------02:18----------
disconnect between who i am now and who


---------02:20----------
i was


---------02:21----------
just a few yeah just a few years ago i


---------02:24----------
would say


---------02:25----------
can you tell me who you are now


---------02:28----------
um it feels like now nowadays


---------02:32----------
um i'm kind of living in


---------02:35----------
person almost like it's it feels like


---------02:37----------
i'm basically just uh


---------02:40----------
someone who's watching my own life


---------02:41----------
happening um i don't really have


---------02:44----------
i don't really have like um um


---------02:48----------
i don't know like i don't feel like my


---------02:50----------
life is very important in that


---------02:53----------
like not in a depressed kind of way like


---------02:55----------
not and i'm not saying i feel suicidal


---------02:58----------
as much as i'm saying but it feels like


---------03:00----------
um


---------03:02----------
i don't really i feel like i would


---------03:04----------
rather


---------03:06----------
um help someone else fix their life and


---------03:08----------
fix my own


---------03:09----------
i think that's a good way i think that's


---------03:10----------
a good way to say that


---------03:12----------
so would it be fair to say that you're


---------03:14----------
not you don't feel


---------03:15----------
invested in your own life


---------03:19----------
yeah that's a pretty good way to say


---------03:20----------
that i think okay


---------03:22----------
so you're just kind of like a person


---------03:24----------
yeah go ahead um i would say i'm the


---------03:26----------
type of person who would rather clean up


---------03:28----------
your room than my own if that makes


---------03:30----------
sense


---------03:30----------
so you put others ahead of yourself


---------03:34----------
yeah um and in a way i do believe that


---------03:36----------
that's like


---------03:37----------
the only thing that keeps me happy


---------03:38----------
anymore um


---------03:40----------
like i don't it's rare for me to just be


---------03:43----------
happy on my own


---------03:44----------
or um to feel happy because something


---------03:47----------
happened


---------03:47----------
for me if it makes sense yep um stupid


---------03:50----------
example i made 10k on crypto


---------03:53----------
just like from investments and i didn't


---------03:54----------
feel anything about it i didn't feel


---------03:56----------
anything


---------03:57----------
yeah right um


---------04:00----------
but i never felt anything about it up


---------04:02----------
until i basically started telling people


---------04:04----------
um who are close to me who know that


---------04:06----------
they're going to get some of it and


---------04:08----------
that's when i started getting a little


---------04:09----------
bit happy about it i see so like


---------04:11----------
like the money doesn't mean much to you


---------04:14----------
but like


---------04:15----------
when it can help the people around you


---------04:18----------
yeah


---------04:19----------
it it that's when you start to feel


---------04:20----------
happy yeah


---------04:22----------
and i don't know i just don't feel very


---------04:24----------
goal um goal oriented anymore


---------04:26----------
sure um it's like


---------04:30----------
i guess for the gamers out there i could


---------04:32----------
say it's like uh i went from being an


---------04:34----------
eddie carrie main to


---------04:35----------
you me support okay i don't know exactly


---------04:38----------
what that means but i i can follow the


---------04:40----------
gist of it maybe i became the healer


---------04:43----------
yeah so maybe let me ask you in a


---------04:45----------
different way would you say that like


---------04:47----------
you no longer have main quest


---------04:48----------
and you're just doing side quests yeah


---------04:51----------
exactly


---------04:52----------
actually that's funny so that's kind of


---------04:54----------
how i was describing it to one of my


---------04:55----------
best friends


---------04:56----------
yesterday it's just it's just random


---------04:59----------
side quests


---------05:00----------
yeah exactly and and it sounds like it


---------05:04----------
hasn't always been this way you said


---------05:05----------
that a few years ago maybe it was


---------05:07----------
different


---------05:08----------
yeah um i would say


---------05:12----------
maybe like everything like for five


---------05:15----------
years it's been like this um


---------05:16----------
before that i used to be at least


---------05:20----------
competitive to some extent i was always


---------05:22----------
like


---------05:23----------
sort of the way i am now but now it


---------05:24----------
feels like uh i'm continuing what i've


---------05:26----------
started if that makes sense


---------05:28----------
sure uh before that i felt like


---------05:31----------
there was some drive behind it like i


---------05:33----------
actually tried to be


---------05:35----------
um i don't know i i try to be


---------05:38----------
someone who's got a presence in people's


---------05:40----------
life who was um


---------05:43----------
and just someone who had like his own


---------05:45----------
goals if that makes sense like


---------05:46----------
i was very excited to be independent i


---------05:48----------
was excited to be


---------05:51----------
what i'm trying what i'm still trying to


---------05:53----------
be a teacher that's what i'm going for


---------05:55----------
right now it's what i'm studying for


---------05:57----------
but nowadays it just everything just


---------05:59----------
kind of feels like it's just happening


---------06:00----------
like


---------06:01----------
i close my eyes and five minutes later


---------06:03----------
it's uh i'm a year older and nothing


---------06:06----------
happened if that makes sense


---------06:07----------
yeah um like life is passing you by


---------06:11----------
exactly um i'm not even necessarily sad


---------06:15----------
about it and that's what's scaring me


---------06:16----------
like


---------06:17----------
i feel like yeah i don't know it's kind


---------06:21----------
of like


---------06:21----------
just happening and i don't really feel


---------06:24----------
invested in my own life anymore i'm just


---------06:25----------
invested in for example what my little


---------06:27----------
sister is doing


---------06:28----------
what uh what my friends are doing um to


---------06:31----------
some


---------06:31----------
to some degree and and i'm very


---------06:35----------
yeah just just like a side note i don't


---------06:38----------
really know how to like incorporate it


---------06:40----------
into


---------06:40----------
like how to just bring it up so i'll


---------06:42----------
just say it the way it is


---------06:44----------
um i'm i also have this weird structure


---------06:46----------
but i don't see many people having but


---------06:48----------
maybe some people here do


---------06:50----------
um in a way i feel like i'm a narcissist


---------06:53----------
who also


---------06:54----------
hates himself like nothing else if it


---------06:55----------
makes sense like i'm the person who i


---------06:57----------
hate and love her most in my entire life


---------06:59----------
can you tell me about that sure


---------07:02----------
um for example like about the


---------07:05----------
loving myself part it's something that


---------07:08----------
doesn't really need context i just feel


---------07:10----------
like


---------07:10----------
in general i have a i have an ability to


---------07:15----------
get on people's level very well i think


---------07:17----------
i do have


---------07:19----------
um i mean i mean it does sound like i'm


---------07:22----------
like


---------07:22----------
um like narcissistic but i feel like i


---------07:25----------
have a very


---------07:26----------
good amount of like social intelligence


---------07:28----------
if that makes sense um


---------07:31----------
i think i'm i can't really think of any


---------07:34----------
friend circle i'm in where i'm not at


---------07:36----------
least somewhat of a prominent person


---------07:38----------
okay and it's not because just it's not


---------07:41----------
because i'm


---------07:43----------
someone who's so just who sticks out so


---------07:46----------
much but people just


---------07:47----------
want to know me it's more like i just


---------07:49----------
get to know other people and then they


---------07:50----------
eventually


---------07:51----------
just know know me because of that like


---------07:54----------
yeah


---------07:55----------
and it's just something that i i feel


---------07:59----------
like i have a little bit


---------08:00----------
i have it's like the only thing that i


---------08:02----------
have proud like pride over


---------08:03----------
the fact that i can understand and


---------08:07----------
get along with like pretty much anyone


---------08:09----------
um i have a very uh


---------08:12----------
wide set of friends uh i it goes from


---------08:15----------
like [ __ ] posters on the internet to um


---------08:19----------
people who i've been studying with in my


---------08:21----------
university to also people who are like


---------08:23----------
basically bottom of a society um


---------08:26----------
in terms of like sure


---------08:29----------
like here just from being infamous like


---------08:31----------
they're not bad people and it's just


---------08:34----------
uh it's hard to explain like it's good


---------08:37----------
people in bad positions i would say


---------08:39----------
okay so doc let me ask you a question so


---------08:41----------
what i heard you just described as sort


---------08:43----------
of like


---------08:44----------
an assessment that you're pretty good


---------08:46----------
socially i'm confused about what that


---------08:48----------
has to do with being a narcissist who


---------08:50----------
hates himself


---------08:52----------
um i guess i've been trying to tiptoe


---------08:54----------
around it but i also sometimes feel like


---------08:56----------
um


---------08:58----------
um at least in that type of like


---------09:01----------
intelligence um


---------09:02----------
because i believe there's many types of


---------09:04----------
it if it makes sense uh


---------09:05----------
i think that i'm one of one of the best


---------09:09----------
and the only people who managed to


---------09:10----------
become like my very consistent and best


---------09:12----------
friends are also


---------09:14----------
similar in that regard and


---------09:18----------
i guess to if i wanted to describe it in


---------09:20----------
like a way that


---------09:21----------
seems more logical maybe to people who


---------09:23----------
can't relate or


---------09:25----------
it would be something like sometimes


---------09:26----------
life feels like um


---------09:28----------
it's like watching a movie and everybody


---------09:31----------
else leaves before


---------09:32----------
after like the ads are over and when the


---------09:34----------
movie actually starts people are


---------09:36----------
starting to leave and talking about how


---------09:37----------
good the movie was and i'm the only one


---------09:38----------
like actually


---------09:40----------
me and like some other people obviously


---------09:42----------
but very few people are actually like


---------09:44----------
watching the movie that we were


---------09:46----------
that we came here for if that makes


---------09:47----------
sense okay so


---------09:49----------
so i i'm gonna i'm gonna try to cap so


---------09:52----------
you use the word narcissist but


---------09:54----------
what i'm sort of hearing is like a lot


---------09:56----------
of people in life are plebs


---------09:59----------
[Laughter]


---------10:03----------
and and so is that is that what so


---------10:05----------
having that


---------10:06----------
idea is why you you recogni that's what


---------10:09----------
you describe


---------10:10----------
when you call yourself a narcissist is


---------10:12----------
it that attitude


---------10:14----------
that you're talking yeah sort of like


---------10:15----------
yeah i know that's not like actual


---------10:17----------
on the paper narcissism but it's just


---------10:19----------
like i don't know how to describe it


---------10:20----------
yeah i i get you okay so we can talk


---------10:24----------
about other people being plebs


---------10:26----------
oh okay but not in like a derogatory way


---------10:29----------
i still i can still love a club if it


---------10:31----------
makes it


---------10:31----------
i i i i get you you know you can you can


---------10:34----------
be


---------10:35----------
compassionate and respect the plebs but


---------10:37----------
there's still plebs


---------10:40----------
right yeah pretty much yeah


---------10:44----------
i mean you could be on the challenger


---------10:46----------
league and you can


---------10:47----------
you know pat those silver tear fighters


---------10:50----------
on the head


---------10:52----------
they're still silver right like it's


---------10:54----------
they're not less human than you are they


---------10:55----------
just happen to be silver


---------10:57----------
yeah and it's like i guess but that's a


---------11:00----------
really good example because like it


---------11:01----------
feels like i really am like


---------11:02----------
this challenger player who doesn't


---------11:04----------
really have anything to do with q times


---------11:05----------
are long


---------11:06----------
games aren't fun it's always the same so


---------11:09----------
i'm going down


---------11:09----------
so i'm making a smurf account that


---------11:11----------
helping like a fixed amount of people


---------11:12----------
trying to go up


---------11:14----------
yeah i mean no wonder it sounds like


---------11:16----------
you're living life in the third person


---------11:19----------
it's like but it's also because it's


---------11:20----------
like it really does feel like it's the


---------11:22----------
only thing really


---------11:24----------
that's really fun for me anymore yeah i


---------11:27----------
mean it


---------11:28----------
kind of makes sense so like i know we're


---------11:29----------
kind of going into the law analogies


---------11:31----------
here but if you really think about it


---------11:32----------
like


---------11:33----------
if i'm a challenger lover player playing


---------11:35----------
in like silver


---------11:36----------
let's say silver is a thing in law right


---------11:38----------
because yeah there's yeah


---------11:39----------
yeah so like and if you think about it


---------11:41----------
like how much fun could i have being an


---------11:44----------
adc


---------11:44----------
if i'm a challenger level player playing


---------11:46----------
in silver it's like completely boring


---------11:48----------
if you also kind of think about it what


---------11:50----------
would be more fun would be like a yumi


---------11:52----------
support right where it's like


---------11:56----------
like there's just no point in playing


---------11:58----------
this game


---------12:00----------
if i'm like trying to play but like at


---------12:02----------
least i can get some enjoyment like


---------12:04----------
if you think about it i mean sometimes


---------12:05----------
i'll i'll play with you know dota


---------12:06----------
players who are like


---------12:08----------
very good and whenever they play


---------12:11----------
you know with me like they love playing


---------12:13----------
sport


---------12:14----------
like because it's just it's a waste of


---------12:18----------
everyone's time if they play


---------12:21----------
mid or carry but like with support


---------12:25----------
they can run around and like cheer me on


---------12:27----------
and they have a lot of fun when


---------12:29----------
i do well exactly you know yeah


---------12:34----------
maybe everything in everything in life


---------12:36----------
can be learned from wall maybe that's


---------12:37----------
the takeaway


---------12:39----------
yeah pretty much so but help me


---------12:42----------
understand the hates himself part


---------12:44----------
i i get the i get the arrogance


---------12:47----------
all right that one's um it's a bit more


---------12:50----------
complicated and i think it would make a


---------12:51----------
little bit more sense once uh


---------12:53----------
i've i've told a little bit about like


---------12:55----------
my past but in a way


---------12:56----------
this one's um like a mixed part it's


---------13:00----------
most but i think it's mostly this is


---------13:01----------
just me guessing because


---------13:03----------
honestly this is something that i can't


---------13:05----------
really tell for sure why it is the way


---------13:07----------
it is


---------13:08----------
um but i've had a major glow up in life


---------13:12----------
i used to be very um unattractive inside


---------13:15----------
and outside


---------13:16----------
was a very weird person to be honest


---------13:20----------
it's hard to explain but


---------13:23----------
for a while it felt like um especially


---------13:25----------
like


---------13:26----------
middle school and beginning of high


---------13:28----------
school like


---------13:30----------
there was nothing i could do to make


---------13:32----------
people like me if it makes sense


---------13:34----------
and this is a this is something that i


---------13:37----------
had to combat by uh essentially copying


---------13:41----------
normies


---------13:42----------
let me like to put it like very uh


---------13:47----------
simple it's something that i i just kind


---------13:50----------
of


---------13:50----------
uh started to copy my best friend at the


---------13:54----------
time who


---------13:54----------
was only my friend because he lived in


---------13:56----------
the same house and like he felt like he


---------13:58----------
had to be my friend


---------13:59----------
but he was very popular and he was


---------14:02----------
someone who


---------14:03----------
really helped me out just by telling him


---------14:06----------
just by showing me like


---------14:08----------
how to how to not be the type of person


---------14:11----------
who for example can't understand that


---------14:14----------
everything i like doesn't necessarily


---------14:15----------
have to be something that everyone likes


---------14:18----------
and i think that's what it was because


---------14:20----------
uh


---------14:21----------
because of my like perception that


---------14:23----------
everything that i like must be something


---------14:25----------
that's


---------14:26----------
uh so high up in quality that everyone


---------14:28----------
would like it even if i


---------14:29----------
even if i have no clue what it is um


---------14:32----------
but i grew to be a very annoying person


---------14:35----------
which then was also paired with um


---------14:38----------
what i at first actually thought was


---------14:40----------
probably racist because i lived in a


---------14:42----------
village where


---------14:42----------
like i lived in a small town small


---------14:44----------
village where


---------14:45----------
people were not actually like no one


---------14:49----------
knew really like really knew people who


---------14:50----------
had my type of complexion i would say


---------14:53----------
um which later then turned out not to be


---------14:56----------
true because it was actually just rumors


---------14:58----------
about my mom


---------14:59----------
that led to that kind of situation uh


---------15:01----------
because people were telling their


---------15:02----------
children not to play with me at first


---------15:04----------
and it just


---------15:04----------
devolved into more and more not hate but


---------15:08----------
like dislike i was very cringe


---------15:14----------
wait people were telling that


---------15:17----------
like people were their parents but their


---------15:19----------
parents were telling their kids not to


---------15:20----------
talk to me


---------15:21----------
um just like when i was in like


---------15:23----------
elementary school too


---------15:24----------
and just these are the same people i was


---------15:27----------
with in elementary school were always in


---------15:28----------
my class up until like


---------15:30----------
beginning of high school and this type


---------15:33----------
of like


---------15:33----------
not bullying but just excluding made me


---------15:36----------
feel like there's nothing about me


---------15:37----------
that's interesting enough to


---------15:39----------
ever make like any meaningful


---------15:40----------
connections uh aside from my family


---------15:43----------
which even there was it was really hard


---------15:46----------
um


---------15:48----------
can you tell me and it's just really oh


---------15:50----------
yeah can you tell me a little bit about


---------15:52----------
your family


---------15:54----------
sure that's like that's an entire thing


---------15:57----------
to unpack


---------15:59----------
um so do you want me to just go in


---------16:02----------
chronological order just tell me to tell


---------16:04----------
you about what my money's like right now


---------16:06----------
okay so


---------16:07----------
i can just talk about my family life i


---------16:09----------
think um


---------16:11----------
i have i was brought up by my single


---------16:14----------
mother at first


---------16:15----------
um because my biological father


---------16:18----------
who i hope isn't watching um


---------16:22----------
he he basically bailed the moment that


---------16:25----------
i was born or ever yeah that's pretty


---------16:28----------
much it i was an anchor baby


---------16:30----------
why do you hope that he's not watching


---------16:33----------
because i it's


---------16:36----------
hard to explain at first i thought i


---------16:37----------
hated him because that's just like


---------16:39----------
but that's like basically indoctrination


---------16:42----------
from my mom because she didn't like him


---------16:43----------
and she just kept telling me to


---------16:45----------
but i wasn't supposed to like him


---------16:47----------
nowadays it's more like


---------16:48----------
i actually really do dislike him just


---------16:50----------
for the fact that he


---------16:52----------
basically left me out and just left me


---------16:54----------
um but at the same time it's more like


---------16:56----------
the fact that


---------16:58----------
that i know what type of person he is


---------16:59----------
he's someone who


---------17:01----------
um which is this is not an ambition of


---------17:04----------
guilt just in case uh he's someone who


---------17:06----------
i've heard


---------17:06----------
he's uh deals drugs in a major city in


---------17:08----------
germany right now or


---------17:10----------
might be dead by by all but i know i


---------17:12----------
don't know


---------17:13----------
um and he was someone who's never


---------17:16----------
contacted me and contacted me ever in my


---------17:18----------
life other than when he actually needed


---------17:20----------
something from me


---------17:21----------
for example he um just to put things in


---------17:24----------
perspective my mother was german


---------17:27----------
this probably also answered a few


---------17:28----------
questions about my accent


---------17:31----------
but also my biological father he was uh


---------17:34----------
moroccan


---------17:35----------
and he used me or my mom rather to make


---------17:38----------
an anchor baby


---------17:39----------
and just come to germany um using that


---------17:42----------
i see and yeah trying to live the high


---------17:45----------
life right


---------17:46----------
and um yeah he was uh


---------17:50----------
this is just the type of person he is he


---------17:52----------
did that he did


---------17:53----------
similar things a lot like uh when i


---------17:56----------
turned 18


---------17:57----------
um apparently he was like just about to


---------17:59----------
be thrown out of germany


---------18:01----------
i don't know why he had he was about to


---------18:03----------
have his papers taken


---------18:05----------
so suddenly he started texting me again


---------18:08----------
and asking he was playing up a big game


---------18:12----------
he was telling me how


---------18:13----------
i was his only son that mattered he has


---------18:15----------
a lot of sons by the way


---------18:17----------
but i'm the only one that matters and um


---------18:21----------
he really wanted to connect with me


---------18:23----------
again and he misses me and


---------18:25----------
that kept on for like weeks and how did


---------18:28----------
you honestly i didn't buy it


---------18:30----------
i didn't buy it i was just annoyed to be


---------18:32----------
honest because at that point i was just


---------18:33----------
like i don't really


---------18:34----------
want to know him now because as much as


---------18:37----------
blood can


---------18:38----------
can be thicker than water in that one


---------18:40----------
instance i just thought it's been 18


---------18:41----------
years


---------18:43----------
this dude's just a stranger to me now


---------18:45----------
like he can't be my father no matter


---------18:47----------
what he does he's


---------18:47----------
he's always just going to be a stranger


---------18:49----------
the same way that any stepfather would


---------18:51----------
be


---------18:51----------
that makes sense because i don't know


---------18:53----------
him


---------18:54----------
and um yeah so when when that all went


---------18:58----------
down i was just kind of annoyed that my


---------19:00----------
mom was


---------19:00----------
for some reason also trying to enable it


---------19:03----------
even though she


---------19:04----------
herself was like the reason i disliked


---------19:05----------
him at first and didn't try to seek him


---------19:08----------
out


---------19:08----------
so she was trying to patch things up


---------19:09----------
between y'all uh i think she was just


---------19:12----------
receiving money from him to be honest um


---------19:15----------
as i said before he may or may not have


---------19:17----------
been dealing in drugs and have


---------19:18----------
made has probably made a lot of money


---------19:21----------
under the table


---------19:22----------
and he used that to like try to get to


---------19:25----------
me um sent me a lot of gifts


---------19:27----------
uh asked me what i wanted to have stuff


---------19:29----------
like that when we actually met up in


---------19:31----------
real life which


---------19:31----------
happened like a few weeks after albert


---------19:33----------
trying to get in contact


---------19:34----------
he gave me like a [ __ ] ton of money just


---------19:38----------
just in my hand right just and you


---------19:41----------
really thought it was going to work


---------19:43----------
and i guess it did for what he wanted to


---------19:45----------
achieve because


---------19:46----------
the same day that i met him for the


---------19:47----------
first time in 18 years


---------19:50----------
so it's also the day that he dragged me


---------19:51----------
to the town hall and


---------19:53----------
made me tell some people in the bureau


---------19:55----------
that uh he i


---------19:56----------
invented i'm his son and i actually need


---------19:58----------
him still and


---------20:00----------
because i did that that's why he never


---------20:02----------
got like shoved off to another country


---------20:05----------
so that's like the only reason you


---------20:06----------
really tried to like um engage with me


---------20:08----------
again


---------20:09----------
right and after that yeah and after that


---------20:12----------
i never really got to hear from him


---------20:13----------
again


---------20:13----------
like at first i think because he felt a


---------20:16----------
little bit bad about it but


---------20:18----------
it was noted noticeably less and after a


---------20:21----------
while he stopped texting me all together


---------20:22----------
again


---------20:25----------
and uh yeah that's the type of person he


---------20:27----------
was um and in the meantime


---------20:29----------
since he was not my only father figure


---------20:33----------
this is the wrong word to call it i


---------20:36----------
didn't really have father figures aside


---------20:38----------
from like my grandpa who was very


---------20:40----------
he loved me very much but in a way that


---------20:43----------
someone would love his dog if that makes


---------20:44----------
sense like


---------20:45----------
he didn't love me for who i was but just


---------20:46----------
the fact that i was if that makes sense


---------20:48----------
like


---------20:49----------
he showered me in gifts and stuff but


---------20:50----------
it's not really something that you could


---------20:51----------
call


---------20:52----------
raising someone i love him very much


---------20:54----------
like it's not something that i would


---------20:56----------
hold against him i don't i don't just


---------20:58----------
don't think that he knows any other way


---------20:59----------
to like care for people


---------21:02----------
yes so if i can just try to understand


---------21:05----------
that so it sounds like your grandfather


---------21:08----------
loved you the way that a grandfather


---------21:10----------
loves a grandson


---------21:11----------
as opposed to loving you for being you


---------21:15----------
exactly um but i do believe that like


---------21:18----------
i have a very special player placed on


---------21:19----------
his heart and he doesn't have a special


---------21:21----------
place in my heart too like


---------21:22----------
but maybe he doesn't really know who you


---------21:24----------
are exactly it's more yeah it's more


---------21:26----------
like he doesn't know how to find out who


---------21:28----------
i am or who anyone


---------21:30----------
is for that matter he's he's sort of


---------21:32----------
he's just


---------21:33----------
the type of person who's just really


---------21:34----------
old-fashioned and superficial


---------21:37----------
um like he likes people who do what he


---------21:40----------
says basically that's a


---------21:42----------
that's a good way to call it yeah um


---------21:45----------
so he's he um


---------21:49----------
but i'm basically um now talking back


---------21:51----------
like going going back to my mom


---------21:53----------
she was a single mom obviously and um


---------21:57----------
she however was someone who


---------22:01----------
um despite being over 40 like


---------22:05----------
at the end of her lifespan she was very


---------22:08----------
i would say energetic and she behaved


---------22:11----------
like someone who was still like in


---------22:12----------
in puberty she was like always 16 at


---------22:15----------
height ever since i've known her


---------22:16----------
seriously and um


---------22:20----------
that's something that can be charming


---------22:21----------
but can also be very exhausting


---------22:23----------
especially when you're a kid


---------22:25----------
that feels like you have to basically


---------22:27----------
educate your own mom on stuff if that


---------22:29----------
makes sense i always felt like i was


---------22:30----------
repaired


---------22:31----------
um maybe some people can relate i i bet


---------22:34----------
some people can


---------22:36----------
um can you give me an example of of what


---------22:38----------
that looked like


---------22:41----------
um complete naivete and just


---------22:44----------
complete naivete like she was someone


---------22:46----------
who


---------22:47----------
had lots of husbands in her in her


---------22:50----------
lifetime


---------22:50----------
i would say always the same type of


---------22:53----------
person


---------22:54----------
and she just would never learn from her


---------22:56----------
mistakes


---------22:57----------
in that regard um


---------23:03----------
same type of person my father was


---------23:05----------
someone who just used her for like


---------23:08----------
just to like get to germany basically or


---------23:10----------
for any other man


---------23:11----------
like any other means to just get some


---------23:12----------
sort of um


---------23:15----------
benefit out of you and also for a


---------23:16----------
relationship we would all marry her for


---------23:18----------
paying for


---------23:19----------
a visa for money stuff like that


---------23:24----------
um weirdly enough always people from the


---------23:26----------
same family as my father


---------23:29----------
almost always that's very weird


---------23:33----------
thank you son um


---------23:37----------
it really was weird like uh you see even


---------23:40----------
like


---------23:40----------
i'm my real name it's actually


---------23:44----------
the name of my biological father's


---------23:46----------
brother so that's like the type of


---------23:48----------
person


---------23:48----------
i'm not the type of family but i'm that


---------23:50----------
i used to live and it was really weird


---------23:52----------
and basically


---------23:56----------
they were all in my opinion very bad


---------23:57----------
people which is also i don't want them


---------23:59----------
to see this


---------24:00----------
but they probably won't they can't speak


---------24:02----------
english um


---------24:05----------
yeah but um this all kind of


---------24:09----------
so can you tell us all kind of let you


---------24:11----------
yeah oh sorry go ahead


---------24:14----------
i was just led to like a childhood where


---------24:16----------
i had like a very


---------24:18----------
a very inconsistent concept of what home


---------24:21----------
is if that makes sense um


---------24:23----------
i used to live with my mother for don't


---------24:26----------
be like eight years stuff like that um


---------24:29----------
and at some point um


---------24:32----------
i think at that point i had two


---------24:34----------
different stepfathers already


---------24:36----------
one of them was like neutral the other


---------24:38----------
one was really bad really


---------24:40----------
i i like i get to see them fight every


---------24:42----------
single day luckily not nothing physical


---------24:46----------
but it was just something that i've seen


---------24:47----------
every single day


---------24:49----------
and at some point in life she also


---------24:52----------
figured that she


---------24:53----------
wants to live like she wants to live her


---------24:55----------
own life she doesn't really want to live


---------24:56----------
for her children


---------24:57----------
that makes sense so she shoved me off to


---------24:59----------
my grandparents which is also why i'm


---------25:01----------
saying that my grandpa


---------25:02----------
really um was like the only father


---------25:04----------
figure that i had


---------25:05----------
for a while because um


---------25:09----------
i was raised there like with my


---------25:10----------
grandparents for like half my life at


---------25:12----------
least and now i'm here again


---------25:14----------
grandpa is still upstairs um


---------25:17----------
yeah and at some point like after being


---------25:21----------
with my grandparents for a while but


---------25:22----------
that was something that i could call my


---------25:25----------
like my actual home


---------25:27----------
but one day um that's when i like around


---------25:29----------
the time that my little sister got


---------25:31----------
gotten around to maybe six years old


---------25:34----------
that's when um the child protective


---------25:37----------
services are


---------25:38----------
some no actually no um just basically


---------25:41----------
just uh


---------25:42----------
the town in general just came up to my


---------25:44----------
mom and asked her


---------25:45----------
whether i'm still living with her or not


---------25:48----------
and


---------25:49----------
they figured that i wasn't so we


---------25:51----------
basically threatened her that if


---------25:53----------
i wasn't coming back to uh to her place


---------25:56----------
they would cut the um picture what's it


---------25:59----------
called like just we


---------26:00----------
in germany we get money for having


---------26:01----------
children basically sure yeah


---------26:03----------
um i don't know what it's called sorry


---------26:05----------
but um


---------26:07----------
yeah but since you didn't want to miss


---------26:08----------
out on that money which she didn't give


---------26:10----------
to my grandparents either


---------26:11----------
like she was just kind of living off of


---------26:13----------
that


---------26:14----------
um she figured that i'd have to come


---------26:16----------
back and after that things were really


---------26:19----------
awkward to be honest because like


---------26:21----------
i've been i've been living somewhere


---------26:22----------
else for six years i didn't really


---------26:25----------
trust in my mom uh i was


---------26:28----------
12 13 something when you came back


---------26:31----------
yeah okay so you spent like 6 to 12 with


---------26:34----------
your grandparents


---------26:36----------
exactly um


---------26:39----------
and when i came back it was just


---------26:41----------
extremely awkward because i


---------26:43----------
i didn't i didn't really connect well


---------26:45----------
with my sister yet and like


---------26:46----------
she was just a stranger to me to be


---------26:48----------
honest at that point


---------26:49----------
but your sister was staying with your


---------26:51----------
mom yeah exactly because my mom always


---------26:54----------
wished for


---------26:54----------
like my mom always wished for a daughter


---------26:56----------
so that was like


---------26:58----------
that's like the main reason she stayed


---------27:00----------
with her because like my big brother was


---------27:01----------
also chef to my grandparents at some


---------27:04----------
point


---------27:06----------
and um yeah um when i was there


---------27:10----------
things just immediately went kind of


---------27:13----------
hayward


---------27:14----------
haywire again because uh as i said


---------27:16----------
before she had a lot of like


---------27:18----------
i had a lot of stepfathers and none of


---------27:21----------
them


---------27:21----------
were good except for the last one to


---------27:24----------
some degree


---------27:24----------
but i'm gonna get to that um


---------27:28----------
it's always been like i was always


---------27:30----------
afraid that they


---------27:31----------
like they were bad people to such an


---------27:33----------
extent that i was scared that they would


---------27:34----------
touch my little sister when i'm not


---------27:36----------
around sort of


---------27:37----------
like that's how bad they were sometimes


---------27:39----------
um


---------27:40----------
you talk it says not many people wanted


---------27:43----------
you


---------27:44----------
yeah they didn't and i can't even fault


---------27:48----------
them


---------27:48----------
which is also like this plays also into


---------27:50----------
like


---------27:51----------
my um self-hatred two way because i feel


---------27:54----------
like


---------27:54----------
in a way i've just messed that up and


---------27:56----------
i'm still that person i'm still someone


---------27:58----------
who people don't want


---------27:59----------
and now i'm playing this character or


---------28:02----------
it's not even a character because like i


---------28:04----------
don't think i'm


---------28:04----------
acting like in a way that's like fixed


---------28:07----------
but rather


---------28:09----------
uh depending on who i'm in front of it's


---------28:11----------
just like a matter of role taking if


---------28:13----------
that makes sense like


---------28:14----------
i i'll be the mirror that reflects


---------28:17----------
someone the best way


---------28:18----------
possible or i try to be at least like i


---------28:20----------
want people to just be comfortable


---------28:21----------
around me


---------28:23----------
and so i'll act accordingly sounds like


---------28:26----------
you're a chameleon


---------28:28----------
yeah pretty much um but i


---------28:31----------
i think i have like a few car like a few


---------28:34----------
car


---------28:35----------
um things about my personality that


---------28:37----------
don't change um


---------28:38----------
but mostly yeah that's what i am a


---------28:41----------
crypto savant


---------28:43----------
exactly um


---------28:47----------
no but uh yeah people really didn't want


---------28:50----------
me back then


---------28:51----------
um especially like any like anything


---------28:54----------
outside of a realm of like my


---------28:55----------
grandfather


---------28:56----------
a grand grandparent's house that's


---------28:58----------
everything that's everything that didn't


---------28:59----------
want me


---------29:00----------
uh school teachers my my own mother uh


---------29:03----------
my


---------29:04----------
my real my real father stuff like that


---------29:06----------
they all didn't really want me around


---------29:08----------
um not necessarily oh sure um


---------29:12----------
this is actually like a mixed product i


---------29:13----------
said background because like i had


---------29:15----------
many teachers who were very nice to me


---------29:17----------
but the thing is i think it's


---------29:19----------
probably a natural thing in people to


---------29:20----------
always like


---------29:22----------
have the worst stuff that happened to


---------29:23----------
you more in mind than the rest um


---------29:25----------
and for every uh i don't know if every


---------29:28----------
five teachers were very good to me there


---------29:29----------
was one teacher who would bully me in


---------29:30----------
front of a tire in front of a class


---------29:33----------
at some point that was even um the


---------29:36----------
school rector that was like the worst


---------29:38----------
time of my life in a way because


---------29:40----------
that person made me um fail fail class


---------29:43----------
like


---------29:43----------
i actually had to repeat one class even


---------29:45----------
though i had a really good like


---------29:47----------
i had a really i had really good results


---------29:49----------
at the end of at the end of the semester


---------29:51----------
thing was that she just gave me an f and


---------29:53----------
one course in the germany it's like this


---------29:54----------
if you have an f


---------29:55----------
and you're like final results when you


---------29:57----------
just don't get to um


---------29:59----------
progress to the next class why didn't


---------30:01----------
you


---------30:02----------
get failed do you know um


---------30:05----------
and ironically because she didn't like


---------30:07----------
me and uh


---------30:08----------
stuff like that happened with her all


---------30:10----------
the time to the point where she actually


---------30:11----------
got like demoted like she's not in that


---------30:13----------
school anymore


---------30:14----------
it's like she's been in the papers for


---------30:15----------
her and that was really just me being


---------30:17----------
unlucky like she


---------30:18----------
didn't really have a reason to dislike


---------30:20----------
me she was just the type of person who


---------30:21----------
would like single someone


---------30:22----------
just be so that sounds like it was just


---------30:25----------
bad luck


---------30:26----------
yeah pretty much because like it's


---------30:28----------
really weird because like


---------30:29----------
three years after that i got into the


---------30:31----------
same class again and she had it and she


---------30:33----------
ended up having a headphone on someone


---------30:34----------
completely different and


---------30:36----------
that time i i got i got off from


---------30:38----------
scottsdale nothing


---------30:39----------
happened interesting okay


---------30:43----------
yeah but um so i had a few teachers


---------30:46----------
oh go ahead sorry please i had a few


---------30:49----------
teachers who would


---------30:50----------
very deliberately um make me do things


---------30:53----------
that they knew


---------30:53----------
the entire class would make fun of me


---------30:55----------
for um


---------30:57----------
especially like uh just i don't know


---------31:00----------
like


---------31:00----------
it goes from like simple stuff like


---------31:03----------
asking me stuff that they knew


---------31:04----------
i wouldn't i wasn't gonna know to


---------31:07----------
literally bringing up like my


---------31:08----------
entire like family relations uh in front


---------31:11----------
of a whole class just to


---------31:12----------
make fun of it sort of like it was


---------31:15----------
really weird


---------31:17----------
what would they say it was um for


---------31:20----------
example i had like a really bad fight


---------31:22----------
with my mom at the time and he'd just


---------31:24----------
bring it up and


---------31:25----------
asked me how i couldn't have how i could


---------31:27----------
be disappointing to someone who and then


---------31:29----------
he mentioned something that my mom was


---------31:30----------
very famous for


---------31:32----------
um in relation to like me having a lot


---------31:35----------
of stepfathers that brings like


---------31:37----------
a lot of infamy with it right okay so


---------31:39----------
yeah


---------31:42----------
not like he was not a very nice person


---------31:44----------
and that guy's like


---------31:46----------
i don't know that guy is like still in


---------31:48----------
my brain i don't think that's


---------31:49----------
ever gonna leave for some reason it's


---------31:52----------
just like


---------31:52----------
it felt really unfair at the time


---------31:54----------
because i felt like i really i had no


---------31:56----------
chance to even if i was a normal person


---------31:58----------
if that makes sense i don't think i


---------31:59----------
would have made friends


---------32:00----------
at the time um


---------32:03----------
but yeah when that when you say that


---------32:05----------
person is still in your brain


---------32:07----------
that sounds awful and also what what


---------32:10----------
space do they occupy in their mind in


---------32:12----------
your mind in what way are they still in


---------32:14----------
your brain


---------32:15----------
i think there's like an entire half of


---------32:17----------
my psyche that's like dedicated to like


---------32:19----------
in


---------32:20----------
weirdly enough uh it's like the most


---------32:22----------
dramatic thing for me even though


---------32:23----------
on paper there's much worse stuff that's


---------32:26----------
i'm still going to tell you


---------32:28----------
but the bullying uh it just made me feel


---------32:30----------
like there really was


---------32:31----------
nothing and no one who would ever really


---------32:34----------
gonna who's


---------32:35----------
ever really gonna love me for who i am


---------32:37----------
instead of just what i am which is for


---------32:38----------
example a grandson if that makes


---------32:41----------
but um it's like till this day now i'm


---------32:45----------
very popular where i live


---------32:47----------
um and still when i walk around


---------32:49----------
somewhere i feel like when people are


---------32:50----------
laughing i


---------32:51----------
i always feel like it's probably


---------32:52----------
something about me because people used


---------32:53----------
to make fun of like the most mundane


---------32:55----------
things about me


---------32:56----------
the way i drink water the way i walk


---------32:58----------
like stuff like that


---------32:59----------
and that just makes you feel like


---------33:01----------
there's really nothing that


---------33:03----------
you can do that feels normal all right


---------33:07----------
and now it's like this half of my brain


---------33:09----------
that i know isn't real anymore


---------33:11----------
like it's i often call i like to call it


---------33:14----------
um


---------33:15----------
logic against behind like my heart's


---------33:17----------
telling me this


---------33:18----------
like people are still um people still


---------33:20----------
feel this way about me but my brain


---------33:22----------
knows it's not that way


---------33:23----------
sure sure i'm noticing you


---------33:27----------
you laugh a lot yeah it's because uh


---------33:31----------
i am like i'm starting to realize now


---------33:33----------
that i'm probably at the point where


---------33:34----------
i've been telling like a lot of stuff


---------33:35----------
that's


---------33:36----------
really bad and i'm not showing the


---------33:38----------
emotional


---------33:39----------
um i don't know like i don't i feel like


---------33:42----------
i'm not showing like an


---------33:44----------
emotional response that's fitting if


---------33:45----------
that makes sense


---------33:48----------
and also it's something that i just


---------33:50----------
someone just said coping humor


---------33:52----------
in uh in the chat which is no reading


---------33:54----------
twitch


---------33:55----------
sorry i'm really sorry no reading


---------33:58----------
chat quiet okay


---------34:02----------
i once just asked


---------34:05----------
yeah i got it forward now but um


---------34:09----------
basically uh for me it's something that


---------34:12----------
this is going to sound weird i have an


---------34:14----------
uncle who's very very very like


---------34:17----------
he's suffering a lot from bpd


---------34:20----------
and he's one of her only like


---------34:23----------
people i know who are like very


---------34:24----------
genuinely kind and nice but he's


---------34:26----------
got a really bad problem which is he


---------34:28----------
alien alienates people all the time


---------34:30----------
by basically talking about his tragedies


---------34:34----------
in a way that


---------34:36----------
makes people feel like they have to say


---------34:37----------
something to it like they have to


---------34:38----------
console him


---------34:39----------
and i think in my opinion um people who


---------34:42----------
have that sort of negative


---------34:43----------
energy around them like all the time


---------34:45----------
like if it's really very


---------34:47----------
consistent um people have a problem with


---------34:51----------
actually


---------34:52----------
connecting to that person anymore like


---------34:54----------
they don't really want to be around that


---------34:55----------
person anymore and i like to be


---------34:56----------
recycled type of person who's


---------34:58----------
comfortable to be around


---------35:00----------
and so i don't like to have and so i


---------35:01----------
don't even if i were to


---------35:03----------
still feel like overly emotional i feel


---------35:05----------
like i would still try to mask that


---------35:07----------
because i want people to feel like i'm


---------35:09----------
just telling them a story and they don't


---------35:11----------
really have to


---------35:12----------
like pat my back and be like oh i'm so


---------35:14----------
sorry for you


---------35:15----------
because i know it's gonna make them feel


---------35:17----------
bad too like it's because especially


---------35:19----------
because of the things that i do tell


---------35:20----------
people i think it's something that most


---------35:22----------
people just don't know how to respond to


---------35:24----------
yeah at all so what i'm hearing is that


---------35:31----------
so i'm hearing that you have an uncle


---------35:33----------
who manipulates people into being


---------35:35----------
compassionate and caring


---------35:38----------
very true yes and you will be damned


---------35:41----------
if you manipulate people into doing the


---------35:43----------
same thing


---------35:44----------
exactly it's just uh for him it's like


---------35:48----------
his saving grace is that he


---------35:50----------
himself is as caring and as


---------35:52----------
compassionate as he wants everest to be


---------35:53----------
like


---------35:54----------
he's he's at least doing that like


---------35:57----------
back to people and he's very much like


---------35:59----------
if he loves someone he would do anything


---------36:00----------
for them sure


---------36:02----------
but he's very egocentric i would say in


---------36:04----------
the way that uh


---------36:06----------
um i'm probably front running like what


---------36:09----------
i'm about to tell but


---------36:10----------
i was gonna eventually tell you about


---------36:13----------
how my mom was murdered


---------36:14----------
and uh i had to like i watched it


---------36:17----------
i was there for it and my


---------36:21----------
uncle uh somehow had this idea in mind


---------36:24----------
that he had it worse than


---------36:26----------
me for example which i feel like if he


---------36:28----------
had told that to anyone else they would


---------36:30----------
have probably snapped at him


---------36:31----------
i wasn't really angry because i know


---------36:33----------
what's going on in his mind but like


---------36:35----------
i can i can see how this sort of


---------36:38----------
behavior can


---------36:38----------
probably piss off a lot of people if


---------36:40----------
that makes sense and he's


---------36:42----------
alienated like all of his real life


---------36:43----------
friends just from doing that


---------36:49----------
but yeah it's like


---------36:52----------
i try to be the type of person who


---------36:55----------
if i do decide to tell someone stuff i


---------36:57----------
don't want them to feel like


---------36:59----------
they have to react in a certain


---------37:02----------
in some specific way they don't have to


---------37:04----------
tell me anything if i'm telling it i


---------37:05----------
want it to be like i'm just


---------37:07----------
telling an interesting story okay sad


---------37:10----------
but interesting


---------37:12----------
i'm confused about how to react to you


---------37:16----------
sharing that your mother was murdered


---------37:19----------
um yeah it's uh it's i think that's


---------37:22----------
everyone that's part of it


---------37:25----------
um it for me it's very like a


---------37:27----------
conflicting thing because


---------37:29----------
as you can probably as you've probably


---------37:30----------
picked up my especially like my early


---------37:32----------
lifetime with her


---------37:34----------
not a very good experience um not


---------37:36----------
necessarily horrible but also not


---------37:38----------
very good and i always felt like i


---------37:42----------
wasn't really like


---------37:43----------
an important part of her life especially


---------37:45----------
during that time


---------37:47----------
um but as i said before she had a lot of


---------37:49----------
like she


---------37:50----------
she married a lot um and people really


---------37:53----------
did think that she was just someone


---------37:54----------
who's very


---------37:56----------
easy to have um to say very


---------37:59----------
and then to put it in like the most


---------38:01----------
positive life but i can


---------38:02----------
however um she really was in love with


---------38:05----------
her people that she


---------38:07----------
married she was just really um she was


---------38:09----------
just really


---------38:10----------
unfortunate in the way she picked people


---------38:13----------
and um so they would always like end up


---------38:16----------
breaking up with her


---------38:17----------
before she even like was ready for it


---------38:19----------
herself and it gave her something that


---------38:22----------
i don't know it changed her in the to a


---------38:25----------
degree where she was


---------38:26----------
extremely jealous um in the most unlike


---------38:30----------
i don't know it was really unhealthy to


---------38:31----------
see even to see and to witness but


---------38:34----------
i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to


---------38:36----------
have been like her married partner even


---------38:38----------
if


---------38:39----------
even if she i was someone who wasn't her


---------38:41----------
because she was like very


---------38:43----------
i don't know she was so jealous but it


---------38:44----------
really felt like there was nothing you


---------38:46----------
could do to please her


---------38:47----------
and when my last stepfather came around


---------38:50----------
that person was a very nice man


---------38:53----------
in my opinion he was a very nice man at


---------38:55----------
first for example


---------38:57----------
she he was someone that actually was


---------39:00----------
completely outside of the


---------39:01----------
um how do you say that completely like


---------39:05----------
outside of what she usually looked for


---------39:06----------
in men


---------39:07----------
very complete like a very different man


---------39:10----------
actually like someone who's integrated


---------39:11----------
into society


---------39:13----------
someone who works alone like someone who


---------39:15----------
wanted to work instead of just sitting


---------39:16----------
and sit and sit at home and drink and


---------39:18----------
talk to underage people on chatterbait


---------39:20----------
or whatever whatever


---------39:22----------
chad roulette i think and


---------39:27----------
just someone who felt like he was a


---------39:29----------
normal person like someone that


---------39:32----------
as weird as business to say um


---------39:35----------
that was like around the time where i


---------39:36----------
actually had friends


---------39:38----------
and meeting other families was like


---------39:41----------
complete whiplash for me


---------39:43----------
seeing how other families uh like even


---------39:46----------
even by while having in mind that these


---------39:48----------
people are probably trying to like


---------39:50----------
play it up and be nicer now that i'm


---------39:52----------
around now that i'm busy and visiting


---------39:55----------
these people were nice to a degree but


---------39:57----------
i've never known


---------39:58----------
um it was such a weird experience to see


---------40:00----------
like a normal functioning family


---------40:03----------
and it was so distant from what my


---------40:06----------
family wasn't


---------40:07----------
in my opinion aside from like maybe what


---------40:09----------
my grandparents were


---------40:11----------
but when that person came around it felt


---------40:14----------
like


---------40:14----------
this guy was gonna um bring that sort of


---------40:18----------
feeling that i had when i was at my


---------40:20----------
friend's


---------40:20----------
like in my at my friend's house right to


---------40:22----------
visit it felt like he was going to bring


---------40:24----------
that to us


---------40:25----------
but she did actually like he actually


---------40:27----------
did that um he


---------40:28----------
had something about him but


---------40:31----------
i'm i'm listening uh what did he bring i


---------40:34----------
think you're about to say it


---------40:35----------
okay yeah um he he just brought


---------40:39----------
something that


---------40:39----------
i would call common sense um he was


---------40:41----------
someone who actually wanted to


---------40:44----------
be like a presence in my life in my


---------40:46----------
sister's life he wanted to be someone


---------40:48----------
like he was


---------40:48----------
someone who actually loved my mother


---------40:50----------
instead of just trying to abuse her for


---------40:52----------
something


---------40:52----------
um and i think that


---------40:56----------
and i think that confused my mom because


---------40:58----------
she was so


---------40:59----------
like adjusted to people being the worst


---------41:03----------
to her


---------41:03----------
right and so because this person was so


---------41:06----------
different


---------41:07----------
she started being voiced to him um


---------41:11----------
not at first but like at some point it


---------41:13----------
went to a


---------41:14----------
degree where for example she um


---------41:17----------
she would go to work and he usually came


---------41:21----------
home


---------41:21----------
before she did because he went out


---------41:23----------
earlier too


---------41:25----------
and he had put on some weight he wanted


---------41:27----------
to lose weight so he just went out


---------41:28----------
and drove his butt like rode his bike


---------41:32----------
so he came home later than she did and


---------41:34----------
her immediate reaction to that when he


---------41:36----------
came home was


---------41:37----------
who were you with who did you cheat on


---------41:39----------
me with right


---------41:41----------
very extreme reaction she would take his


---------41:43----------
phone and uh


---------41:45----------
demand that she knows that she gets to


---------41:46----------
know all his passwords


---------41:48----------
he gets to read all of his facebook


---------41:49----------
messages and stuff and then she told her


---------41:52----------
at some point even


---------41:53----------
started like throwing his phone around


---------41:55----------
and having like extreme temper tantrums


---------41:57----------
where he wouldn't even understand what


---------41:58----------
she's saying anymore


---------42:00----------
which was very sad because she had like


---------42:01----------
made so much progress at that point


---------42:04----------
in to like in a direction where i would


---------42:07----------
call her like an actual mom


---------42:08----------
instead of just the person i call mom if


---------42:10----------
that makes sense


---------42:12----------
um she was still someone who i felt i


---------42:14----------
had to


---------42:15----------
educate and care for in a way but


---------42:19----------
it at least felt like she loved me and


---------42:21----------
very like she actually like now


---------42:23----------
like loved and um appreciated me in a


---------42:26----------
way a mother would have some


---------42:27----------
instead of just someone who's like


---------42:30----------
living with me and this was around the


---------42:33----------
time that she was dating the


---------42:34----------
the good stepfather or married to okay


---------42:37----------
yeah this is


---------42:38----------
good so even though she was kind of


---------42:42----------
sorry just to clarify even though she


---------42:44----------
was kind of um


---------42:45----------
maybe being not so nice to him it


---------42:47----------
sounded like she was more


---------42:48----------
genuinely caring for you


---------42:52----------
and not for her too like she was she was


---------42:55----------
very much in love with her like to a


---------42:57----------
point with


---------42:58----------
i would say this is his love for her was


---------43:01----------
probably


---------43:02----------
um the thing that seared like my


---------43:04----------
family's uh


---------43:05----------
entire fate in a way because


---------43:09----------
the thing is if you treat someone who


---------43:11----------
hates you badly


---------43:12----------
he's just gonna want to distance himself


---------43:14----------
from you right but if you treat someone


---------43:16----------
badly who loves you a person's just


---------43:18----------
gonna be confused and not know what to


---------43:19----------
do


---------43:21----------
and some people can deal with that sort


---------43:24----------
of pressure in a way that doesn't end in


---------43:25----------
homicide and some people can't i would


---------43:27----------
say


---------43:28----------
and this person after


---------43:31----------
two years of having been the best father


---------43:33----------
figure that i


---------43:34----------
have had up until that point


---------43:38----------
apparently i don't know really what


---------43:40----------
happened i don't even know if it really


---------43:42----------
happened but my mom claimed that he


---------43:43----------
um like punched her and punched the


---------43:45----------
lights out almost


---------43:47----------
like um i heard him screaming i went i


---------43:50----------
immediately came running and what i saw


---------43:53----------
was


---------43:55----------
her on the ground crying she was mad in


---------43:58----------
the floor uh


---------43:59----------
just looking at me like just like no


---------44:02----------
what did i do right


---------44:04----------
i talked to her and she said but yeah


---------44:05----------
and he had punched him a few times but


---------44:07----------
to be honest her story didn't completely


---------44:09----------
check out


---------44:10----------
i feel like she actually lied about it


---------44:12----------
in a way because like his story which


---------44:14----------
was that he shoved her aside and


---------44:16----------
um everybody shoved her side very hard


---------44:19----------
and that she


---------44:19----------
and that he accidentally like pushed her


---------44:21----------
against the um door frame


---------44:23----------
uh like seeing the wounds that she had


---------44:26----------
that was much more likely than


---------44:28----------
him actually punching her full password


---------44:29----------
three times in the face like that didn't


---------44:31----------
really check out


---------44:32----------
but nevertheless i was mad um my big


---------44:35----------
brother was really mad


---------44:37----------
and we threw him out not in the nicest


---------44:41----------
way possible either


---------44:43----------
but i eventually started feeling bad for


---------44:45----------
my king and i came after him and i


---------44:46----------
helped him at least find a hotel to stay


---------44:48----------
in


---------44:50----------
and at the time i was working at the


---------44:51----------
same place as my mom


---------44:53----------
we had a small casino just eight slot


---------44:55----------
machines now it's nothing big but


---------44:57----------
it was ours we were um we were working


---------45:00----------
in it


---------45:00----------
up until like eight and one am every day


---------45:04----------
and one time like like a week after that


---------45:07----------
happened


---------45:07----------
um i would occasionally bring him food


---------45:10----------
stuff like that so he would like


---------45:12----------
even then live comfortably because for


---------45:13----------
some reason i just knew they were going


---------45:14----------
to get back together


---------45:16----------
um and he ended up visiting me in


---------45:19----------
in that casino while i was working and


---------45:22----------
just


---------45:23----------
smelled like a smell of alcohol smelled


---------45:24----------
of puke


---------45:26----------
really puffy uh eyes and he was talking


---------45:29----------
to me about how


---------45:30----------
horrible he felt how this is like the


---------45:32----------
worst time of his life


---------45:33----------
because he's separated from her because


---------45:35----------
he doesn't know what to do he feels like


---------45:36----------
and he even told me at that point that


---------45:39----------
sometimes she can be like the nicest and


---------45:40----------
sweetest woman to him and sometimes


---------45:42----------
she's just


---------45:43----------
so insane to her and to him that he


---------45:44----------
doesn't know what to do


---------45:46----------
and he asked me for a hug i gave it to


---------45:48----------
him he connected and


---------45:49----------
i figured i would i was going to help


---------45:50----------
him to get back with my


---------45:52----------
get back with my mom again which i did


---------45:57----------
i believe myself to be someone who's


---------45:59----------
very good at


---------46:00----------
reaching like any sort of goal as long


---------46:03----------
as it


---------46:04----------
um as long as it contains making someone


---------46:07----------
do something


---------46:08----------
even if it's at least something that


---------46:09----------
they have at least somewhat in mind like


---------46:12----------
i think


---------46:13----------
it's not really i don't know if it's


---------46:14----------
something that i couldn't call


---------46:15----------
manipulative but


---------46:16----------
something along those lines they have to


---------46:18----------
give you a side quest and you can make


---------46:20----------
sure it gets done


---------46:21----------
exactly exactly if i know if i can feel


---------46:23----------
that there's like even if it's a secret


---------46:24----------
quest if i can feel it i can do it sort


---------46:26----------
of


---------46:27----------
but it's that's what it feels like but


---------46:29----------
yeah i did that


---------46:30----------
and from four months it went


---------46:34----------
really well again and then


---------46:37----------
basically like a complete repeat of


---------46:39----------
everything but i said before happened


---------46:41----------
again


---------46:43----------
and um yeah so we threw him out again


---------46:47----------
and this time and this is something that


---------46:49----------
i missed to tell you um before that he


---------46:51----------
actually told us that


---------46:52----------
next time he was gonna get thrown out


---------46:54----------
like once he came back in he said that


---------46:56----------
in a very


---------46:57----------
not in a cryptic or mad way he said that


---------46:59----------
very matter-of-factly like


---------47:00----------
we didn't even think anything about it


---------47:02----------
he said that um we were going to regret


---------47:03----------
it


---------47:04----------
and my mom immediately asked him what


---------47:06----------
are you going to go back to portugal


---------47:07----------
because that's where he was from


---------47:09----------
um and he was like yeah you'll see


---------47:12----------
and that felt like that's what he meant


---------47:14----------
right and


---------47:16----------
so this time we threw him out again


---------47:17----------
because it happened basically the exact


---------47:19----------
same thing happened again


---------47:20----------
um except this time he also like tried


---------47:22----------
to push my sister or something i wasn't


---------47:24----------
there for it


---------47:26----------
and because of that like


---------47:29----------
we eventually checked out like on her


---------47:32----------
mom's bank account like her shared bank


---------47:34----------
account with bad guy


---------47:35----------
and we really realized i can't talk


---------47:37----------
sorry


---------47:38----------
we realized that um 500 euros we're


---------47:41----------
missing


---------47:42----------
it's like i think about 600 something


---------47:45----------
like that


---------47:46----------
um and we figured he really did just get


---------47:49----------
a


---------47:49----------
ticket back to portugal or something


---------47:51----------
like that


---------47:53----------
well he visited me again at work


---------47:56----------
this time at like night time much more


---------47:59----------
[ __ ] up than the last time very puffy


---------48:01----------
eyes again


---------48:02----------
small smooth smoke like [ __ ] to be


---------48:04----------
honest and


---------48:06----------
one time he and like he we were just


---------48:08----------
talking about [ __ ] and not even about my


---------48:10----------
mom just talking about stuff because i


---------48:12----------
felt like this was the last time we were


---------48:13----------
gonna talk


---------48:14----------
which was right um


---------48:17----------
and he again asked me to hug him and he


---------48:19----------
was talking about how he feels like


---------48:22----------
this is again the worst time of his life


---------48:23----------
but also


---------48:25----------
there's nothing he can do about it right


---------48:28----------
like he felt like there was nothing to


---------48:29----------
do and i told him yeah i don't think you


---------48:31----------
and mom are


---------48:31----------
ever going to work out it was like yeah


---------48:33----------
but things are going to be better soon


---------48:36----------
and the next day i was in bed my mom was


---------48:38----------
late


---------48:39----------
it was late at work she just came home i


---------48:41----------
heard her garage going um


---------48:43----------
just closed down so i figured she was


---------48:45----------
gonna come in soon


---------48:47----------
and suddenly i heard basically the


---------48:49----------
loudest


---------48:50----------
sound of my that i've ever heard in my


---------48:52----------
life it's felt like an explosion right


---------48:54----------
next to me


---------48:56----------
and it happened again and again so like


---------48:58----------
three times and i


---------48:59----------
then looked outside of a window and i


---------49:01----------
saw my mom laying on the ground


---------49:03----------
and my stepfather or at least a


---------49:06----------
silhouette


---------49:07----------
with a gun in hand and


---------49:11----------
yeah i panicked called the police the


---------49:13----------
father and at that point i actually


---------49:15----------
fought or even knew


---------49:17----------
like in my mind i knew i was gonna die


---------49:19----------
next i felt like this is


---------49:20----------
this person that's gonna come up here


---------49:22----------
and he's gonna kill me and he's gonna


---------49:24----------
kill my sister and this is like my last


---------49:25----------
moment in life


---------49:27----------
that sort of feeling is something that i


---------49:29----------
probably will never shake


---------49:31----------
i it's hard to explain it's something it


---------49:34----------
feels like


---------49:35----------
that sort of adrenaline makes you feel


---------49:36----------
like someone else is controlling your


---------49:38----------
body and you're only


---------49:39----------
watching and it's like


---------49:43----------
i don't know it's like automotive but


---------49:47----------
yeah um and i thought was


---------49:50----------
even more like that's part sounded even


---------49:52----------
more convincing to me the moment i heard


---------49:54----------
another shot


---------49:57----------
and i didn't even bother to try to look


---------49:59----------
outside of the window this time


---------50:01----------
because i was scared to see and to see


---------50:02----------
what it was or to see


---------50:04----------
someone actually come in so out of panic


---------50:08----------
i just called the police and i took a


---------50:09----------
wine bottle


---------50:10----------
still stood next to the door and thought


---------50:12----------
that if someone's going to come in maybe


---------50:13----------
i can try to overwhelm them if not i'll


---------50:15----------
die


---------50:15----------
i die anyways maybe i can save my sister


---------50:19----------
who knows


---------50:21----------
but no one ever came no police and that


---------50:24----------
guy didn't either


---------50:25----------
so at some point after like probably 15


---------50:28----------
minutes of waiting or maybe free who


---------50:29----------
knows


---------50:30----------
i was very i was in a very very weird


---------50:33----------
mindset


---------50:34----------
i actually looked outside of the window


---------50:36----------
and i saw another person laying down on


---------50:38----------
the ground


---------50:39----------
same person with a gun yeah and


---------50:43----------
like an hour later police came and


---------50:46----------
that's where how my family got torn


---------50:48----------
apart to a point where


---------50:50----------
nothing feels but now it does again that


---------50:53----------
it felt like


---------50:54----------
life was never going to be normal again


---------50:57----------
and it


---------50:57----------
i think it's just something to before i


---------51:00----------
finish this story sort of


---------51:02----------
it just felt almost ironic that


---------51:05----------
the moment that life feels it feels like


---------51:08----------
it's starting to get


---------51:08----------
better in regards to like my family life


---------51:10----------
the moment that


---------51:12----------
my um me and my mom get back together in


---------51:14----------
a way where it's


---------51:15----------
where it actually feels like family


---------51:16----------
that's when life also takes her from me


---------51:19----------
was kind of ironic i guess


---------51:27----------
that's quite the story doc yeah


---------51:32----------
it's hard to tell people sometimes


---------51:34----------
because it feels like i don't know i


---------51:36----------
feel like it's


---------51:37----------
actually so much that people often


---------51:39----------
oftentimes don't believe me


---------51:40----------
unless they actually live around me and


---------51:42----------
know it happened


---------51:44----------
it does sound unbelievable in a lot of


---------51:46----------
ways


---------51:48----------
yeah i know and to those who doesn't


---------51:52----------
sound unbelievable too it sounds like


---------51:53----------
something they can't really respond to


---------51:57----------
usually when i'm at a loss for words


---------52:00----------
it's because there are too many


---------52:01----------
things to say i'm sorry


---------52:05----------
no it's okay how does it feel to share


---------52:07----------
that


---------52:09----------
um it's something that i can't really


---------52:13----------
explain to be honest


---------52:14----------
because um i'm as i said before i'm very


---------52:17----------
open about like


---------52:20----------
i don't know it's hard to say it's i've


---------52:22----------
i'm very open about stuff that happens


---------52:24----------
to me i


---------52:24----------
tell people all the time and


---------52:28----------
it feels like i'm making it real again


---------52:30----------
in a way because like sometimes i feel


---------52:31----------
like my brain is trying to


---------52:34----------
not forget it but make it seem like it


---------52:35----------
happened 20 years ago when it was only


---------52:37----------
three years ago


---------52:39----------
and when i tell it i feel like


---------52:43----------
it's it's still real it's something that


---------52:45----------
really didn't even


---------52:47----------
um i don't know it's something that


---------52:50----------
happened not too long ago but i overcame


---------52:53----------
it if that makes sense like i think


---------52:54----------
i think but in a way at least


---------52:58----------
i probably overcame it as well as i


---------53:01----------
possibly could without any help


---------53:04----------
that makes sense because there were


---------53:07----------
times where i


---------53:08----------
didn't want to live anymore that's


---------53:10----------
especially like the first


---------53:13----------
um first week after it happened second


---------53:16----------
week


---------53:16----------
ironically i was already working again


---------53:18----------
because like


---------53:19----------
i felt like if i were to go back into


---------53:21----------
like a normal everyday life


---------53:23----------
um i wasn't gonna forget it but i was at


---------53:26----------
least gonna get used to the change if


---------53:28----------
that makes sense


---------53:29----------
because like that basically uploaded


---------53:31----------
like my entire life like


---------53:32----------
nothing's the same


---------53:40----------
um yeah you have more to say


---------53:44----------
no no it's fine can i think for a second


---------53:48----------
you may i love it thank you


---------53:58----------
hmm


---------54:04----------
i feel like this conversation has ten


---------54:07----------
main quests


---------54:08----------
in it


---------54:11----------
they all feel really important to me


---------54:14----------
okay i'm gonna start listing them out


---------54:18----------
all right actually let's start with this


---------54:21----------
what


---------54:22----------
how how are you feeling right now doc


---------54:27----------
still nervous um a little bit more


---------54:30----------
comfortable than before


---------54:32----------
but other than that i don't really


---------54:35----------
feel much to be honest is your is your


---------54:38----------
mind


---------54:39----------
telling you that we think


---------54:42----------
something about you now


---------54:46----------
um i can't imagine that there's people


---------54:48----------
especially like in


---------54:50----------
i don't know i can imagine that there's


---------54:51----------
people who now have listened to that who


---------54:54----------
believe this is not true


---------54:56----------
um because that's like a that's


---------54:59----------
that's a reaction i get a lot um


---------55:02----------
there's probably a lot of people who


---------55:04----------
think i'm weird for


---------55:06----------
reacting to it the way i do and maybe a


---------55:08----------
lot of people are also


---------55:10----------
relating to at least part of what i just


---------55:11----------
said because i think uh


---------55:14----------
i don't know i think that for a lot of


---------55:16----------
people especially like people who


---------55:17----------
maybe were outcasts or even outcasts


---------55:20----------
like in


---------55:21----------
middle and high school or even just


---------55:22----------
people who are gamers


---------55:24----------
um i think there's at least something


---------55:26----------
that


---------55:27----------
they will probably relate to in that


---------55:30----------
what do you think i think


---------55:34----------
no clue okay good i'm happy to hear that


---------55:39----------
um because that means i don't have to


---------55:40----------
dispel anything and we can just get into


---------55:43----------
it


---------55:44----------
so i have a very good opinion about you


---------55:47----------
well let's it sounds like disappointing


---------55:51----------
you will be easy then


---------55:53----------
um so


---------55:56----------
yeah i it's yeah anyway you don't have


---------55:59----------
to


---------56:00----------
we can i'm sure we can hit that tennis


---------56:02----------
ball across the court several times


---------56:04----------
back and forth yeah um so


---------56:09----------
uh let me just let me just kind of toss


---------56:12----------
out i'm gonna just think out loud okay


---------56:15----------
okay so we started off the conversation


---------56:17----------
and you kind of mentioned that you had


---------56:18----------
had traumatic experiences but that you


---------56:21----------
basically like the main thing that


---------56:22----------
that i heard originally was that you're


---------56:25----------
kind of living life in the third person


---------56:27----------
and that the only time that you kind of


---------56:28----------
get excited is


---------56:30----------
the only time that you can really feel


---------56:32----------
happiness or joy


---------56:33----------
is like when you're helping someone else


---------56:35----------
out


---------56:37----------
um and and you know also like so we sort


---------56:40----------
of


---------56:40----------
kind of notice that you sort of feel


---------56:42----------
like


---------56:44----------
separated from your life you're not


---------56:45----------
invested in your own life


---------56:48----------
um but you can be invested in others and


---------56:51----------
then you sort of mention this thing


---------56:52----------
about


---------56:54----------
um you know like you're a narcissist who


---------56:59----------
hates himself and


---------57:00----------
what as we kind of dug into that we sort


---------57:02----------
of recognize that


---------57:04----------
you know you do actually think about


---------57:05----------
other people as plebs and as weird as


---------57:07----------
that sounds i don't think that that's


---------57:08----------
actually arrogant i


---------57:09----------
i i think that


---------57:13----------
i think you can accurately assess that


---------57:16----------
you've sort of developed like a high


---------57:18----------
level of social intelligence and you


---------57:20----------
kind of know how to interact with people


---------57:22----------
you know how to make yourself likeable


---------57:24----------
and that sometimes people


---------57:26----------
are not like aware of those levels of


---------57:29----------
interaction


---------57:30----------
right which sort of makes sense it's


---------57:31----------
kind of like you know you can be a


---------57:32----------
master chef


---------57:34----------
and taste lots of things whereas like


---------57:37----------
you know the majority of people may just


---------57:39----------
want their attendees and like they don't


---------57:40----------
really care about


---------57:41----------
you know like which is which is fine


---------57:44----------
like it's like that's how humans are


---------57:45----------
like some of us


---------57:46----------
are master chefs and some of us are fine


---------57:48----------
with attendees


---------57:50----------
you know some of us are like socially


---------57:52----------
like very aware of nuance and such


---------57:55----------
and and other people are just sort of


---------57:56----------
like i'm gonna be a pleb and


---------57:58----------
oh my god did you see this pair of shoes


---------58:00----------
on instagram i want it


---------58:02----------
and and you know like yeah and that's


---------58:04----------
fine right


---------58:06----------
like yeah i wish i was like that that's


---------58:08----------
that's the thing like


---------58:09----------
i don't think i i don't think lesser of


---------58:11----------
him i just feel like yeah i wish i would


---------58:12----------
still like that if that makes sense


---------58:14----------
and and some people are challenger level


---------58:17----------
at league and some people are silver


---------58:19----------
right like that's


---------58:20----------
it's okay for people to be good at


---------58:22----------
things and other people to not be good


---------58:23----------
at things


---------58:25----------
um and you know you mentioned


---------58:29----------
hate yourself um and this is where i


---------58:32----------
think we can really start to see a


---------58:34----------
couple of themes which


---------58:35----------
you know if you've been watching the


---------58:37----------
stream for a while i'm sure people can


---------58:39----------
piece this together


---------58:40----------
you reading twitch chat by the way no


---------58:43----------
okay good actually not so


---------58:46----------
so i i you know you you said one thing


---------58:49----------
that struck me as odd is that there was


---------58:51----------
a friend of yours who was living with


---------58:52----------
you


---------58:53----------
and he felt like he had to be your


---------58:55----------
friend because he was living with you


---------59:00----------
can you help me understand that


---------59:01----------
statement oh it's just the


---------59:04----------
apartment complex he was living


---------59:05----------
underneath like in the apartment


---------59:07----------
underneath me


---------59:08----------
why does why does he have to be with why


---------59:10----------
does he


---------59:11----------
have to because he he just was that type


---------59:15----------
of person he wasn't


---------59:16----------
he's extremely extroverted um


---------59:19----------
that person is like an entire thing to


---------59:21----------
unpack too because he was uh that


---------59:23----------
he was my latest in my late step


---------59:24----------
problems like the guy who did that


---------59:26----------
he was when he was his um


---------59:29----------
nephew so it's a yeah that's like a


---------59:33----------
tangled tangled story but but what i'm


---------59:36----------
curious about is


---------59:37----------
is why couldn't he like you for being


---------59:40----------
you


---------59:41----------
uh because he told me he wouldn't have


---------59:42----------
liked me if i hadn't lived in the same


---------59:44----------
department in the same apartment complex


---------59:47----------
he was very uh he was just someone who


---------59:49----------
was very extroverted and he


---------59:52----------
just knowing that someone just someone


---------59:54----------
his age


---------59:55----------
is in the same like house as he is


---------59:59----------
he just he just felt like he was he had


---------60:01----------
to do


---------60:02----------
do stuff with me because he just always


---------60:04----------
needs someone around and that was like


---------60:05----------
the perfect


---------60:06----------
scenario for him so he in a way shaped


---------60:09----------
me into someone he would like if that


---------60:10----------
makes sense because


---------60:12----------
i was a very i was a very nerdy person


---------60:15----------
um because as one might as one might


---------60:18----------
tell since i didn't have any friends


---------60:20----------
internet was my friend and it still is


---------60:23----------
to his day


---------60:24----------
to a degree because that's why i feel


---------60:26----------
most comfortable even


---------60:28----------
like i'm not shy i have a lot of friends


---------60:31----------
nowadays i have a lot of people to hang


---------60:33----------
out with i just


---------60:34----------
oftentimes feel like i do want to stay


---------60:36----------
alone either way


---------60:38----------
yeah so doc i may start


---------60:41----------
interrupting you a little bit okay


---------60:43----------
that's fine completely fine


---------60:45----------
um so so and so this is i think like a


---------60:51----------
was not the answer i was expecting um in


---------60:54----------
terms of


---------60:54----------
you know why you felt that way but but i


---------60:57----------
i'm really seeing a big theme here which


---------60:59----------
is that you know you're not


---------61:00----------
worth liking right so yeah


---------61:04----------
so so and we'll and i can see you


---------61:06----------
swallowed there so that's good so


---------61:08----------
there's probably some kind of emotion


---------61:10----------
so right then it can hurt to hear it but


---------61:12----------
like let's just kind of like run through


---------61:14----------
the


---------61:14----------
the evidence of that right so i and i


---------61:16----------
think that


---------61:18----------
and this is where we have to get really


---------61:19----------
tricky because i think you are worth


---------61:21----------
liking but i think that it's very


---------61:22----------
reasonable


---------61:24----------
for you to believe that you are not


---------61:26----------
worth liking because like honestly the


---------61:28----------
evidence kind of points in that


---------61:29----------
direction right


---------61:31----------
and i think it just happens to be bad


---------61:33----------
karma for lack of a better term but to


---------61:34----------
start off with you were an anchor child


---------61:36----------
right your dad like


---------61:38----------
basically the reason that you were


---------61:39----------
conceived was out of a uh


---------61:42----------
a sociopathic desire to stay in a


---------61:44----------
country and for material gain


---------61:46----------
yeah and to have an absent father who


---------61:48----------
tells you that he likes you i mean


---------61:50----------
you're not really buying it but then you


---------61:52----------
also get like very clear evidence right


---------61:55----------
and this is not one of those things


---------61:56----------
where i mean sometimes we we deal with


---------61:58----------
situations of cognitive bias or


---------62:00----------
distortion


---------62:02----------
where that's what i thought we would see


---------62:03----------
with your friend which was like


---------62:05----------
oh you know maybe you just didn't


---------62:07----------
realize because you felt unlovable but


---------62:09----------
he actually was your friend because


---------62:12----------
he liked you but it turns out maybe


---------62:14----------
that's not the case


---------62:16----------
and that if anything what he taught you


---------62:19----------
is that you're not


---------62:20----------
worth liking but if we can doll you up


---------62:23----------
and make you pretty and make you


---------62:24----------
likeable if i can turn you into


---------62:26----------
something that you're not


---------62:27----------
then i can like you yeah pretty much


---------62:32----------
and and so yeah go ahead


---------62:36----------
i was just gonna say that um uh in like


---------62:39----------
regards to the uh


---------62:40----------
cognitive dissonance that you've


---------62:42----------
mentioned before i get that and i still


---------62:45----------
for me it's i think it's a little bit


---------62:47----------
different than for most people


---------62:48----------
um because i have this sort of thing


---------62:50----------
where it feels like i got two


---------62:51----------
thought processes at the same time when


---------62:53----------
talking to people where it's like the


---------62:54----------
logic


---------62:55----------
that's like the logical part of my brain


---------62:57----------
that knows no this person probably


---------62:58----------
really does like me and i'm very


---------63:00----------
confident in that assessment then


---------63:02----------
there's also the other part of my brain


---------63:03----------
that's like


---------63:04----------
yeah but do you remember back then you


---------63:06----------
did you never really know if people


---------63:08----------
actually like you or is it this is just


---------63:09----------
a facade because we either don't want to


---------63:11----------
be mean


---------63:12----------
or because we're trying to like bait you


---------63:13----------
into being like


---------63:16----------
uh funnily stupid again sort of yeah


---------63:19----------
good so i'm glad that you recognize that


---------63:21----------
because i do think it's different from


---------63:23----------
the cog


---------63:23----------
i think it's quite different so for some


---------63:25----------
people what happened so let's just


---------63:27----------
illustrate this for a second


---------63:28----------
for some people what happens is that


---------63:31----------
their


---------63:31----------
heart ends up controlling their mind


---------63:35----------
and so even though the mind should


---------63:38----------
logically see that this person likes you


---------63:41----------
the heart convinces them otherwise and


---------63:44----------
they take someone who actually likes you


---------63:46----------
and distort it


---------63:47----------
into what the heart actually believes in


---------63:50----------
your sense i don't think that you have


---------63:51----------
that cognitive distortion or cognitive


---------63:53----------
bias


---------63:54----------
yeah it's more like my heart is trying


---------63:56----------
to give me that but it's not working


---------63:57----------
that much yeah


---------63:58----------
yeah yeah i just feel a general form of


---------64:00----------
like discomfort


---------64:01----------
yeah that's like at most that's it


---------64:04----------
absolutely and i think if


---------64:05----------
we want to be really honest about it


---------64:07----------
like i think that there's a good reason


---------64:09----------
it's not that your heart is actually


---------64:10----------
illogical i think it's actually quite


---------64:12----------
logical right because


---------64:13----------
if we really look at your life what we


---------64:15----------
see is you know dad


---------64:17----------
you know like abandonment and all that


---------64:20----------
good stuff and then also like


---------64:22----------
oh son you're the only son that matters


---------64:24----------
to me


---------64:25----------
pro tip if you have a parent who has


---------64:28----------
lots of children


---------64:29----------
and tells you that you're the only one


---------64:31----------
that dot dot dot or just in general


---------64:33----------
makes me hate it more just in general


---------64:35----------
like like i see this a lot with like


---------64:37----------
narcissistic


---------64:38----------
kind of i mean we i think the word gets


---------64:40----------
tossed around a lot so


---------64:42----------
there's just a particular kind of person


---------64:44----------
who will say you're the only one


---------64:47----------
yeah right so that kind of idealization


---------64:50----------
that's something you should be careful


---------64:51----------
like even when it comes to dr k they're


---------64:53----------
like dr k is the only one no i'm i'm


---------64:55----------
really not


---------64:58----------
you know no it's like um that's i


---------65:01----------
i wouldn't say that either like i just


---------65:02----------
um


---------65:04----------
uh this is gonna probably this is


---------65:06----------
probably something you've heard a lot


---------65:07----------
before


---------65:08----------
um i came to know you because of your


---------65:11----------
first interview with


---------65:12----------
reckful and reckful was someone that i


---------65:14----------
at that point in time


---------65:15----------
um related to a lot um weirdly enough


---------65:18----------
because i feel like he has very he had


---------65:20----------
very different problems


---------65:22----------
to me and still i felt like he was


---------65:24----------
someone that i could relate to very well


---------65:26----------
and when i found out that he was like


---------65:28----------
talking to a therapist on online


---------65:30----------
and i checked it out and i felt like


---------65:32----------
this is someone who actually


---------65:34----------
sort of um can like look behind that


---------65:37----------
curtain that people


---------65:38----------
have put up and and at least in my like


---------65:41----------
this is gonna sound weird to say but i


---------65:43----------
feel like people who are primarily on


---------65:45----------
the internet


---------65:46----------
aren't easily understood by most


---------65:49----------
therapists in


---------65:50----------
the same way that they are by you and by


---------65:52----------
you for some reason


---------65:54----------
yeah so there's a simple reason for that


---------65:58----------
and it's that therapists look at


---------66:00----------
patients


---------66:01----------
and what therapists should do is look at


---------66:04----------
people


---------66:05----------
yeah right and and


---------66:09----------
i mean that you know i think the more


---------66:12----------
person


---------66:12----------
that you see the easier it's going to be


---------66:15----------
to relate and if we really look at


---------66:17----------
you know byron i think one of the things


---------66:18----------
that made him special was that


---------66:20----------
he was really good at like being himself


---------66:24----------
and being very authentic which is why


---------66:26----------
it's interesting because we do hear that


---------66:27----------
a lot of people like really connected


---------66:29----------
with byron and i think that's because


---------66:31----------
like


---------66:31----------
he showed off all the facets of his


---------66:33----------
being so you didn't get


---------66:34----------
a curtain you got a person like yeah it


---------66:37----------
felt like


---------66:38----------
um in a way it felt like just hanging


---------66:39----------
out with a friend when you watched him


---------66:41----------
yeah that's probably what most people


---------66:43----------
felt like


---------66:45----------
and so just kind of going back to kind


---------66:47----------
of themes of of you know being unlovable


---------66:50----------
which is just what i'm going to call it


---------66:52----------
right so there's your dad


---------66:53----------
there's this friend who sort of shaped


---------66:55----------
you into a person who's worthy of being


---------66:57----------
friends with


---------66:59----------
um and then also like people like kids


---------67:01----------
in your neighborhood


---------67:02----------
explicitly being told to not hang out


---------67:06----------
with you


---------67:07----------
yeah um because of just rumors about my


---------67:10----------
mom going around


---------67:11----------
yeah also just me being like the only


---------67:14----------
colored person in the village that's


---------67:15----------
what i thought was the case


---------67:16----------
um the way i was trying to make it easy


---------67:18----------
for myself i think yeah


---------67:19----------
just a standard case of racism yeah but


---------67:23----------
i i tried to make it about that because


---------67:25----------
i feel like if it's not then i can't do


---------67:27----------
anything about it it's not my fault and


---------67:28----------
it's fine


---------67:30----------
exactly but it turned out to not be that


---------67:32----------
which means what


---------67:34----------
um first of all i needed to change and


---------67:37----------
second of all


---------67:38----------
people knew about my mom too much yeah


---------67:41----------
so it's kind of interesting right


---------67:42----------
because when you say you need to change


---------67:44----------
like if you attribute


---------67:45----------
their dislike of you to racism like


---------67:47----------
that's not your fault


---------67:49----------
yeah but if it's not racism then it's


---------67:52----------
sort of like


---------67:53----------
kind of your not necessarily it's that


---------67:55----------
it's your fault because


---------67:56----------
i still get the sense that you're pretty


---------67:59----------
level-headed about that but that it


---------68:00----------
like you really are there's something


---------68:02----------
wrong with you let's put it that way


---------68:04----------
yeah um i was just very


---------68:07----------
i was just the annoying kid at school


---------68:09----------
basically like uh


---------68:10----------
but it's also i think it was kind of a


---------68:12----------
result of just not having any friends in


---------68:13----------
my age range ever


---------68:15----------
up until like up until i like turned


---------68:18----------
[Music]


---------68:19----------
14 with my friend that lived in the same


---------68:21----------
apartment complex and then 16 when i


---------68:23----------
basically started with a new slate in a


---------68:25----------
new class that was really welcoming and


---------68:27----------
nice


---------68:28----------
yeah so i'm just going to kind of go


---------68:30----------
back to unlovable okay


---------68:32----------
i'm just going to lay out a couple other


---------68:33----------
things so one is like


---------68:35----------
you know being told that you know being


---------68:38----------
sent off to your grandparents place and


---------68:39----------
then your mom telling you that they


---------68:41----------
always wanted a daughter i'm gonna keep


---------68:43----------
this kid


---------68:45----------
but this kid i'm gonna send off


---------68:49----------
like that's gotta hurt


---------68:52----------
it did to a degree but i was


---------68:56----------
luckily young enough to not really like


---------68:59----------
think about it too much my grandpa did a


---------69:01----------
really good job of like


---------69:03----------
making me feel like i was at home


---------69:06----------
but it was still it was still on my mind


---------69:09----------
yeah


---------69:09----------
yeah yeah so so and this is where i kind


---------69:12----------
of get


---------69:12----------
you know back to this idea of like you


---------69:15----------
know what's it like to never be wanted


---------69:20----------
it it i think it's something that


---------69:24----------
i say that at some point it just makes


---------69:28----------
you feel like


---------69:29----------
i don't know you just ask yourself all


---------69:30----------
the time what's wrong with me um


---------69:33----------
what did i do wrong why are people like


---------69:35----------
always snapping at me why


---------69:37----------
no i can't uh it just felt like why


---------69:40----------
can't i have


---------69:41----------
why can't i have anything nice unless


---------69:42----------
it's literally just a i don't know a ps2


---------69:45----------
game


---------69:46----------
or something that i got on christmas


---------69:48----------
right


---------69:49----------
um yeah just it felt like uh


---------69:53----------
i must have messed up somewhere and


---------69:56----------
there's no way for me to


---------69:58----------
get out of it on my own because i just


---------69:59----------
don't know what to change


---------70:01----------
or i didn't know um


---------70:04----------
at some point i just figured i would uh


---------70:07----------
see like


---------70:08----------
i had like a few people who were at


---------70:10----------
least neutral towards me and i just


---------70:11----------
tried to like


---------70:12----------
hang on to those people and be as um


---------70:16----------
i don't know i tried to be uh almost


---------70:18----------
like them


---------70:20----------
and it just weirdly worked out


---------70:24----------
doc i mean this may sound kind of weird


---------70:25----------
like i don't know how to find the words


---------70:27----------
but like


---------70:29----------
i can imagine that the person that on


---------70:31----------
some level you feel you


---------70:33----------
are has a main quest that isn't even


---------70:36----------
worth pursuing


---------70:38----------
yeah pretty much


---------70:41----------
right like why would we want to bother


---------70:44----------
with this guy's main quest


---------70:46----------
like this guy's main quest isn't even


---------70:48----------
worth it


---------70:50----------
like there are like other people who are


---------70:52----------
like normal


---------70:54----------
and like them doing their side quests is


---------70:57----------
like more


---------70:58----------
important than our main quest


---------71:04----------
you know i'm kind of i'm kind of almost


---------71:06----------
imagining these rpgs where you know


---------71:08----------
sometimes like in rpgs you've got good


---------71:10----------
characters and bad characters


---------71:12----------
and there's the side content that you


---------71:14----------
can do to develop a character and some


---------71:16----------
characters just aren't worth developing


---------71:19----------
yeah so you just leave the side quest is


---------71:21----------
just sitting in the quest log but


---------71:22----------
they're not really worth using like


---------71:25----------
their stats are low so like why bother


---------71:30----------
yeah pretty much um so i just went back


---------71:32----------
to character creation basically


---------71:35----------
yeah well said right and you reinvented


---------71:39----------
yourself


---------71:40----------
yeah and i don't know is this gonna


---------71:44----------
sound weird but i feel like


---------71:47----------
in a way everything that happened in my


---------71:48----------
life at least to some degree


---------71:50----------
made me who i am because uh i don't know


---------71:53----------
how


---------71:54----------
else to say it but i feel like i've been


---------71:56----------
in


---------71:57----------
almost like every single position that


---------71:58----------
someone of my age could be in


---------72:00----------
um in the way that i've been someone who


---------72:03----------
was extremely unpopular


---------72:05----------
bullied um i know what it's like to


---------72:09----------
to have parents i don't i don't i know


---------72:11----------
what it's like to be an orphan now um i


---------72:13----------
i know what it's like not to be loved by


---------72:14----------
your parents but i also know what it's


---------72:16----------
like


---------72:16----------
to get pay attention uh mostly because


---------72:19----------
my grandparents but also just with last


---------72:21----------
two years of my mom


---------72:22----------
still uh i don't know it's just like the


---------72:25----------
last three years of


---------72:26----------
living with my mom we're actually pretty


---------72:28----------
nice which is why it's so


---------72:30----------
which is why it still hurt to lose her


---------72:32----------
so much like


---------72:34----------
it's hard to explain but all these


---------72:36----------
things uh


---------72:37----------
it's obviously a lot more to it it just


---------72:39----------
came together to make me feel like i


---------72:41----------
can empathize and simplify with almost


---------72:43----------
everyone


---------72:44----------
to a degree where i became popular not


---------72:47----------
because of


---------72:48----------
um


---------72:51----------
okay okay okay so two things sorry


---------72:55----------
you gotta find so one thing is


---------72:59----------
that feels like i don't know what else


---------73:00----------
to call it but a main quest


---------73:02----------
yoink you know i don't know if you


---------73:04----------
played one of these games where


---------73:05----------
you're like you know you're like at the


---------73:07----------
end of the main quest and then you get


---------73:09----------
like disconnected


---------73:10----------
and you have to start over at the


---------73:11----------
beginning it's like


---------73:14----------
like you know just when you were putting


---------73:16----------
your life together


---------73:18----------
and like you had a stepfather in the


---------73:20----------
picture who like


---------73:21----------
actually treated you nicely yeah


---------73:24----------
and your mom was also like being more


---------73:27----------
loving towards you


---------73:32----------
and then he murders her and kills


---------73:36----------
himself


---------73:41----------
like what is the point of progressing on


---------73:44----------
a main quest


---------73:45----------
that ends like that


---------73:52----------
i don't know taking care of my sister


---------73:55----------
that's not the best question


---------73:59----------
right so i understand that's what you do


---------74:01----------
and that's probably why


---------74:02----------
how you get through suicidal feelings


---------74:06----------
which makes sense and i think that's


---------74:07----------
good


---------74:11----------
what are you feeling now


---------74:14----------
um i think this is um


---------74:18----------
probably the first time in


---------74:22----------
one and a half years but i feel like


---------74:23----------
crying about it


---------74:25----------
i don't know it's um i don't really like


---------74:30----------
as i told you before i talk about this


---------74:32----------
in a way where as if i was talking and


---------74:33----------
telling someone a story so i


---------74:36----------
don't force people to like go in depth


---------74:38----------
about it


---------74:40----------
so now it's tickling your spot that


---------74:44----------
hasn't i don't know


---------74:48----------
so it's kind of strange because like


---------74:49----------
literally on the screen


---------74:51----------
you're like sneaking away you've moved


---------74:54----------
like


---------74:55----------
further and for no no i think it's fine


---------74:57----------
i think it's just like


---------74:58----------
it's interesting right because like


---------74:59----------
you're not like as the conversation goes


---------75:02----------
you're like


---------75:04----------
sneaking which is fine i i don't i don't


---------75:06----------
i think you should be allowed to retreat


---------75:08----------
but it you know and and i think like


---------75:11----------
how you know how does it feel to be


---------75:14----------
tickling that


---------75:15----------
spot again


---------75:21----------
so it's hard to explain um


---------75:25----------
it feels like um


---------75:28----------
as i said before it's like it's like um


---------75:31----------
i'm making it real again


---------75:33----------
i don't i feel like at least people who


---------75:36----------
go through trauma can kind of relate


---------75:38----------
to this in the way that sometimes


---------75:40----------
there's really bad things that happen


---------75:42----------
feel like


---------75:43----------
suddenly that 20 years back in the past


---------75:45----------
even though it's really happened like


---------75:47----------
way like not even that long ago


---------75:51----------
and i don't know i feel like i've never


---------75:54----------
really gotten to


---------75:57----------
talk about it with someone in a way


---------75:58----------
where i could actually um


---------76:01----------
be sad about it if that makes sense


---------76:02----------
since i was always um


---------76:05----------
kind of like the full support pillar for


---------76:06----------
my family at least


---------76:08----------
mentally um i


---------76:11----------
play some sort of a favaro for my sister


---------76:14----------
my grandma


---------76:15----------
basically needs me to yeah um


---------76:20----------
it's like i don't know it's it feels


---------76:23----------
weird to actually be


---------76:24----------
at a spot where i'm the one like being


---------76:27----------
in focus about it


---------76:28----------
and in a way where i don't have to feel


---------76:31----------
like


---------76:32----------
whatever i'm saying should not be should


---------76:34----------
not like go over


---------76:36----------
some sort of limit to a point where


---------76:37----------
someone dislikes me


---------76:39----------
good so that segues to my next question


---------76:44----------
what do we think about you now


---------76:49----------
i've honestly no clue


---------76:53----------
[Music]


---------76:54----------
i don't know i from experience i would


---------76:56----------
say there's probably


---------76:58----------
still a lot of people who either don't


---------77:01----------
believe it


---------77:03----------
and even worse there's probably a lot of


---------77:06----------
people who


---------77:06----------
um who relate to it too much


---------77:11----------
which for most people i do feel bad for


---------77:13----------
um i hope no one can


---------77:15----------
but it's unlikely yeah


---------77:18----------
is it okay if we if we see you


---------77:22----------
yeah um can i tell you what i see


---------77:29----------
i see a survivor


---------77:36----------
[Laughter]


---------77:40----------
i think that's what you are and there's


---------77:42----------
like there's respect there


---------77:45----------
but there's also sorrow


---------77:48----------
like a lot right because we can respect


---------77:51----------
a survivor but it's also like


---------77:52----------
there's only one way that you can become


---------77:55----------
a survivor which is by surviving [ __ ]


---------78:02----------
and you can be likable i mean that's


---------78:05----------
cool like i think it's neat that you


---------78:06----------
leveled up your


---------78:08----------
you know learning how to talk to other


---------78:09----------
normies skill


---------78:11----------
yeah next i tried to mix up my character


---------78:14----------
yeah


---------78:14----------
right so like you're as much as i can


---------78:17----------
you're like an alien in human clothing


---------78:19----------
like that's neat and all but i i think


---------78:21----------
at the end of the day doc like seriously


---------78:22----------
what i see is like a survivor


---------78:28----------
yeah i don't know i always felt like um


---------78:33----------
at first that's what i felt like too but


---------78:37----------
um over time i just started out so like


---------78:40----------
i don't know i wasn't going to bring


---------78:41----------
this up because this is like actually


---------78:42----------
something that


---------78:43----------
me i don't know this is also like


---------78:46----------
part of why i don't like myself but i


---------78:49----------
feel like


---------78:51----------
i i don't know um i was too close to my


---------78:54----------
stepfather


---------78:55----------
so now i'm like in this weird limbo


---------78:57----------
where


---------78:59----------
um i hate him or more than anything like


---------79:01----------
he


---------79:02----------
it's this is gonna sound weird i'm even


---------79:05----------
more pissed about the fact he also


---------79:06----------
killed himself because it basically took


---------79:08----------
like my


---------79:10----------
like the only thing that i could be mad


---------79:11----------
at if that makes sense


---------79:13----------
and afterwards i also started to think


---------79:16----------
about how this person


---------79:18----------
who had such a bad thing in mind


---------79:22----------
also i also managed to


---------79:26----------
have the audacity almost to like


---------79:29----------
come up to my into my workplace and ask


---------79:32----------
me for a hug


---------79:34----------
just the night before he was gonna do


---------79:36----------
something like that


---------79:38----------
it's uh i don't know it's like this


---------79:42----------
weird conflict and a conflict in my


---------79:43----------
heart where it's like this person was


---------79:44----------
basically like my


---------79:47----------
the first father figure i had and also


---------79:49----------
the worst person would ever come


---------79:51----------
come across from me if it's ever come


---------79:53----------
across to me i guess


---------79:54----------
it's like


---------79:57----------
yeah i think you explained it really


---------80:00----------
well


---------80:02----------
i'd be really surprised if someone


---------80:03----------
didn't understand that


---------80:05----------
and can i tell you what i heard


---------80:08----------
yeah that you know on the one hand it


---------80:11----------
sounds like he was the first


---------80:13----------
stable father figure who like cared


---------80:15----------
about you as a person


---------80:18----------
and also that he is so


---------80:21----------
selfish


---------80:25----------
right for so many reasons like it's not


---------80:28----------
just


---------80:30----------
like you said there are just so many


---------80:31----------
elements to it where like


---------80:33----------
you know coming in and asking you for a


---------80:35----------
hug like he gets the comfort


---------80:38----------
right like he gets to determine he gets


---------80:40----------
to like


---------80:41----------
plan things out and in a sense be at


---------80:43----------
peace like he's figured his plan out i'm


---------80:46----------
gonna say goodbye


---------80:47----------
i'm gonna get a hug because i care about


---------80:49----------
this kid and then


---------80:50----------
i'm gonna do this thing and i'm not


---------80:52----------
gonna stick around for the


---------80:53----------
responsibility


---------80:55----------
yeah so that's pretty much what it felt


---------80:59----------
like he even left a note


---------81:01----------
um before he did it since he knew he was


---------81:03----------
gonna kill himself


---------81:05----------
and uh in that note he was


---------81:08----------
basically just talking straight [ __ ]


---------81:10----------
about my sister


---------81:11----------
about my mom about my brother but


---------81:13----------
completely left me out like


---------81:15----------
nowhere nothing and it just feels weird


---------81:19----------
to um


---------81:21----------
sorry the first time in like


---------81:24----------
years almost when i'm crying almost


---------81:26----------
crying


---------81:28----------
but it feels like how do you say that


---------81:33----------
it feels weird to be the best friend of


---------81:35----------
your mom's murder i guess it's


---------81:38----------
yeah i i get the sense that there are a


---------81:40----------
lot lotta really


---------81:46----------
do you feel responsible


---------82:06----------
sorry do you want me to help you stop


---------82:09----------
crying


---------82:12----------
yeah sure i'm asking it's a genuine


---------82:15----------
question


---------82:16----------
yeah i'm hinted


---------82:20----------
okay um i'll give you a second cause now


---------82:23----------
i gotta figure


---------82:24----------
out how i'm gonna do that


---------82:27----------
worked good job i was like oh [ __ ]


---------82:31----------
he said yes i wasn't expecting that doc


---------82:36----------
this is the part where you say no this


---------82:37----------
feels good i'm i'm feeling so good


---------82:40----------
no like i need to cry like a television


---------82:42----------
it's like no he said yes


---------82:47----------
what do i do i'm sorry he's supposed


---------82:53----------
he's supposed to feel free and it's


---------82:54----------
supposed to be good he's supposed to be


---------82:55----------
able to handle it


---------82:57----------
yeah it was good but it's what everyone


---------82:59----------
goes for


---------83:02----------
i am quick


---------83:14----------
[Music]


---------83:15----------
[Laughter]


---------83:33----------
no i mean it's it's fine yeah i felt


---------83:36----------
like


---------83:37----------
if i was gonna say no that was gonna be


---------83:38----------
weird yeah and i


---------83:40----------
just wanna have to like watching me cry


---------83:42----------
for five minutes so


---------83:44----------
yeah yeah no i mean i'm totally fine


---------83:46----------
watching you cry i


---------83:48----------
you know it's you know that's that's


---------83:50----------
cool that's what we


---------83:51----------
come here to do a little bit


---------83:55----------
if it's like if it makes if it takes


---------83:59----------
things into like a different perspective


---------84:00----------
it's also rare that i


---------84:02----------
genuinely have so that's like the first


---------84:04----------
for two things now


---------84:05----------
yeah yeah yeah well i i did get the


---------84:08----------
sense that that was a


---------84:10----------
not quite as a defensive of a laugh


---------84:13----------
no yeah that was that was genuine yeah


---------84:16----------
it was a funny reaction um


---------84:24----------
so doc i feel like there's a lot to say


---------84:27----------
but i also feel like um


---------84:35----------
maybe it should be said at another time


---------84:37----------
in another place like i think it's


---------84:38----------
important to process what we talked


---------84:40----------
about


---------84:41----------
i'd like to still talk about one or two


---------84:42----------
things if that's okay with you but i


---------84:44----------
just kind of want to check in with you


---------84:45----------
about


---------84:46----------
you know where's your stamina bar right


---------84:48----------
now


---------84:50----------
okay um do you want me do you want me to


---------84:53----------
answer that directly or say is that like


---------84:55----------
in regards to maybe a


---------84:58----------
sort of aspect of my life no i mean like


---------85:01----------
like


---------85:02----------
for this conversation like where are you


---------85:04----------
oh like in terms of


---------85:06----------
so uh actually i'm still full


---------85:09----------
it's like i can still go on okay


---------85:12----------
okay so so uh in my experience


---------85:15----------
when we have something like this which


---------85:18----------
is sort of like


---------85:19----------
uh you know a good cry


---------85:22----------
followed by a genuine laugh like that's


---------85:24----------
what healing


---------85:26----------
sort of can look like sometimes but it's


---------85:28----------
also like


---------85:29----------
we should give ourselves the time and


---------85:31----------
space


---------85:32----------
to kind of process and decompress from


---------85:34----------
that a little bit


---------85:36----------
i want to share i think a couple of um


---------85:39----------
almost like more practical


---------85:42----------
thoughts and questions for you um the


---------85:45----------
first is i'd like to explain a little


---------85:47----------
bit about


---------85:48----------
um you know your experience of living in


---------85:52----------
the third person


---------85:54----------
and share some terms and and concepts


---------85:57----------
and things like that


---------85:58----------
i'm also really curious about what your


---------86:00----------
romantic relationships are like


---------86:03----------
oh that's all so i guess


---------86:07----------
that's gonna be


---------86:11----------
you know so so i'm i'm kind of curious


---------86:12----------
about that


---------86:14----------
uh um give me just one second


---------86:20----------
and you know just like because i i can


---------86:23----------
imagine that


---------86:24----------
a lot of what we're talking about will


---------86:28----------
you know make romantic it'll complicate


---------86:32----------
your experience of a romantic


---------86:34----------
relationship


---------86:36----------
i'm surprised that that's something you


---------86:39----------
um


---------86:40----------
uh that's the conclusion you could draw


---------86:42----------
out of her because it's true


---------86:43----------
um anyway i just didn't think that


---------86:46----------
that's something that's like correlating


---------86:49----------
but yeah it's very true um


---------86:52----------
because i don't do would you like me to


---------86:54----------
answer it right now or


---------86:56----------
i i mean so so i you know i am curious


---------86:59----------
about it i think that


---------87:00----------
i imagine we could spend another you


---------87:02----------
know hour and a half talking just about


---------87:04----------
that


---------87:05----------
um so i'd love to hear a little bit but


---------87:08----------
yeah so i mean please yeah i i mean i


---------87:11----------
can like


---------87:12----------
sort of put it shortly but um i've had a


---------87:14----------
lot of relationships


---------87:16----------
like in my life in general after like


---------87:20----------
turning into a normal to like to


---------87:23----------
to put it like that and um


---------87:26----------
it for me it's rarely been the case that


---------87:29----------
i was actually


---------87:31----------
genuinely genuinely romantically


---------87:32----------
invested to be honest it's more like


---------87:35----------
people would um come up to me uh


---------87:38----------
i would like i would talk to them and


---------87:40----------
eventually it would


---------87:41----------
just like the topic of romans would come


---------87:43----------
up


---------87:44----------
and for me it was just like a matter of


---------87:48----------
saying yes to someone because i didn't


---------87:49----------
want to see them cry and i didn't


---------87:51----------
dislike them enough to not feel like i


---------87:53----------
could have that sort of relationship


---------87:55----------
with them if that makes sense


---------87:56----------
but i never really have i guess


---------87:58----------
infatuation like


---------88:00----------
i don't really have any sort of feelings


---------88:02----------
of infatuation fortunately for anyone


---------88:04----------
um and


---------88:08----------
it usually just led to


---------88:11----------
relationships but for me felt like just


---------88:14----------
a friendship plus


---------88:15----------
almost but like you know obviously i


---------88:16----------
wouldn't like i wasn't gonna like


---------88:18----------
trample my feelings i wasn't gonna


---------88:21----------
do like i wasn't gonna cheat on them or


---------88:22----------
anything that's not it but more like


---------88:25----------
i just felt like i was almost like


---------88:29----------
yeah not not invested romantically um i


---------88:32----------
still


---------88:33----------
i still enjoyed their company i still


---------88:35----------
like them and loved them as friends


---------88:36----------
almost like


---------88:37----------
[Music]


---------88:38----------
yeah and but that changed at some point


---------88:42----------
when i met someone who's nowadays my


---------88:44----------
best friend


---------88:45----------
ima like ever it's like unimaginable


---------88:49----------
how compatible we are if you're watching


---------88:51----------
hi


---------88:52----------
um but this person is


---------88:56----------
it's it feels like having a mental twin


---------88:58----------
almost and this person is um


---------89:01----------
someone who actually wasn't let's just


---------89:04----------
say


---------89:04----------
they actually don't um look for the


---------89:07----------
gender that i am they actually look for


---------89:09----------
women but


---------89:10----------
um still worked out for some reason


---------89:12----------
because we were just so


---------89:15----------
almost i guess excited about the fact


---------89:17----------
that there's someone who


---------89:20----------
is that compatible with us if that makes


---------89:22----------
sense


---------89:23----------
and at some point it just uh


---------89:27----------
uh we just figured we would try it out


---------89:30----------
worked for a few months but eventually


---------89:32----------
yeah no it's like this is it's weird


---------89:35----------
since um


---------89:36----------
like just our sexual orientations


---------89:38----------
weren't um


---------89:40----------
working they're like working in time i


---------89:42----------
might say yeah but we're still


---------89:44----------
best friends and yeah


---------89:48----------
so someone like the most


---------89:52----------
important person in my life i would say


---------89:54----------
um


---------89:56----------
yeah so in every but ever since then


---------89:59----------
i've tried to see if i can have that


---------90:03----------
sort of feeling for anyone else which i


---------90:04----------
can't


---------90:05----------
it's um it just won't work it happened


---------90:07----------
for some reason


---------90:08----------
and it's uh but also um


---------90:12----------
i've remembered some this is gonna be um


---------90:14----------
this is gonna be a bit depressing again


---------90:17----------
uh i've remembered some stuff in my life


---------90:19----------
that happened which i


---------90:21----------
apparently managed to lock away which


---------90:24----------
somehow led me to just be almost


---------90:27----------
completely unable to


---------90:28----------
um i say that


---------90:32----------
i don't really feel like any sort of


---------90:33----------
like sexual attraction to people anymore


---------90:35----------
in general


---------90:37----------
um and it feels like nowadays


---------90:40----------
back then i used to be with a lot of


---------90:42----------
women just


---------90:43----------
um because like with a lot of women who


---------90:46----------
were also like


---------90:47----------
with a lot of men i'm not i didn't like


---------90:49----------
break any heights but


---------90:50----------
i was very uh active in that regards


---------90:52----------
because i felt like


---------90:53----------
if i'm with someone if i'm uh if i get


---------90:56----------
intimate with someone then i feel like


---------90:58----------
i'm still desirable


---------90:59----------
almost that's kind of like i think that


---------91:00----------
was like subconsciously going on in my


---------91:03----------
mind


---------91:04----------
but eventually that um


---------91:08----------
it didn't feel like that anymore it just


---------91:09----------
feels like it's uncomfortable for me now


---------91:11----------
and i don't really get like romantically


---------91:13----------
close to anyone anymore


---------91:15----------
yeah okay thanks for sharing that i


---------91:18----------
thought that was a


---------91:19----------
great summary so i think it makes sense


---------91:22----------
for a lack of a better term um and and


---------91:25----------
here's so here's here's kind of like the


---------91:27----------
main so i think there's a lot to


---------91:30----------
talk about so you know


---------91:33----------
i'll make a recommendation now and later


---------91:36----------
in more detail that


---------91:37----------
i think i don't know if you ever seen a


---------91:38----------
mental health treatment provider like a


---------91:40----------
therapist


---------91:42----------
yeah um like right after that uh like


---------91:44----------
right after my mom died um


---------91:46----------
we were assigned to someone who was very


---------91:49----------
kind


---------91:49----------
uh fair but i don't know she was a


---------91:53----------
therapist but it also felt like just


---------91:55----------
talking to a friend to be honest like


---------91:56----------
nothing really


---------91:58----------
it there's not really anything that came


---------92:00----------
out of it


---------92:02----------
so a lot of times when we you know when


---------92:05----------
people come on here i'll say


---------92:06----------
you know you should consider working


---------92:07----------
with our coaches or work with a


---------92:08----------
therapist in your case i'd say you


---------92:10----------
should definitely work with a therapist


---------92:12----------
so yeah i was gonna sign up for a coach


---------92:15----------
at first but


---------92:16----------
i figured probably that's too much i


---------92:18----------
mean like i think i think coaching is


---------92:20----------
i'm sure that coaching will you'll do


---------92:22----------
well in coaching but i i think


---------92:24----------
for what i'm about to explain i i think


---------92:26----------
um


---------92:27----------
therapy is definitely like worthwhile


---------92:31----------
now so i just want to be clear so i'm


---------92:36----------
not sure that


---------92:36----------
you know you have an illness or anything


---------92:38----------
i'm not diagnosing you with anything but


---------92:40----------
like


---------92:41----------
what what it really is huh i've been


---------92:44----------
diagnosed with ptsd but


---------92:46----------
somehow i don't feel like i it's weird


---------92:48----------
to say it's like


---------92:49----------
unless uh this feeling of like


---------92:52----------
completely numbed out emotions


---------92:53----------
is part of it i don't really see it all


---------92:55----------
that much it is part of it


---------92:58----------
okay so we're gonna explain that in a


---------92:59----------
second but but i'm not i'm not


---------93:02----------
surprised anyone is gonna diagnose you


---------93:05----------
with ptsd just to be safe given your


---------93:07----------
story


---------93:08----------
because there's no way that some that


---------93:10----------
this stuff happens to you and you don't


---------93:11----------
wind up with ptsd


---------93:13----------
at the same time i i don't know that


---------93:15----------
there's really like a clinical


---------93:16----------
like you know there are a lot of


---------93:17----------
questions that when we diagnose with


---------93:19----------
someone with ptsd like you have


---------93:20----------
nightmares flashbacks things like that


---------93:22----------
but i think that like this is definitely


---------93:24----------
so here's what i'm


---------93:25----------
i'm hearing from you doc is that your


---------93:28----------
life and your experiences


---------93:31----------
have shaped the way that you interact


---------93:35----------
with life


---------93:37----------
yeah right so so and the biggest thing


---------93:39----------
is like so this is like now a


---------93:41----------
psychological term


---------93:42----------
so i get some degree of


---------93:45----------
i think probably depersonalization


---------93:48----------
so with trauma our our brains can do two


---------93:52----------
things


---------93:53----------
they can it create a situation of


---------93:56----------
derealization or depersonalization


---------93:59----------
so dear really derealization is the


---------94:01----------
feeling that the world that you're


---------94:03----------
existing in does not feel real


---------94:06----------
you are real but the world becomes fake


---------94:08----------
so it's like i feel like


---------94:10----------
i'm living in a video game


---------94:13----------
the other thing that people experience


---------94:15----------
is sort of the opposite which i think


---------94:16----------
you're more depersonalization which is


---------94:18----------
that


---------94:19----------
i'm like i feel like i'm not actually


---------94:21----------
living my life


---------94:23----------
but i'm watching a character who's like


---------94:25----------
playing a video game


---------94:26----------
take the actions of my life so


---------94:29----------
i am not real i would


---------94:32----------
i think i would even like describe it as


---------94:34----------
me being the person who's playing the


---------94:36----------
character like uh it's free to explain


---------94:38----------
but like it feels like i'm


---------94:40----------
remote controlling myself absolutely so


---------94:42----------
did i say the word controller


---------94:44----------
or was i just thinking anyway so so what


---------94:47----------
i'll like


---------94:48----------
anyway so so the other way that i kind


---------94:51----------
of think about it is like you know i do


---------94:52----------
get the sense that


---------94:53----------
you are controlling yourself living life


---------94:56----------
right like the doc is playing the


---------94:59----------
character


---------95:00----------
of whatever your real name is who is


---------95:04----------
existing


---------95:05----------
you know presumably in germany in 2021


---------95:09----------
so that sounds to me like


---------95:11----------
depersonalization and that's actually a


---------95:12----------
feature of trauma and if we really look


---------95:14----------
at it like why does this happen


---------95:16----------
it's because when we have these very


---------95:18----------
traumatic experiences


---------95:20----------
our mind kind of unplugs from the


---------95:23----------
reality of it


---------95:25----------
and and and so in some cases like these


---------95:27----------
these periods will be like very very


---------95:29----------
like


---------95:30----------
acute and temporary so people will have


---------95:33----------
like periods of derealization where it's


---------95:35----------
almost like they're like


---------95:37----------
you know on psilocybin or lsd or


---------95:39----------
something where they like kind of feel


---------95:40----------
like completely disconnected and it's


---------95:43----------
like a trippy kind of surreal


---------95:45----------
sometimes scary experience sometimes


---------95:47----------
they'll also be associated with like


---------95:49----------
amnesia episodes where like people will


---------95:51----------
have a fugue state


---------95:53----------
where you wake up in a different place


---------95:55----------
like 30 hours later and you have no


---------95:57----------
memory of it


---------95:58----------
so our brain has yeah it can be weird


---------96:01----------
but like our brain has all these


---------96:03----------
mechanisms to essentially like


---------96:05----------
unplug from traumatic situations because


---------96:09----------
they hurt and it's been really


---------96:11----------
interesting because the first thing that


---------96:12----------
you said is that you know i feel like


---------96:14----------
i'm living life in the third person


---------96:16----------
and then just now when we kind of when


---------96:18----------
you cried for


---------96:19----------
you know some amount of time and it's


---------96:21----------
been a while you said like


---------96:22----------
you try to avoid it because it feels


---------96:25----------
real


---------96:26----------
and i'm making it real again when i


---------96:28----------
think about it


---------96:29----------
so i think it's good to make it real in


---------96:31----------
a way like


---------96:33----------
it's hard to explain yeah so so we'll


---------96:35----------
talk so so that's the thing right so i


---------96:37----------
want you to just pay attention to like


---------96:38----------
the language that i'm sending back at


---------96:40----------
you


---------96:41----------
life feels like not realish right like


---------96:44----------
i'm living it in the third person


---------96:46----------
like there's no point in the maid quest


---------96:48----------
it's all about the side quests it's


---------96:50----------
about the periphery it's not about like


---------96:52----------
my life third person autopilot side


---------96:56----------
character


---------96:56----------
side quests you are the npc in other


---------96:59----------
people's lives


---------97:00----------
instead of being the pc right like


---------97:03----------
you're like


---------97:04----------
yeah like it's kind of weird like even


---------97:06----------
when it comes to your romantic


---------97:07----------
relationships and stuff like that


---------97:09----------
you are the person that they have to


---------97:11----------
date before they find the one they love


---------97:13----------
you're like the npc in their story


---------97:15----------
it's not your story they're attracted to


---------97:17----------
you


---------97:18----------
they're infatuated with you they


---------97:19----------
approach you


---------97:21----------
so you're like you're you know it's kind


---------97:23----------
of weird


---------97:24----------
i got i got a really good um this is


---------97:27----------
something that i talked about with my


---------97:28----------
old therapist once uh where she was


---------97:30----------
asking me since i


---------97:31----------
told her since i also told her that i


---------97:33----------
felt like


---------97:35----------
some sort of superiority almost over


---------97:37----------
people um


---------97:38----------
like just from like a cognitive point


---------97:40----------
not actually feeling like i'm


---------97:42----------
better as like i'm a better person or


---------97:44----------
yeah worth more just but i can do more


---------97:46----------
sometimes um


---------97:49----------
uh and she asked me if i felt like a


---------97:50----------
king i said uh and i replied and i think


---------97:53----------
the best


---------97:53----------
like the best summary of what i feel


---------97:56----------
like is what i said


---------97:57----------
i'd rather be the um i know i'd rather


---------98:00----------
be the person telling the king what to


---------98:02----------
do rather than


---------98:02----------
the actual king that makes sense like


---------98:04----------
sure i want to be an advisor


---------98:06----------
yeah it feels more comfortable yeah so


---------98:08----------
that's the role of the npc right


---------98:11----------
it's like you're not yeah so so i i


---------98:13----------
think that there's


---------98:14----------
there's just a very it feels to me like


---------98:15----------
there's a very simple connection between


---------98:18----------
making it real again and


---------98:22----------
like living your main quest because i


---------98:25----------
think what you've managed to do


---------98:27----------
is like put your main quest on pause


---------98:30----------
like on purpose and for survival


---------98:34----------
because it's just too much man like


---------98:36----------
there's just too much


---------98:40----------
right there's like all the low value


---------98:42----------
stuff from early


---------98:44----------
on like not like and that would have


---------98:45----------
been enough man that's enough to get you


---------98:47----------
on stream


---------98:49----------
that's enough to talk about and then you


---------98:52----------
toss in


---------98:53----------
yeah go ahead uh sorry i just wanted to


---------98:56----------
say that


---------98:57----------
this is like one of the weirdest things


---------98:59----------
to tell people but like i i do believe


---------99:01----------
that


---------99:02----------
to some extent at least um what happened


---------99:05----------
like


---------99:05----------
the stuff that was continuously


---------99:07----------
happening in my childhood and like


---------99:08----------
up until the point where people stopped


---------99:10----------
bullying me and by like started getting


---------99:12----------
actually like popular


---------99:14----------
that stuff probably sticks more to my


---------99:15----------
head than anything else it's uh


---------99:17----------
as weird as it sounds no so i don't


---------99:19----------
think that sounds weird at all like so


---------99:20----------
you can


---------99:21----------
i mean you even told us that it can be a


---------99:23----------
confusing


---------99:24----------
observation that your teacher bullying


---------99:27----------
you


---------99:28----------
feels more traumatic than


---------99:31----------
you know i feel weird even saying this


---------99:32----------
but your stepfather


---------99:35----------
killing your mom and then committing


---------99:36----------
suicide and and yet


---------99:38----------
i encourage everyone to just notice that


---------99:40----------
if we want to be good


---------99:42----------
scientists we need to let our


---------99:45----------
observations shape our hypotheses


---------99:48----------
instead of letting our hypotheses shape


---------99:50----------
our observations


---------99:53----------
right and if that's what your experience


---------99:55----------
is so much of like


---------99:56----------
our so much of the reason that we get


---------100:00----------
the okay


---------100:00----------
sorry what are you feeling


---------100:03----------
oh for me it's just um


---------100:06----------
i don't know how to explain it it's i


---------100:08----------
think it's just like the nature of it


---------100:10----------
being so


---------100:11----------
such a continuous thing and it's not


---------100:13----------
even just about like teachers bullying


---------100:14----------
me i could have dealt with that it's the


---------100:16----------
fact that


---------100:16----------
everyone joined in and that feeling of


---------100:20----------
like


---------100:20----------
there's nothing desirable about me and


---------100:23----------
that's something that


---------100:25----------
is really hard to check even now i often


---------100:27----------
feel like


---------100:29----------
i can actually see a lot of people


---------100:31----------
relating to this when friends call me up


---------100:33----------
and ask me to come out


---------100:35----------
oftentimes i'd say no even though i know


---------100:38----------
i would have


---------100:38----------
more fun going out with them than i


---------100:40----------
would have staying in


---------100:42----------
just because i don't want to feel that i


---------100:44----------
don't want to feel uncomfortable


---------100:45----------
in the way that i


---------100:48----------
feel like when i'm outside i'm exposing


---------100:50----------
myself to


---------100:52----------
the change just the chance that i might


---------100:54----------
do something that might make


---------100:56----------
people look bad at me like might make


---------100:58----------
people


---------100:59----------
look at me in a way that's just um


---------101:02----------
like i'm weird against everything like


---------101:04----------
that even though i know it's not going


---------101:05----------
to happen it's just something that


---------101:06----------
always stays in my mind yeah absolutely


---------101:08----------
right because


---------101:09----------
and the reason it stays in your mind is


---------101:11----------
because it was put into your mind


---------101:13----------
over and over and over and over and over


---------101:16----------
and over again


---------101:17----------
this is where when we get to your sort


---------101:18----------
of like asexuality and inability to be


---------101:21----------
infatuated with people because i i think


---------101:23----------
that like this is where you know this is


---------101:25----------
a little bit more bread and butter like


---------101:27----------
you have to really think a little bit


---------101:28----------
about if you cared about someone


---------101:32----------
and if you were in love


---------101:37----------
how would it so you have that colonel


---------101:40----------
like you have that core of


---------101:41----------
unlovableness right like everyone dog


---------101:44----------
piling on


---------101:45----------
and as long as that exists i don't think


---------101:47----------
you will let yourself fall in love with


---------101:49----------
anyone


---------101:52----------
because i think so too i i'd have to be


---------101:55----------
very very comfortable with that person


---------101:57----------
yeah and and that's where like so it


---------101:59----------
seems that when you get your


---------102:00----------
you know your your twin


---------102:04----------
your mental clone like that you can


---------102:06----------
actually start to have those sorts of


---------102:07----------
feelings but


---------102:08----------
i i think it's sort of like like because


---------102:10----------
it's just too much of a risk right it's


---------102:12----------
gonna hurt


---------102:13----------
like it's fine for teachers and other


---------102:15----------
randos to bully you like it's fine for


---------102:17----------
your friends


---------102:17----------
you don't don't really know who you are


---------102:20----------
to like not invite you somewhere totally


---------102:22----------
fine


---------102:23----------
but if you let yourself love someone


---------102:26----------
and they respond to you in the way that


---------102:29----------
many people have in which you're


---------102:32----------
terrified of happening like that's going


---------102:33----------
to be too much


---------102:36----------
yeah because and the weird thing is it's


---------102:38----------
not even like the


---------102:40----------
um it's gonna sound bad i think uh it's


---------102:43----------
not even like about me


---------102:45----------
being afraid to lose someone that i know


---------102:48----------
as much as i'm afraid to lose that


---------102:51----------
slight grip on reality but i have but


---------102:54----------
maybe i


---------102:55----------
is something lovable above you that


---------102:56----------
makes sense exactly


---------102:58----------
so that's so you're absolutely because


---------103:00----------
because right now there's still a


---------103:01----------
question mark right


---------103:02----------
in your mind there's still a question


---------103:04----------
mark that maybe i am lovable


---------103:06----------
but if ever you love and that person


---------103:10----------
finds you unlovable then it's like it's


---------103:13----------
going to be the final nail in the coffin


---------103:15----------
yeah which which makes perfect i mean


---------103:18----------
it's not true


---------103:19----------
but it makes perfect sense does that


---------103:21----------
make sense like do you understand the


---------103:23----------
difference there


---------103:24----------
yeah okay so and this is why i think


---------103:27----------
this is really like therapy level stuff


---------103:29----------
so so like like when you


---------103:30----------
when you have someone who has been


---------103:33----------
through as much as you have


---------103:35----------
i think it takes really like a good


---------103:37----------
therapist


---------103:38----------
to help you


---------103:41----------
start the process of like making life


---------103:45----------
real again


---------103:46----------
because i don't think it's like it's not


---------103:48----------
like a malfunction it's a survival


---------103:49----------
mechanism


---------103:50----------
right so you've de-personalized you've


---------103:52----------
like withdrawn from life


---------103:54----------
because life like hurts way too much


---------103:58----------
yeah pretty much and this is where you


---------104:01----------
can also get into other kinds of things


---------104:03----------
like like you know maybe the reason that


---------104:05----------
the teacher's


---------104:06----------
bullying you hurts more is because


---------104:09----------
you'll let yourself get closer to that


---------104:12----------
whereas like when it comes to your mom


---------104:14----------
you really have to do your level best


---------104:16----------
because the guilt and stuff especially


---------104:17----------
we don't even touched on that


---------104:19----------
but like that you know so like all those


---------104:21----------
things doc i think at the end of the day


---------104:23----------
like i think you are a good person i'm


---------104:25----------
not just saying that because i'm dr k


---------104:26----------
like i think like


---------104:27----------
genuinely like you seem like a good dude


---------104:31----------
right and i'm not trying to pity you


---------104:35----------
but like i think i get to a little bit


---------104:38----------
right i don't like you because i pity


---------104:40----------
you but i think like you gotta let me


---------104:42----------
pity you somewhat


---------104:45----------
and i i can like you as a person


---------104:47----------
independent of the pity i hope you can


---------104:49----------
see that like i


---------104:50----------
i can see you as being a good dude i


---------104:52----------
mean you're dank


---------104:54----------
you made some money on crypto you're


---------104:57----------
busting out the lull analogies


---------104:59----------
and maybe that's you being a chameleon


---------105:01----------
for me


---------105:03----------
you know but i i don't just listen to it


---------105:05----------
but it's also


---------105:06----------
yeah i mean a little bit but this is


---------105:08----------
also like part of my core personality


---------105:10----------
just


---------105:10----------
uh i like making these metaphors that


---------105:12----------
are easy to


---------105:13----------
so so like i can like you for those


---------105:16----------
reasons


---------105:17----------
and have compassion and pity because it


---------105:19----------
sounds like boy have you been through a


---------105:21----------
lot


---------105:24----------
i guess that's like the sort of thing


---------105:26----------
that


---------105:28----------
prevents me from telling people because


---------105:29----------
i don't want them to think that i'm just


---------105:31----------
saying it for attention because that's


---------105:32----------
like


---------105:33----------
because you saw an uncle do that and you


---------105:35----------
know what that you know what


---------105:36----------
manipulating people in the compassion


---------105:38----------
looks like and you don't want to do that


---------105:39----------
which makes sense


---------105:41----------
yeah so so you know just the last thing


---------105:44----------
that i'd leave you with doc is like


---------105:46----------
there's this principle from


---------105:47----------
from indian philosophy called advaith


---------105:50----------
vedanta


---------105:52----------
which i think is a very useful way to


---------105:55----------
overcome conflicting emotions


---------105:59----------
and what advice vedanta says is that


---------106:01----------
essentially like


---------106:02----------
dualism or conflict is like an


---------106:05----------
artificial construction of the mind


---------106:08----------
and that reality just has like one


---------106:12----------
quality so like if we think about you


---------106:15----------
know is this a good glass of water


---------106:17----------
or a bad glass of water like neither


---------106:19----------
it's just a good glass of water


---------106:20----------
whether it's good or bad has to do with


---------106:24----------
the constructions that my mind puts on


---------106:27----------
top of it


---------106:28----------
and so i'd say your road forward


---------106:31----------
involves probably some combination of


---------106:33----------
like therapy to start out


---------106:36----------
second thing is you have to learn how to


---------106:37----------
love again yeah


---------106:40----------
and then third thing on a really


---------106:42----------
spiritual level and i think this is your


---------106:44----------
main quest because i think that some of


---------106:46----------
these


---------106:47----------
qualities that you describe about the


---------106:49----------
plebs and like your level of awareness


---------106:52----------
actually speaks to me of a certain


---------106:54----------
spiritual


---------106:56----------
iq right like it's not even necessarily


---------106:59----------
emotional i think


---------107:00----------
it even extends kind of beyond that and


---------107:03----------
then i think your real happiness is


---------107:04----------
going to be


---------107:05----------
when when you can sit and this is also


---------107:07----------
kind of involved in


---------107:09----------
in treatment for ppd for example like


---------107:11----------
when you have all of these conflicting


---------107:13----------
emotions that like both of them can


---------107:14----------
coexist


---------107:16----------
and be real and ultimately like even


---------107:18----------
beyond that you don't even have a head


---------107:20----------
or a heart that's actually an artificial


---------107:22----------
construction


---------107:23----------
and what you are is like


---------107:26----------
just something that's even formless


---------107:30----------
but that takes time and you know you can


---------107:33----------
do that long term


---------107:35----------
i guess to a degree formless that's


---------107:36----------
something but i don't really do feel but


---------107:37----------
i guess in a more negative


---------107:39----------
sort of way yeah so so for yeah so so


---------107:42----------
that that form like so even formless


---------107:45----------
is like not advice because


---------107:48----------
formless and form is actually like


---------107:51----------
two opposites right so there's there's a


---------107:53----------
there's a way to even transcend that


---------107:54----------
axis


---------107:55----------
and not feel formless or feel form but


---------107:58----------
just to feel


---------108:01----------
i feel period not anything on the other


---------108:04----------
end and i know it's kind of getting kind


---------108:05----------
of weird and abstract there but like


---------108:08----------
just for you to kind of exist and and as


---------108:11----------
as you understand advice then you do


---------108:13----------
particular kinds of meditation practices


---------108:15----------
you know like this sort of idea that


---------108:17----------
like it clearly isn't your fault what


---------108:19----------
happened to your mom


---------108:21----------
and you feel responsible so those two


---------108:24----------
things can feel conflicting


---------108:28----------
and you can work on transcending both of


---------108:31----------
those


---------108:34----------
yeah that's going to be hard it's going


---------108:37----------
to be helpful


---------108:38----------
that's step three end of the main quest


---------108:41----------
my dude


---------108:43----------
step one is seriously you should see a


---------108:45----------
therapist man like and


---------108:46----------
it's just like you you deserve some help


---------108:50----------
in the process of putting yourself back


---------108:52----------
together


---------108:53----------
which i i think it's clear you're a


---------108:55----------
survivor and like you've managed


---------108:57----------
amazingly well with you know


---------109:00----------
a lot of bad rng


---------109:04----------
i mean i i mean i'd also like


---------109:07----------
for this session i've been only talking


---------109:09----------
about like bad stuff in my life but i


---------109:11----------
i think something that really helped me


---------109:13----------
cope with


---------109:15----------
enough is just like the exact opposite


---------109:17----------
of what's plagued me in my


---------109:18----------
uh earlier just because nowadays i'm


---------109:21----------
very


---------109:22----------
um sort of popular where i live


---------109:25----------
um people um there's a lot of people who


---------109:28----------
i can


---------109:29----------
trust um at least like my brain knows i


---------109:33----------
can trust them


---------109:33----------
like they're just metaphorically


---------109:35----------
speaking again my heart will never do


---------109:36----------
but it's


---------109:38----------
like um or it will always tell me that i


---------109:40----------
shouldn't but i know that i can i love


---------109:42----------
these people to death


---------109:43----------
um and they've been really


---------109:47----------
good at keeping me company over like my


---------109:49----------
worst time of it


---------109:50----------
of course um as i said again um


---------109:54----------
so it's a funny story actually i met


---------109:56----------
these people like most of them of my


---------109:58----------
nowadays best friends like at all i met


---------110:01----------
them


---------110:01----------
in um my time working in my casino


---------110:04----------
[Music]


---------110:06----------
they used to be like in a school next to


---------110:09----------
mine


---------110:09----------
we were just like very very very like


---------110:14----------
far acquaintances i'd say like we didn't


---------110:16----------
really know which other world but


---------110:17----------
we knew each other's names that's it we


---------110:19----------
just started talking i just


---------110:20----------
turned out that they were the type of


---------110:22----------
people who are like extremely compatible


---------110:24----------
with the person that i am when i'm at my


---------110:26----------
most comfortable


---------110:27----------
if that makes sense because they are the


---------110:28----------
type to


---------110:30----------
if they have a problem with you they'll


---------110:31----------
just straight up tell you they don't


---------110:33----------
have any like


---------110:35----------
they don't really talk about anyone


---------110:36----------
behind their backs but they just make


---------110:38----------
fun of you right in front of your face


---------110:40----------
and then we'll also make sure that you


---------110:42----------
know it's okay though like they make fun


---------110:44----------
of you but we're trying to make you


---------110:45----------
laugh with them


---------110:46----------
i love these people today and they


---------110:48----------
helped me a lot with


---------110:49----------
um what was going on back then


---------110:52----------
and also stupid thing to say about this


---------110:55----------
just


---------110:56----------
as a server on discover also there's a


---------110:58----------
few people who really helped me


---------111:00----------
just by being who they are um they know


---------111:03----------
they're probably watching too


---------111:06----------
um oh sorry was that me or you


---------111:10----------
okay need something


---------111:17----------
i don't know anyway i'm sure if it's


---------111:24----------
yeah um sorry but it sounds like you've


---------111:28----------
had


---------111:28----------
a lot of really important people who


---------111:30----------
have helped you through hard times


---------111:31----------
both in person and on discord


---------111:35----------
yeah and to a degree um taking care of


---------111:37----------
my sister also really


---------111:39----------
um in a way gave me a goal that


---------111:42----------
i i don't know previously didn't think i


---------111:45----------
had


---------111:46----------
just something to do basically to


---------111:49----------
yeah and um it felt really nice to like


---------111:53----------
see her grow up to be like a really well


---------111:56----------
adjusted


---------111:57----------
and nice person and i often like to say


---------112:00----------
that she's like


---------112:01----------
who i would be if i didn't have any


---------112:04----------
problems at all like not uh i didn't


---------112:05----------
have any problems but if i didn't have


---------112:06----------
any like behavioral


---------112:07----------
behavior and problems if that makes


---------112:08----------
sense she's um


---------112:11----------
i know she's got strength i got


---------112:12----------
weaknesses basically she's i'm very


---------112:14----------
proud of her for that


---------112:17----------
it's been but it just feels good to like


---------112:21----------
that's why i said before what would she


---------112:23----------
say about you


---------112:25----------
um i'm pretty sure i could just ask her


---------112:27----------
right now but


---------112:29----------
i'm pretty sure that she would probably
