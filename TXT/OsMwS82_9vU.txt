and then really when you got banned from


---------00:01----------
twitch you were sort of like i'm getting


---------00:03----------
a sense of like


---------00:04----------
you know desperation and fear really


---------00:07----------
that all this stuff was gonna be taken


---------00:08----------
away and like you'd pay


---------00:09----------
any price to hang on to it any price


---------00:16----------
this uh with like i don't know like a


---------00:19----------
doctor before like just mental health


---------00:21----------
and stuff so


---------00:23----------
yeah i can i can imagine um you know i


---------00:26----------
think a lot of people


---------00:27----------
are do tend to be nervous i think um you


---------00:29----------
know just so you know


---------00:30----------
we're recording this for upload later


---------00:32----------
right we on the same page about that


---------00:34----------
okay


---------00:35----------
um yeah so


---------00:38----------
what are you what do you uh help me


---------00:40----------
understand what you're nervous about


---------00:43----------
well i mean uh well when i was younger i


---------00:47----------
did go to therapy but it's been so long


---------00:49----------
it's been like


---------00:49----------
you know 15 years um i mean i just have


---------00:53----------
a lot of uh things that i've just


---------00:56----------
gone through in my life that uh


---------00:59----------
is hard to talk about and i


---------01:02----------
usually don't feel comfortable talking


---------01:04----------
about it to my viewers


---------01:06----------
because you know they wouldn't some of


---------01:09----------
them


---------01:09----------
may not respect what i say so i i just


---------01:12----------
tend to keep things myself


---------01:14----------
okay um well you know just a couple of


---------01:16----------
like sim oh


---------01:17----------
a couple of simple ground rules um you


---------01:19----------
know the first is that anything that you


---------01:21----------
don't feel comfortable talking about you


---------01:22----------
don't have to talk about


---------01:24----------
um you know my goal is to try to you


---------01:27----------
know


---------01:28----------
maybe help you in some way or educate


---------01:30----------
you or


---------01:31----------
um you know maybe give you some


---------01:32----------
direction or guidance and if there's


---------01:34----------
some way i can do that that's fine but


---------01:36----------
you know the goal here is not to make


---------01:38----------
the masses happy


---------01:40----------
right and and so can you just start off


---------01:43----------
by telling me what do you what do you go


---------01:45----------
by


---------01:45----------
what should i call you um you can just


---------01:48----------
call me paul


---------01:49----------
okay um yeah paul so uh can you tell me


---------01:53----------
just uh


---------01:53----------
did and did you have a particular idea


---------01:55----------
of what you wanted to talk about today


---------01:59----------
i mean it would be nice to talk about um


---------02:03----------
just yeah i mean just i mean well so i


---------02:05----------
i've autism so that would be


---------02:06----------
interesting to talk about okay and also


---------02:09----------
just


---------02:10----------
personal growth and you know


---------02:13----------
things like that mental health when it


---------02:15----------
comes to streaming in a very stressful


---------02:18----------
environment i've streamed in some


---------02:20----------
stressful environments


---------02:22----------
yeah okay uh


---------02:25----------
and i i guess that's really it i don't i


---------02:27----------
don't know yeah no that's that sounds


---------02:29----------
great man


---------02:30----------
um so can you tell me a little bit you


---------02:31----------
say you have autism so


---------02:33----------
can you tell me a little bit about that


---------02:36----------
yeah


---------02:36----------
um so when i was younger um i don't


---------02:39----------
remember what age i was diagnosed with


---------02:41----------
asperger's


---------02:42----------
so that i think has played like a pretty


---------02:46----------
big role in my life


---------02:47----------
because i have a like it took me a while


---------02:50----------
to like


---------02:51----------
understand uh social


---------02:55----------
cues and like how you know how to just


---------02:57----------
how to be social sure when i was younger


---------02:59----------
i was like


---------03:00----------
super sheltered and always in my house


---------03:02----------
didn't have any friends and talk to


---------03:04----------
anybody had a


---------03:05----------
not a very good uh you know emotional


---------03:08----------
relationship with my parents


---------03:11----------
so i was very just to myself um


---------03:15----------
and i i think that also still carries


---------03:17----------
with me today in streaming


---------03:19----------
can you tell me um i mean if it carries


---------03:22----------
with you is it okay if i ask some


---------03:23----------
questions about that


---------03:25----------
yeah that's fine i mean i'm totally open


---------03:27----------
with you i just you know because


---------03:29----------
you can help guide me through how to


---------03:31----------
talk about this


---------03:32----------
sure so um can you tell me a little bit


---------03:34----------
about what growing up was like for you


---------03:38----------
i mean it was pretty terrible it was uh


---------03:41----------
i mean my parents are good people like


---------03:43----------
they're nice


---------03:44----------
and i love them but you know they just


---------03:46----------
didn't uh


---------03:47----------
i just i just don't think they were on


---------03:48----------
the same page as me they would always


---------03:50----------
bring me to


---------03:51----------
like brought me to therapist they put me


---------03:53----------
on different medicine


---------03:54----------
and you know but they just never really


---------03:56----------
i don't think understood how to


---------03:59----------
um you know just communicate with me


---------04:01----------
when i was going through a lot of my


---------04:03----------
issues so it caused me to be a very


---------04:05----------
angry


---------04:07----------
child an angry person growing up and you


---------04:09----------
know that caused me to lash out at


---------04:11----------
school


---------04:12----------
lash out against other people lash out


---------04:14----------
on my parents


---------04:16----------
um and uh so my my childhood was very


---------04:20----------
you know it was full of a lot of


---------04:22----------
problems and i had i was like a


---------04:24----------
very troubled kid yeah it sounds like


---------04:26----------
you were kind of misunderstood and


---------04:28----------
didn't know really how to handle that


---------04:32----------
yeah i mean i think looking back on it


---------04:35----------
whenever i would get angry or upset


---------04:37----------
i just wouldn't know how to express


---------04:39----------
myself and my parents


---------04:41----------
didn't know what to do so because i


---------04:44----------
wouldn't tell them


---------04:45----------
because i'm not very good at expressing


---------04:47----------
how i feel


---------04:49----------
so i think they just kind of had to


---------04:51----------
guess


---------04:52----------
can you like does does anything in


---------04:54----------
particular come to mind in terms of like


---------04:56----------
um you know times or our memories of


---------05:00----------
when you know things


---------05:03----------
you got angry and kind of lashed out


---------05:08----------
i mean not i mean i don't really


---------05:09----------
remember specific moments um there was


---------05:11----------
this one time i destroyed the


---------05:13----------
christmas tree it was uh they had put me


---------05:16----------
on zoloft


---------05:18----------
and then uh which i'm sure it's like a


---------05:21----------
medicine


---------05:21----------
and uh then i didn't like it because i


---------05:23----------
was like like a zombie and like i just


---------05:25----------
didn't feel very good


---------05:27----------
so i just stopped it cold turkey


---------05:30----------
and uh they they they kept they wanted


---------05:32----------
to give me like another medicine


---------05:34----------
that i didn't really want to take either


---------05:36----------
so i just got very angry


---------05:38----------
and i lashed out and i just like


---------05:39----------
destroyed the christmas tree knocked it


---------05:41----------
over


---------05:42----------
punched you know a couple holes in the


---------05:43----------
walls in my room


---------05:45----------
and uh you know then my parents got


---------05:48----------
really angry obviously i did that and


---------05:50----------
they came and you know you know yelled


---------05:52----------
at me and


---------05:53----------
spanked me or whatever so how old were


---------05:56----------
you


---------05:58----------
uh i mean this was middle school so i


---------06:01----------
don't know maybe probably 12


---------06:02----------
13. yeah so and do you have a sense of


---------06:06----------
why they put you on medication or


---------06:08----------
why they thought you needed medication


---------06:12----------
i mean i was just you know i was just


---------06:14----------
always misbehaving


---------06:15----------
so they probably just you know the


---------06:17----------
doctors probably told them that i should


---------06:19----------
get some medication to help me with my


---------06:22----------
my issues right like uh yeah like i said


---------06:25----------
i had a lot of anger issues so they put


---------06:26----------
me on zoloft


---------06:27----------
and these like uh mood stabilizers


---------06:31----------
but they didn't really help me because i


---------06:33----------
don't think i had


---------06:35----------
like i'm not like bipolar or anything i


---------06:37----------
just uh like i can control my anger but


---------06:39----------
just


---------06:40----------
i just got to a certain point when i was


---------06:41----------
younger that i was always angry all the


---------06:44----------
time because i couldn't


---------06:45----------
ever express myself and i had zero


---------06:47----------
validation from anyone


---------06:50----------
so that sounds weird to me to medicate


---------06:53----------
misbehavior well i mean they


---------06:56----------
i just don't think they knew what to do


---------06:58----------
because all right in school i was really


---------06:59----------
bad


---------07:00----------
and i had bad grades and i just how so


---------07:02----------
you know


---------07:05----------
yeah what does that mean you were bad in


---------07:07----------
school i would always try to be the


---------07:08----------
class clown


---------07:09----------
so i would uh you know misbehave in


---------07:11----------
class and make people laugh


---------07:12----------
and then i'd get in trouble um but then


---------07:16----------
also i would be very angry in school and


---------07:18----------
lash out at people because i also had no


---------07:19----------
friends


---------07:21----------
so you know making people laugh was like


---------07:23----------
the only


---------07:24----------
positive sort of like thing that i got


---------07:27----------
out of people at school but i had to get


---------07:29----------
myself in trouble to do that


---------07:31----------
so it's kind of like a bad situation


---------07:34----------
yeah i mean i i can imagine it must have


---------07:36----------
been tough to be like a kid and to think


---------07:38----------
like


---------07:39----------
oh the only way i can make friends or


---------07:41----------
make people sort of like you know


---------07:43----------
treat me well or appreciate that i'm


---------07:45----------
around as if i get in trouble


---------07:48----------
so it's sort of you really had to you


---------07:49----------
had to pay a price to


---------07:52----------
you know kind of connect with people and


---------07:55----------
make make people appreciate you well i


---------07:58----------
mean they still didn't really appreciate


---------07:59----------
me i got bullied like crazy in school


---------08:01----------
like i was probably one of the most


---------08:02----------
bullied kids at school


---------08:04----------
um i have really really bad stories that


---------08:07----------
i could tell you of making


---------08:08----------
like of just things that have happened


---------08:09----------
to me and specifically in middle school


---------08:11----------
that was the


---------08:12----------
[ __ ] worst kid i'd love to hear if


---------08:16----------
you're


---------08:16----------
comfortable sharing that so that there


---------08:18----------
was this one time


---------08:20----------
and uh i think it was like seventh grade


---------08:22----------
or something there was this teacher was


---------08:23----------
really popular


---------08:25----------
um and she was pregnant and i was in


---------08:27----------
class and you know i didn't want to do


---------08:28----------
my work


---------08:29----------
because you know whatever reason and i


---------08:31----------
was just sitting there


---------08:32----------
and she got very angry at me for not


---------08:35----------
doing my work


---------08:36----------
and she you know came up i don't know if


---------08:38----------
she was like going through mood swings


---------08:39----------
or something


---------08:40----------
but she came up and she started like


---------08:42----------
scolding me about not doing my work and


---------08:44----------
i'm like i don't really want to do it


---------08:45----------
and then she started you know kind of


---------08:47----------
yelling a little bit


---------08:49----------
for me to do my work and then she like i


---------08:51----------
don't know started getting cramps or


---------08:53----------
something in her stomach


---------08:54----------
and um i think she ended up well she i


---------08:57----------
think she went to the hospital because


---------08:58----------
she had to like leave


---------09:00----------
and you know the principal came in had


---------09:02----------
to like take over the class and she was


---------09:04----------
you know going through like a pretty


---------09:05----------
major episode in class i think from the


---------09:07----------
cramps


---------09:08----------
so after that when the bell rang the uh


---------09:12----------
the rest of the kids in the class just


---------09:14----------
uh made up this rumor


---------09:15----------
that i'd killed her baby in you know


---------09:19----------
that she was pregnant with which


---------09:20----------
obviously it wasn't true


---------09:22----------
but for the rest of the year i was just


---------09:24----------
known as a as baby killer


---------09:26----------
oh my god by the entire school and i


---------09:29----------
would tell the teachers and the


---------09:31----------
principal and they just


---------09:33----------
would say uh they just didn't care


---------09:35----------
really they said


---------09:36----------
well i guess uh we can put you in this


---------09:38----------
isolated classroom so that's what they


---------09:40----------
did they put me in this like in-school


---------09:41----------
suspension classroom for


---------09:44----------
like two months which was terrible as


---------09:47----------
well so


---------09:47----------
uh yeah that's how seventh grade went


---------09:51----------
dude that's that sounds awful it sounds


---------09:53----------
like almost sounds like you got


---------09:54----------
punished for reaching out for help well


---------09:58----------
yeah i mean they i'm from a small town


---------09:59----------
in florida they had


---------10:01----------
literally no resources whatsoever


---------10:05----------
so they just kind of put you like they


---------10:08----------
just didn't know what to do


---------10:09----------
or they just had no money for resources


---------10:11----------
or i don't know


---------10:13----------
do you remember how you felt about it


---------10:15----------
back then


---------10:17----------
um i mean oh i mean i'm just angry i


---------10:20----------
don't really know how i felt but i can


---------10:21----------
just remember


---------10:22----------
my entire childhood i was just angry all


---------10:25----------
the time


---------10:26----------
and i just hated everyone i hated myself


---------10:29----------
i hated everything


---------10:30----------
i just thought that uh you know i was


---------10:33----------
just


---------10:34----------
not belonging anywhere


---------10:37----------
that sounds terrible man


---------10:40----------
yeah but i i feel like it helped me


---------10:43----------
learn like it helped me grow as a person


---------10:46----------
like uh pretty quick at least in that


---------10:49----------
kind of regard of like uh


---------10:51----------
toughening up like i'm a pretty tough


---------10:53----------
person


---------10:54----------
and i can deal with a lot of [ __ ] so


---------10:58----------
yeah i can imagine that to come out of


---------10:59----------
that on the other end you have to be


---------11:01----------
quite the survivor


---------11:04----------
but um yeah so i mean and then that was


---------11:07----------
just seventh grade


---------11:08----------
other grades you know has were also had


---------11:10----------
their own stories


---------11:12----------
so i'd love to hear a little bit more


---------11:16----------
about that


---------11:17----------
okay um when


---------11:21----------
i mean sixth grade was just basic


---------11:23----------
bullying nothing really crazy to be


---------11:25----------
honest


---------11:25----------
uh when i was in eighth grade there was


---------11:28----------
this kid his name i think eighth grade


---------11:29----------
maybe he was still seventh i don't


---------11:31----------
really remember


---------11:32----------
but this kid his name was pimp and he


---------11:34----------
was just


---------11:35----------
uh this this like kid in my pe class


---------11:38----------
and every time we would go to the locker


---------11:40----------
room he would like


---------11:42----------
pretend rape me and i know that sounds


---------11:45----------
insane but he would uh so i would always


---------11:48----------
try i would change in the stall


---------11:49----------
instead of changing like in front of


---------11:51----------
everyone because i just didn't feel


---------11:52----------
comfortable with that


---------11:53----------
and one day he uh you know usually he


---------11:56----------
didn't go that far he would like come up


---------11:57----------
and like slap my ass and like


---------11:59----------
you know just like just like uh


---------12:03----------
harass me in front of his friends and it


---------12:05----------
was just funny but this one time


---------12:07----------
when i was changing the stall he crawled


---------12:08----------
under the stall and he like


---------12:10----------
you know he had his pants on and


---------12:12----------
everything but he like grabbed me


---------12:14----------
and he pushed me on the floor and he got


---------12:15----------
on top and he was like pretend raping me


---------12:18----------
in front of and then like he opened the


---------12:20----------
stall and there was just like


---------12:22----------
20 kids like the whole locker room just


---------12:24----------
there laughing as he's doing that


---------12:27----------
and uh so that was obviously humiliating


---------12:31----------
as [ __ ]


---------12:32----------
and that was terrible um but


---------12:35----------
and he was also the most popular kid in


---------12:37----------
our grade so i couldn't even tell


---------12:38----------
a teacher or anything but someone else


---------12:41----------
actually told the teacher that this kid


---------12:44----------
had


---------12:45----------
like you know [ __ ] pretend raped me


---------12:47----------
in the locker room


---------12:49----------
you know and humiliated me and he ended


---------12:52----------
up getting expelled from school


---------12:54----------
but everyone thought that i told the


---------12:55----------
teacher on him so they just called me a


---------12:57----------
snitch


---------12:58----------
for the rest of that year and they just


---------13:00----------
bullied me even harder because they're


---------13:02----------
like oh you [ __ ]


---------13:04----------
you know got pimp expelled and i'm just


---------13:07----------
like i


---------13:07----------
i didn't do anything wow dude


---------13:11----------
so it's just like a double whammy this


---------13:14----------
is terrible


---------13:16----------
yeah i've heard of a lot of bad bullying


---------13:19----------
like i got bullied


---------13:20----------
growing up you know i grew up in east


---------13:23----------
texas and


---------13:25----------
you know it was small town texas kind of


---------13:28----------
stuff where


---------13:29----------
you know just your but that was like


---------13:31----------
your run-of-the-mill


---------13:33----------
you know racism like some degree of like


---------13:36----------
bigotry


---------13:38----------
like pretty like standard stuff i mean


---------13:40----------
this is honestly paul like just as a


---------13:42----------
as a professional this is some of the


---------13:43----------
worst stuff i've ever heard like someone


---------13:45----------
going through


---------13:47----------
yeah my i mean it was it was pretty bad


---------13:49----------
and


---------13:50----------
i you know obviously yeah i didn't have


---------13:53----------
anyone to talk to it about so


---------13:55----------
i just kept it all to myself so you can


---------13:58----------
see why


---------13:58----------
so angry i can i can definitely see why


---------14:01----------
you would be so angry and lash out


---------14:03----------
and stuff i mean i i don't know i mean


---------14:06----------
did your parents


---------14:07----------
know that this stuff was going on or


---------14:09----------
yeah i told my parents and


---------14:11----------
i mean obviously they went to the school


---------14:13----------
were upset that this was happening but


---------14:15----------
the school


---------14:16----------
i mean they didn't do anything there's


---------14:18----------
they i i don't remember


---------14:20----------
obviously what happened with my parents


---------14:24----------
going in there and talking to them but i


---------14:25----------
just remember nothing happening


---------14:27----------
so i don't think the school did anything


---------14:30----------
but after


---------14:31----------
uh though actually that was seventh


---------14:33----------
grade the the pimp thing because i


---------14:35----------
remember


---------14:36----------
eighth grade i actually did get


---------14:38----------
transferred to a different school


---------14:40----------
but it was not it was so bad that i got


---------14:43----------
transferred


---------14:44----------
though because what ended up happening


---------14:45----------
was so my parents complained


---------14:47----------
or something and i guess we had a


---------14:49----------
meeting and i was there


---------14:50----------
and they were like okay we can send paul


---------14:52----------
to this other school that's out of the


---------14:54----------
jurisdiction because they have this like


---------14:57----------
special classroom that he can sit in


---------14:59----------
and it's like a one classroom a day type


---------15:01----------
thing so instead of going to eight


---------15:02----------
periods i just have i just stay in one


---------15:04----------
classroom all day with like seven other


---------15:05----------
kids


---------15:06----------
and with like uh behavioral uh issues it


---------15:09----------
was called a self-contained classroom


---------15:12----------
and you know people who had emotional


---------15:15----------
behavioral problems go in there


---------15:17----------
instead of just like expelling me from


---------15:19----------
school so


---------15:20----------
you know i transferred to that school


---------15:22----------
but it was awful because obviously since


---------15:24----------
it was so far away


---------15:26----------
they had to send a bus to my house that


---------15:29----------
was only for me i was the only person on


---------15:32----------
the bus


---------15:33----------
so they sent me a little short bus


---------15:35----------
instead of like a normal bus


---------15:37----------
and everyone at my bus stop of like 20


---------15:40----------
kids


---------15:41----------
i was like oh yeah i'm going to this new


---------15:43----------
school now and they're like oh


---------15:45----------
you know that's interesting and then


---------15:46----------
this [ __ ] short bus pulls up and they


---------15:48----------
all just start calling me [ __ ]


---------15:50----------
because you know obviously the short bus


---------15:52----------
is like a it's like a meme that it's


---------15:54----------
like


---------15:55----------
for slow kids right so


---------15:59----------
i was very upset that that was the bus


---------16:03----------
that they


---------16:03----------
decided to send me every day because


---------16:06----------
yeah


---------16:06----------
going to the bus stop was terrible then


---------16:08----------
these are my neighbors you know


---------16:10----------
they call me [ __ ] just every day


---------16:15----------
oh my god paul but when i got to the new


---------16:18----------
school it was actually


---------16:19----------
it was good though because i actually


---------16:21----------
enjoyed being in that classroom


---------16:23----------
and the self-contained classroom is


---------16:24----------
actually what i spent my entire high


---------16:26----------
school in


---------16:27----------
as well until i was a senior at least


---------16:30----------
um because yeah i was i felt very


---------16:33----------
comfortable in there


---------16:34----------
and the other kids didn't bully me we


---------16:37----------
were all pretty like cool with each


---------16:38----------
other everyone was pretty nice to each


---------16:40----------
other


---------16:41----------
i think it's because they all went


---------16:42----------
through like their own issues


---------16:44----------
so they didn't maybe judge uh me as much


---------16:48----------
interesting and uh so i'm really curious


---------16:52----------
paul like


---------16:53----------
i can you know i can imagine or remember


---------16:56----------
when i was 13 sort of like how i had a


---------16:58----------
conception of things


---------17:00----------
like you know why stuff happened


---------17:04----------
why i got treated the way that i did


---------17:06----------
what was your understanding of like


---------17:09----------
why this stuff was happening to you i


---------17:11----------
mean did you even understand that


---------17:12----------
something was happening to you that you


---------17:14----------
were


---------17:14----------
sort of being treated differently that


---------17:16----------
you were


---------17:18----------
like what did you think about yourself


---------17:19----------
and your situation growing up


---------17:23----------
i mean i don't really know um


---------17:26----------
i remember just thinking yeah this is


---------17:28----------
unfair


---------17:30----------
but i also just thought to myself oh i'm


---------17:33----------
just you know


---------17:35----------
clearly there's just something wrong


---------17:36----------
with me because if i'm having these


---------17:38----------
issues and other people aren't


---------17:41----------
i suppose there must be something wrong


---------17:43----------
with me


---------17:44----------
so i just you know had really low


---------17:46----------
self-esteem


---------17:49----------
i didn't know what was wrong with me uh


---------17:52----------
because i actually didn't get diagnosed


---------17:54----------
with asperger's um


---------17:57----------
for a while maybe it was when i was a


---------17:59----------
little bit older than like 12


---------18:01----------
because i remember going to a lot of


---------18:02----------
therapists and they knew i had some kind


---------18:04----------
of autism but they didn't


---------18:06----------
know exactly what


---------18:09----------
until i think i was maybe like 14 or


---------18:11----------
something or 15.


---------18:13----------
because i we my parents ended up having


---------18:15----------
to take me to this one really


---------18:17----------
good specialist and he then


---------18:20----------
was like okay this sounds like


---------18:22----------
asperger's


---------18:24----------
which uh i mean it's hard to remember


---------18:27----------
everything


---------18:28----------
in like a chronological order but


---------18:31----------
um yeah so even but even with that


---------18:34----------
diagnosis i still


---------18:36----------
i at the time i didn't think i had


---------18:38----------
asperger's because my parents then


---------18:40----------
started


---------18:41----------
enrolling me and and you know these


---------18:43----------
therapy groups


---------18:44----------
with other kids that had asperger's and


---------18:47----------
you know the other kids in those therapy


---------18:50----------
groups had it


---------18:51----------
way more severely than i did um so they


---------18:55----------
acted way different obviously


---------18:58----------
and uh so i didn't even feel like i


---------19:00----------
belonged in those groups either


---------19:04----------
because i i mean now as an adult you


---------19:06----------
know


---------19:08----------
and maturing a little bit i think like


---------19:11----------
yeah


---------19:11----------
i do have i think i do have asperger's


---------19:13----------
but but it's not because i


---------19:15----------
like i just have a hard time expressing


---------19:17----------
my emotions and it's like


---------19:20----------
i i can't really feel emotions very well


---------19:23----------
okay but explain to me what asperger's


---------19:26----------
is or or what your understanding of it


---------19:29----------
is


---------19:31----------
um i mean it's it's just when you you


---------19:34----------
know have a hard time


---------19:36----------
seeing other people's perspectives


---------19:39----------
perhaps and you have a hard time


---------19:43----------
reading people's like body language and


---------19:46----------
understanding what they're thinking and


---------19:49----------
uh


---------19:49----------
and then maybe i have a hard time with


---------19:53----------
talking to people in the form of like uh


---------19:55----------
you know with like sarcasm


---------19:57----------
or joking with people or i'll say


---------20:00----------
something that i think is funny


---------20:01----------
but other people it's like offensive or


---------20:03----------
rude to them i had a


---------20:05----------
huge problem with that when i was


---------20:06----------
younger i would say something and people


---------20:09----------
would get like offended by it


---------20:10----------
and i wasn't trying to offend anyone hmm


---------20:14----------
so i it sounds to me like like sometimes


---------20:16----------
you're just not quite on the same


---------20:18----------
wavelength is that a good way to


---------20:19----------
describe


---------20:19----------
it yeah i think that's a good way to


---------20:23----------
describe that yeah and and that


---------20:26----------
sometimes you're not really sure


---------20:29----------
what you're feeling or how to express


---------20:30----------
that to people and maybe


---------20:32----------
some of that i'm gonna assume for a


---------20:36----------
second that that's sort of negative


---------20:37----------
emotions


---------20:38----------
um but that emotional turmoil kind of


---------20:41----------
manifests


---------20:42----------
in in ways that can create challenges


---------20:44----------
for you and your relationships


---------20:47----------
yeah i mean essentially um you know


---------20:50----------
yeah making relationships with people


---------20:52----------
has been tough


---------20:53----------
because i have a hard time with i mean i


---------20:56----------
don't know


---------20:57----------
like the basic stuff needed to build


---------21:00----------
relationships like i just have a hard


---------21:01----------
time


---------21:02----------
like now as an adult i can it's easier


---------21:05----------
but when i was younger it was so hard i


---------21:06----------
didn't understand how to be


---------21:08----------
friends with somebody or i didn't


---------21:10----------
understand how to even like have


---------21:11----------
basic communication with people you know


---------21:14----------
when i was like 16.


---------21:16----------
and and what would you say you've


---------21:18----------
learned as an adult like what are some


---------21:20----------
of the key things that you've sort of


---------21:21----------
figured out in terms of how to be


---------21:23----------
friends with someone and how to


---------21:24----------
communicate


---------21:26----------
um well now i mean i just


---------21:30----------
i try my best to go out of my way to


---------21:34----------
you know be a friend to my friends right


---------21:37----------
you know ask how they're doing


---------21:39----------
and you know just you know ask if they


---------21:42----------
want to hang out you know just it sounds


---------21:44----------
basic but


---------21:45----------
i just i had to learn this stuff it


---------21:46----------
didn't come natural to me


---------21:49----------
like i used to read i used to like look


---------21:51----------
on the internet and google and like read


---------21:52----------
books and like how to


---------21:54----------
like talk and be friends like how to


---------21:57----------
read somebody's face


---------21:59----------
like i didn't know how to do any of that


---------22:00----------
[ __ ] what are you getting from my face


---------22:03----------
are you reading my face now


---------22:06----------
i mean yeah you just look like you're


---------22:08----------
listening okay


---------22:11----------
i am listening i mean


---------22:14----------
it's still uh i mean i'm pretty good at


---------22:16----------
it now obviously because


---------22:18----------
streaming has really helped me a lot


---------22:20----------
with uh understanding uh social cues


---------22:23----------
and everything but even like when i was


---------22:24----------
20 before i even started streaming


---------22:27----------
i still had a hard time and yeah so can


---------22:30----------
you


---------22:30----------
so it sounds like actually getting in


---------22:32----------
that self-contained classroom was


---------22:33----------
was a pretty good experience for you it


---------22:36----------
seems like


---------22:37----------
you were able to form connections with


---------22:38----------
people people really didn't bully you


---------22:40----------
and stuff like that


---------22:42----------
yeah so so high school can you tell me a


---------22:44----------
little bit about what high school was


---------22:45----------
like i mean


---------22:47----------
i mean high school was pretty pretty


---------22:49----------
plain i


---------22:50----------
uh well when i was in ninth grade though


---------22:52----------
this was the only not plain thing so i


---------22:55----------
was still


---------22:55----------
obviously upset the self-contained


---------22:57----------
classroom was


---------22:58----------
was nice that i didn't get bullied in


---------23:00----------
but i was still upset that i was


---------23:03----------
in there still kind of and i felt like


---------23:06----------
and i was still just an angry kid so the


---------23:08----------
teacher


---------23:09----------
came up to me and was like wanting to


---------23:12----------
have me do my work and i didn't want to


---------23:13----------
do my [ __ ] work


---------23:14----------
and i started arguing with the teacher


---------23:16----------
in my ninth grade class


---------23:18----------
and then he you know was like um


---------23:21----------
you know [ __ ] uh yelling and i was


---------23:24----------
just like and i threatened him i was


---------23:25----------
like i'm gonna punch you or i'm gonna


---------23:27----------
i don't know stab you with this pencil i


---------23:30----------
i said i'm gonna stab you with this


---------23:31----------
pencil i just don't like saying it now


---------23:33----------
because it makes me sound like a


---------23:35----------
like a bad person but i was just an


---------23:37----------
angry kid


---------23:38----------
um so i said that to the teacher i


---------23:41----------
wasn't actually gonna do that i was just


---------23:42----------
angry but so


---------23:43----------
obviously they set up a meeting and they


---------23:46----------
were going to expel me because that's


---------23:48----------
like a threat


---------23:49----------
to the teacher and i was so angry and


---------23:51----------
upset


---------23:52----------
i started yelling in the room with uh


---------23:55----------
with my mom there


---------23:56----------
and i started yelling at my mom because


---------23:58----------
she said something that i didn't like


---------24:00----------
to the teacher and i said something


---------24:02----------
about autism or asperger's or something


---------24:04----------
i just felt so angry that she said that


---------24:07----------
because i kept denying that i had


---------24:08----------
aspergers at that time


---------24:10----------
so i started yelling at her and you know


---------24:12----------
what the [ __ ] school did they ended


---------24:14----------
up calling the


---------24:15----------
resource officer like the school cop and


---------24:17----------
they had me arrested


---------24:20----------
for yelling at my mom like i was just


---------24:22----------
yelling like and they they arrested me


---------24:24----------
instead of like trying to de-escalate


---------24:26----------
the situation


---------24:27----------
um obviously i didn't get charged with


---------24:30----------
anything


---------24:31----------
but they sent me over to the you know


---------24:33----------
the juvenile


---------24:34----------
detention place and i ended up sitting


---------24:36----------
there for like two hours and then they


---------24:38----------
wouldn't release me back to my parents


---------24:40----------
um because that was


---------24:42----------
because you know i was yelling at them


---------24:44----------
and that was where the situation


---------24:45----------
occurred so i had to go to my friend's


---------24:47----------
mom for like a week


---------24:49----------
before i could go back to my parents and


---------24:51----------
that was terrible because


---------24:52----------
i i thought that was totally undeserving


---------24:56----------
yeah i mean i mean it


---------25:00----------
and and when you say you thought it was


---------25:02----------
undeserving what what what made you


---------25:04----------
think that that was undeserving or


---------25:06----------
unfair


---------25:07----------
well i mean obviously i'm gonna be upset


---------25:09----------
that they're trying to expel me from


---------25:11----------
school


---------25:12----------
sure and you know i had a lot of


---------25:14----------
emotional problems


---------25:16----------
when i was younger so i just would hope


---------25:18----------
uh i mean


---------25:19----------
this is not how i was thinking i was


---------25:21----------
younger but now in hindsight i'm like i


---------25:22----------
would hope this school would maybe


---------25:24----------
have a little bit more uh understanding


---------25:27----------
but


---------25:28----------
they didn't they just were like oh well


---------25:30----------
we don't want to deal with it so just


---------25:32----------
call the police yeah i'm hearing a theme


---------25:35----------
here of people sort of


---------25:37----------
not trying to understand you i


---------25:41----------
i mean yeah that sounds that's like the


---------25:44----------
that's like the plot here of my


---------25:45----------
childhood


---------25:47----------
but i mean tough man


---------25:51----------
yeah i mean it it uh it it was it was


---------25:54----------
um but uh so i ended up going


---------25:57----------
so instead of when i got expelled i went


---------25:59----------
to this other school and it was full of


---------26:00----------
bad kids and like gangsters drug dealers


---------26:03----------
[ __ ] up


---------26:04----------
just kids that were actually criminals


---------26:06----------
and like on probation and [ __ ] and


---------26:08----------
clearly i'm i don't belong there so my


---------26:11----------
parents ended up um


---------26:13----------
putting me into this this camp it's


---------26:17----------
called eckerd uh eckerd's learning


---------26:19----------
center and it was just like


---------26:21----------
it was it was this camp that kids go to


---------26:23----------
when they have


---------26:24----------
you know behavior problems well half the


---------26:27----------
kids there


---------26:28----------
were orphans that were being misbehaving


---------26:31----------
in their orphanage


---------26:32----------
and the other half were kids who got


---------26:34----------
arrested and got sent there by the


---------26:36----------
courts


---------26:37----------
but my parents you know could opt to


---------26:39----------
send me there since i was in this


---------26:40----------
alternative school


---------26:42----------
but they asked but they had to pay money


---------26:44----------
um so they did


---------26:45----------
and i went there for three months


---------26:47----------
instead of go instead of this


---------26:49----------
alternative school that had


---------26:50----------
you know these you know like drug


---------26:53----------
dealers and [ __ ]


---------26:55----------
so i was and i was i actually liked it


---------26:57----------
there i mean it was interesting i ran


---------26:58----------
away three times and then they had to


---------27:00----------
find me and they brought me back


---------27:02----------
and whatever but i all i had to do was


---------27:04----------
be good for like a month and fill out


---------27:06----------
this check sheet and i'd be out


---------27:08----------
i ended up staying there for three


---------27:09----------
months because the first two months i


---------27:11----------
was misbehaving last month i was good


---------27:12----------
and they let me go and i got back i got


---------27:15----------
to go right back to my uh


---------27:16----------
school i got expelled from and that's


---------27:18----------
where my behavior


---------27:20----------
issues started to subside that camp


---------27:22----------
actually helped me


---------27:23----------
understand yeah i'm sorry keep going


---------27:27----------
the camp helped me understand how to uh


---------27:30----------
control myself a lot better because


---------27:34----------
um well i mean like i said that half the


---------27:37----------
kids there were there by the courts


---------27:39----------
and have been the actual jail like um


---------27:42----------
and the other half were you know kids


---------27:44----------
who were who were orphans


---------27:46----------
so they obviously had a not a very good


---------27:48----------
life at that time


---------27:50----------
so i kind of like got more perspective


---------27:54----------
um and i didn't misbehave as much


---------27:57----------
because they would beat the [ __ ] out of


---------27:58----------
me if


---------28:00----------
if i did because um if somebody starts


---------28:02----------
misbehaving that we have to go


---------28:03----------
in this like group this we have to sit


---------28:06----------
in like a circle and talk about it for


---------28:07----------
an hour


---------28:08----------
nobody wants to do that so if anyone


---------28:11----------
makes the whole group have to sit there


---------28:12----------
for an hour in a group


---------28:14----------
then later they they jump you they like


---------28:17----------
beat you up


---------28:18----------
so obviously i'm not going to misbehave


---------28:20----------
there i don't want to get [ __ ] beat


---------28:22----------
um i already got initiated when i got


---------28:24----------
there they beat me with they put like


---------28:25----------
something inside a sock and they hit me


---------28:26----------
with it when i was sleeping


---------28:29----------
so that was uh yeah that was not fun so


---------28:32----------
i didn't want it


---------28:33----------
you mean the other kids right yeah the


---------28:36----------
other kid so we had three cabins because


---------28:38----------
it was in the woods this like camp uh we


---------28:40----------
had three cabins so the kids in my cabin


---------28:42----------
would


---------28:43----------
you know they did that as like an


---------28:44----------
initiation


---------28:47----------
so i'm i'm hearing that actually like


---------28:50----------
you know physical consequences


---------28:52----------
actually helped you well in terms of


---------28:55----------
like learning how to regulate yourself


---------28:58----------
yeah


---------28:58----------
it helped me with like uh just


---------29:01----------
self-control


---------29:01----------
like i didn't lash out i was still angry


---------29:03----------
but i just kept to myself i didn't lash


---------29:05----------
out


---------29:05----------
at those people and those kids or


---------29:07----------
anything so


---------29:09----------
um and then after a while of not lashing


---------29:12----------
out i started to like be more content


---------29:13----------
with


---------29:15----------
i don't know being there and i kind of


---------29:16----------
liked being there it was like kind of


---------29:18----------
nice


---------29:18----------
to be told what to do all the time


---------29:22----------
it was kind of nice to i don't know


---------29:25----------
like uh just have a structure in your


---------29:28----------
life


---------29:28----------
because you know you have the line up


---------29:30----------
every other you know in a line when you


---------29:32----------
walk places you have to do your laundry


---------29:33----------
you have to clean your bed


---------29:34----------
flip your mattress you have to make your


---------29:36----------
own food you're completely independent


---------29:39----------
wow so it was food like what kind of


---------29:42----------
food would you make


---------29:44----------
um well i mean you wouldn't really make


---------29:46----------
the food but you would


---------29:47----------
set it out to the other kids like you'd


---------29:49----------
make the table


---------29:50----------
got it um so it was


---------29:53----------
kind of like that it was like a once a


---------29:55----------
week thing you x every kid got


---------29:57----------
you know they take turns or whatever


---------29:58----------
yeah yeah


---------30:00----------
so that place helps me be independent


---------30:02----------
and and have more self-control so


---------30:04----------
when i left that place when i graduated


---------30:06----------
from it it was i don't know i think it


---------30:08----------
like really helped me become like a


---------30:11----------
like a better person can i just point


---------30:14----------
out


---------30:15----------
paul um a couple of just themes that i'm


---------30:18----------
hearing


---------30:20----------
yeah so uh


---------30:23----------
you know the first is that i i really do


---------30:25----------
get the sense that like


---------30:26----------
people have not tried to understand you


---------30:29----------
i mean


---------30:29----------
i i'm kind of hearing so many different


---------30:32----------
stories of


---------30:32----------
you know early on like growing up you


---------30:34----------
were misbehaving and your parents sort


---------30:36----------
of like


---------30:37----------
a lot of times you would get kind of


---------30:38----------
punished and i think on the one hand it


---------30:40----------
sort of makes sense because maybe you


---------30:41----------
were lashing out and


---------30:43----------
and kind of saying inappropriate things


---------30:45----------
but


---------30:46----------
a lot of times you know it seems like


---------30:47----------
people sort of didn't care about your


---------30:49----------
side


---------30:50----------
of things you know this whole like


---------30:51----------
getting expelled and like you kind of


---------30:53----------
expressing


---------30:54----------
anger and then expressing anger at your


---------30:56----------
mom i'm sort of hearing


---------30:58----------
and i've heard this theme before that


---------31:00----------
you know everyone blames you for being


---------31:02----------
angry but like people may not be trying


---------31:04----------
to understand like why you're angry in


---------31:05----------
the first place like what's your side of


---------31:07----------
the story


---------31:08----------
and then certainly with with you know


---------31:10----------
the whole pimp thing because it's like


---------31:13----------
you had something that you were trying


---------31:14----------
to explain to people you're like i


---------31:16----------
didn't say anything


---------31:17----------
but they didn't care to listen and they


---------31:19----------
didn't care to understand


---------31:22----------
and so i'm hearing a lot of sort of


---------31:24----------
situations where


---------31:25----------
maybe you got punished for


---------31:29----------
you know stuff that really wasn't your


---------31:30----------
fault or or that


---------31:33----------
you know people had kind of listened to


---------31:34----------
you or bothered to kind of


---------31:36----------
try to understand your perspective like


---------31:38----------
like or they they really didn't do that


---------31:41----------
what do you think about that is that


---------31:44----------
fair to say yeah


---------31:45----------
that's pretty accurate yeah nobody


---------31:47----------
nobody cared to


---------31:48----------
listen to me when i was younger i mean i


---------31:51----------
had therapists but they weren't very


---------31:52----------
good


---------31:53----------
um until i got the one guy that


---------31:56----------
diagnosed


---------31:57----------
the asperger's and i stayed with him for


---------31:58----------
like six years wow


---------32:00----------
what was can you tell me a little bit


---------32:02----------
about um


---------32:05----------
what made the therapists not good and


---------32:07----------
and what made this guy


---------32:09----------
good well i mean my my first therapist


---------32:12----------
that i had he didn't even say i had


---------32:13----------
autism he said


---------32:14----------
adhd and he gave me you know adderall or


---------32:17----------
whatever


---------32:18----------
and i didn't do very good on adderall


---------32:22----------
i just got worse my behavior got worse


---------32:24----------
because now i'm super stimulated


---------32:26----------
at school and i definitely didn't want


---------32:28----------
to do anything and now i'm like super


---------32:30----------
agitated and like got angry quicker and


---------32:32----------
like


---------32:33----------
and i don't know and then when i went


---------32:35----------
back to the therapist and i would tell


---------32:36----------
him like


---------32:37----------
i feel worse because i didn't know how


---------32:39----------
to express myself so i wasn't like it's


---------32:41----------
the medicine


---------32:42----------
i just said i feel worse so he just put


---------32:45----------
me on a different medicine


---------32:46----------
instead of like trying to maybe


---------32:49----------
understand why i felt worse


---------32:51----------
um so that's like the theme of all these


---------32:54----------
therapists that i would go to


---------32:55----------
typically um until that one guy he


---------32:59----------
actually didn't give me any medicine he


---------33:01----------
just


---------33:01----------
gave me advice which is much better


---------33:04----------
and so you stayed with him for six years


---------33:06----------
that's a long time


---------33:08----------
yeah he was uh this top-rated guy in


---------33:10----------
palm beach


---------33:11----------
so we had to drive like 45 minutes to


---------33:13----------
palm beach


---------33:14----------
in or to get to him my parents had to


---------33:16----------
unfortunately


---------33:18----------
you know he's very expensive my parents


---------33:19----------
had to pay like 700


---------33:21----------
every time we go there but he didn't


---------33:22----------
take insurance so he's like


---------33:25----------
one of the like of course he's you know


---------33:27----------
uh


---------33:28----------
just a very expensive doctor but for


---------33:30----------
good reason he was really good


---------33:32----------
at what he did and he you know


---------33:35----------
actually sat there and talked to me and


---------33:38----------
like listened to what i


---------33:39----------
had to say and gave me advice


---------33:42----------
um instead of just just giving me


---------33:45----------
medicine


---------33:46----------
and i really liked him i like i looked


---------33:48----------
forward to seeing him he was like my


---------33:51----------
the person i actually could open up to


---------33:55----------
does he know that he was that important


---------33:57----------
to you


---------33:59----------
i mean no i'm probably not


---------34:03----------
i've not i've been talk i mean obviously


---------34:05----------
haven't spoke to him in


---------34:06----------
many years so how long has it been


---------34:11----------
i don't know i think the i mean i think


---------34:13----------
the last time i saw him was like a 19 or


---------34:16----------
something


---------34:17----------
and uh 26.


---------34:24----------
have you ever thought about reaching out


---------34:26----------
to him and and sharing some of this


---------34:28----------
stuff


---------34:31----------
i mean i i haven't but i i could i just


---------34:35----------
um


---------34:35----------
i always just thought he was just you


---------34:36----------
know like a busy guy you know


---------34:39----------
he's the number one therapist in palm


---------34:42----------
beach


---------34:42----------
so i just never thought he would have


---------34:45----------
time for any of that so


---------34:51----------
but um yeah so i mean after i got out of


---------34:54----------
the camp


---------34:55----------
and you know that's when i you know my


---------34:57----------
parents brought me to this guy and then


---------34:58----------
at school i started being better because


---------35:00----------
the camp helped me learn some things


---------35:02----------
i'm able to get advice from from this


---------35:04----------
new therapist


---------35:05----------
who's giving me you know good advice


---------35:07----------
about asperger's and stuff


---------35:09----------
and like how to you know communicate


---------35:11----------
with people and i started being better


---------35:12----------
in school i started


---------35:14----------
not misbehaving and i went through my


---------35:18----------
ninth the second half of ninth grade all


---------35:21----------
the way up until i was a senior


---------35:23----------
in this like self-contained classroom


---------35:25----------
which is a weird experience like in high


---------35:27----------
school to have just one classroom


---------35:29----------
all day for three years but um since i


---------35:32----------
was good for three years they're like


---------35:34----------
okay


---------35:34----------
let's let them out to the general


---------35:36----------
population classrooms


---------35:40----------
as a senior and yeah i did well


---------35:43----------
so and i felt like good i was like i


---------35:45----------
wasn't getting bullied


---------35:46----------
and like uh kids are being nice to me


---------35:49----------
and i was like i felt like


---------35:51----------
i was hanging out with some people like


---------35:52----------
i felt pretty good about myself


---------35:55----------
at that point wow dude that's great


---------35:58----------
but to be fair though we were like 18


---------36:02----------
or 17 18 and as a senior so it's like


---------36:05----------
obviously kids are past the bullying


---------36:07----------
part so i didn't forgive any of them


---------36:10----------
because these are the same kids that


---------36:11----------
used to bully me


---------36:13----------
yeah i don't know that people are past


---------36:15----------
bullying at the age of 17 rape team i


---------36:17----------
think sometimes


---------36:18----------
it gets better but you know i know


---------36:21----------
people who are in their 30s and still


---------36:23----------
bully other people but i'm happy to hear


---------36:26----------
that it sounds like you


---------36:27----------
you learned a lot of skills you had


---------36:29----------
learned maybe a little bit about how to


---------36:30----------
control yourself a little bit better


---------36:32----------
had learned how to make friends um you


---------36:34----------
know ask people how they're doing


---------36:37----------
ask people if they want to hang out and


---------36:40----------
uh


---------36:42----------
and so i assume things with your parents


---------36:44----------
got better too


---------36:46----------
yeah i mean my parents and i are good


---------36:48----------
now we just uh you know it's just a


---------36:50----------
rough childhood


---------36:51----------
yeah sorry what are you saying


---------36:54----------
no go go for it uh now that i you know


---------36:57----------
i'm


---------36:57----------
as i'm an adult so i can express myself


---------37:00----------
better so


---------37:01----------
clearly my relationship with my parents


---------37:03----------
is better because i can


---------37:05----------
um you know tell them how i feel and


---------37:08----------
like


---------37:09----------
stuff now so yeah i was just gonna say i


---------37:12----------
think actually it sounds like your


---------37:13----------
parents tried very hard to kind of


---------37:15----------
figure out


---------37:16----------
you know how to help you um i'm hearing


---------37:19----------
that they were really confused but


---------37:21----------
you know it sounds like they tried quite


---------37:23----------
hard like they


---------37:24----------
you know had you seeing different kinds


---------37:26----------
of people and sure those people ended up


---------37:28----------
not being the right ones but


---------37:30----------
paul i've heard so many stories where


---------37:32----------
you know


---------37:33----------
the parents sort of give up at some


---------37:36----------
point right


---------37:37----------
or because what i'm really hearing is


---------37:38----------
that your parents tried like


---------37:40----------
so many different things to try to help


---------37:42----------
you and even drive you 45 minutes and


---------37:44----------
pay 700 bucks a session to try to get


---------37:48----------
you the help that you need for like six


---------37:49----------
years


---------37:50----------
like it sounds like you tried really


---------37:52----------
hard my parents had to take out a loan


---------37:54----------
to bring me to that that camp


---------37:56----------
because because you know i wasn't court


---------37:57----------
ordered so i might they had to pay like


---------37:59----------
six thousand a month to send me there


---------38:00----------
for three months


---------38:02----------
so they got a loan for that and yeah if


---------38:04----------
i was a parent i don't think i would


---------38:05----------
do that for my kid i would want to help


---------38:07----------
my kid but that would be


---------38:09----------
like that's just a huge risk it's a lot


---------38:11----------
of money


---------38:13----------
so my parents are very good with that


---------38:16----------
yeah i mean how do you understand why


---------38:18----------
they did that if you wouldn't do it


---------38:21----------
what do you mean you said that you


---------38:23----------
wouldn't do that for your kid


---------38:24----------
you know well i mean it's just a lot of


---------38:27----------
money


---------38:28----------
and i won't and i don't know if this is


---------38:29----------
going to help my kid so if it doesn't


---------38:31----------
help


---------38:32----------
them it's a lot of money to just you


---------38:34----------
know throw away


---------38:35----------
yeah so i don't know if i would take


---------38:38----------
that that


---------38:38----------
financial risk makes makes a lot of


---------38:41----------
sense


---------38:42----------
how do you understand why your parents


---------38:45----------
would take that financial risk


---------38:49----------
i mean i think they just wanted to help


---------38:52----------
me


---------38:53----------
any way that they could you know despite


---------38:55----------
any financial situation they could end


---------38:57----------
up in


---------39:00----------
yeah because i mean they saw


---------39:03----------
they saw my my misery like you know they


---------39:06----------
they


---------39:06----------
they felt bad like they didn't want me


---------39:09----------
to


---------39:09----------
be miserable so sure


---------39:14----------
you feeling anything as i ask you these


---------39:15----------
questions


---------39:18----------
i mean yeah i feel i'm just like looking


---------39:21----------
back at memories and it makes me feel


---------39:23----------
like


---------39:24----------
um i don't know like um


---------39:29----------
i don't know how it makes me feel it's


---------39:31----------
just like a weird uh


---------39:34----------
feeling but it's not very strong it's


---------39:35----------
just like uh


---------39:37----------
memories i don't know how to explain it


---------39:39----------
to be honest yeah yeah


---------39:40----------
that's so that that's what we're here


---------39:42----------
for so do you have a sense of why i


---------39:44----------
asked you that question at that moment


---------39:48----------
no i don't right so i i saw a change in


---------39:51----------
your face


---------39:52----------
so you started uh i'm not quite sure if


---------39:54----------
you were like like


---------39:56----------
sucking your teeth or something like


---------39:58----------
your your facial expression change you


---------39:59----------
started to do something with your mouth


---------40:01----------
i'm not trying to make you uh


---------40:03----------
self-conscious i realize it could be


---------40:05----------
doing that but


---------40:06----------
i noticed signs in your face that you


---------40:08----------
were experiencing some kind


---------40:10----------
of emotion yeah and


---------40:13----------
and so it was a different kind of


---------40:14----------
emotion from what i've seen so far


---------40:16----------
expressed in your face


---------40:19----------
and and you know if i if i had to say


---------40:22----------
like like can we talk about that emotion


---------40:24----------
and maybe try to understand what it is


---------40:28----------
yeah i mean we can talk about it so so


---------40:30----------
let's


---------40:31----------
let's kind of think about this you you


---------40:32----------
had images in your mind


---------40:35----------
of you and what were the images of


---------40:39----------
well i was just trying to remember you


---------40:41----------
know things that


---------40:43----------
happened when i was young so i was just


---------40:44----------
you know replaying the


---------40:46----------
situations and yeah just


---------40:49----------
maybe it's a little bit of a discomf


---------40:52----------
discomfort feeling


---------40:53----------
maybe that's like what i felt but uh


---------40:57----------
i don't really know probably i i think


---------41:00----------
so let me let me ask you kind of


---------41:02----------
something weird do you know if


---------41:03----------
what you felt was negative or positive


---------41:05----------
or maybe a little bit of both


---------41:09----------
i think it was kind of positive yeah


---------41:13----------
i mean it's uncomfortable to think about


---------41:15----------
but it's positive


---------41:16----------
because i like to see my you know where


---------41:18----------
i've how i used to be when i was younger


---------41:21----------
versus now it's it's nice to look back


---------41:25----------
and be and like know that i have


---------41:28----------
learned so many things you know what i


---------41:29----------
mean yeah


---------41:31----------
so what do you think about love like do


---------41:34----------
you think it was love


---------41:36----------
uh do i think it was well what do you


---------41:38----------
mean it was love


---------41:39----------
what you were feeling just now


---------41:42----------
uh no i don't think so


---------41:46----------
okay who would i be loving ah good


---------41:48----------
question


---------41:49----------
so i i i know it sounds kind of weird


---------41:51----------
but maybe it was being the recipient of


---------41:54----------
love


---------41:58----------
with my parents


---------42:02----------
how so so here's um


---------42:05----------
so you it's kind of weird right because


---------42:07----------
it's a positive feeling that's


---------42:08----------
uncomfortable


---------42:10----------
right and then you're actually


---------42:12----------
remembering like


---------42:14----------
miserable circumstances


---------42:17----------
so that's kind of confusing right


---------42:18----------
because like if i'm remembering misery


---------42:21----------
but i'm feeling a positive emotion like


---------42:24----------
how does that work


---------42:26----------
you with me yeah and then we were sort


---------42:29----------
of talking about


---------42:31----------
essentially like you know your parents


---------42:35----------
it's kind of taking a big financial risk


---------42:39----------
and then i i started to see your face


---------42:41----------
change when when


---------42:42----------
as we sort of talked about that you


---------42:43----------
start started to say like well


---------42:45----------
you know they saw how miserable i was


---------42:49----------
and and what i'm kind of seeing hearing


---------42:51----------
is like a story of of you know you not


---------42:53----------
being understood you not knowing how to


---------42:55----------
express


---------42:55----------
things to them and at the same time them


---------42:58----------
putting themselves in like financial


---------43:00----------
risk essentially to roll the dice


---------43:03----------
because they didn't know if six thousand


---------43:04----------
dollars a month is going to help you or


---------43:06----------
not


---------43:08----------
but they saw how miserable you are


---------43:12----------
and and so i'm wondering whether like


---------43:14----------
and it can be hard to like


---------43:16----------
be it can be hard to for other people to


---------43:19----------
like


---------43:20----------
feel to see our misery and like


---------43:23----------
do something about it it can actually be


---------43:25----------
like really uncomfortable for us to


---------43:27----------
receive kind of like love or faith


---------43:32----------
or or even be treated with value


---------43:35----------
no i feel that's that's crazy you say


---------43:37----------
that because i literally


---------43:39----------
feel uncomfortable with positive


---------43:42----------
uh reinforcement a lot of the time like


---------43:45----------
when people give me compliments i feel


---------43:47----------
comfortable by that like i like


---------43:49----------
compliments and i


---------43:50----------
for sure but i you know am a little bit


---------43:54----------
uncomfortable because it's just uh i


---------43:56----------
mean even now it's just


---------43:57----------
maybe i'm not used to it or i don't know


---------43:59----------
i mean obviously it's a streamer i'm


---------44:00----------
used to it but


---------44:01----------
it's still like if a viewer says okay


---------44:04----------
let me reiterate that if the viewer


---------44:05----------
compliments me in the chat


---------44:07----------
obviously there's no discomfort but if


---------44:10----------
the


---------44:10----------
person in real life says it to me it's


---------44:13----------
different


---------44:14----------
there's a little bit more uh i'm a


---------44:15----------
little bit more awkward with it


---------44:17----------
yeah so paul do you do you


---------44:22----------
so maybe maybe love is not the right


---------44:25----------
word


---------44:26----------
so like what about feeling valued


---------44:32----------
yeah i mean i don't know if


---------44:35----------
i mean i look back my parents valued me


---------44:37----------
for obviously for sure


---------44:38----------
but i i don't know if that's what i'm


---------44:40----------
feeling right when i looked back


---------44:43----------
at that but i don't know i mean you


---------44:45----------
would know more than me potentially


---------44:48----------
but sort of right because you're the one


---------44:49----------
who's actually feeling it though so it's


---------44:51----------
it's not like i'm a mind reader i'm not


---------44:53----------
a mind reader


---------44:54----------
but i i just i don't know like i'm sorry


---------44:56----------
i just can't like i have such a hard


---------44:57----------
time with


---------44:58----------
emotions yeah i i understand that why


---------45:01----------
are you apologizing


---------45:03----------
i just don't want you to be uh


---------45:06----------
i don't know uh what's like upset that


---------45:08----------
i'm not explaining it well


---------45:10----------
yeah are you getting the sense that i'm


---------45:12----------
upset


---------45:15----------
i mean no but i just do like you know


---------45:17----------
pre-apology


---------45:19----------
yep so so let's understand where that


---------45:21----------
apology comes from so like


---------45:23----------
if you're not getting a signal from me


---------45:25----------
that that


---------45:26----------
i'm upset i'm sort of getting that


---------45:29----------
you've your


---------45:30----------
mind is actually activated


---------45:32----------
pre-apology.exe


---------45:34----------
does that make sense to you yeah it's


---------45:37----------
like oh maybe i'm not doing a good job


---------45:39----------
so i better apologize because then this


---------45:41----------
person will be disappointed because i'm


---------45:43----------
not doing what i'm supposed to be doing


---------45:45----------
is that why you're apologizing


---------45:47----------
yeah so that i think is also like an


---------45:51----------
important bit of programming you've


---------45:52----------
learned because i think in the past


---------45:54----------
people have punished you and been upset


---------45:56----------
with you


---------45:57----------
because you haven't done some things


---------45:58----------
that you've been incapable


---------46:00----------
of doing


---------46:04----------
yeah that makes sense and so i'm not


---------46:07----------
expecting you to


---------46:09----------
be good at this and you


---------46:13----------
i know actually i i don't expect you to


---------46:15----------
be bad at it either


---------46:17----------
it's just


---------46:21----------
sun was just beating on me it's getting


---------46:22----------
really hot yeah totally cool man


---------46:25----------
um i kind of think about this as like


---------46:27----------
this is a co-op game


---------46:29----------
so like you know if it's helpful we can


---------46:32----------
try to explore emotions and


---------46:33----------
and maybe like help you understand what


---------46:35----------
some of that stuff is


---------46:37----------
swim around in there i may not know you


---------46:39----------
may not know but hopefully we can figure


---------46:41----------
it out together


---------46:42----------
what do you think about that yeah i mean


---------46:44----------
i would


---------46:45----------
if i could understand emotions better


---------46:47----------
that would be


---------46:48----------
really amazing because


---------46:52----------
i'm not gonna lie when you asked about


---------46:53----------
love earlier i just thought i was like a


---------46:54----------
little worried for a second because love


---------46:56----------
is like


---------46:57----------
just one of those things i totally have


---------47:00----------
such a hard time feeling don't really


---------47:03----------
understand


---------47:05----------
and i just you know and it makes me feel


---------47:07----------
bad


---------47:09----------
because i should love you know


---------47:12----------
more often right like i should love


---------47:15----------
people like i love my parents


---------47:16----------
but it doesn't come in the form of like


---------47:18----------
a physical emotion


---------47:20----------
it comes in the form of logical thinking


---------47:24----------
yeah so that that's why i tossed out


---------47:26----------
that word there because i


---------47:27----------
it occurs to me that i know it sounds


---------47:30----------
kind of weird but like


---------47:32----------
sometimes that's how love can feel like


---------47:34----------
if you can kind of think about it


---------47:36----------
it's weird because love is sometimes an


---------47:38----------
emotion that


---------47:39----------
we think of as a positive emotion but


---------47:41----------
oftentimes is like


---------47:43----------
hurts on the inside it's weird like that


---------47:48----------
okay so so i'll try to explain a little


---------47:51----------
bit okay


---------47:52----------
so you were thinking about your misery


---------47:56----------
right and you were also saying that


---------47:57----------
logically it doesn't make sense


---------48:00----------
to take a you know a loan


---------48:03----------
on rolling the dice on a kid who's like


---------48:06----------
kind of hopeless


---------48:08----------
like they've tried a bunch of stuff


---------48:09----------
right like you've been to special


---------48:10----------
classrooms


---------48:12----------
you've been here you've tried this


---------48:13----------
therapist that therapist


---------48:15----------
and and so i i could imagine that like


---------48:17----------
you maybe felt some degree of


---------48:18----------
hopelessness


---------48:20----------
you may not have recognized it but i


---------48:22----------
think on some level like you understood


---------48:24----------
that you were bouncing around from thing


---------48:25----------
to thing to thing


---------48:27----------
and like you know like i almost get this


---------48:30----------
is the second theme


---------48:31----------
so i get the sense that you were a kid


---------48:33----------
that no one knew what to do with


---------48:36----------
like what do we do with paul like what


---------48:38----------
do we do like well let's try to medicate


---------48:40----------
him let's try to put him in this


---------48:41----------
classroom let's try to put him in that


---------48:42----------
classroom


---------48:43----------
let's expel him let's suspend


---------48:46----------
him let's like what do we do with this


---------48:48----------
kid


---------48:50----------
and it can be really really hard i mean


---------48:52----------
the you know one of the most devastating


---------48:54----------
things to your self-esteem the


---------48:55----------
self-esteem of a child is for like the


---------48:57----------
world to not know like what to do with


---------48:59----------
this kid


---------49:01----------
and to be that kid and then for your


---------49:04----------
parents to sort of like have tried so


---------49:06----------
much stuff and it kind of like not


---------49:08----------
having worked


---------49:09----------
and i i don't know that you sort of


---------49:10----------
consciously understood this but i think


---------49:12----------
it manifests in self-esteem like


---------49:14----------
you felt like probably not like a great


---------49:16----------
kid right and you were like really angry


---------49:18----------
all the time and angry was just sort of


---------49:19----------
like


---------49:20----------
the way that these emotions like these


---------49:22----------
other emotions manifested


---------49:25----------
yeah i mean that that makes i mean yeah


---------49:27----------
the anger just


---------49:28----------
was everything yep and and so when you


---------49:32----------
think about that kid and you think about


---------49:33----------
your parents sort of like


---------49:37----------
knowing that maybe this wasn't a great


---------49:39----------
idea like logically didn't sound like a


---------49:41----------
great idea but for them to really put


---------49:42----------
themselves at financial


---------49:44----------
risk when


---------49:47----------
we didn't know if it was going to work


---------49:48----------
like it sounds like a stupid decision


---------49:50----------
but like it's a stupid decision they


---------49:51----------
made for you


---------49:54----------
yeah and that's and and that's uh yeah i


---------49:58----------
mean that's like love right so


---------49:59----------
yeah exactly right so like and that's


---------50:01----------
why it feels kind of weird on the inside


---------50:03----------
because it's not like a positive emotion


---------50:05----------
there's like


---------50:05----------
there's some kind of hurt but it's also


---------50:08----------
like you can tell


---------50:09----------
that you are on the receiving end of


---------50:11----------
someone's like


---------50:13----------
stupidity that you are on the receiving


---------50:17----------
end of like


---------50:17----------
they're making a bad decision because


---------50:19----------
they love you right it's kind of weird


---------50:22----------
yeah does that make sense yeah no no


---------50:25----------
that man yeah that does that makes a lot


---------50:27----------
of sense


---------50:29----------
yeah and so sometimes that's what love


---------50:31----------
feels like so i'd say like take a


---------50:32----------
snapshot


---------50:33----------
you know screencap that and like to feel


---------50:37----------
valued when maybe you yourself didn't


---------50:40----------
think you were worth it


---------50:43----------
like for someone to take a risk on you


---------50:45----------
that may not have worked out


---------50:48----------
but for them to like care about you that


---------50:50----------
much


---------50:51----------
and like put their own financial health


---------50:53----------
at stake like for your sake


---------50:55----------
it can it's like something that maybe


---------50:57----------
like there's a little bit of likes


---------50:59----------
like you know pity or some something on


---------51:02----------
that


---------51:03----------
spectrum in there too does that feel


---------51:05----------
right to you


---------51:09----------
no i don't think pity i i hate pity


---------51:12----------
so much i hate when anyone gives me pity


---------51:15----------
so i don't


---------51:15----------
i know what i feel that okay okay


---------51:19----------
um yeah so you know i'd encourage you


---------51:22----------
paul to just kind of like


---------51:25----------
pay attention to that because sometimes


---------51:26----------
that's what love or feeling valued


---------51:30----------
or feeling cared for do any of those


---------51:34----------
kind of resonate with with maybe what


---------51:36----------
you could you could have felt back then


---------51:38----------
like in terms of when i asked you about


---------51:40----------
your feelings


---------51:42----------
no back then i didn't feel cared for at


---------51:44----------
all no no i i don't mean back then i


---------51:46----------
mean like just a few minutes ago


---------51:48----------
like as we were talking about it


---------51:51----------
a few weeks ago no sorry sorry a few


---------51:53----------
minutes ago


---------51:54----------
oh um yeah i mean


---------51:58----------
looking back on it yeah they i i i


---------52:01----------
i guess that could be what it is like


---------52:03----------
that i felt cared for


---------52:06----------
no so i think what's what's happening is


---------52:07----------
that you didn't feel cared for back then


---------52:11----------
but now you're realizing that maybe you


---------52:14----------
were


---------52:14----------
cared for yeah


---------52:18----------
that actually that that could be it


---------52:20----------
because it it it is like uh


---------52:22----------
i felt like yeah it's like a positive


---------52:24----------
feeling that i was feeling so


---------52:27----------
even though it was like you were having


---------52:29----------
like memories of hurt


---------52:31----------
with a positive feeling in the present


---------52:35----------
right yeah that that makes a lot of


---------52:38----------
sense that's


---------52:39----------
it's crazy to think about like i'm just


---------52:40----------
thinking about it it's it's kind of


---------52:42----------
crazy because


---------52:44----------
i didn't ever really think like that


---------52:47----------
ever


---------52:49----------
when i think of i just look at stuff


---------52:52----------
like


---------52:52----------
with black and white honestly with


---------52:54----------
everything that i


---------52:56----------
look at and what i think about so i


---------52:58----------
don't so it's


---------52:59----------
it's interesting that you you put it


---------53:01----------
that way because it's


---------53:02----------
it's uh it really makes me think and


---------53:04----------
like oh maybe that's right


---------53:06----------
that is true yeah


---------53:09----------
yeah i mean i think this is you know and


---------53:12----------
how do you come up with likes


---------53:14----------
like how do you know that like how do


---------53:16----------
you come up with that


---------53:19----------
uh how do i come up with are you asking


---------53:22----------
because you want to do this process


---------53:23----------
yourself


---------53:24----------
down the road yeah yeah yeah like how do


---------53:26----------
you look at stuff not so


---------53:28----------
black and white with practice


---------53:34----------
right so so so this is what what


---------53:36----------
training is for and this is what


---------53:37----------
practice is for


---------53:39----------
but i think that um


---------53:42----------
let me see if i can give you a better


---------53:44----------
answer


---------53:46----------
because what i'm hearing in that


---------53:47----------
question is can you teach me to do that


---------53:49----------
on my own and can we do that again


---------53:52----------
yeah is that is that the question yeah


---------53:55----------
yeah so let me can i have a second to


---------53:57----------
think about how to teach that to you


---------54:08----------
okay


---------54:19----------
okay so here's the thing when you're


---------54:22----------
growing up


---------54:24----------
so like let's black and white is fine


---------54:26----------
like that's not a big deal


---------54:28----------
so when you're growing up you have a


---------54:29----------
conception of things right like if you


---------54:31----------
think about your memory


---------54:33----------
your memory is laid down by a particular


---------54:36----------
mind


---------54:38----------
so your memories of like you know being


---------54:40----------
frustrated with your parents for like


---------54:43----------
putting you on zoloft those memories


---------54:46----------
were like


---------54:46----------
saved to your hard drive by like a 12


---------54:49----------
year old mind


---------54:51----------
does that make sense yeah it's kind of


---------54:54----------
like if i draw a picture


---------54:55----------
of you know a dinosaur and i'm six


---------55:00----------
and i have that picture on a piece of


---------55:01----------
paper and then i like 20 years later i'm


---------55:04----------
a great artist


---------55:05----------
the piece of paper with the dinosaurs it


---------55:07----------
was still made up by a six-year-old


---------55:10----------
so it's not like as my skill as an


---------55:12----------
artist improves


---------55:15----------
all of my past pictures get better does


---------55:18----------
that make sense


---------55:20----------
so our bizarrely our memories are the


---------55:22----------
same way


---------55:23----------
so our memories get laid down


---------55:26----------
by the mind that exists at that time


---------55:30----------
so it's it's not going to be very easy


---------55:32----------
for me to see it


---------55:34----------
other than in black and white because i


---------55:35----------
was so young


---------55:38----------
exactly so but now what you can do is


---------55:41----------
now there's like 29 year old paul


---------55:43----------
right so you can actually go and revisit


---------55:46----------
huh 26. 20 seconds make me feel old


---------55:50----------
sorry um there's there's 26 year old


---------55:54----------
paul


---------55:54----------
25 paul 24 whatever doesn't really


---------55:56----------
matter


---------55:58----------
there's paul there's the adult paul who


---------56:01----------
can go back


---------56:02----------
and revisit those experiences


---------56:05----------
but you're gonna revisit them with your


---------56:07----------
adult mind


---------56:09----------
and when you revisit them with your


---------56:11----------
adult mind there's like actually a


---------56:13----------
technique to like


---------56:14----------
go through those like experiences again


---------56:17----------
right


---------56:18----------
so for example like um


---------56:21----------
you know you can and this is this gets


---------56:23----------
this is where things get a little bit


---------56:24----------
tricky like


---------56:25----------
you have to really sort of do it in a in


---------56:27----------
a systematic way where like you can kind


---------56:29----------
of say like okay


---------56:30----------
what happened first what happened next


---------56:32----------
what happened third


---------56:34----------
um and there's actually like a technique


---------56:36----------
of almost like journaling where you can


---------56:37----------
just write down like you know i would


---------56:38----------
say like write down


---------56:39----------
one page of like a memory that you had


---------56:43----------
and then and then you can sort of


---------56:44----------
analyze it with your current mind and


---------56:46----------
you can go through and like look at each


---------56:48----------
sentence and


---------56:49----------
ask yourself what could i have been


---------56:51----------
feeling then what could i have been


---------56:52----------
feeling then what could i have been


---------56:53----------
feeling then what could i have been


---------56:54----------
feeling then


---------56:55----------
because your memory is going to be like


---------56:57----------
anger is going to be each of those


---------56:59----------
things


---------57:00----------
right like all your memory is just going


---------57:02----------
to be purely of anger


---------57:04----------
but if we think about you know the


---------57:05----------
scenario with like pimp in the bathroom


---------57:07----------
like


---------57:08----------
there's like shame there's humiliation


---------57:10----------
there's like


---------57:11----------
you know injustice there are all kinds


---------57:14----------
of other emotions


---------57:16----------
besides anger and so as we revisit


---------57:19----------
our past experiences we can take that


---------57:22----------
six-year-old's drawing and we can kind


---------57:24----------
of like fix it up a little bit and then


---------57:26----------
you'll have a new perspective on it


---------57:30----------
that makes sense i don't know if i'd be


---------57:32----------
very good at that but it


---------57:34----------
i guess like you said it's with training


---------57:36----------
absolutely right so when you say i


---------57:38----------
wouldn't be very good at it


---------57:40----------
are you talking about aptitude or


---------57:43----------
experience


---------57:46----------
i mean i guess a little bit of both i i


---------57:48----------
just uh so


---------57:49----------
too yeah i'm not very good with the uh


---------57:53----------
with just like i would have never even


---------57:55----------
thought


---------57:56----------
about the word like shame or injustice


---------57:58----------
when you brought up the pimps


---------57:59----------
situation i would only think of anger


---------58:03----------
because that you know it's that emotion


---------58:07----------
is well


---------58:08----------
a shameful emotion at least in my


---------58:11----------
experience shame doesn't really


---------58:13----------
translate well memory as well as anger


---------58:15----------
at least


---------58:16----------
well yeah i mean that's that's what i'm


---------58:18----------
saying right so like like it


---------58:20----------
when you say translate well in memory


---------58:22----------
your memory is going to be


---------58:23----------
dominated by experiences of anger and


---------58:26----------
this is where anger is actually a


---------58:27----------
protective emotion


---------58:29----------
anger is what protects us from all the


---------58:31----------
other negative emotions


---------58:34----------
because like you know shame is like


---------58:36----------
harder to deal with than anger is like


---------58:38----------
at least at anger like


---------58:39----------
there's there's like something you can


---------58:40----------
like you know


---------58:42----------
direct your anger at so you don't have


---------58:44----------
to look at yourself you don't have to


---------58:46----------
feel ashamed if i'm


---------58:47----------
pissed at pimp for like you know i get


---------58:50----------
pissed at him i don't have to feel hurt


---------58:52----------
anger is actually what protects us


---------58:53----------
against hurt


---------58:57----------
that makes sense i mean yeah actually


---------59:00----------
oh yeah that does make a lot of sense


---------59:02----------
because shame is i mean that's


---------59:03----------
it's probably the worst emotion in the


---------59:05----------
world


---------59:07----------
if i could do anything to avoid feeling


---------59:08----------
shameful like i would love to


---------59:10----------
but uh what do you do when pity people


---------59:12----------
pity you paul


---------59:14----------
i get angry right i don't like when


---------59:17----------
people


---------59:18----------
pity me i feel like they


---------59:21----------
are i don't know maybe being


---------59:22----------
condescending or something


---------59:24----------
yeah right so but what is pity


---------59:27----------
um when they feel sorry for you yeah


---------59:31----------
is that condescending


---------59:35----------
i i mean not everyone who does it is


---------59:38----------
condescending but i


---------59:39----------
that's just where my mind goes


---------59:40----------
immediately very good right so i'm gonna


---------59:43----------
change that answer for you a little bit


---------59:45----------
it's the way that i feel i feel


---------59:48----------
condescended to


---------59:49----------
i feel like people are condescending to


---------59:51----------
me when they pity me


---------59:53----------
does that make sense right yeah and so


---------59:56----------
like when you


---------59:56----------
when people like pity you like there's


---------59:59----------
like actually


---------60:00----------
some degree of like potential


---------60:01----------
vulnerability or hurt there


---------60:03----------
is that because like if i like if you


---------60:05----------
know


---------60:06----------
if you were in an accident and you broke


---------60:09----------
your leg


---------60:10----------
and i felt pity for you like that's not


---------60:12----------
necessarily condescending sometimes pity


---------60:14----------
can be condescending by the way so i


---------60:16----------
think we got to be careful about pity


---------60:17----------
but


---------60:18----------
you know i could feel like compassion or


---------60:20----------
i could feel empathy


---------60:21----------
the thing you've got to be careful about


---------60:23----------
is that compassion and empathy


---------60:25----------
may feel like pity to you


---------60:29----------
yeah that makes sense i uh


---------60:33----------
i you know i think what i think i i


---------60:36----------
might feel so bad


---------60:38----------
about when people pity me and i feel


---------60:40----------
like condescended to


---------60:41----------
because i you know compassion and


---------60:44----------
empathies are also


---------60:45----------
two emotions i have struggled with yep


---------60:48----------
so so i can't really


---------60:49----------
i can't really um like point it out when


---------60:52----------
i see it you know yep


---------60:53----------
very good so i think like let's think


---------60:55----------
about that so one thing is i do think


---------60:57----------
pity has an


---------60:58----------
element of condescension to it right


---------60:59----------
because pity is like


---------61:01----------
oh like when i'm walking down the street


---------61:03----------
and i you know there's a beggar


---------61:05----------
and then like i have like my you know


---------61:07----------
nice clothes and i've got my fancy new


---------61:09----------
phone and and


---------61:10----------
all this kind of stuff and like oh like


---------61:11----------
this poor beggar like oh


---------61:13----------
like let me like let me pity you like


---------61:15----------
it's like i'm i'm up here and i'm i'm


---------61:17----------
gonna you know i'm gonna give you


---------61:18----------
i'm the hand that's giving and you're


---------61:20----------
the hand that's receiving


---------61:22----------
so sometimes with pity there is a power


---------61:24----------
dynamic with that emotion does that make


---------61:26----------
sense


---------61:27----------
yeah i think the thing you've got to be


---------61:29----------
careful about is if you're


---------61:31----------
colorblind to compassion or empathy


---------61:34----------
if we think like pity compassion and


---------61:37----------
empathy are all going to kind of overlap


---------61:40----------
to some degree right the problem is that


---------61:42----------
if i'm sending you all three signals but


---------61:45----------
you're only able to see


---------61:46----------
one then how are you going to respond


---------61:51----------
and anger yeah actually that makes a lot


---------61:53----------
of sense because


---------61:54----------
any time people have tried to console me


---------61:57----------
i


---------61:58----------
i do get angry because i just i i can't


---------62:01----------
deal with the with those emotions i


---------62:03----------
even now i do so bad with it if i feel


---------62:06----------
if something bad happens or i feel bad


---------62:08----------
and somebody tries to make me feel


---------62:09----------
better i


---------62:10----------
don't usually respond in a positive way


---------62:14----------
yeah that's gotta be that makes sense


---------62:16----------
now cause


---------62:17----------
yeah but how do i fix that


---------62:21----------
well so i i think that that's where you


---------62:23----------
know just ignore so this is okay so now


---------62:25----------
i'm gonna give you a playbook hold on


---------62:26----------
one second let me can i


---------62:27----------
have a second to give you a playbook i


---------62:29----------
just gotta


---------62:30----------
make it up real quick


---------62:36----------
okay


---------62:44----------
okay so it starts with you recognizing


---------62:48----------
this [ __ ] guy is being condescending


---------62:49----------
to me


---------62:51----------
okay so it actually starts because


---------62:53----------
that's a signal that you can detect very


---------62:54----------
easily right


---------62:56----------
yeah so like when you feel like someone


---------62:59----------
is being condescending towards you


---------63:01----------
that's that should be like the you know


---------63:04----------
the


---------63:06----------
running low on gas light in your car


---------63:08----------
like that should be the signal


---------63:09----------
to you okay once you feel that way if


---------63:12----------
you feel like someone is being


---------63:13----------
condescending to you you need to pause


---------63:15----------
for a second


---------63:16----------
and then do a little analysis and ask


---------63:19----------
yourself


---------63:20----------
you know is this person really being


---------63:22----------
condescending


---------63:24----------
if this person were trying to be


---------63:26----------
compassionate


---------63:27----------
what would they do differently if this


---------63:30----------
person would


---------63:31----------
were trying to be compassionate would i


---------63:33----------
be able to tell the difference


---------63:37----------
and and this is where you can also kind


---------63:39----------
of use like you know the friend example


---------63:41----------
like


---------63:41----------
if you take yourself out of the equation


---------63:44----------
if someone's


---------63:45----------
you know dad passed away and then like


---------63:49----------
someone


---------63:50----------
went to their house and said to them


---------63:51----------
like make it like a third person thing


---------63:53----------
so like


---------63:53----------
person a's dad passed away person b


---------63:55----------
shows up and


---------63:56----------
says this thing to person a are would


---------63:59----------
would i consider that condescending


---------64:02----------
and this is where it's hard because you


---------64:03----------
really have to step out of your shoes


---------64:04----------
you have to really think about the


---------64:05----------
scenario


---------64:07----------
outside of your experience of it


---------64:11----------
and then then you can kind of maybe see


---------64:14----------
and it's almost like


---------64:15----------
what you asked me earlier about like you


---------64:16----------
know how do you do that you kind of step


---------64:18----------
out of your own shoes ask yourself


---------64:19----------
okay like if this person would be we're


---------64:21----------
being compassionate what would they do


---------64:23----------
and if you can't come up with an answer


---------64:26----------
then like that's kind of an interesting


---------64:28----------
clue you may not know what compassion


---------64:29----------
looks like which is you know i'm not


---------64:31----------
trying to be condescending there was


---------64:32----------
that was that condescending


---------64:34----------
no i don't know okay okay um but like


---------64:37----------
like you may i i mean you may not know i


---------64:39----------
i don't know i just don't know about


---------64:41----------
that


---------64:41----------
um but you know i'd say that if you if


---------64:43----------
you can't figure out how


---------64:45----------
compassion and condescension would look


---------64:47----------
different


---------64:48----------
in this scenario then that's a real sign


---------64:51----------
that maybe they're trying to be


---------64:52----------
compassionate


---------64:54----------
so step one is recognize the pity and


---------64:56----------
anger


---------64:57----------
recognize this the feeling that


---------64:59----------
someone's being condescended


---------65:00----------
recognize that you're getting pissed so


---------65:02----------
if you're pissed okay why am i pissed


---------65:04----------
is someone being condescending to me


---------65:05----------
okay next question is like


---------65:07----------
okay if two people that were not me and


---------65:09----------
were not this person


---------65:10----------
were engaged in this behavior would that


---------65:13----------
be compassion or would that be


---------65:14----------
condescension


---------65:16----------
third thing is


---------65:22----------
okay let me just make you following me


---------65:25----------
so far


---------65:26----------
yeah okay so then third thing is if this


---------65:29----------
person was trying to be compassionate


---------65:31----------
would i be able to recognize that could


---------65:33----------
i envision what that looked like


---------65:35----------
could it actually look like


---------65:39----------
what they're doing does that make sense


---------65:43----------
like what do you mean what it could look


---------65:46----------
like what they're doing


---------65:47----------
so like someone's doing something to you


---------65:49----------
right that makes you feel like they're


---------65:51----------
you're being they're being condescending


---------65:54----------
yeah


---------65:55----------
right so let's say i say to you oh paul


---------65:58----------
you poor thing let me buy you some


---------66:00----------
deodorant


---------66:02----------
okay right and so so then you can ask


---------66:04----------
yourself like okay


---------66:05----------
does buying does buy deodorant like


---------66:08----------
could that be a sign of compassion


---------66:10----------
or is it necessarily condescension


---------66:13----------
does that does that question make sense


---------66:14----------
now that one makes sense yeah


---------66:17----------
right so like and with deodorant it's


---------66:18----------
like well the decent chance that it's


---------66:20----------
condescending


---------66:21----------
right yeah but it's like my dad passed


---------66:24----------
away someone got me flowers like even


---------66:26----------
though you may feel


---------66:27----------
condescended like people are like


---------66:29----------
looking down on you


---------66:30----------
like i don't need flowers like who the


---------66:32----------
[ __ ] do they think i am


---------66:34----------
needing flowers like that's not really


---------66:36----------
that's not really how i feel like


---------66:38----------
uh if somebody if something bad happens


---------66:41----------
and somebody says


---------66:42----------
like where to get me flowers i mean


---------66:44----------
nobody in my family has died so i


---------66:45----------
i don't know how i'd feel with that but


---------66:47----------
when something bad happens um


---------66:51----------
you know like let's say there's like


---------66:52----------
some drama online or something that


---------66:54----------
makes me feel really bad


---------66:56----------
and then somebody like my girlfriend


---------66:57----------
wants to try and make me feel better


---------67:00----------
i won't feel pissed because i'll be like


---------67:02----------
who does she think i am i'll feel more


---------67:03----------
pissed because


---------67:05----------
she's you know


---------67:09----------
i don't know trying like talking in a


---------67:12----------
place where she is not also feeling bad


---------67:15----------
so she is trying to give me like i don't


---------67:18----------
know trying to make me feel better just


---------67:19----------
makes me feel pissed


---------67:21----------
because i feel like they don't i feel


---------67:22----------
like she wouldn't understand how i'm


---------67:24----------
feeling


---------67:26----------
so that sort of condescending feeling is


---------67:28----------
how i it's how i feel


---------67:30----------
does that make sense why do you call


---------67:31----------
that condescension


---------67:35----------
i mean i i don't know what else to call


---------67:38----------
it so so so you feel like your


---------67:40----------
your girlfriend like doesn't have


---------67:44----------
this the stance to be compassionate


---------67:47----------
towards you or like


---------67:49----------
to console you that


---------67:53----------
and also i don't like when you know if


---------67:56----------
she's trying to


---------67:57----------
console me with something she's bringing


---------67:59----------
up not just her anyone bringing up bad


---------68:01----------
like the bad memories again that just


---------68:03----------
happened i don't like that either i


---------68:05----------
don't like


---------68:06----------
when people want to talk about something


---------68:07----------
to try to make me feel better because it


---------68:09----------
brings back


---------68:10----------
those negative emotions and i don't


---------68:13----------
do good at dealing with negative


---------68:15----------
emotions so i don't even want to go


---------68:16----------
there


---------68:17----------
and then so it's like a multi-layered


---------68:20----------
thing why i get pissed


---------68:22----------
good i mean it's not good that it's both


---------68:25----------
but it's good i i'm really


---------68:26----------
happy actually um paul because it sounds


---------68:30----------
like you actually have a lot of


---------68:31----------
insight in into why you get pissed


---------68:35----------
i mean right even nowadays i still keep


---------68:37----------
to myself


---------68:38----------
you know i mean i don't even really talk


---------68:40----------
about things with my girlfriend


---------68:42----------
um she tries to talk about things with


---------68:44----------
me but i just you know


---------68:45----------
i kind of just keep to myself i don't


---------68:47----------
let her


---------68:48----------
usually i just don't i'm so used to


---------68:51----------
keeping things myself


---------68:53----------
that i that's just what i've come


---------68:55----------
accustomed to


---------68:57----------
okay so i'm gonna give you step four


---------68:59----------
which is i think


---------69:00----------
talk to the person that you feel angry


---------69:03----------
at for trying to console you


---------69:06----------
and this is where you can signal some


---------69:07----------
things to them right you can tell them


---------69:09----------
explicitly


---------69:10----------
hey i recognize you're trying to talk to


---------69:12----------
me about this


---------69:14----------
but i actually find that talking about


---------69:16----------
it like brings up


---------69:17----------
more negative emotions


---------69:21----------
right just like you explained to me like


---------69:23----------
just share that with them have you tried


---------69:24----------
doing that


---------69:26----------
no i usually uh just get angry and i


---------69:29----------
tell them to go away


---------69:31----------
right so we're gonna like like i know it


---------69:33----------
sounds kind of weird paul but we gotta


---------69:35----------
like retrain those neurons


---------69:38----------
right so that's not gonna help your


---------69:39----------
relationships it's


---------69:41----------
it's a really bad habit i know i just my


---------69:43----------
whole life


---------69:44----------
26 years i just have only been to myself


---------69:48----------
and that's just


---------69:49----------
it you know and then actually when as a


---------69:51----------
strip when i became a streamer


---------69:52----------
i definitely couldn't express myself i


---------69:55----------
did not feel comfortable expressing


---------69:57----------
myself to


---------69:58----------
people on a live stream you know


---------70:02----------
what's your understanding of why you've


---------70:03----------
become so self-reliant


---------70:07----------
i just have trust issues


---------70:10----------
well said right so i i think the way


---------70:13----------
that i would put that i think you have


---------70:15----------
a lot of reasons to not let other people


---------70:19----------
in


---------70:20----------
i don't know what you're referring to


---------70:21----------
when you say trust issues but what i'm


---------70:22----------
hearing is a kid who was chronically


---------70:24----------
misunderstood


---------70:25----------
growing up well when i say trust that


---------70:28----------
and


---------70:29----------
when i say trust issues i mean yeah i


---------70:31----------
just don't wanna i


---------70:32----------
give i don't trust anyone else with


---------70:35----------
my feelings i don't know i just don't


---------70:37----------
like i've just had too many bad


---------70:38----------
experiences where i tell someone about


---------70:40----------
my feelings and then i feel


---------70:41----------
worse they make me feel worse are you


---------70:44----------
feeling worse now


---------70:46----------
no i i prepared myself to


---------70:50----------
chat with you so i you know i just


---------70:53----------
i have an ex i have an expectation when


---------70:55----------
talking to you so i


---------70:56----------
i don't feel bad because i've already


---------71:00----------
gave myself that expectation right okay


---------71:03----------
do you feel like you're


---------71:05----------
okay so when it comes to your girlfriend


---------71:07----------
i do want to give you some concrete


---------71:09----------
feedback here to where like i think


---------71:11----------
instead of


---------71:12----------
i think it's fine to push her away but


---------71:14----------
just use


---------71:15----------
this language if that makes sense you


---------71:17----------
know just tell her hey


---------71:19----------
sometimes like i recognize that you're


---------71:20----------
trying to help me but sometimes it's


---------71:22----------
actually like makes things


---------71:24----------
more emotionally difficult i i prefer to


---------71:27----------
kind of process on my own


---------71:30----------
and you think that is that like i mean


---------71:32----------
is that more healthy than me trying to


---------71:34----------
figure out how to


---------71:36----------
talk to her like like i would prefer


---------71:40----------
if i didn't get angry bro that is


---------71:42----------
talking to her


---------71:44----------
that's the first step to talking to her


---------71:47----------
okay


---------71:48----------
does that make sense it's like


---------71:52----------
wait first i just want to i like


---------71:55----------
eventually i want to be able to not get


---------71:57----------
angry and feel so negative when people


---------71:58----------
try to


---------72:00----------
yeah yeah he told me i so i don't want


---------72:02----------
to push him away i just can't deal with


---------72:04----------
the


---------72:05----------
emotions when you know i just can't deal


---------72:08----------
with them i just get so


---------72:10----------
worked up you know yeah so so that that


---------72:13----------
actually is the first and most important


---------72:15----------
step right like so if we want to figure


---------72:16----------
out


---------72:18----------
like so what i'm hearing from you paul


---------72:19----------
is that you and


---------72:21----------
the people that you care about you want


---------72:23----------
to be able to move in the direction of


---------72:25----------
being able to discuss emotional things


---------72:27----------
right yeah i want to yeah okay so that


---------72:30----------
starts out


---------72:31----------
by figuring out if you want to go


---------72:33----------
somewhere you have to start


---------72:35----------
by figuring out where you are


---------72:38----------
does that make sense like if we're in


---------72:42----------
like south florida like that's where we


---------72:43----------
got to start like sure i want to be in


---------72:45----------
the pacific northwest


---------72:46----------
like that's where i want to go but we


---------72:48----------
got to start where we are


---------72:51----------
and so signaling to your girlfriend i


---------72:52----------
know it sounds kind of weird but that's


---------72:54----------
a way to


---------72:54----------
open up the conversation right so you


---------72:56----------
instead of just pushing her away


---------72:58----------
and like jumping into your emotions too


---------73:01----------
heavily what's going on


---------73:02----------
you i feel like i just lost you for a


---------73:04----------
second oh no


---------73:06----------
my microphone is flashing i just want to


---------73:07----------
make sure


---------73:09----------
um so i think i know it sounds kind of


---------73:11----------
weird because it sounds like you're


---------73:12----------
pushing her away but i don't think it's


---------73:14----------
actually pushing her away i think it's


---------73:15----------
actually the first step to letting her


---------73:17----------
in because you're signaling to her hey


---------73:20----------
this is hard for me


---------73:21----------
it's not that i'm mean it's not that i


---------73:23----------
don't care about you it's not that i


---------73:24----------
don't appreciate it


---------73:26----------
it's hard for me to be consoled right


---------73:30----------
now


---------73:32----------
okay right and and so like like you kind


---------73:35----------
of signaling to her like what you can


---------73:37----------
handle


---------73:38----------
in a respectful way where you're not


---------73:40----------
saying things that are hurtful


---------73:42----------
you're not lashing out to her that's


---------73:44----------
gonna start to lay the foundation for


---------73:46----------
like the next step in communication


---------73:52----------
but if i tell her to go uh to go away


---------73:55----------
you know because i'm not feeling good


---------73:56----------
how do i open myself back


---------74:00----------
to that conversation because that's the


---------74:03----------
heart


---------74:03----------
that's the hard part yeah but you're not


---------74:05----------
telling her to go away


---------74:06----------
right you're just saying it's hard for


---------74:08----------
me to talk


---------74:10----------
and then and then paul you're brilliant


---------74:12----------
bro


---------74:13----------
you say exactly what you just said to me


---------74:16----------
which is that i want to be able to have


---------74:18----------
this conversation with you


---------74:20----------
but i recognize there's a part of me


---------74:22----------
that's pushing you away but like i don't


---------74:24----------
want to


---------74:25----------
but it's hard for me to like sit with


---------74:27----------
these negative emotions


---------74:31----------
does that make sense yeah like you can


---------74:34----------
even say something like


---------74:36----------
i feel myself pushing you away but i


---------74:39----------
don't want to


---------74:42----------
how does that sound i mean that's


---------74:45----------
that's accurate um my only fear is that


---------74:50----------
i go back into the conversation and


---------74:53----------
you know then i just get angry during it


---------74:56----------
so you share that as well right so you


---------74:59----------
say that you say i'm a


---------75:00----------
i want to have this conversation but i'm


---------75:02----------
afraid that because it's painful


---------75:05----------
i'm going to get angry and i don't want


---------75:07----------
to get angry and now i don't know if


---------75:10----------
you've been paying attention paul and


---------75:12----------
i'm not trying to be condescending here


---------75:13----------
but that is you have sharing your


---------75:15----------
feelings with her that is like literally


---------75:16----------
what that is


---------75:18----------
you were doing it at that point does


---------75:20----------
that make sense


---------75:21----------
yeah right because like you've shared


---------75:24----------
actually a lot with her at that point


---------75:27----------
you want me to recap just or yeah


---------75:30----------
i mean no no it's fine i got it it's i


---------75:33----------
shared a lot but


---------75:34----------
we haven't shared like the main part of


---------75:37----------
it though we've only


---------75:38----------
shared how i feel before the


---------75:40----------
conversation


---------75:41----------
yep good so that's actually how you do


---------75:44----------
it


---------75:44----------
so like what you do is you start right


---------75:46----------
so like if i'm if i'm like let's say


---------75:48----------
you've got


---------75:48----------
you know let's say you have a broken arm


---------75:51----------
okay


---------75:52----------
so if i'm a doctor and like there's a


---------75:54----------
child with a broken arm i don't start by


---------75:56----------
touching this


---------75:57----------
i start by touching this and then i get


---------76:00----------
closer does this hurt no does this hurt


---------76:01----------
does this hurt


---------76:02----------
does this hurt does this oh this hurts a


---------76:04----------
little bit i'm sorry can i just move a


---------76:06----------
little bit okay that hurts


---------76:07----------
oh that really hurts oh my god oh that's


---------76:10----------
very painful i'm so sorry


---------76:11----------
so you start in a safe zone and then you


---------76:14----------
slowly move towards the deep end


---------76:17----------
right you got to start in the kiddie


---------76:18----------
pool and then like


---------76:21----------
like as you guys talk about it and then


---------76:23----------
like this is where


---------76:24----------
she's not gonna feel pushed away because


---------76:26----------
you're sharing with her


---------76:28----------
right and then the two of y'all are


---------76:30----------
gonna work together about going into the


---------76:32----------
deep end


---------76:35----------
makes sense yeah i mean i i'll


---------76:38----------
definitely have to try that


---------76:39----------
because i guess i i keep keep trying to


---------76:41----------
go right into the deep end i think so


---------76:43----------
yep


---------76:44----------
you took the thought right out of my


---------76:46----------
mind


---------76:48----------
yeah you want to teleport right to where


---------76:50----------
you want to go but you got to go slow


---------76:52----------
paul right because like if we think


---------76:55----------
about it


---------76:56----------
why is it so hard for you to connect


---------76:58----------
it's because like


---------76:59----------
for like you know the first half of your


---------77:02----------
life


---------77:03----------
or even long in the first half of your


---------77:04----------
life like it was hard to let people in


---------77:07----------
because


---------77:08----------
you didn't know how and they didn't


---------77:09----------
understand you and they like


---------77:11----------
you know you didn't do anything wrong


---------77:12----------
but they still called you a snitch and


---------77:13----------
bullied you like of course you got trust


---------77:15----------
issues


---------77:16----------
so you have to you have to give yourself


---------77:18----------
the patience


---------77:20----------
to build that trust up and it needs to


---------77:22----------
be built up slowly


---------77:24----------
you know you don't you don't like build


---------77:25----------
up trust in the 24-hour period right


---------77:28----------
like trust is something it's not like


---------77:30----------
you know it happens slowly


---------77:33----------
yeah it makes sense


---------77:39----------
relationships uh are tough i don't know


---------77:43----------
how


---------77:44----------
people i don't know not relationships


---------77:45----------
like boy girl but like you know


---------77:47----------
friendships


---------77:48----------
all kinds of relationships it's just


---------77:49----------
it's tough i don't i like i wish i could


---------77:52----------
just


---------77:52----------
it just came naturally to me more like


---------77:55----------
more often but it's


---------77:56----------
uh so hard to do


---------78:01----------
yeah uh i'm


---------78:05----------
can i share some feelings with you yeah


---------78:09----------
so when you say something like that it


---------78:12----------
makes me feel something like pity for


---------78:14----------
you


---------78:16----------
right like i i just i think it's sad and


---------78:20----------
i'm i'm trying to avoid that feeling but


---------78:22----------
i have it


---------78:23----------
i kind of like think about your life and


---------78:24----------
like you know


---------78:26----------
it sounds like you spawned on hard mode


---------78:29----------
like you're playing the game of life on


---------78:31----------
hard mode and so i feel some degree of


---------78:33----------
like


---------78:34----------
compassion towards you how do you feel


---------78:36----------
about that


---------78:37----------
when you say does that rub you the wrong


---------78:40----------
way


---------78:41----------
um i mean it doesn't i mean it doesn't


---------78:44----------
rub me the wrong way i mean i


---------78:45----------
i maybe uh on medium because i'm i'm


---------78:49----------
pretty like privileged


---------78:50----------
to like live you know in a nice family


---------78:53----------
and stuff so i'm not i don't think


---------78:54----------
like i have a hard life but i had just


---------78:57----------
you know when it comes to like


---------78:59----------
more of deeper emotional stuff that's


---------79:01----------
when it gets tough


---------79:02----------
but that's not really something i would


---------79:04----------
consider like a hard life


---------79:06----------
yeah so let me modify what i said a


---------79:09----------
little bit you let me know how this


---------79:10----------
makes you feel


---------79:12----------
okay so on the one hand paul i i respect


---------79:15----------
you dude i think you're a survivor i


---------79:16----------
think you've


---------79:17----------
you know like it sounds like you had a


---------79:18----------
really challenging upbringing in a lot


---------79:20----------
of ways and


---------79:21----------
you actually like worked really hard to


---------79:23----------
like put yourself back together


---------79:25----------
that you've grown into an adult and like


---------79:27----------
you've learned how to do things that did


---------79:29----------
not come


---------79:30----------
easily for you that other people take


---------79:31----------
for granted


---------79:33----------
feeling okay with that so far yeah is


---------79:36----------
that fair to say


---------79:37----------
for me to say that and respect you for


---------79:39----------
that


---------79:40----------
and at the same time i'm also sad that


---------79:42----------
like you were dealt that hand in the


---------79:44----------
first place


---------79:46----------
yeah i mean that's that's uh i like that


---------79:49----------
way better


---------79:50----------
yeah so it's kind of interesting because


---------79:51----------
like i can respect your triumph


---------79:54----------
and also be like man that sucks that you


---------79:56----------
were in that situation where you had to


---------79:57----------
triumph in the first place


---------80:02----------
makes sense how does that make you feel


---------80:05----------
i like that it makes me feel good yeah


---------80:08----------
so i just don't like when uh yeah i


---------80:10----------
didn't like the hard mode thing because


---------80:12----------
it makes me feel


---------80:13----------
like i'm being in the wrong


---------80:16----------
because there's people who have these


---------80:19----------
emotional


---------80:20----------
problems and their life isn't good


---------80:22----------
because they


---------80:24----------
you know like i went to that camp that


---------80:25----------
bro they had you know these kids were in


---------80:27----------
the same boat as me but they had they


---------80:28----------
were orphans or


---------80:30----------
you know they were going they were in


---------80:32----------
jail and like they just had way worse


---------80:33----------
lives than me so my perspective is so


---------80:36----------
wide that yeah i just i i felt


---------80:39----------
kind of like i was in the wrong when you


---------80:41----------
said hard mode


---------80:43----------
yeah i can understand that um can i


---------80:46----------
disagree with you there a little bit


---------80:48----------
can i share my experience yeah so i i've


---------80:51----------
worked with people who are very


---------80:52----------
privileged and very wealthy


---------80:54----------
i've worked in jails i've worked with


---------80:57----------
kids


---------80:58----------
you know i've worked at places where


---------80:59----------
kids run away on a routine basis let's


---------81:01----------
just put it that way


---------81:04----------
and what i've come to realize is that no


---------81:06----------
amount of privilege


---------81:08----------
protects you from suffering that at the


---------81:11----------
end of the day in


---------81:12----------
in buddha the buddha the guy who founded


---------81:14----------
buddhism you know


---------81:15----------
he sort of said this and he said that


---------81:17----------
like ultimately like suffering is a part


---------81:19----------
of the human condition


---------81:21----------
and it's been really bizarre because


---------81:22----------
i've worked with people who are suicidal


---------81:24----------
and like in jail and are going to be


---------81:26----------
there for the next 40 years


---------81:28----------
and i've worked with people who just got


---------81:30----------
promoted to be ceo of a


---------81:32----------
you know a tech startup out of mit who


---------81:35----------
are also suicidal


---------81:36----------
and when i really sit with them both of


---------81:38----------
them i don't think that


---------81:40----------
you know does one have more privilege


---------81:42----------
absolutely does one have certain


---------81:43----------
benefits that they should be grateful


---------81:45----------
for


---------81:45----------
absolutely is one's life easier


---------81:48----------
absolutely


---------81:50----------
and at the same time in my experience


---------81:53----------
suffering


---------81:54----------
and difficulty are not the same thing


---------81:59----------
it's kind of weird it's just my


---------82:00----------
experience


---------82:03----------
that that's a good way to put it i like


---------82:06----------
that


---------82:07----------
do you think other people see it that


---------82:09----------
way


---------82:12----------
because i felt like i felt like the bad


---------82:14----------
guy there for a second because


---------82:16----------
i felt like i was in the wrong for a


---------82:17----------
second because of how other people would


---------82:19----------
perceive it


---------82:20----------
who aren't uh as well put as you


---------82:24----------
you know you're like you you can


---------82:26----------
understand things probably


---------82:28----------
a little bit better than the average


---------82:31----------
person


---------82:33----------
yeah so i i think that that's a problem


---------82:35----------
that people we seem to be


---------82:37----------
keeping suffering more and more and more


---------82:41----------
right we we allow some people to suffer


---------82:43----------
and then we get into this like weird


---------82:45----------
like


---------82:46----------
contest about who's the most who's


---------82:49----------
allowed to suffer the most


---------82:51----------
it's weird you know like it's like at


---------82:54----------
the end of the day paul like


---------82:56----------
you have probably the single worst case


---------82:58----------
of school bullying that i've ever heard


---------83:02----------
this whole thing with like pimp in the


---------83:03----------
bathroom like i've heard a lot of cases


---------83:05----------
of bullying like


---------83:06----------
by like you know people like that's the


---------83:08----------
worst i mean it's like


---------83:10----------
[ __ ] like it's humiliating it's like


---------83:13----------
terrifying


---------83:14----------
you know like that's that's so


---------83:16----------
psychologically like


---------83:18----------
the bizarre thing and what's even like


---------83:19----------
worse is like


---------83:21----------
it actually doesn't sound like it was


---------83:22----------
that traumatic for you


---------83:25----------
i mean it was pretty it was pretty bad


---------83:28----------
if i still remember


---------83:29----------
i mean i understand it was pretty bad


---------83:31----------
but just hearing the way you talk about


---------83:32----------
it it sounds like


---------83:34----------
in the grand scheme of things it was


---------83:36----------
maybe one of the worst things that


---------83:38----------
happened to you


---------83:38----------
but your baseline was like pretty [ __ ]


---------83:41----------
you know you know what's crazy


---------83:43----------
that yeah you know that that was pretty


---------83:45----------
traumatic


---------83:46----------
but compared to i mean well now a day is


---------83:50----------
it


---------83:50----------
like i don't know like i have been


---------83:52----------
through so much worse as a streamer


---------83:55----------
than my childhood bro that yeah getting


---------83:58----------
pretend


---------83:59----------
raped is almost like nothing


---------84:02----------
like you know what i mean and that's


---------84:04----------
[ __ ] terrible to say but it's


---------84:06----------
it's my scale is so skewed


---------84:09----------
a [ __ ] up [ __ ] i've been through so


---------84:11----------
much [ __ ] up [ __ ]


---------84:12----------
yep absolutely man and so this is where


---------84:15----------
i think at the end of the day


---------84:16----------
comparing suffering i think is a waste


---------84:18----------
of everyone's time


---------84:20----------
it's not that anyone deserves to suffer


---------84:22----------
more than you are i think the right move


---------84:24----------
is to like


---------84:25----------
you know if stuff sucked for you it


---------84:27----------
sucked for you and also


---------84:29----------
like if things are worse for other


---------84:30----------
people like have compassion for them and


---------84:32----------
try to help them but like


---------84:34----------
they it doesn't matter whether my life


---------84:36----------
was good or my life is bad i should


---------84:37----------
still have compassion for someone who's


---------84:39----------
whose life is like


---------84:40----------
sucks right does that make sense and i


---------84:43----------
don't know why is


---------84:44----------
like societally we've started entangling


---------84:47----------
those two


---------84:49----------
like if my life is bad then i


---------84:52----------
it's weird it's like i don't need to


---------84:54----------
give compassion to others


---------84:56----------
and if my life is good then i don't


---------84:58----------
deserve to have compassion myself


---------85:00----------
it's really weird i just don't think it


---------85:01----------
makes any sense i think you know


---------85:02----------
someone's life can be terrible and you


---------85:04----------
should be compassionate towards them


---------85:05----------
irrespective of how bad your life is


---------85:08----------
now you may not be able to do a whole


---------85:10----------
lot right like if you if you're you know


---------85:11----------
if you're dealing with trauma or abuse


---------85:13----------
or you got diagnosed with cancer and you


---------85:15----------
may not have a whole lot of bandwidth to


---------85:16----------
give


---------85:17----------
that's completely separate but in terms


---------85:20----------
of i don't think it's


---------85:21----------
you know i mean it sounds like paul


---------85:23----------
you've had some things that you should


---------85:24----------
be grateful for


---------85:26----------
like you had parents that loved you a


---------85:27----------
lot and took out a loan


---------85:29----------
to try to help their son get on the


---------85:30----------
right track so should you be grateful


---------85:31----------
for that


---------85:32----------
absolutely but did your life


---------85:36----------
suck in some ways absolutely


---------85:40----------
and those two don't have to be mutually


---------85:41----------
exclusive


---------85:45----------
okay yeah i just always i don't know i


---------85:48----------
just always feel weird


---------85:50----------
like uh talking about like uh like how


---------85:53----------
hard some parts of my life have been


---------85:55----------
because i just feel like yeah obviously


---------85:57----------
i've got a lot of privilege


---------85:59----------
and i don't want to overstep my boundary


---------86:02----------
here of


---------86:04----------
what you know i know that's like weird


---------86:05----------
but i just i put no


---------86:07----------
it's i just i don't know i just want to


---------86:09----------
make sure i'm not


---------86:12----------
putting myself in a situation where


---------86:13----------
people are going to


---------86:16----------
look at me poorly in that sense at least


---------86:19----------
i don't know


---------86:21----------
yeah so i i don't know man i i think


---------86:23----------
that you know you got to be a little bit


---------86:25----------
careful about your appearance but


---------86:27----------
i don't yeah i mean i i think that if


---------86:31----------
this is your authentic experience then


---------86:33----------
that's your authentic experience like it


---------86:34----------
happened to you


---------86:36----------
and if people think that you're like you


---------86:37----------
know pity farming


---------86:40----------
you know i don't get that sense from you


---------86:42----------
i i don't you know i think you're just


---------86:44----------
i think it just sounds like very


---------86:45----------
authentic to me like


---------86:47----------
yeah the whole pity like thing actually


---------86:50----------
i never had an issue with


---------86:51----------
with pity as much at least until


---------86:54----------
i started streaming the the streaming


---------86:57----------
the


---------86:58----------
when i first started streaming obviously


---------87:00----------
i was very sheltered


---------87:02----------
so that it was everything bro and i


---------87:03----------
learned a lot of [ __ ]


---------87:05----------
from just viewers


---------87:09----------
interacting with me and a lot of it has


---------87:12----------
been


---------87:12----------
negative um learning and not positive


---------87:15----------
learning


---------87:16----------
you know like i learned to not you know


---------87:20----------
feel bad for myself and [ __ ] which is


---------87:23----------
kind of uh paul i just want to pause for


---------87:27----------
a second so we've been


---------87:28----------
uh you know going at this for about an


---------87:30----------
hour and a half how are you feeling


---------87:33----------
i i mean i feel good i like getting the


---------87:35----------
stuff off my chest


---------87:37----------
i uh don't know if i'm doing good at it


---------87:40----------
or not i'm sorry if uh


---------87:41----------
i'm if i'm not but there's


---------87:44----------
pre-apology.exe


---------87:46----------
i just want to make sure that i'm not


---------87:48----------
like uh just dragging things on or


---------87:50----------
something


---------87:52----------
no i i i think that i've i think


---------87:55----------
today's so far everything we've talked


---------87:57----------
about has been very productive


---------88:00----------
um the only reason i paused is because i


---------88:02----------
i'm recognizing that we haven't even


---------88:04----------
touched streaming yet


---------88:06----------
yeah it's i mean i keep it short or i


---------88:09----------
can give you the whole thing


---------88:10----------
it's up to you well so that's where


---------88:13----------
where i i'm


---------88:14----------
actually wondering you know i i think i


---------88:16----------
actually want the whole thing


---------88:17----------
um because i i think that's you know i'm


---------88:20----------
not interested in the abbreviated


---------88:22----------
version it's just i


---------88:23----------
i mean i imagine that'll be long so you


---------88:25----------
know are you are you good for going for


---------88:27----------
like another hour


---------88:29----------
yeah i'm good so tell me about streaming


---------88:32----------
okay i mean i don't even know where to


---------88:34----------
begin dude it's it's such a


---------88:36----------
all right i mean i guess when i uh first


---------88:38----------
got into streaming um i mean i'm just


---------88:40----------
gonna stick to like the whole mental


---------88:42----------
health and like how i feel part of


---------88:43----------
streaming more so than like


---------88:45----------
how i became a streamer [ __ ] because


---------88:46----------
people you know know that [ __ ] so


---------88:49----------
um i i don't can you tell me a little


---------88:52----------
bit about it


---------88:53----------
yeah um well i became a streamer i was


---------88:56----------
playing uh runescape


---------88:57----------
which is uh you know this game i played


---------88:59----------
a lot for like ever since i was young


---------89:01----------
it was uh game always played so i became


---------89:04----------
a streamer i started streaming runescape


---------89:06----------
um and i made youtube videos with it and


---------89:10----------
and i you know it was just fun i didn't


---------89:12----------
take it seriously you should just like


---------89:13----------
smoke weed


---------89:14----------
after work and then go live make videos


---------89:18----------
and like just troll a little bit on


---------89:19----------
runescape you know i'd have like really


---------89:21----------
good armor and like a really bad


---------89:23----------
situation and


---------89:24----------
die and then i'd be like oh i [ __ ]


---------89:25----------
died and it was just funny


---------89:28----------
and um you know people liked it i


---------89:31----------
started getting a following from that


---------89:34----------
and uh


---------89:35----------
you know it was all going pretty well


---------89:36----------
for you know the first like three months


---------89:39----------
i think i started in like august 2015.


---------89:44----------
wow and yeah i mean that's how


---------89:47----------
streaming started um then irl came out


---------89:51----------
and i actually started to move


---------89:55----------
my content to irl or like pokemon go is


---------89:57----------
what it was back then


---------89:59----------
on twitch because you couldn't do irl


---------90:00----------
twitch back then but


---------90:03----------
and the viewers and everyone really


---------90:04----------
loved it i really liked it because you


---------90:06----------
know


---------90:06----------
it's [ __ ] crazy because


---------90:10----------
i was so isolated and sheltered growing


---------90:12----------
up


---------90:13----------
and then streamed for you know the first


---------90:16----------
few months


---------90:17----------
runescape and i started to like get out


---------90:18----------
of my shell a little bit


---------90:20----------
and i started to you know express my


---------90:24----------
my you know my class clown humor on


---------90:26----------
stream


---------90:27----------
and it really felt like it just was


---------90:30----------
right it felt like


---------90:31----------
it all led up to this and then when irl


---------90:35----------
or like pokemon go came out i really


---------90:38----------
enjoyed like


---------90:40----------
like i would never talk to i would have


---------90:42----------
never been


---------90:43----------
able to talk to people without the


---------90:45----------
stream


---------90:46----------
giving me that validation and i think


---------90:49----------
that really helped me


---------90:50----------
i when pokemon go came out the first day


---------90:53----------
i streamed it


---------90:54----------
i had people in my chat you know giving


---------90:57----------
me


---------90:57----------
good validation every time i would talk


---------91:00----------
to someone


---------91:01----------
and it made me feel comfortable with


---------91:03----------
talking to people for like the first


---------91:04----------
time ever


---------91:06----------
can you tell me what what you mean by


---------91:08----------
validation and


---------91:09----------
what they said that made you feel


---------91:11----------
comfortable well


---------91:13----------
you know usually i would be awkward


---------91:16----------
you know with how i talk to people


---------91:18----------
growing up and


---------91:19----------
you know i could just tell that when i


---------91:21----------
talk to people the conversations are


---------91:23----------
kind of like weird and don't go anywhere


---------91:24----------
or


---------91:25----------
they're judging me a little bit maybe


---------91:27----------
but when i would stream


---------91:29----------
and you know i would talk to people


---------91:30----------
doing irl


---------91:32----------
my chat would just give me they'd just


---------91:35----------
be like oh that was funny


---------91:37----------
you're you know hilarious you're you


---------91:39----------
know that was good


---------91:40----------
you know and i wasn't even trying to


---------91:42----------
really be funny i was just talking to


---------91:43----------
people


---------91:44----------
but i guess my quirky my quirkiness just


---------91:47----------
kind of like translated well to the


---------91:49----------
stream so


---------91:51----------
um you know made me feel good so even if


---------91:53----------
the interaction i just had was kind of


---------91:54----------
awkward


---------91:56----------
the stream made me feel good and i just


---------91:58----------
you know was able to do it more and more


---------92:00----------
until i got more comfortable with


---------92:02----------
actually talking to people and then i


---------92:04----------
you know but and you know that i learned


---------92:06----------
how to actually have


---------92:07----------
decent conversations because of the


---------92:09----------
streams validation


---------92:11----------
helping me push myself right the very


---------92:13----------
first ira stream i did


---------92:15----------
dude i was so nervous i knew i wanted to


---------92:17----------
do it because i'm like all right this is


---------92:18----------
going to get


---------92:19----------
a lot of viewers and it's going to be


---------92:20----------
super hype because it's a new category


---------92:22----------
and i think it'll be fun and um


---------92:27----------
yeah i just my heart was being so fast i


---------92:29----------
was so nervous because i never really


---------92:31----------
talked to people


---------92:32----------
and then all of a sudden that went so


---------92:34----------
well the first stream like i was so


---------92:36----------
happy dude that i was


---------92:37----------
able to talk to people and not feel


---------92:39----------
judged like i didn't really care if the


---------92:41----------
people in real life were judging me


---------92:42----------
i only cared about the stream


---------92:46----------
like judging me because that was


---------92:49----------
what i was going out for anyways right


---------92:51----------
so


---------92:53----------
it was very uh exciting for me when i


---------92:56----------
first did that irl stream


---------92:58----------
because i had never done like anything


---------93:00----------
like that before


---------93:01----------
like talking to people and so


---------93:05----------
sounds great what where's the


---------93:09----------
uh it sounds like things went downhill


---------93:11----------
at some point


---------93:12----------
yeah i mean obviously obviously


---------93:16----------
that so those feel good feelings you


---------93:18----------
know whatever


---------93:19----------
so i started doing irl like every day


---------93:22----------
and i started to uh you know and it was


---------93:25----------
going well and it was going well for


---------93:27----------
for for you know a little bit and um


---------93:32----------
before i get to the other parts let me


---------93:34----------
just say


---------93:36----------
there was this one stream i did on


---------93:38----------
twitch that didn't go so like there


---------93:39----------
wasn't it wasn't that in like i went i


---------93:41----------
think i tried gaming


---------93:42----------
so i just did iron off like a week


---------93:43----------
straight and then i went back to gaming


---------93:45----------
and then the viewers didn't like it so i


---------93:47----------
started crying on stream


---------93:48----------
and got very emotional because all i was


---------93:51----------
trying to do was


---------93:52----------
just be accepted by my chat which


---------93:54----------
there's a video of that stream but it's


---------93:56----------
it's it was just like a two-minute


---------93:58----------
stream of me just


---------93:59----------
crying and saying you know how i felt


---------94:02----------
and i


---------94:02----------
you know people gave me good feedback


---------94:05----------
with


---------94:05----------
and you know hearts and stuff and i felt


---------94:07----------
good and i felt comfortable with


---------94:09----------
expressing myself actually in you know


---------94:12----------
at that moment or like afterward or


---------94:14----------
whatever in that moment i i


---------94:16----------
wasn't comfortable but i did it i wasn't


---------94:17----------
reading chat but afterward when i read


---------94:18----------
the chat i felt more comfortable and i


---------94:20----------
felt much better


---------94:21----------
um which and i bring that up now because


---------94:24----------
later on i will tell you why


---------94:26----------
i decided to stop opening myself up to


---------94:28----------
my stream


---------94:30----------
um so yeah but then so let's


---------94:33----------
so you know a couple months go by it's


---------94:35----------
going well irl


---------94:37----------
stuff gaming stuff whatever um you know


---------94:40----------
then i got banned on twitch


---------94:41----------
i got uh swatted on an airplane i'm not


---------94:44----------
sure if you're familiar with what


---------94:46----------
happened


---------94:48----------
so i was uh you know i did a stream at


---------94:50----------
an airport


---------94:51----------
uh waiting for a plane to go to


---------94:53----------
dreamhack and um


---------94:56----------
you know and i was very uh what's the


---------94:58----------
word like um


---------95:00----------
irresponsible with my camera pointing


---------95:04----------
and i was just cause back in early 2017


---------95:09----------
getting swatted and like having viewers


---------95:12----------
know where you are wasn't really like an


---------95:15----------
issue it was like ira was so new


---------95:19----------
it was not it wasn't really an issue and


---------95:21----------
i had only ever been swatted


---------95:23----------
one time before that


---------95:26----------
like way but like way before the plane


---------95:28----------
thing it was at my house


---------95:29----------
and you know i mean okay whatever that


---------95:32----------
it wasn't like a normal thing


---------95:33----------
so when i streamed at the airport and i


---------95:35----------
streamed at airports multiple times as


---------95:37----------
well


---------95:37----------
i didn't think it was an issue but you


---------95:40----------
know obviously when i ended the stream


---------95:42----------
some viewer uh called the police and


---------95:45----------
said


---------95:45----------
i had a bomb or whatever and you know i


---------95:48----------
got swatted


---------95:49----------
uh on the airplane when it landed uh


---------95:51----------
like the cops came in and they like


---------95:53----------
questioned me and stuff


---------95:54----------
and you know obviously went on the news


---------95:57----------
and


---------95:58----------
got banned on twitch which wait why


---------96:00----------
would you get banned on twitch if


---------96:01----------
someone's


---------96:02----------
swatted i'm confused well i had been


---------96:05----------
banned a few times before so i got


---------96:06----------
banned four times on twitch


---------96:08----------
for uh because for you know because i


---------96:11----------
had tts on right on my streams


---------96:13----------
and sometimes by text-to-speech


---------96:16----------
so i got banned four times for texas


---------96:19----------
speech because you know


---------96:21----------
they people get around filters and you


---------96:23----------
know offensive things would come through


---------96:25----------
and i wouldn't skip it in time so i got


---------96:27----------
banned four times for that


---------96:28----------
and then i got banned for accidentally


---------96:30----------
leaking someone's phone number


---------96:32----------
like uh i asked for someone like i asked


---------96:34----------
for a girl's phone number i forgot to


---------96:35----------
leak the


---------96:36----------
[ __ ] microphone so i got banned for


---------96:38----------
that so


---------96:39----------
i got banned for getting spotted on the


---------96:41----------
plane because obviously i had already a


---------96:43----------
history i had like five bands before


---------96:45----------
that


---------96:45----------
and i think twitch you know saw it as


---------96:47----------
bad pr


---------96:49----------
they saw my chat was a little i mean my


---------96:52----------
i'm not going to


---------96:53----------
cookie cutter it my chat was pretty


---------96:55----------
[ __ ] like


---------96:56----------
ridiculous you know what i mean like


---------96:58----------
they were spammy as hell they could be


---------97:01----------
toxic they could be like


---------97:02----------
you know pretty [ __ ] bad so


---------97:05----------
i think twitch just was like just you


---------97:08----------
know they just banned me


---------97:09----------
because i uh and i will say i was pretty


---------97:11----------
irresponsible with the


---------97:13----------
way i was streaming i was like showing


---------97:16----------
what flight i was going on and stuff


---------97:19----------
with you know in hindsight it's easy to


---------97:20----------
say oh that was stupid but in the moment


---------97:22----------
like i said getting slotted wasn't


---------97:24----------
really a normal thing


---------97:25----------
so i didn't even think that was gonna


---------97:27----------
happen so yeah i got banned for


---------97:30----------
obviously uh i'm gonna assume


---------97:33----------
i don't really i don't really know


---------97:36----------
but i think it's because i was being


---------97:38----------
irresponsible with


---------97:40----------
showing where i was and stuff so let me


---------97:42----------
ask you a quick question


---------97:44----------
paul what's your understanding i mean so


---------97:46----------
you were saying that your community it


---------97:47----------
seems like you know they were


---------97:50----------
trolls yeah you know um


---------97:53----------
what's your understanding of of how your


---------97:56----------
community got to be that way


---------98:01----------
i uh i didn't moderate my chat i mean


---------98:03----------
that's as simple as that you know i


---------98:06----------
enjoyed the validation that my viewers


---------98:08----------
are giving me


---------98:10----------
you know i've never had anything like


---------98:11----------
this before so i was very afraid to lose


---------98:13----------
it


---------98:14----------
so i and what kinds of things would they


---------98:16----------
validate


---------98:19----------
um i mean you know if i was funny on


---------98:21----------
stream


---------98:23----------
if i was uh you know just saying jokes


---------98:26----------
and


---------98:27----------
you know obviously i would say offensive


---------98:29----------
jokes too


---------98:30----------
uh back when i was in my early twenties


---------98:33----------
offensive humor and like shock humor was


---------98:36----------
like


---------98:37----------
uh i don't know i found it funny i mean


---------98:40----------
you know i'm


---------98:41----------
i've heard now obviously but i'm not


---------98:43----------
gonna like


---------98:44----------
lie i found it funny so i would do it


---------98:46----------
you know and i'd say shocking things and


---------98:48----------
offensive things


---------98:50----------
um and the chat found it funny and you


---------98:52----------
know and


---------98:53----------
so it's kind of like the class clown


---------98:55----------
humor right you say


---------98:56----------
something in class that's like kind of


---------98:58----------
shocking the teacher would get mad


---------99:00----------
i mean it kind of just carried over i


---------99:02----------
guess but


---------99:04----------
but the viewers yeah they validated it


---------99:05----------
and then they they enjoyed it so


---------99:08----------
you know i was so afraid to lose anybody


---------99:11----------
i didn't want to lose a single viewer


---------99:13----------
because i just felt so good that i


---------99:16----------
finally had people that liked me


---------99:18----------
so i didn't ban or moderate anything


---------99:22----------
which is a mistake how do you understand


---------99:25----------
why you felt so


---------99:26----------
good why were you so afraid to lose a


---------99:28----------
single viewer


---------99:32----------
how do i explain why i felt so good yeah


---------99:34----------
like well like help me understand why


---------99:36----------
you were afraid to ban a single viewer


---------99:39----------
i just didn't i was just afraid of like


---------99:41----------
people not liking me anymore and


---------99:43----------
just going away and then i'd be alone


---------99:45----------
again i really didn't like being alone


---------99:48----------
and i really like for the first time saw


---------99:50----------
what it's like to be liked


---------99:52----------
and not be alone and you know


---------99:55----------
i just wanted to cherish that because it


---------99:58----------
was very


---------99:59----------
valuable to me and i i was you know a


---------100:02----------
dude i was 21


---------100:04----------
22 when i first i was 21 no i was 20


---------100:07----------
when i first started streaming


---------100:08----------
21 when i really blew up so i was young


---------100:12----------
and just


---------100:12----------
no life experience or anything i just


---------100:15----------
didn't know that


---------100:18----------
you know surrounding myself with


---------100:22----------
uh bad validation was even a thing


---------100:26----------
what do you mean by bad validation


---------100:30----------
i just you know i mean so you there's


---------100:32----------
there's


---------100:35----------
i mean how do i explain it there's


---------100:40----------
okay so you have if i have a viewer in


---------100:42----------
the chat who's uh


---------100:43----------
saying stupid things that uh


---------100:47----------
like saying uh making fun of me or


---------100:49----------
something or laughing when i do


---------100:51----------
something stupid


---------100:52----------
laughing at me more than with me that's


---------100:55----------
like bad validation


---------100:56----------
because he's still in my chat and he's


---------100:59----------
still laughing but he's not laughing for


---------101:00----------
the good


---------101:01----------
for good reasons and i couldn't really


---------101:04----------
differentiate the difference there


---------101:05----------
between


---------101:07----------
good and bad validation so i just kept


---------101:10----------
everyone because i didn't want to lose


---------101:11----------
anyone because i thought they


---------101:12----------
cared about me i thought they were there


---------101:13----------
for me


---------101:16----------
but um so i you know i was just very


---------101:19----------
afraid to moderate anything


---------101:21----------
so i'm kind of hearing a couple things


---------101:23----------
can i


---------101:24----------
just repeat back to you and just make


---------101:25----------
sure i'm on the same page so


---------101:28----------
you know we heard a lot about your early


---------101:30----------
life um


---------101:31----------
excuse me one second


---------101:36----------
so we heard a lot about your early life


---------101:37----------
and and uh


---------101:41----------
you know it sounds like you were not


---------101:43----------
very well understood


---------101:44----------
sounds like you were pretty alone in a


---------101:47----------
lot of ways


---------101:48----------
and then here comes twitch to the rescue


---------101:52----------
which it does so many times and and so


---------101:55----------
you know there's there's a sense of


---------101:56----------
community there's a sense of connection


---------101:59----------
you get to be the class clown again and


---------102:01----------
then like twitch loves that


---------102:02----------
right like we love class clowns and so i


---------102:05----------
i'm getting the sense that you started


---------102:06----------
to cultivate


---------102:08----------
a particularly you know risk like kind


---------102:11----------
of risque


---------102:12----------
attitude telling kind of offensive jokes


---------102:15----------
which you thought were funny like


---------102:16----------
people liked you because you know you


---------102:18----------
were the guy who


---------102:20----------
wouldn't be so pc started to cultivate a


---------102:23----------
particular kind of community that would


---------102:26----------
repeatedly say inappropriate things in


---------102:28----------
text-to-speech


---------102:30----------
maybe you weren't so keen on moderating


---------102:32----------
them because you really


---------102:33----------
found that like it's it's almost like


---------102:35----------
you you become kind of


---------102:37----------
i use this word a little bit carefully


---------102:40----------
but almost dependent on the validation


---------102:42----------
i mean i was hearing you kind of say


---------102:43----------
that you know you would do things that


---------102:45----------
or that their validation would allow you


---------102:47----------
to do things that


---------102:48----------
that paul couldn't do and ice poseidon


---------102:52----------
became someone different from paul


---------102:54----------
paul had trouble talking to people but


---------102:55----------
like ice poseidon was like


---------102:58----------
totally cool to talk to people like had


---------103:00----------
friends like


---------103:02----------
is that fair or or is that kinda


---------103:06----------
i mean i don't wanna i don't think it's


---------103:08----------
fair to take the blame off of me


---------103:11----------
and put it onto my persona but


---------103:15----------
yes you're right but i just want to make


---------103:18----------
sure you


---------103:18----------
like i just want you to know that i'm


---------103:20----------
that doesn't take the blame away from me


---------103:22----------
personally does is what i said


---------103:26----------
does that assign the blame somewhere


---------103:28----------
well


---------103:29----------
i mean no i don't think so but


---------103:32----------
i'm just uh so


---------103:36----------
used to


---------103:39----------
i'm just so used to getting judged man


---------103:41----------
about


---------103:42----------
like uh how i how i'm supposed to feel


---------103:45----------
and [ __ ]


---------103:46----------
i just feel like i have to just say that


---------103:47----------
i don't know okay


---------103:51----------
what would happen if you didn't say that


---------103:56----------
i just feel like people would


---------104:01----------
say that i'm just you know deflecting uh


---------104:06----------
my responsibilities or something i don't


---------104:09----------
know i don't


---------104:10----------
think so but i just thought i would say


---------104:13----------
that to see how


---------104:14----------
what what your reaction would be i


---------104:16----------
suppose i mean so here's what i have


---------104:19----------
paul if we're going to talk about blame


---------104:21----------
i think you and twitch


---------104:22----------
so this is this i mean you know there's


---------104:23----------
a part of me that loves it too but i


---------104:25----------
think a lot of times there are marriages


---------104:26----------
made in hell


---------104:28----------
and and that's what this sounds like to


---------104:30----------
me it sounds like you were the class


---------104:32----------
clown


---------104:32----------
you were also a champion of sorts and


---------104:35----------
they loved you for it and you loved to


---------104:37----------
be loved for it


---------104:39----------
and i i'm kind of hearing you know you


---------104:41----------
didn't moderate things but at the same


---------104:43----------
time you're not the one that was


---------104:44----------
you know making the text-to-speech


---------104:46----------
donations i think you just cultivated a


---------104:48----------
particular kind of culture


---------104:50----------
and everyone was sort of happy with that


---------104:52----------
what do you think about that


---------104:55----------
yeah i mean yeah my humor was edgy and


---------104:58----------
uh


---------104:58----------
my chat you know therefore got edgy and


---------105:01----------
yeah i mean that was uh


---------105:03----------
yeah essentially yes yeah i mean do you


---------105:06----------
feel blamed enough by what i said


---------105:09----------
is that fair in terms of judgment yeah


---------105:12----------
that's that's fair


---------105:15----------
i mean i i think this really sounds to


---------105:16----------
me like a situation where


---------105:18----------
you know there was a lot of like


---------105:19----------
cultivation or evolution


---------105:21----------
of something it started in one place and


---------105:24----------
then it got like a little bit worse and


---------105:25----------
a little bit worse and a little bit


---------105:26----------
worse and a little bit worse


---------105:28----------
i never you know i never i never wanted


---------105:30----------
it to be like


---------105:31----------
i never wanted to make a [ __ ] edgy


---------105:34----------
sort of like


---------105:35----------
thing but uh just you know obviously i


---------105:38----------
just didn't know what the [ __ ] up do my


---------105:40----------
i didn't know what i was doing my


---------105:41----------
channel i went from


---------105:43----------
400 viewers i'll say it i went from


---------105:46----------
100 viewers to 20 000 in like


---------105:50----------
two months or like i mean overnight


---------105:53----------
essentially dude


---------105:54----------
i mean it was literally overnight and i


---------105:56----------
had no guidance


---------105:58----------
it was just i'm just by myself


---------106:01----------
and i had to just figure everything else


---------106:03----------
everything out on my own


---------106:05----------
and i'm just like this sheltered kid so


---------106:07----------
it was tough dude


---------106:09----------
it was not easy and i just you know fell


---------106:12----------
into the wrong


---------106:13----------
sort of environment yeah i i've noticed


---------106:17----------
paul that um when people blow up it's


---------106:19----------
psychologically


---------106:20----------
very difficult and and you know


---------106:24----------
there's a lot of good that comes with it


---------106:25----------
but also like a lot of


---------106:28----------
danger that comes with blowing up um


---------106:31----------
so i've heard that story again a lot of


---------106:33----------
times it manifests as imposter syndrome


---------106:35----------
to where people like i don't understand


---------106:37----------
why


---------106:38----------
you know these 1900 19 900 people like


---------106:41----------
where they came from


---------106:43----------
because i was used to that original 100


---------106:46----------
um but anyway so it sounds like you got


---------106:49----------
banned for


---------106:50----------
to twitch i got banned for twitch for


---------106:52----------
you know


---------106:53----------
having this like cultivating like just a


---------106:55----------
bad community i'm quite sure


---------106:56----------
um the plane thing was just like icing


---------106:58----------
on the cake


---------107:00----------
um so and then i went over to youtube


---------107:03----------
um i know i was very upset


---------107:06----------
when this happened obviously because


---------107:10----------
i didn't know what the [ __ ] to do bro i


---------107:12----------
was so scared


---------107:14----------
of being alone again and going back to


---------107:18----------
being this just sheltered misunderstood


---------107:20----------
person


---------107:22----------
so i you know i i made a video and i


---------107:25----------
said i'm gonna be streaming on youtube


---------107:27----------
um criticized twitch and and and how


---------107:31----------
they banned me


---------107:32----------
which now looking at it i get where they


---------107:35----------
were coming from so i


---------107:36----------
you know i took that video down because


---------107:38----------
that's not fair


---------107:39----------
criticism in my opinion that i had on


---------107:42----------
them


---------107:43----------
but um started streaming on youtube


---------107:46----------
and you know i said this one thing that


---------107:49----------
was very


---------107:51----------
um like just the worst mistake of my


---------107:54----------
life


---------107:55----------
honestly because if you think it's bad


---------107:57----------
it hasn't even bro


---------107:58----------
youtube my youtube career that's when


---------108:00----------
streaming got


---------108:02----------
ridiculous like in terms of uh how


---------108:06----------
bad it really got um i said this one


---------108:09----------
thing and it really just it


---------108:11----------
i should have never said it i literally


---------108:12----------
said um


---------108:15----------
all right i want you guys to control my


---------108:17----------
life i said that to my viewers and that


---------108:20----------
was the worst [ __ ] mistake of my life


---------108:21----------
dude


---------108:22----------
because that that's not good that


---------108:25----------
because i realize now


---------108:26----------
viewers don't have your best intention


---------108:28----------
and you know you're just


---------108:30----------
entertainment and or like a very un


---------108:34----------
or like a parasocial relationship to a


---------108:36----------
lot of viewers


---------108:37----------
in like some unhealthy way and i learned


---------108:39----------
that i learned all that [ __ ] the hard


---------108:41----------
way man


---------108:42----------
so i had this reddit that had you know


---------108:44----------
those very popular


---------108:45----------
and had you know 100 000 members on it


---------108:49----------
and that reddit was who i was talking to


---------108:51----------
the


---------108:52----------
my reddit would control my life


---------108:54----------
essentially


---------108:55----------
is what i told them and if anything that


---------108:57----------
gets upvoted to the top


---------108:59----------
i would do and you know they


---------109:02----------
that's it you know i was so afraid of


---------109:04----------
losing


---------109:05----------
these people that i just gave them full


---------109:07----------
power so they wouldn't go anywhere


---------109:10----------
and uh yeah so then


---------109:14----------
the next year or so i mean it just it


---------109:16----------
got it just got real bad


---------109:18----------
um the viewers were very uh


---------109:22----------
you know even now i have a hard time


---------109:24----------
talking about this because


---------109:26----------
it's it's i just feel like a lot of


---------109:30----------
uh like it's hard to know


---------109:33----------
if i like if what i'm saying is even


---------109:36----------
accurate or not


---------109:36----------
not accurate and what happened but


---------109:39----------
accurate in how i feel


---------109:40----------
like i feel like now in hindsight that i


---------109:42----------
was being gaslighted


---------109:44----------
by my reddit and that sounds [ __ ]


---------109:46----------
insane


---------109:48----------
but i think i was because they would


---------109:52----------
upvote something


---------109:53----------
i would do it and then they would tell


---------109:56----------
me they would upload another post saying


---------109:57----------
i'm a


---------109:58----------
[ __ ] [ __ ] for doing that and that


---------110:00----------
i should apologize


---------110:01----------
to them and then i would apologize


---------110:05----------
and like cry on stream and say i'm sorry


---------110:08----------
and then it'd be like not good enough


---------110:12----------
does that make sense like it just got it


---------110:15----------
got very bad bro where like the viewers


---------110:17----------
some a lot of the viewers got very


---------110:19----------
entitled and they started and i just


---------110:21----------
only did i did my best


---------110:23----------
to just try and make everyone happy


---------110:27----------
but i think a lot of viewers took


---------110:29----------
advantage of that and it made me feel


---------110:31----------
really bad


---------110:32----------
and it really [ __ ] in my head for a


---------110:34----------
long time


---------110:35----------
and that was a huge mistake i should


---------110:37----------
have never given


---------110:39----------
you know my viewers such power over me


---------110:44----------
what what made what were what were you


---------110:48----------
do you remember what you were thinking


---------110:49----------
and feeling when you sort of put that


---------110:51----------
offer out there that they get to control


---------110:53----------
your life


---------110:54----------
i was just scared that was the first


---------110:56----------
stream on youtube that i did


---------110:58----------
i was just scared i didn't want to lose


---------111:01----------
you know


---------111:01----------
this this like magical gift that i was


---------111:05----------
given


---------111:07----------
because it i i dude i was alone my


---------111:09----------
entire life


---------111:11----------
and this was like something


---------111:14----------
that's like a dream come true you know


---------111:16----------
like people like me


---------111:19----------
people like want to see me like i've


---------111:21----------
never had that before


---------111:23----------
so i just was so worried about it that i


---------111:26----------
was just like i'm just gonna give them


---------111:27----------
everything i'm gonna give them my


---------111:29----------
literally the key to my heart everything


---------111:34----------
you know and that was that was bad


---------111:37----------
and and so the reason you were giving


---------111:39----------
them everything is because


---------111:40----------
you had you were living a life that you


---------111:43----------
know


---------111:44----------
i'm just trying to understand for a


---------111:46----------
second you know it's it's like when


---------111:49----------
i i can envision that when you were


---------111:51----------
growing up there was like your life and


---------111:53----------
there were like normal lives


---------111:55----------
right like people had friends and people


---------111:57----------
were liked and people were appreciated


---------111:59----------
and then there was paul


---------112:01----------
who is in the special school and and you


---------112:03----------
know taken to doctors and put on zoloft


---------112:05----------
and put on adhd medicine


---------112:08----------
there's the paul that we were kind of


---------112:09----------
saying like what do we do with you


---------112:12----------
and then suddenly like twitch and


---------112:15----------
youtube you were kind of


---------112:16----------
you did this for a while on twitch and


---------112:18----------
then you were afraid of losing everyone


---------112:20----------
and so you kind of gave them power over


---------112:23----------
your life


---------112:24----------
anything to not have them leave is that


---------112:27----------
fair to say


---------112:29----------
yeah because when i mean when i got


---------112:31----------
banned on twitch


---------112:32----------
no youtube live streaming wasn't a thing


---------112:35----------
really


---------112:35----------
like i was i don't even know who else is


---------112:39----------
streaming on youtube i think


---------112:40----------
yeah i have no idea i think i remember


---------112:43----------
like just nobody was streaming on


---------112:44----------
everyone who ever whoever got banned on


---------112:46----------
twitch their career was done


---------112:48----------
for streaming so


---------112:51----------
i was so scared of yeah of being like


---------112:54----------
just back to being alone so yeah i did


---------112:57----------
like i went


---------112:58----------
to the extremes on youtube so i could


---------113:01----------
keep these people


---------113:02----------
and so they don't leave and go back to


---------113:04----------
twitch and like leave


---------113:05----------
and you know whatever i'm alone so yeah


---------113:08----------
i gave them


---------113:09----------
full power and so when they would post


---------113:12----------
something on reddit how would you feel


---------113:15----------
like what would they ask you to do


---------113:20----------
i mean it would just be like content


---------113:21----------
ideas and stuff but um


---------113:24----------
and i would feel fine for i mean for


---------113:26----------
that obviously


---------113:27----------
um but when they would uh


---------113:31----------
when the reddit would upvote stuff


---------113:34----------
that would make me feel bad


---------113:38----------
when it when i didn't do anything that


---------113:41----------
like


---------113:42----------
but there was this one such i mean i'm


---------113:44----------
not bringing i'm not gonna say names but


---------113:46----------
there was this one situation


---------113:47----------
with two girls and one


---------113:51----------
of them i went on a date for the stream


---------113:54----------
i didn't really want to date them i just


---------113:56----------
went on a date with them for the stream


---------113:58----------
for content


---------113:59----------
because my reddit upvoted it


---------114:03----------
and said i should do that but i didn't


---------114:05----------
really want to


---------114:07----------
and i actually had this other girl that


---------114:10----------
i was friends with


---------114:12----------
that i liked and wanted to actually you


---------114:15----------
know


---------114:16----------
pursue her instead but


---------114:22----------
you know and and i went on so i did the


---------114:24----------
date with the with the stream girl


---------114:27----------
and the viewers found you know found out


---------114:30----------
that i


---------114:31----------
actually was pursuing this other girl


---------114:34----------
you know because uh like off stream


---------114:36----------
because


---------114:37----------
you know and and but and they


---------114:40----------
they they were so upset by it they


---------114:43----------
didn't you know


---------114:44----------
to me the stream did the date on stream


---------114:47----------
was just content to me


---------114:49----------
but to the viewers it was


---------114:54----------
like they're watching me actually date


---------114:57----------
someone


---------114:58----------
and they were upset and they they they


---------115:00----------
were like


---------115:01----------
oh he's gonna be he's like cheating on


---------115:04----------
her he's like he's such a piece of [ __ ]


---------115:06----------
he's [ __ ] this and that and i'm just


---------115:08----------
like oh [ __ ]


---------115:10----------
and because i said i gave i you know the


---------115:11----------
viewers control my life


---------115:13----------
so i ended up going live that night like


---------115:16----------
crying and i was just like i'm so sorry


---------115:20----------
i you know i didn't mean to do this i


---------115:22----------
please forgive me


---------115:23----------
and i ended up putting myself in a


---------115:26----------
situation where i


---------115:28----------
temporarily tried to date this


---------115:31----------
stream girl that i didn't even like


---------115:34----------
for the viewers you know because they


---------115:38----------
told me to


---------115:39----------
and that was a very uh awkward situation


---------115:43----------
to be in and um i'm just


---------115:48----------
it's just kind of i'm just trying to


---------115:50----------
like put it all together so i'm like


---------115:51----------
stuttering a little bit but


---------115:55----------
well yeah paul i'm i'm so


---------116:00----------
this may sound like a silly question but


---------116:02----------
you know


---------116:03----------
why did you have to do that


---------116:07----------
i i don't know i just felt like they


---------116:09----------
were gonna


---------116:10----------
leave and i was gonna be alone again so


---------116:12----------
i put my so i did that


---------116:14----------
you know i i told my viewers that they


---------116:17----------
would control my life


---------116:18----------
so i that's what it is that's what


---------116:20----------
happened and that was the worst mistake


---------116:21----------
ever


---------116:22----------
because if i ever wanted to do anything


---------116:24----------
that i wanted to do i couldn't


---------116:26----------
and if i ever tried they would


---------116:29----------
you know [ __ ] on me in my chat on reddit


---------116:32----------
they would make me feel


---------116:33----------
so bad they would they would you know


---------116:36----------
they would just


---------116:37----------
make me you know say i'm a scumbag and


---------116:40----------
all this [ __ ]


---------116:40----------
and to them it's memes but to me you


---------116:42----------
know these are my feelings my feelings


---------116:44----------
aren't memes


---------116:45----------
i couldn't say that though i could never


---------116:47----------
express myself


---------116:48----------
to my viewers and i'll tell you why


---------116:51----------
when i went live apologizing for you


---------116:54----------
know pursuing the wrong


---------116:56----------
girl that the stream didn't tell me to


---------116:59----------
um they were just they just


---------117:03----------
they just used it against me they used


---------117:04----------
my the feelings against me and they


---------117:06----------
would


---------117:07----------
repost the picture of me crying over and


---------117:09----------
over and over


---------117:10----------
with like captions that they thought


---------117:13----------
were funny and


---------117:14----------
but to me it like really hurt me and it


---------117:16----------
really like upset me


---------117:18----------
and it really and and unfortunately i


---------117:20----------
didn't know how to deal


---------117:21----------
with these with this situation and these


---------117:24----------
emotions


---------117:25----------
so i just totally started throwing


---------117:27----------
everyone under the bus


---------117:29----------
like you know the girls that i was


---------117:31----------
pursuing um


---------117:32----------
the girls pursuing uh and then the girl


---------117:35----------
that i was i


---------117:36----------
stated on stream i just


---------117:39----------
literally tried throwing them under the


---------117:42----------
bus


---------117:44----------
so i was pursuing this girl that i liked


---------117:47----------
right


---------117:47----------
and since the stream didn't want me to


---------117:51----------
i went live and apologized for pursuing


---------117:53----------
her


---------117:54----------
which was bad because obviously it would


---------117:56----------
make her feel bad too


---------117:59----------
and it would make my viewers lash out at


---------118:01----------
her


---------118:02----------
so that was the wrong move on my behalf


---------118:05----------
i should have taken


---------118:06----------
responsibility and just been like no i


---------118:08----------
like this other person


---------118:11----------
and i you know i shouldn't have played


---------118:13----------
pretend with my stream


---------118:15----------
but at like i said they i gave them


---------118:17----------
control


---------118:18----------
of my life and i would do everything so


---------118:21----------
yeah so that's how that situation went


---------118:23----------
so i after i was like all right crying


---------118:26----------
on stream


---------118:26----------
letting out my emotions to my viewers


---------118:28----------
bad move they're gonna just use it


---------118:30----------
against me


---------118:32----------
and you know post photos and and


---------118:34----------
whatever


---------118:35----------
and make me feel bad so i stopped doing


---------118:37----------
that that's why i keep saying


---------118:38----------
i don't like to express myself with the


---------118:41----------
like on streams typically because


---------118:43----------
even now it's like kind of hard for me


---------118:44----------
to say this because i have so so


---------118:46----------
engraved in my head that


---------118:48----------
somebody's gonna use it against me that


---------118:51----------
is it's


---------118:51----------
it's hard you know i mean i think you've


---------118:54----------
learned that lesson


---------118:58----------
yeah i mean i i have but uh


---------119:02----------
so it didn't end i


---------119:05----------
i i also let viewers come to stream


---------119:08----------
snipe me in real life


---------119:09----------
you know what stream sniping means yeah


---------119:12----------
i thought that was but when you're


---------119:13----------
competing in a game right and they're


---------119:14----------
watching your stuff


---------119:16----------
but this it also goes to real life as


---------119:18----------
well so i'm doing a


---------119:19----------
irl stream and they would you know


---------119:21----------
viewer would come up to me in person and


---------119:23----------
you know say hi to me and that's fine


---------119:25----------
i've enjoyed that i enjoy meeting the


---------119:27----------
viewers


---------119:28----------
saying hi to them that's great what i


---------119:31----------
didn't enjoy


---------119:32----------
was viewers coming to my house and


---------119:34----------
spying on me through my window


---------119:36----------
and recording my conversations in


---------119:38----------
private and posting them on reddit and


---------119:40----------
things like that


---------119:41----------
but i couldn't say that because if i


---------119:43----------
ever tried to say oh i don't i don't


---------119:45----------
like


---------119:45----------
you doing this don't do it of course my


---------119:48----------
viewers would be upset that i'm defying


---------119:50----------
them


---------119:52----------
so you know i would never say anything


---------119:54----------
like that but yeah my boundaries


---------119:57----------
there was no boundary viewers would i


---------120:00----------
would leave my door unlocked


---------120:01----------
and i would let viewers walk in my house


---------120:03----------
as i'm sleeping and i'd wake up and


---------120:05----------
there'd be seven people sitting on my


---------120:06----------
couch


---------120:07----------
that i have no idea who they are and


---------120:08----------
then they'd [ __ ] cheer and be like


---------120:10----------
yeah


---------120:10----------
he's awake and you know i mean it would


---------120:13----------
kind of


---------120:14----------
make me feel a little uh


---------120:17----------
weird obviously i'd be like i don't know


---------120:20----------
if i like this


---------120:21----------
but i just i just rolled with it you


---------120:23----------
know wow


---------120:25----------
why wouldn't you lock your door


---------120:30----------
oh no i just was so i i when i


---------120:33----------
when i said that i was gonna let the


---------120:35----------
viewers control my life i meant it dude


---------120:37----------
i don't want you i don't want you to


---------120:40----------
underestimate how much


---------120:42----------
fear i had inside of me when i got


---------120:45----------
banned bro


---------120:46----------
and i wanted to not lose


---------120:50----------
anything and be alone again


---------120:54----------
so i went to the absolute extreme to


---------120:57----------
make sure


---------120:58----------
i stood out enough that viewers weren't


---------121:00----------
going to leave me


---------121:05----------
so it's interesting paul because usually


---------121:07----------
when i think about


---------121:09----------
you know really extreme circumstances a


---------121:12----------
lot of people will talk about


---------121:13----------
negative emotions like i did it because


---------121:16----------
i was afraid


---------121:18----------
um but sometimes there's actually like


---------121:21----------
other reasons


---------121:22----------
right there can actually be like


---------121:23----------
positive things so like when i think


---------121:25----------
about


---------121:26----------
for example people who stay in abusive


---------121:28----------
relationships


---------121:29----------
um which it sounds weird but it sounds


---------121:31----------
like you were in a an abusive


---------121:33----------
relationship with your viewers


---------121:35----------
um i mean because what you're describing


---------121:38----------
stuff


---------121:39----------
like if you weren't if you were using if


---------121:41----------
you replaced the word viewers


---------121:43----------
or reddit with like you know someone's


---------121:46----------
name


---------121:46----------
and you just told the story like it you


---------121:49----------
know


---------121:50----------
like you know what's weird yeah the


---------121:52----------
weird the weird thing is


---------121:54----------
the viewers didn't hate me they liked me


---------121:58----------
yeah so so i i don't think that's weird


---------122:00----------
so this is kind of what i was saying is


---------122:02----------
is that like you know a lot of times


---------122:03----------
when you talk to people in abusive


---------122:04----------
relationships they'll talk about like


---------122:06----------
fear is the reason they stay in the


---------122:07----------
relationship but a lot of times


---------122:10----------
actually the more i've really come to


---------122:12----------
understand abusive relationships like


---------122:14----------
oftentimes actually there's something


---------122:16----------
even more powerful than fear which is


---------122:18----------
some kind of


---------122:19----------
other driver like sometimes love causes


---------122:21----------
people to stay in an abusive


---------122:22----------
relationship


---------122:23----------
like you know the hope that this person


---------122:25----------
will change


---------122:27----------
will cause them to stay in a


---------122:28----------
relationship the fact that they love


---------122:29----------
this person the fact that they built a


---------122:31----------
life with


---------122:32----------
them you know i've seen abusive


---------122:33----------
relationships that will last for 40


---------122:35----------
years


---------122:36----------
and when we really think about why does


---------122:38----------
someone stay in that relationship


---------122:40----------
it's not out of fear i mean sure fear is


---------122:42----------
a big part of it


---------122:43----------
but it can actually i think that things


---------122:45----------
that really get people stuck


---------122:46----------
are oftentimes positive emotions or like


---------122:49----------
you know


---------122:50----------
some kind of positive value do you think


---------122:53----------
you were getting something


---------122:54----------
out of this yeah i mean


---------122:58----------
of course you know i got a lot of


---------123:01----------
viewers


---------123:02----------
you know made money of course i got


---------123:04----------
something out of it


---------123:05----------
i just um went about i just think i


---------123:09----------
i dropped my boundaries way too much


---------123:12----------
because in the end like


---------123:14----------
it's self-destructive you know and then


---------123:16----------
they come there comes a certain point


---------123:17----------
where


---------123:20----------
you can't keep up anymore man like like


---------123:23----------
at a certain point i couldn't keep up


---------123:24----------
with the with what my viewers wanted


---------123:27----------
and then they want


---------123:32----------
i mean okay i mean this is going to be


---------123:34----------
really tough to


---------123:37----------
talk about and i really don't like


---------123:38----------
talking about it because people like to


---------123:40----------
make memes about it but i'll you know


---------123:42----------
i'll talk about it but you don't have to


---------123:43----------
talk about it


---------123:45----------
well i but i will though because that


---------123:46----------
they use


---------123:49----------
i wonder if you're making the same


---------123:51----------
mistake now


---------123:53----------
that you were back then which is like if


---------123:54----------
there's a boundary


---------123:56----------
maybe you should just respect that


---------123:58----------
boundary instead of sacrificing yourself


---------124:00----------
for the sake of answering my question


---------124:01----------
what do you think about that


---------124:03----------
i mean i i'm very curious but like


---------124:05----------
that's my curiosity right because it's


---------124:07----------
like


---------124:09----------
i mean i wouldn't say anything that i'm


---------124:11----------
uncomfortable with


---------124:12----------
i am comfortable with talking to you


---------124:14----------
about this stuff now because


---------124:16----------
it's all of that stuff's in the past i'm


---------124:18----------
talking about this from like a past


---------124:21----------
tense sort of thing okay um


---------124:24----------
like in the past talking about this


---------124:26----------
would would have been like really tough


---------124:28----------
and it's still tough now but i'm not


---------124:29----------
afraid to talk about it anymore before i


---------124:31----------
would have been afraid to talk about it


---------124:33----------
um so let me ask you explicitly before


---------124:35----------
we continue


---------124:36----------
do you feel like talking about this


---------124:37----------
would be lowering your boundary or


---------124:40----------
violating an internal boundary that you


---------124:42----------
want to hold


---------124:43----------
for the sake of the interview or the


---------124:45----------
content or whatever like


---------124:47----------
you know because i don't want to fall


---------124:49----------
into that same pattern


---------124:50----------
no because i'm not gonna like no names


---------124:53----------
or anything like i'm not gonna get


---------124:54----------
100 detail just what i'm comfortable


---------124:57----------
but um so my ex-girlfriend i


---------125:02----------
you know i you know i liked her right


---------125:04----------
and uh


---------125:06----------
the stream didn't like her i don't know


---------125:08----------
if you've ever seen these sort of


---------125:09----------
relationships before


---------125:10----------
but um so for the first


---------125:13----------
uh six months or so of dating


---------125:16----------
this girl um my viewers would just [ __ ]


---------125:20----------
on me


---------125:20----------
constantly for six months non-stop [ __ ]


---------125:23----------
on me [ __ ] on her [ __ ] on


---------125:24----------
anything i did everyone around her


---------125:26----------
because they didn't like her that's not


---------125:28----------
who


---------125:28----------
they wanted me to date that's who i


---------125:31----------
wanted to date but that's not who they


---------125:32----------
wanted me to date


---------125:34----------
so but and this was the first time i've


---------125:36----------
defied i defied my viewers


---------125:37----------
i dated this this girl and i didn't care


---------125:41----------
what the viewer said


---------125:42----------
and that caused my life to be a living


---------125:44----------
[ __ ] hell for


---------125:45----------
six or seven months house


---------125:49----------
what's that how so


---------125:52----------
i mean the viewers would you know i mean


---------125:54----------
they would just


---------125:56----------
yeah like the the chat the dislikes


---------125:59----------
the reddit everything they would just


---------126:01----------
say [ __ ] you ice


---------126:02----------
you're a [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] you're


---------126:04----------
dating this person this person's [ __ ]


---------126:06----------
awful [ __ ] [ __ ] you [ __ ] that like they


---------126:08----------
just didn't like


---------126:09----------
who i was dating so they lashed out at


---------126:11----------
me constantly which made all my streams


---------126:13----------
awful


---------126:14----------
because i'm not going to be able to be


---------126:16----------
happy


---------126:18----------
and positive on stream if i'm getting my


---------126:21----------
whole chat


---------126:21----------
[ __ ] on me and my whole community


---------126:23----------
[ __ ] on me so it'd be a constant


---------126:25----------
battle between me and my community


---------126:27----------
of me defending myself and oh if i want


---------126:30----------
to date this person i can date this


---------126:31----------
person in my chat


---------126:33----------
saying [ __ ] you you can't date this


---------126:34----------
[ __ ] person


---------126:36----------
it was just a bad toxic situation an


---------126:39----------
environment that i was in


---------126:41----------
so instead of and i tried i tried really


---------126:45----------
hard to hold my


---------126:46----------
my own and hold my gut for seven months


---------126:49----------
i just couldn't take it anymore so what


---------126:51----------
i ended up doing was


---------126:52----------
hiding the relationship for my viewers


---------126:55----------
and this is where i got really bad dude


---------126:57----------
because now i'm living a [ __ ] like a


---------127:00----------
second life


---------127:01----------
i have my i'm like my stream life


---------127:05----------
where my viewers think i'm single and


---------127:08----------
then i have my actual life where i'm


---------127:09----------
going


---------127:10----------
and i'm seeing this this girl


---------127:13----------
and i lived in constant fear of getting


---------127:16----------
spotted in public


---------127:17----------
with with her of just whatever you know


---------127:20----------
so it that relationship ended up


---------127:22----------
going really really bad and turning very


---------127:25----------
bad because of


---------127:26----------
because of me you know it's not her


---------127:29----------
fault


---------127:29----------
it's because of me i literally was


---------127:31----------
afraid to leave the house with her


---------127:33----------
so it ended up turning into a very just


---------127:36----------
not a good relationship dude


---------127:38----------
um very uh


---------127:42----------
i started treating her poorly because i


---------127:44----------
was


---------127:45----------
you know just not like poorly as in


---------127:47----------
calling her names and stuff i treated


---------127:48----------
her poorly as in


---------127:49----------
if we're gonna leave the house you have


---------127:50----------
to put a hood on and like a mask and


---------127:52----------
[ __ ] like it's just


---------127:53----------
i was just scared bro and um


---------127:57----------
it just wasn't good and one and then my


---------127:59----------
viewers eventually found out


---------128:02----------
that i was dating her and let me tell


---------128:05----------
you that was just awful


---------128:06----------
it was i mean she got completely


---------128:09----------
harassed i got


---------128:10----------
completely harassed and i made such a


---------128:12----------
dumb [ __ ] mistake


---------128:14----------
of just completely just i mean i like


---------128:16----------
threw under the bus dude i'm like oh i'm


---------128:18----------
not dating her


---------128:19----------
because i didn't know what to do and i


---------128:21----------
was so upset


---------128:23----------
and so like worried about just


---------128:27----------
losing the viewers and being alone again


---------128:31----------
i just you know i just did really really


---------128:34----------
uh made some really bad


---------128:36----------
mistakes i you know and and i lost her


---------128:40----------
uh respect i lost the viewers respect i


---------128:42----------
lost everyone's [ __ ] respect


---------128:44----------
you know the viewers were upset because


---------128:45----------
i was hiding this relationship for like


---------128:47----------
seven months


---------128:49----------
my ex-girlfriend obviously uh


---------128:52----------
you know thought it was [ __ ] [ __ ]


---------128:54----------
and unfair to her which it clearly was


---------128:57----------
and i was uh just yeah


---------129:01----------
just bad bad moves all around


---------129:05----------
and then after that of course it just


---------129:07----------
was never the same my viewers just


---------129:08----------
treated me like [ __ ]


---------129:09----------
and had no respect for me for so long


---------129:13----------
until my read until i closed my reddit


---------129:16----------
what do you think about that


---------129:23----------
i mean i i made a mistake you know i


---------129:25----------
made mistakes i


---------129:26----------
i should have never dropped the boundary


---------129:28----------
boundaries between me and my viewers


---------129:30----------
it was it only led to bad things nothing


---------129:33----------
good came from it


---------129:34----------
because in hindsight i think the viewers


---------129:36----------
would have still watched me


---------129:39----------
with the boundaries i didn't need to


---------129:41----------
drop those boundaries


---------129:42----------
i just did because i was scared like i


---------129:45----------
cultivated


---------129:46----------
this abusive relationship between me and


---------129:48----------
my viewers


---------129:49----------
and i need and that's not what i meant


---------129:51----------
to do i was just trying to grow our bond


---------129:53----------
by doing that i'll be the only streamer


---------129:56----------
to let the viewers come into his house


---------129:58----------
and whatever but


---------130:00----------
the it got toxic because the viewers


---------130:03----------
wanted full control and they they


---------130:07----------
wanted you know and i can't i'm not a


---------130:09----------
robot i live my own life too


---------130:14----------
well i can i can kind of see it's it's


---------130:16----------
really interesting to hear


---------130:17----------
you because


---------130:21----------
you know how you were saying that that


---------130:23----------
we were talking about apology.exe


---------130:26----------
and and how you because you do


---------130:28----------
explicitly own uh


---------130:30----------
up to a lot of this you say you know it


---------130:32----------
was my fault my mistake i did this


---------130:34----------
i did this i cultivated this abusive


---------130:36----------
relationship


---------130:39----------
um you know it's kind of interesting


---------130:41----------
because


---------130:42----------
i i can see what you're saying it's


---------130:43----------
almost like a this too


---------130:45----------
has been kind of an evolution of you


---------130:46----------
being judged


---------130:48----------
over and over and over again does that


---------130:50----------
make sense


---------130:52----------
yeah i mean i'm i'm just uh


---------130:56----------
i think where this like where it comes


---------130:58----------
from me like constantly


---------131:00----------
trying to own up the stuff is the reddit


---------131:02----------
would always say i'm not owning up to


---------131:03----------
anything


---------131:05----------
and and now this is kind of interesting


---------131:06----------
because i'm i'm beginning to understand


---------131:08----------
i think


---------131:08----------
why they think you don't own up to


---------131:11----------
things


---------131:12----------
this is going to sound kind of weird


---------131:14----------
because even as i hear you explain


---------131:16----------
things there's a part of me that feels


---------131:18----------
some degree of doubt and i was really


---------131:19----------
surprised by that


---------131:22----------
right well so like there's something


---------131:24----------
actually i know it sounds kind of weird


---------131:25----------
dude so i'm just going to be straight


---------131:27----------
there's something about what you're


---------131:28----------
saying that feels very bs-like to me


---------131:31----------
okay and then i got really confused


---------131:33----------
because i was like he's clearly owning


---------131:34----------
up to things he's clearly taking


---------131:36----------
responsibility for it he recognizes he


---------131:38----------
makes mistakes


---------131:39----------
he's gotten he's become very insightful


---------131:41----------
so why is my bs meter going off a little


---------131:43----------
bit


---------131:44----------
does that make sense it does


---------131:48----------
and and so i want to share something


---------131:50----------
with you and i wonder if actually if


---------131:51----------
this has something to do with


---------131:52----------
um you know whether you have asperger's


---------131:55----------
or not


---------131:56----------
in sort of the way that you've learned


---------131:57----------
to apologize


---------131:59----------
um because i i do think that there are a


---------132:01----------
couple of things that are kind of


---------132:03----------
interesting about your apologies one is


---------132:05----------
that


---------132:05----------
you tend to own up to something and then


---------132:09----------
you


---------132:09----------
say because and then you cite


---------132:12----------
a negative emotion that was controlling


---------132:14----------
you


---------132:16----------
so you're like i cultivated this abusive


---------132:18----------
relationship because i was afraid


---------132:21----------
does that make does that construction


---------132:22----------
make sense yeah


---------132:24----------
100 owning a mistake


---------132:27----------
because negative emotion


---------132:32----------
and and i think you you've got to be


---------132:34----------
careful about that because while i can


---------132:36----------
completely understand that that's true


---------132:39----------
i think if i say oh yeah um


---------132:42----------
you know i i hit my dog


---------132:45----------
because i was angry and so it's like


---------132:49----------
yeah that can be true but when you sort


---------132:51----------
of like cite a negative emotion as


---------132:53----------
controlling you


---------132:55----------
i think there's a sense of like


---------132:57----------
absolving yourself of responsibility


---------132:59----------
there


---------133:00----------
it's not you it was the fear that made


---------133:03----------
you do it the fear made me do it the


---------133:04----------
fear made me do it the fear made me do


---------133:06----------
it


---------133:07----------
and i can understand that 100 because i


---------133:09----------
think that's actually how human beings


---------133:10----------
work


---------133:11----------
but i'm just sort of sharing that with


---------133:13----------
you because i think that that that


---------133:15----------
may you know is is it you


---------133:18----------
or is it the fear like what's really


---------133:20----------
responsible here what do you think


---------133:24----------
i mean yeah the the fear comes from me


---------133:26----------
so when i say fear i


---------133:28----------
just you know that's like that's me


---------133:32----------
like i'm the fear you know well so yeah


---------133:35----------
the re


---------133:36----------
what's your understanding of why i'm


---------133:38----------
sharing this with you


---------133:41----------
um i mean you're saying that i'm just


---------133:44----------
bad at apologies


---------133:46----------
uh honestly that i'm glad that that's


---------133:48----------
the way that you interpreted it because


---------133:49----------
what i was afraid of is that you would


---------133:51----------
interpret what i was saying is like i'm


---------133:53----------
calling bs


---------133:54----------
i don't think you're bad at apologies i


---------133:56----------
think that you have a particular way of


---------133:57----------
apologizing which i was trying to figure


---------133:59----------
out like


---------134:00----------
why do people judge you so harshly like


---------134:02----------
what's going on there because i think


---------134:03----------
that's


---------134:04----------
a little bit of a two-way relationship


---------134:05----------
as well you know because clearly like


---------134:07----------
you're owning up to what you've done


---------134:09----------
right like i'm not getting the sense


---------134:10----------
that you're


---------134:11----------
you know in denial or anything but so


---------134:13----------
that then the question becomes if you're


---------134:15----------
not in denial then then what


---------134:17----------
you know why do people react to you this


---------134:19----------
way and even more shockingly


---------134:21----------
why do i feel like reacting to you in


---------134:23----------
that way right


---------134:24----------
it's like what the yeah because the


---------134:27----------
guy's like clearly like he's like you


---------134:28----------
know i threw people under the bus like i


---------134:30----------
shouldn't have done this like i lowered


---------134:31----------
my boundaries that was a mistake like i


---------134:33----------
was afraid of losing it sounds like very


---------134:35----------
insightful


---------134:36----------
um you know it sounds like you've you've


---------134:38----------
kind of paid attention a lot and you've


---------134:40----------
done a lot of reflection


---------134:43----------
how would i apologize without saying


---------134:45----------
it's the negative emotions because i


---------134:47----------
mean


---------134:47----------
i didn't do it for no reason


---------134:51----------
yeah so that's that's a good question so


---------134:53----------
so i mean so let me


---------134:54----------
explain something to you like like like


---------134:57----------
what are you sorry for something


---------135:01----------
i mean i'm sorry for the


---------135:05----------
you know the people i threw under the


---------135:07----------
bus yeah but uh


---------135:08----------
i'm not really sorry for the cultivation


---------135:12----------
of that


---------135:13----------
you know of the toxic community that


---------135:14----------
i've that i made because


---------135:17----------
i'm past that now and it was affecting


---------135:20----------
me


---------135:21----------
the most who am i going to apologize to


---------135:23----------
myself


---------135:24----------
i mean i guess i it's not the toxic


---------135:27----------
community


---------135:28----------
that made me like throw people under the


---------135:30----------
bus so i'm not going to apologize


---------135:32----------
for that in particular i just apologize


---------135:34----------
like it's my own actions that


---------135:36----------
did that because i was


---------135:39----------
going through so much intense


---------135:42----------
things and there i said the because


---------135:45----------
again but


---------135:47----------
you see that you're doing great until


---------135:49----------
you said the because


---------135:50----------
so if and and i i think i know it sounds


---------135:53----------
kind of weird but like


---------135:54----------
i think in a weird way like you not


---------135:56----------
apologizing for a piece of it felt very


---------135:59----------
authentic to me


---------136:01----------
you know like because because you know


---------136:04----------
and this is subtle but like


---------136:05----------
you say i made a mistake i haven't heard


---------136:08----------
you say i'm sorry


---------136:09----------
right so i think that's the other thing


---------136:11----------
that people may be sniffing out is bs


---------136:13----------
and part of the reason that you get


---------136:14----------
judged


---------136:15----------
because if you're not sorry for


---------136:16----------
something paul i think you should just


---------136:17----------
own up to it and that felt authentic


---------136:19----------
like i'm with you 100


---------136:20----------
if you're like i screwed up but i don't


---------136:22----------
regret it for it for a minute


---------136:24----------
the only thing that i regret is that


---------136:26----------
while i was screwing up i threw some


---------136:28----------
people under the bus and that wasn't


---------136:29----------
fair to them


---------136:30----------
that sounds very authentic that doesn't


---------136:32----------
set off my bs meter


---------136:34----------
but when you say i made a mistake i made


---------136:36----------
a mistake now i'm sort of picking up


---------136:37----------
another piece because you're not sorry


---------136:40----------
and generally speaking we assume that


---------136:42----------
people who make mistakes are sorry that


---------136:43----------
they made mistakes but you're not sorry


---------136:45----------
so that makes perfect sense now i don't


---------136:48----------
blame you for it are you


---------136:49----------
i mean i'm you know in like a weird way


---------136:51----------
i'm kind of glad it all happened because


---------136:53----------
i'm


---------136:53----------
i i have learned a lot like if i didn't


---------136:57----------
go through this


---------136:59----------
i wouldn't have like i don't know dude i


---------137:02----------
would just be


---------137:04----------
so skewed in perspective to so many


---------137:06----------
things because yeah you know i went from


---------137:08----------
sheltered


---------137:09----------
to 20 000 viewers if i never had any of


---------137:13----------
those experiences


---------137:15----------
and everything was just positive i would


---------137:16----------
just be a [ __ ] skewed person i don't


---------137:18----------
know


---------137:19----------
like i needed to get perspective


---------137:20----------
somewhere right


---------137:22----------
yeah so and you know unfortunately i


---------137:25----------
went


---------137:26----------
through it really intense ways


---------137:29----------
but so be it you know yeah so that feels


---------137:33----------
very authentic to me


---------137:34----------
so be it feels far more than because i i


---------137:36----------
don't i didn't really hear you


---------137:37----------
i think i i get what so paul do you get


---------137:40----------
that i'm sharing this with you because i


---------137:42----------
i'm hoping that we can get some insight


---------137:44----------
into


---------137:45----------
you know how you put your words together


---------137:47----------
and how people respond to them


---------137:49----------
that's why i'm not trying to like call


---------137:50----------
you out or anything like that are you


---------137:52----------
getting that sense


---------137:54----------
yeah okay and if people are you know end


---------137:57----------
up watching this i i don't want them to


---------137:59----------
you know the last thing that i'd want to


---------138:00----------
do is reignite all of your haters


---------138:02----------
i think it's in a weird way this this


---------138:04----------
i'm having this conversation with you in


---------138:06----------
the same way


---------138:07----------
that i was having the conversation with


---------138:09----------
you about feelings


---------138:11----------
which is uh and like you know how you


---------138:12----------
talk to your girlfriend about how


---------138:14----------
certain conversations are hard for you


---------138:15----------
it's just for us to recognize that when


---------138:17----------
we communicate in a certain way


---------138:20----------
why do we set people off like because i


---------138:22----------
think there's something about you


---------138:23----------
paul that that is interesting because


---------138:25----------
you say i made a bunch of mistakes but


---------138:27----------
if you don't feel sorry


---------138:29----------
i think that's going to really frustrate


---------138:30----------
a lot of people


---------138:32----------
because what they're here yeah it's


---------138:35----------
it's also i don't know it's just


---------138:38----------
yeah the the sorry thing it's it's it's


---------138:41----------
i'm just not good with like expressing


---------138:43----------
my emotions as i said earlier so it just


---------138:46----------
yeah it comes off weird i can i know


---------138:49----------
yeah i think there's a little bit of a


---------138:50----------
disconnect because most people


---------138:53----------
when someone says i made a mistake and


---------138:55----------
it was my fault


---------138:56----------
empathically they expect


---------139:00----------
an emotion of i'm sorry with that but i


---------139:02----------
don't get i don't get that from you


---------139:06----------
yeah i get no that's you know now that


---------139:08----------
you think about it


---------139:09----------
that's probably why anytime i've ever


---------139:11----------
cried on stream i just had a terrible


---------139:13----------
response


---------139:14----------
except for the first time the first time


---------139:16----------
was authentic


---------139:17----------
ever the one on twitch than the ones on


---------139:20----------
youtube


---------139:21----------
like when i was crying because i wanted


---------139:22----------
to date someone else but i went on this


---------139:24----------
other girl's date for content


---------139:26----------
like i wasn't really sorry i just said


---------139:29----------
that


---------139:29----------
because i you know the viewers were


---------139:31----------
supposed to be controlling me so


---------139:33----------
you know but actually i could see why


---------139:34----------
they totally did not accept that apology


---------139:38----------
it was like uh i just yeah i was just


---------139:40----------
confused bro


---------139:41----------
yeah no i i think paul to be honest i


---------139:43----------
mean you know


---------139:45----------
people who have something on the on the


---------139:48----------
autism spectrum i think what i'm hearing


---------139:50----------
from your story


---------139:50----------
like and i don't really know you know if


---------139:53----------
there's more to say but


---------139:55----------
basically when i when i hear this i


---------139:56----------
think it's just a


---------139:58----------
it's a perfect storm of a lot of


---------139:59----------
different things man


---------140:02----------
you know i um can i just share some


---------140:04----------
thoughts with you


---------140:05----------
yeah so to begin with like i think that


---------140:08----------
you know what i'm hearing is that


---------140:10----------
you grew up and like stuff was hard


---------140:12----------
right because like people didn't know


---------140:13----------
what what to do with you and like people


---------140:14----------
didn't really understand


---------140:16----------
you and like you felt it sounds to me


---------140:18----------
like you felt alone growing up really


---------140:19----------
for lack


---------140:21----------
that's you know and and so then


---------140:24----------
you know twitch came along and and i


---------140:25----------
think that like twitch is amazing


---------140:27----------
because it's it's sort of


---------140:28----------
a way for people who are misfits


---------140:32----------
a way for misfits to fit in i think


---------140:35----------
that's one of the biggest things that


---------140:36----------
twitch has done for our society in


---------140:38----------
in terms of like allowing people for


---------140:40----------
this connection


---------140:42----------
and so you started streaming there i


---------140:44----------
think your class clown came out a little


---------140:45----------
bit


---------140:46----------
but then as you kind of pointed out you


---------140:48----------
know it also sounds like you


---------140:50----------
um you know you got that validation


---------140:54----------
and it was kind of validation in sort of


---------140:56----------
the wrong direction that like anything


---------140:58----------
to not be alone and i totally get that i


---------141:00----------
can understand why


---------141:01----------
you know if you get if you're the victim


---------141:04----------
of of something like a sexual assault or


---------141:07----------
bullying or things like that and if


---------141:09----------
everyone around you calls you a snitch


---------141:10----------
and you have to like transfer schools


---------141:12----------
and


---------141:13----------
go sit in a classroom by yourself when


---------141:15----------
you're like clearly the victim


---------141:19----------
you know i can understand how that


---------141:21----------
leaves


---------141:22----------
a hunger for like acceptance a hunger


---------141:25----------
for


---------141:26----------
friendship like a hunger for like


---------141:27----------
something and then along comes the


---------141:30----------
internet


---------141:31----------
and then all of these things that you


---------141:33----------
grew up as like you don't have to be


---------141:34----------
anymore


---------141:35----------
you can be someone who talks to people


---------141:37----------
you don't have to be someone with


---------141:39----------
asperger's you can just be social


---------141:41----------
you can have lots of friends and you can


---------141:42----------
be funny and people can appreciate you


---------141:44----------
and you can appreciate them


---------141:46----------
i think there's a lot of i mean there


---------141:47----------
must have been a lot of just genuine


---------141:49----------
goodness to your content too i'm not


---------141:51----------
saying it was wholesome


---------141:52----------
but like there must have been like good


---------141:54----------
times and solid laughs and like a lot of


---------141:56----------
like


---------141:57----------
you know hanging out you know i mean and


---------142:00----------
and so that's sort of like and then you


---------142:03----------
had this sort of like high of everyone


---------142:05----------
you know like liking you and this is


---------142:07----------
where i'd say from a spiritual


---------142:09----------
perspective


---------142:10----------
i don't know if we have time for this


---------142:11----------
now right i don't think we do but i


---------142:12----------
think that there's another element of


---------142:14----------
ego or the sanskrit word is ahm god


---------142:17----------
which is the sense of i


---------142:18----------
so your sense of identity of who you


---------142:21----------
become


---------142:22----------
and who you want to be that i think is


---------142:24----------
sort of active here


---------142:26----------
and then then something weird happens i


---------142:28----------
think it sounds like you sort of


---------142:29----------
cultivated


---------142:30----------
um a particular kind of person in in


---------142:34----------
your chat which


---------142:34----------
you know i totally get because i imagine


---------142:37----------
had i been a little bit younger and was


---------142:38----------
watching twitch chat more religiously i


---------142:40----------
probably would have wound up in your


---------142:41----------
community i have a huge inner troll


---------142:44----------
um you know i really get it and so


---------142:48----------
and then you got banned a couple times


---------142:51----------
you got a band a couple more times


---------142:53----------
and then there was this kind of swat


---------142:54----------
thing where and i do think you sort of


---------142:56----------
let it sounds like you went


---------142:58----------
you kind of like let caution go for a


---------143:00----------
while there


---------143:01----------
and you know whatever happened happened


---------143:04----------
um


---------143:06----------
and then really when you got banned from


---------143:07----------
twitch you were sort of like i'm getting


---------143:09----------
a sense of like


---------143:10----------
you know desperation and fear really


---------143:12----------
that all this stuff was going to be


---------143:14----------
taken away and like you'd pay


---------143:15----------
any price to hang on to it any price


---------143:20----------
and was it the wrong thing to do to


---------143:23----------
completely


---------143:23----------
destroy your boundaries and let randos


---------143:25----------
like show up at your place like


---------143:27----------
undoubtedly at the same time i think


---------143:29----------
it's very authentic for you to say that


---------143:31----------
actually


---------143:32----------
sounds like you don't regret it no i


---------143:34----------
mean i had a lot of good i mean i know


---------143:36----------
we're talking about the bad experiences


---------143:37----------
but i had a lot of good ones too


---------143:39----------
dude i have met thousands and thousands


---------143:42----------
of fans


---------143:43----------
at my doorstep and you know most of them


---------143:45----------
are cool


---------143:46----------
and most of them i resonate with really


---------143:48----------
a lot


---------143:49----------
it's only the couple situations where


---------143:53----------
they're like [ __ ]


---------143:54----------
crazy people or something like


---------143:57----------
you know what i mean like i've had


---------143:59----------
people come like crying to me


---------144:01----------
like they like they like let me move in


---------144:03----------
with you you are my god


---------144:04----------
and they're crying and i have to say no


---------144:06----------
you cannot move in with me


---------144:08----------
and then he's posed to conversate he was


---------144:10----------
recording the conversation he posted on


---------144:12----------
reddit


---------144:13----------
and on reddit [ __ ] on me let this


---------144:14----------
guy live with you he's you're


---------144:16----------
you're his god and i just have to say no


---------144:19----------
and then you know those are the bad


---------144:20----------
situations


---------144:21----------
but most of the situations were good


---------144:24----------
yeah


---------144:25----------
and and so then we kind of get to where


---------144:28----------
you are now which is where where are you


---------144:30----------
now paul


---------144:31----------
well i mean yeah i mean i stream on


---------144:34----------
youtube to uh


---------144:36----------
you know smaller audience than twenty


---------144:39----------
thousand but


---------144:40----------
um i'm happy with it bro like honestly


---------144:43----------
i mean obviously uh 20 000


---------144:46----------
was nice but it's not worth like the it


---------144:49----------
just wasn't worth what i had to go


---------144:51----------
through like i


---------144:53----------
i had this this project that i was doing


---------144:56----------
in la this was the final straw 2019 i


---------144:58----------
had this project i was doing i was going


---------145:00----------
to


---------145:00----------
start this like streamer house and you


---------145:03----------
know my viewers


---------145:05----------
wanted me to move in a trailer park


---------145:07----------
instead of a house


---------145:09----------
and i said no because that you know i


---------145:11----------
don't want to live in a [ __ ] trailer


---------145:13----------
and stream from it um and uh


---------145:17----------
you know yeah they they ruined the


---------145:19----------
project that i had


---------145:20----------
they had investors and you know they


---------145:22----------
pulled out because the viewers were


---------145:24----------
getting too crazy


---------145:25----------
when you know they were doxxing the


---------145:27----------
investors and [ __ ] they were just so


---------145:29----------
pissed at me


---------145:30----------
yeah they were so pissed at me that they


---------145:32----------
wanted to do anything to ruin this


---------145:34----------
project that i had been


---------145:35----------
working towards for over a year now


---------145:37----------
because you know getting


---------145:38----------
investors is not an easy task and like


---------145:41----------
getting like a whole


---------145:42----------
like a bunch of employees and it was


---------145:45----------
just a long process right


---------145:48----------
so that got ruined and i said all right


---------145:51----------
[ __ ] this i closed my reddit down i got


---------145:53----------
it banned


---------145:54----------
you know uh other reddit started opening


---------145:57----------
up


---------145:58----------
you know for like people trying to still


---------146:00----------
be a part of my community those got


---------146:01----------
banned


---------146:02----------
and i moved to texas got away from


---------146:05----------
california


---------146:06----------
i just started like a new [ __ ] it's


---------146:07----------
like a new life bro


---------146:09----------
and i stopped streaming for a little bit


---------146:11----------
streamed on mixer for


---------146:12----------
for almost a year now i'm back on


---------146:14----------
youtube and i had to


---------146:16----------
stop streaming and go to mixer to get


---------146:18----------
rid of the like i just had to take time


---------146:20----------
off bro cause the


---------146:21----------
some of these [ __ ] people bro they


---------146:23----------
just wouldn't


---------146:25----------
like they're just like obsessive like


---------146:27----------
when you let


---------146:28----------
people control your life you do get a


---------146:31----------
certain type of


---------146:32----------
viewer like you said and these type of


---------146:35----------
viewers


---------146:36----------
it's hard to it's hard to get rid of


---------146:38----------
them so


---------146:40----------
um so i took some time off and now my


---------146:43----------
viewers


---------146:44----------
they're very nice they respect my


---------146:45----------
boundaries i like them


---------146:48----------
and yeah i mean i'm very happy right now


---------146:50----------
with where i am streaming


---------146:53----------
cool well i'm happy for you


---------146:57----------
thank you i it's been tough though it's


---------146:59----------
it's bro it was like it dude 2019 when i


---------147:02----------
was taking time off bro


---------147:04----------
it wasn't easy dude it i had like an ego


---------147:07----------
death


---------147:09----------
because uh i had to re-identify myself


---------147:12----------
from this like persona


---------147:15----------
to like i just want to be me now i don't


---------147:17----------
want to be a persona


---------147:18----------
you know yeah i


---------147:22----------
i i mean that makes a lot of sense to me


---------147:24----------
because i'm and i'm also really happy to


---------147:26----------
hear that actually because it sounds


---------147:27----------
like your ego was really out of control


---------147:30----------
for a while i yeah i i


---------147:34----------
just yeah i've lost a little bit of uh


---------147:38----------
who i was at like as a person and


---------147:41----------
completely became


---------147:42----------
this you know like [ __ ] frankenstein


---------147:46----------
my viewers were


---------147:47----------
making yeah yeah


---------147:50----------
i hate to say it that way because it's


---------147:52----------
it's not like it is still my fault the


---------147:54----------
viewers aren't the ones who like


---------147:55----------
made that but i put myself in the


---------147:58----------
situation to allow them to


---------148:00----------
make that yeah i i see what you're


---------148:03----------
saying i i think i mean i'm not


---------148:05----------
here to play judge in terms of who was


---------148:08----------
at fault and who wasn't that's not


---------148:10----------
really


---------148:11----------
i mean i think you know i i will


---------148:14----------
judgement is for


---------148:15----------
god if you believe in it yourself and


---------148:18----------
the internet


---------148:19----------
and it's not something that i am


---------148:22----------
interested in i think um


---------148:24----------
my perspective paul it's been an


---------148:26----------
absolute pleasure talking to you i think


---------148:27----------
it's been


---------148:28----------
really fascinating i hope that um you


---------148:31----------
know


---------148:32----------
especially sort of like some of this


---------148:33----------
communication stuff i think that it's


---------148:35----------
interesting that


---------148:35----------
a lot of people take it for granted but


---------148:37----------
there is kind of like a


---------148:39----------
stepwise process to learn how to


---------148:40----------
communicate


---------148:42----------
um we i think sometimes we got to be


---------148:43----------
really careful because there are


---------148:45----------
patterns in our communication like the


---------148:46----------
way that you


---------148:47----------
own up to your mistakes but it's not


---------148:48----------
really an apology that i think that you


---------148:51----------
would


---------148:52----------
it's actually the same principle as sort


---------148:53----------
of talking to your girlfriend which is


---------148:54----------
like


---------148:55----------
just state how you really feel about


---------148:57----------
things hey i really want to talk to you


---------148:59----------
but i'm not really able to because it


---------149:00----------
like brings up a lot of negative emotion


---------149:03----------
and i want to work on this but i just


---------149:04----------
can't handle it right now and i'm really


---------149:06----------
confused about like what to do about


---------149:08----------
that


---------149:09----------
you know because i i'm hearing almost


---------149:11----------
the same degree of like


---------149:13----------
sort of conflicting stuff which unless


---------149:15----------
you state it out for people can be


---------149:17----------
confusing for them


---------149:18----------
so on the one hand it was terrible and i


---------149:20----------
felt like i was in a toxic abusive


---------149:22----------
relationship but on the other hand it


---------149:24----------
was like also super hype


---------149:26----------
you know i i my ego was through the roof


---------149:29----------
i was loving it i was loving being


---------149:32----------
this person who had went from 100


---------149:34----------
viewers to 20 000 viewers


---------149:36----------
and it was amazing and then i was also


---------149:39----------
afraid and i like


---------149:40----------
let let these people like do things to


---------149:42----------
my life but i also


---------149:43----------
let them do it you know and i felt like


---------149:45----------
i lost control


---------149:47----------
and at the end of the day it sounds like


---------149:48----------
really the only thing you're sorry for


---------149:50----------
is


---------149:50----------
the other people who got caught up in it


---------149:53----------
right and


---------149:54----------
and kind of suffered because of your


---------149:56----------
choices


---------149:57----------
um and and it sounds like you're


---------150:00----------
actually grateful that i mean i don't


---------150:02----------
know grateful may be a strong word but


---------150:04----------
that you don't regret what happened to


---------150:05----------
you because


---------150:06----------
it's made you the person that you are


---------150:08----------
today and that you had like


---------150:10----------
you know a pretty narrow sliver of what


---------150:13----------
your experience of life is and like


---------150:15----------
now it's like a huge pie of like just


---------150:18----------
all of these different experiences


---------150:20----------
good bad crazy hype fun


---------150:24----------
you know walking like waking up and like


---------150:26----------
rando's being in your living room like


---------150:27----------
that sounds absolutely insane


---------150:30----------
yeah dude yeah my experience bro i have


---------150:33----------
so many different perspectives


---------150:35----------
it's amazing yeah and and so i think the


---------150:38----------
last thing that i'll kind of leave you


---------150:39----------
with is i'm glad you've kind of had


---------150:40----------
something like an ego death because i


---------150:42----------
i heard the ego when you because this is


---------150:44----------
the ego when it's like i'm going to be


---------150:46----------
the only streamer who dot dot dot


---------150:50----------
that's ego right i want to be the only


---------150:53----------
one that's not about your viewers


---------150:56----------
it's not about making good content


---------150:59----------
if you're interested in being the only


---------151:01----------
whatever that's about you


---------151:03----------
um and and so good luck to you man


---------151:08----------
it's been an absolute pleasure really


---------151:10----------
appreciate your authenticity


---------151:12----------
and just share your story yeah one


---------151:14----------
question uh yeah of course


---------151:16----------
just because i i do feel and i i've


---------151:19----------
always felt insecure about this


---------151:21----------
um but um because


---------151:24----------
then you brought it up because my


---------151:27----------
viewers used to say it all the time too


---------151:28----------
the ego thing


---------151:29----------
um hopefully you don't see that


---------151:33----------
in me at the moment or currently because


---------151:35----------
i tried


---------151:36----------
hard to try to ground myself


---------151:39----------
yeah so let's talk about that for just a


---------151:41----------
second so i think that um


---------151:44----------
i i i think you're on the right road for


---------151:46----------
sure paul


---------151:47----------
and and like you said like that that


---------151:49----------
kind of identity crisis that you went


---------151:51----------
through in 2019 i think was probably


---------151:53----------
very healthy for you


---------151:55----------
i think but i think part of the reason


---------151:57----------
why people see ego i don't think it's


---------151:59----------
actually ego i think it's just your way


---------152:01----------
of communicating


---------152:02----------
which is like when you say something


---------152:05----------
like


---------152:06----------
you know i i made this mistake because


---------152:08----------
of the fear


---------152:10----------
that's gonna come across as egotistical


---------152:13----------
to people


---------152:14----------
like it like it's gonna come across to


---------152:16----------
people as saying like oh it wasn't my


---------152:17----------
fault it was like


---------152:19----------
my emotions which i know it sounds weird


---------152:21----------
but it's true


---------152:23----------
and also like people are going to judge


---------152:24----------
you for being egotistical


---------152:27----------
i think the only real ego that i i


---------152:29----------
shared with you the statement that i


---------152:30----------
thought was egotistical which was the


---------152:32----------
one where i i want to be the only


---------152:34----------
streamer who


---------152:35----------
dot dot that's really like the only


---------152:36----------
thing that i thought was explicitly ego


---------152:38----------
now i mean there may have been way more


---------152:40----------
ego before but i'm not getting a whole


---------152:42----------
lot of that now


---------152:43----------
does that sound okay that i i mean said


---------152:45----------
that do you feel reassured when i say


---------152:47----------
that or


---------152:49----------
yeah i just wanted i was just insecure


---------152:51----------
because i just don't wanna


---------152:52----------
i just hope i was just hoping i wasn't


---------152:54----------
coming off as like uh


---------152:55----------
egotistical or something so the other


---------152:58----------
tricky thing


---------152:58----------
uh paul that i should i should be more


---------153:00----------
careful about this is a mistake on


---------153:02----------
on mine and i'm sorry for that is that i


---------153:04----------
use the term ego


---------153:05----------
is really a translation of the sanskrit


---------153:07----------
term ahamkara


---------153:09----------
which is the i feeling or the identity


---------153:12----------
and so what i'm sort of talking about is


---------153:15----------
not necessarily that you were like


---------153:16----------
egotistical but that you had an


---------153:18----------
identity right like this is if we think


---------153:20----------
about paul growing up


---------153:22----------
paul was lonely paul was riding the


---------153:24----------
short bus


---------153:25----------
paul was all of these things and then


---------153:27----------
you have ice poseidon


---------153:29----------
who thousands of cool people show up at


---------153:32----------
your door to hang out with you


---------153:34----------
both of those are ego they're both a


---------153:36----------
sense of who you


---------153:37----------
are and neither of them is truly who you


---------153:40----------
are those are both identities


---------153:42----------
those are both ego so when i say ego i'm


---------153:44----------
referring to actually both of those


---------153:45----------
things


---------153:46----------
there are constructions of the mind


---------153:48----------
about who we


---------153:49----------
are but that's not really who you are


---------153:52----------
like i know it sounds weird but i mean


---------153:54----------
who you are is like


---------153:56----------
if you close your eyes for a second


---------154:01----------
it's like can you feel your existence


---------154:06----------
yeah like that's who you are


---------154:10----------
right you're not paul you're not ice
