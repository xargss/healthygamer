---------00:00----------
and this is what I'm telling you guys if


---------00:01----------
I can go from there to being faculty at


---------00:04----------
Harvard [ __ ] Medical School you can


---------00:06----------
too


---------00:11----------
let me go to the next question let's


---------00:13----------
talk about Dharma for a second there


---------00:15----------
well then we'll do meditation


---------00:22----------
hey dr. K I know that you advocate for


---------00:24----------
finding your calling karma in life but I


---------00:25----------
feel like I'm having a hard time pinning


---------00:27----------
that down my question is what kinds of


---------00:28----------
specific things can be done to find that


---------00:30----------
calling and is it or can it be related


---------00:33----------
to finding financial success yes so


---------00:36----------
let's talk about finding your Dharma the


---------00:38----------
first thing that I want you to do is


---------00:39----------
take a piece of paper I've given out


---------00:41----------
this exercise before and if you haven't


---------00:44----------
done it and you've heard it before we


---------00:46----------
got to understand why you can't do this


---------00:47----------
and write a page about what you think is


---------00:50----------
wrong with the world


---------00:52----------
just write a page about what you think


---------00:53----------
is wrong with it and they're like all


---------00:54----------
kinds of thoughts are gonna pop nd in


---------00:56----------
your head like oh like the list will be


---------00:58----------
never-ending like oh I could write about


---------01:01----------
this or I could write about this or I


---------01:02----------
couldn't write but that's why you need


---------01:04----------
to sit down and actually write a page


---------01:05----------
about the world of what's wrong with the


---------01:07----------
world because when you sit down and you


---------01:08----------
actually write a page then you'll see


---------01:12----------
what comes out


---------01:14----------
and then this is really important so we


---------01:18----------
have two modes of thinking we have our


---------01:20----------
creative mind and we have our analytical


---------01:22----------
mind


---------01:23----------
and so one of the biggest struggles if


---------01:25----------
you're a writer is that like when you


---------01:27----------
sit down and write you sort of edit what


---------01:29----------
you're writing all the time and that can


---------01:31----------
make it hard to write like the sentence


---------01:32----------
doesn't feel right so one of the biggest


---------01:34----------
things that writers need to learn how to


---------01:35----------
do is shut off their editor so you have


---------01:38----------
like an author and you have like an


---------01:40----------
artist and you have an editor in your


---------01:42----------
head and in learning learning how to


---------01:45----------
write what you've got to do is like


---------01:46----------
separate the artist from the editor and


---------01:49----------
what gamers do is they confuse they're


---------01:52----------
always in editor mode because they're


---------01:54----------
they're analytical mind is really strong


---------01:56----------
and so they never get to exercise their


---------01:58----------
creative mind which is why you all end


---------02:01----------
up on Twitch because you all are really


---------02:03----------
good at analyzing and commenting and


---------02:04----------
really bad at doing and why is that it's


---------02:07----------
because you're your author your creative


---------02:09----------
mind your artistic mind has become dead


---------02:11----------
because video games don't train that


---------02:14----------
mind at all they just train they just


---------02:16----------
train your analytical mind because video


---------02:18----------
games so need you to create anything


---------02:20----------
video games are all about analysis and


---------02:22----------
like following the script that you're


---------02:25----------
given it's all about responding to


---------02:27----------
external things it's nothing internal


---------02:30----------
so what you guys need to do is like


---------02:32----------
recognize that


---------02:35----------
you have this creative part and you have


---------02:37----------
an analytical part and right now it's


---------02:39----------
almost like you know it's like I'm gonna


---------02:42----------
create some weird images but like


---------02:44----------
imagine you just worked out like one arm


---------02:46----------
like you just did like curls with one


---------02:48----------
arm and you got that arm swole and then


---------02:50----------
the other arm you never worked out


---------02:51----------
that's what your brain is like if you're


---------02:53----------
a gamer your analytical mind is way


---------02:55----------
overblown and you're like you're your


---------02:59----------
creative mind like you're your creative


---------03:02----------
mind is like weak so it's like it's like


---------03:06----------
you know people who skip leg day but


---------03:07----------
like you know it's just like one part of


---------03:09----------
your mind is just really weak so when


---------03:11----------
you sit down to write you're starting to


---------03:14----------
like increase the strength of your


---------03:15----------
creative mind to actually like have a


---------03:18----------
thought and put something out in the


---------03:19----------
world so if I had to diagnose your


---------03:22----------
problem is a gamer the problem is that


---------03:24----------
you have lots of thoughts and they never


---------03:26----------
produce anything you can think but you


---------03:28----------
can't produce so what we need to do is


---------03:31----------
just literally practice the skill of


---------03:34----------
producing


---------03:35----------
practice the skill producing it doesn't


---------03:37----------
matter what it is just start working out


---------03:39----------
that arm so write one page generate


---------03:44----------
absolutely just generate something the


---------03:48----------
only thing you guys are good at


---------03:49----------
generating is semen and [ __ ] that's all


---------03:52----------
you guys can produce produce something


---------03:54----------
doesn't matter create something write a


---------03:56----------
page


---------03:59----------
that's that's you should do just write


---------04:01----------
something and in in the in the realm so


---------04:06----------
this is fascinating because even like in


---------04:07----------
yogic texts the there's this idea that


---------04:11----------
there are two things in life that


---------04:13----------
require manifestation you need energy


---------04:16----------
and intention so this is like Shiva is


---------04:20----------
the principle of like consciousness or


---------04:23----------
intention and Shakti is Shiva's consort


---------04:27----------
there's like a male God and his wife as


---------04:29----------
the female God and Shakti means energy


---------04:31----------
and so if you want to accomplish


---------04:33----------
anything in this world you need to


---------04:35----------
combine intention with energy in the way


---------04:39----------
that I view that is the analytical mind


---------04:40----------
and the creative mind and you guys all


---------04:42----------
have a really good analytical mind you


---------04:44----------
have a very good Shiva but your Shakti


---------04:47----------
is very weak your energy is very weak


---------04:49----------
the interesting thing is that in this in


---------04:52----------
the Hindu tradition Shiva is male and


---------04:53----------
shucks these female so I see this


---------04:56----------
problem more with men than women


---------05:00----------
and so start by just writing a page


---------05:02----------
about what's wrong with the world and if


---------05:05----------
you haven't done it yet so like show of


---------05:07----------
hands like who's actually done this


---------05:13----------
right and so if you just think about


---------05:15----------
that for a second if you've heard this


---------05:16----------
exercise or even by the end of tomorrow


---------05:19----------
if you haven't actually written like ask


---------05:22----------
yourself why what gets in the way of you


---------05:25----------
actually just riding one page


---------05:28----------
and like riding what's wrong with the


---------05:31----------
world


---------05:33----------
and so then we get to the second part


---------05:35----------
which is like after you write one page


---------05:37----------
then turn on your analytical mind and


---------05:40----------
sift through it and be your own


---------05:42----------
therapist and ask yourself okay out of


---------05:45----------
this so the second part of the question


---------05:46----------
was about financial financial stuff like


---------05:51----------
can you be financially successful


---------05:52----------
through Therma absolutely because I


---------05:55----------
believe that generally speaking like


---------05:57----------
what matters to you is probably going to


---------06:00----------
matter to someone else out there


---------06:03----------
and generally speaking money is


---------06:04----------
correlated with value like sure there


---------06:06----------
are lots of problems with like this


---------06:09----------
general premise but generally speaking I


---------06:11----------
think people are willing to pay for


---------06:13----------
stuff that's like worth something and so


---------06:16----------
if you see a problem and you go about


---------06:19----------
trying to correct it chances are you'll


---------06:21----------
generate value so if we think about


---------06:24----------
something like axiom verge if you guys


---------06:26----------
haven't checked out the game you check


---------06:27----------
it I'm not getting paid or anything but


---------06:29----------
like axiom verge is a great game because


---------06:32----------
the guy was like I want to play like a


---------06:33----------
Metroid game like I want to play like a


---------06:35----------
Metroid game and so he like made a bunch


---------06:37----------
of guns and he made a budget cool level


---------06:38----------
designs and then it was just like making


---------06:41----------
the game that you want to play


---------06:43----------
if we think about successful authors


---------06:45----------
like successful authors write the book


---------06:48----------
that they want to read because they say


---------06:50----------
like okay there's no book on the market


---------06:51----------
that scratches my itch for this kind of


---------06:54----------
thing like this I think it would be


---------06:55----------
really cool if there was like you know a


---------06:57----------
book about this


---------07:03----------
um and yeah so Raman Berg just had an


---------07:08----------
interesting thought imagine if all of us


---------07:09----------
here on chat does this writing


---------07:11----------
assignment and go beyond it write a book


---------07:12----------
called what's wrong with the world so


---------07:14----------
113 of these books all called the same


---------07:17----------
but written by different authors that's


---------07:19----------
a that's a brilliant idea so I think


---------07:21----------
what you guys should do is write a page


---------07:23----------
and then let's coalesce it and publish


---------07:26----------
it as an e-book and let's see what


---------07:28----------
happens


---------07:30----------
what you guys do it each of you write a


---------07:31----------
page there are 113 viewers and then


---------07:34----------
we're gonna make a book right we're


---------07:38----------
gonna actually do it like you [ __ ] no


---------07:42----------
excuses but y'all are gonna come up with


---------07:44----------
it it's gonna fail it's gonna fail it's


---------07:46----------
gonna [ __ ] fail 113 pages twitch


---------07:50----------
writes a book right it's like twitch


---------07:51----------
plays pokemon but twitch writes a book


---------07:53----------
let's do it that's


---------07:56----------
like a brilliant idea


---------07:58----------
and I'll write a page too I'll put my


---------08:02----------
money where my mouth is dr. Joe Bri asks


---------08:05----------
single-spaced to double who the [ __ ]


---------08:06----------
cares if it's single space or double


---------08:08----------
space see that's the kind of [ __ ]


---------08:09----------
that I'm talking about you guys will


---------08:11----------
come up with any kind of yes single


---------08:14----------
space or double space like who cares


---------08:16----------
does it matter what the font is or


---------08:19----------
whether it's single space or double


---------08:20----------
space your mind will come up with


---------08:23----------
anything it can to not create any reason


---------08:27----------
you want anything it'll come up with all


---------08:31----------
kinds of reasons to not actually create


---------08:33----------
something


---------08:36----------
anything you can to not get someone


---------08:38----------
pregnant and just jerk off


---------08:41----------
that's all you guys want


---------08:44----------
and so like [ __ ] all of that


---------08:48----------
so we got to figure out how to do this


---------08:50----------
but I want you guys to write and like


---------08:52----------
we're gonna see what we can put together


---------08:53----------
and we're gonna like submit it somewhere


---------08:57----------
and then


---------09:00----------
like we're gonna submit it to somewhere


---------09:01----------
and we'll like post it on our website


---------09:03----------
and then you guys can read what like


---------09:05----------
other people have written so we've done


---------09:06----------
this on the past on our discord well we


---------09:08----------
do this exercise with like groups of


---------09:10----------
gamers


---------09:13----------
and and like people will like post their


---------09:16----------
what their submissions and then it's


---------09:18----------
it's been really helpful for everyone


---------09:19----------
else so if you guys want to write a book


---------09:21----------
together let's do it


---------09:24----------
right


---------09:28----------
yeah so write a page about what's wrong


---------09:30----------
with the world


---------09:32----------
and then and can be related to financial


---------09:34----------
success absolutely right so this is how


---------09:36----------
twitch is gonna make money like we're


---------09:37----------
gonna make some money like let's see if


---------09:38----------
we can sell it like let's see if the


---------09:40----------
book is decent there's a piece [ __ ] fine


---------09:41----------
no problem if it fails no big deal


---------09:44----------
at least we learned something right at


---------09:45----------
least we did something because even if


---------09:47----------
you write a really crappy book like it'd


---------09:50----------
be cool right you don't even need


---------09:51----------
failure yeah you don't need success the


---------09:54----------
book can suck but you're gonna feel


---------09:56----------
amazing about yourself and that's the


---------09:58----------
key because remember everywhere that we


---------10:00----------
started from is you don't feel like


---------10:02----------
Europe


---------10:03----------
you deserve to succeed you feel like


---------10:05----------
your piece of [ __ ] and that's what's


---------10:06----------
holding you back so how do we fix that


---------10:08----------
problem we write the shittiest book in


---------10:10----------
the history of humanity


---------10:13----------
in somehow that's gonna make you feel


---------10:15----------
good just think about that this whole


---------10:17----------
stream has been about overcoming failure


---------10:19----------
how about try something that you know is


---------10:22----------
gonna be a piece of [ __ ] and feeling


---------10:23----------
good at the end of it


---------10:24----------
like if you can do that you could turn


---------10:26----------
your [ __ ] life around done it doesn't


---------10:29----------
even have to succeed it doesn't have to


---------10:30----------
be successful it doesn't have to make


---------10:32----------
you rich


---------10:32----------
you're gonna produce the biggest turd


---------10:37----------
of


---------10:39----------
authorship in the universe and you're


---------10:43----------
gonna feel good about it and then you're


---------10:45----------
gonna wake up the next day and you know


---------10:46----------
what's crazy you know it's really crazy


---------10:48----------
you're gonna go to class


---------10:50----------
you're gonna go to class


---------10:54----------
that's going to happen


---------11:00----------
yeah so we got to figure out so I don't


---------11:03----------
know if Kangas still around kanga how


---------11:06----------
could how can these guys submit


---------11:07----------
something


---------11:10----------
we got to figure that out


---------11:13----------
okay


---------11:17----------
so let's talk about in tarma for a


---------11:19----------
second


---------11:28----------
so here's here's a great question yeah


---------11:32----------
Google Doc would be fine


---------11:36----------
so dank dank Moses is going to help us


---------11:39----------
figure out how to do this


---------11:42----------
um okay so hello over the past couple of


---------11:46----------
months I've been struggling with what my


---------11:47----------
Dharma is my dream in life was to become


---------11:49----------
a professional eSports player yet I have


---------11:51----------
come to the realization that I'm not


---------11:53----------
good enough to be one this is pushed me


---------11:55----------
to becoming more involved with school


---------11:57----------
however I'm not passionate about it


---------12:00----------
whatsoever just wondering if there are


---------12:01----------
any tips I could get to move on with my


---------12:03----------
life


---------12:06----------
um so this question comes from engine so


---------12:09----------
I'm not quite sure what you mean by


---------12:11----------
being involved with school but so like


---------12:14----------
let's just talk about shattered dreams


---------12:16----------
for a second so I think this question is


---------12:18----------
about shattered dreams right over the


---------12:20----------
past couple of months I've been


---------12:22----------
struggling with what my Dharma is my


---------12:24----------
dream in life was to become a


---------12:26----------
professional eSports player yet I have


---------12:27----------
come to the realization that I'm not


---------12:29----------
good enough to be one perfect right so


---------12:32----------
we can start there this is what we've


---------12:34----------
been talking about in the roguelike you


---------12:37----------
are thinking like oh I want to be a mage


---------12:38----------
and I want to find a fireball spell


---------12:40----------
because I want to be a fire mage but you


---------12:42----------
roll up your roguelike and there are no


---------12:44----------
fire spells to be found so then you're


---------12:46----------
like well [ __ ] what what can I do so


---------12:50----------
like I wanted to be an eSports pro -


---------12:52----------
like it blows my mind I work with a


---------12:53----------
couple of people who had the opportunity


---------12:56----------
to become eSports pros


---------12:59----------
and they turned it down to [ __ ] go to


---------13:01----------
medical school and you know who you are


---------13:03----------
and then when they tell me that like a


---------13:06----------
couple of people now and and when they


---------13:09----------
tell me that I'm like you're crazy like


---------13:10----------
why not pick eSports because that's what


---------13:12----------
I wanted but I just wasn't good enough


---------13:14----------
like I played so much war three and I


---------13:16----------
was in top 100 on the ladder in North


---------13:19----------
America which is like nothing right like


---------13:23----------
top 100 is sort of an achievement but if


---------13:25----------
we really think about it like that's


---------13:26----------
just not I was like numbered like 87 or


---------13:29----------
something on the NA ladder so I was like


---------13:32----------
good at war 3 but like you 87 is it


---------13:36----------
gonna get you anywhere in the eSports


---------13:38----------
world


---------13:40----------
so


---------13:42----------
you know I think that's fine so like


---------13:44----------
that's not your karma in this life right


---------13:46----------
so just accept that for a moment and be


---------13:48----------
like okay I wanted this thing and now


---------13:50----------
this is really important because like we


---------13:51----------
learned with Helen sometimes we don't


---------13:54----------
let ourselves want what we cannot have


---------13:59----------
and then this the subtle thing is that


---------14:01----------
that want lives in our subconscious and


---------14:05----------
and weighs us down so instead what you


---------14:08----------
really need to do is actually grieve you


---------14:11----------
need to grieve for the loss so what you


---------14:15----------
need to do is like be honest with


---------14:16----------
yourself and say hey I really wanted


---------14:18----------
this but I've lost it like this is gone


---------14:21----------
and this is not gonna be a part of my


---------14:22----------
life because grief is the appropriate


---------14:25----------
place is the appropriate way to move on


---------14:29----------
for something that you no longer have


---------14:31----------
right so engine EADS to grieve his


---------14:34----------
potential eSports career it's like I


---------14:37----------
mean at this I don't mean to be


---------14:38----------
insensitive about this but it's almost


---------14:39----------
like a miscarriage like the appropriate


---------14:42----------
way to deal with a miscarriage is grief


---------14:44----------
because there was this potential right


---------14:46----------
there was this whole other life or track


---------14:48----------
or Avenue of like joy and hope and love


---------14:52----------
and like there was this whole career


---------14:55----------
there's this whole like trajectory in


---------14:57----------
life and it's gone


---------15:00----------
it's never gonna be


---------15:02----------
and so you need to grieve


---------15:06----------
right and like how do you grieve for a


---------15:08----------
miscarriage like you just first of all


---------15:10----------
acknowledge that you're entitled to feel


---------15:12----------
bad for not having it that it's sad that


---------15:16----------
it happened and also like that it


---------15:19----------
doesn't mean that your life is over and


---------15:21----------
when I help people work through


---------15:23----------
miscarriages which happens a lot like so


---------15:25----------
like you know I think half of women have


---------15:28----------
a miscarriage like the numbers absurdly


---------15:30----------
high


---------15:31----------
it's like how do you deal with something


---------15:32----------
like you just say like yeah it's shitty


---------15:34----------
like that sucks like let's be honest


---------15:36----------
about that and you're sad and you're


---------15:37----------
allowed to be sad and


---------15:42----------
let's not like delude ourselves about


---------15:44----------
how bad it is and also let's not delude


---------15:47----------
ourselves about like the limits of its


---------15:49----------
badness because just because you had one


---------15:52----------
miscarriage doesn't mean that you're


---------15:54----------
ever able to have children and I've


---------15:55----------
worked with people like that too we've


---------15:57----------
had miscarriage after miscarriage after


---------15:58----------
miscarriage and that too like you've got


---------16:00----------
agree right you've got to grieve for the


---------16:02----------
life of never being able to have your


---------16:04----------
own child but that doesn't mean that


---------16:06----------
life is over either because some of


---------16:09----------
those people end up adopting some of


---------16:11----------
those people we talked about surprises


---------16:12----------
right and most of twitch chat is a


---------16:14----------
surprise some of those people end up


---------16:16----------
having surprises later in life because


---------16:18----------
they stop using birth control and then


---------16:20----------
like the human body and reproductive


---------16:22----------
organs are weird and when you stop when


---------16:24----------
you stop getting stressed out then


---------16:25----------
you're able to have babies and like


---------16:27----------
sometimes like with at the age of 38 you


---------16:29----------
get pregnant they're like well [ __ ] okay


---------16:31----------
where did this come from and it's all


---------16:34----------
part of life it's all part of your


---------16:36----------
roguelike


---------16:38----------
it's all part of your rug life you just


---------16:39----------
don't know you wanted that fireball


---------16:41----------
spell and you've gotten through six


---------16:43----------
levels of the dungeon and there's no


---------16:44----------
fireball spell and you've decided that


---------16:46----------
you're just gonna pump up your like


---------16:48----------
barbarian stats and so you're double


---------16:50----------
wielding two-handed axes you've got a


---------16:52----------
bunch of strength and con and on level


---------16:54----------
seven you find your fireball spell and


---------16:56----------
you're like that's amazing


---------17:01----------
right like that's that's what you've got


---------17:04----------
to do you've gotta agree that you're not


---------17:05----------
gonna be an eSports professional but


---------17:07----------
that's okay because eSports is such an


---------17:11----------
evolving industry where most of the


---------17:13----------
people now in eSports don't play the


---------17:15----------
game


---------17:17----------
think about that for a second you have


---------17:19----------
teams right and teams have players but


---------17:23----------
they also have coaches they have


---------17:25----------
managers they have advertising people


---------17:27----------
they have PR people they have like


---------17:29----------
financial people


---------17:31----------
they have CEOs CFOs they have all kinds


---------17:36----------
they have chefs they have psychologists


---------17:40----------
so you can still get involved in eSports


---------17:42----------
like that's just your Dharma so if you


---------17:46----------
want to get involved in eSports get


---------17:47----------
involved in eSports and now we come to


---------17:50----------
our second don't write a page about this


---------17:53----------
but for that person what's missing in


---------17:55----------
eSports


---------17:57----------
that's the page you need to write what's


---------18:00----------
missing in eSports and then when you so


---------18:03----------
let your creative mind do that


---------18:07----------
then what you need to do is like think


---------18:10----------
about what your skill sets are and what


---------18:12----------
your cents are and what can you do about


---------18:14----------
it


---------18:14----------
right that's the second page
