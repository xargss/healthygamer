---------00:00----------
let's get started as a kid i was


---------00:02----------
obsessed with perfectionism for a while


---------00:05----------
i tried to eat perfectly spend all my


---------00:07----------
time studying avoid wasting any time on


---------00:09----------
fun and games


---------00:10----------
i initially did this because i felt


---------00:12----------
lonely and unloved as a kid and i wanted


---------00:14----------
people to seem


---------00:15----------
to like me for something this kind of


---------00:17----------
paid off for a while when i got into


---------00:18----------
middle school i was deemed gifted


---------00:21----------
praised by all my classmates for being


---------00:23----------
smart


---------00:24----------
i tried desperately to maintain this but


---------00:26----------
of course burned out within a year


---------00:28----------
as i've been setting higher and higher


---------00:29----------
expectations of intelligence for myself


---------00:31----------
i've become more and more afraid of


---------00:33----------
falling short


---------00:34----------
i feel like if i try my best at


---------00:36----------
something and fail i'll hate myself


---------00:38----------
and i'm afraid of that so i don't really


---------00:42----------
put much


---------00:42----------
effort into anything anymore my mind is


---------00:45----------
now hardwired to do things perfectly or


---------00:47----------
not at all


---------00:48----------
if i'm not in the perfect mood to go to


---------00:50----------
the gym i don't go


---------00:53----------
if i can't do an assignment perfectly


---------00:55----------
and in the right mood i don't do it i


---------00:58----------
can't perform perfectly in a game


---------00:59----------
i don't enjoy it i cope with these


---------01:01----------
feelings by telling myself that i could


---------01:03----------
accomplish anything if i tried but i


---------01:05----------
never actually do


---------01:06----------
i also spend a lot of time maladaptive


---------01:09----------
daydreaming


---------01:10----------
to distract myself from feelings of


---------01:13----------
inadequacy


---------01:15----------
i just don't know what to do about any


---------01:17----------
of this i'm in college now and i feel


---------01:19----------
like i'm mentally deficient because


---------01:21----------
all of the time i've struggled with


---------01:23----------
perfectionism


---------01:25----------
i have almost no motivation for anything


---------01:27----------
in life besides basic pleasures i didn't


---------01:29----------
even solve


---------01:30----------
my initial issue of loneliness i feel


---------01:32----------
like i'm an incomplete version of normal


---------01:34----------
people who are actually competent have


---------01:36----------
proper support systems


---------01:37----------
and know what they want in life all


---------01:40----------
right so


---------01:41----------
i know this sounds kind of weird so this


---------01:42----------
post was made 12 hours ago


---------01:45----------
um i already responded to it actually


---------01:49----------
so i first of all i just want to thank


---------01:51----------
people in the community who respond on


---------01:52----------
our subreddit because i think that


---------01:54----------
you know i can't get to everyone and i


---------01:56----------
really appreciate that some of y'all


---------01:57----------
like actually know our content


---------01:59----------
better than i do um so i'm really


---------02:02----------
grateful when people go out of their way


---------02:04----------
to like respond to these kinds of posts


---------02:06----------
try to support these people because


---------02:08----------
y'all can do it too that's the whole


---------02:09----------
point


---------02:09----------
so this is where the other thing that i


---------02:11----------
i kind of want to do for a second


---------02:13----------
is actually show you guys


---------02:16----------
so the reason that we made dr k's guides


---------02:19----------
is because this is a common problem


---------02:20----------
right so like people face this thing


---------02:22----------
and the challenge with with


---------02:24----------
perfectionism is that


---------02:25----------
it's not like a psychiatric diagnosis


---------02:27----------
like you you know you can sort of walk


---------02:29----------
into a therapist's office and you can


---------02:30----------
say


---------02:31----------
you know i'm perfectionistic but there


---------02:34----------
isn't like a particular playbook


---------02:36----------
to deal with perfectionism it's not


---------02:38----------
something that we're sort of trained


---------02:39----------
to deal with in an explicit way so there


---------02:42----------
are a lot of elements here which i think


---------02:43----------
we see which um


---------02:45----------
you know if you guys haven't watched


---------02:47----------
this this is a good video i think this


---------02:49----------
is


---------02:50----------
you know early on this is one of our


---------02:51----------
first uploads and i think it's gotten


---------02:53----------
you know three quarters of a million


---------02:55----------
views and


---------02:57----------
we hear a lot of good feedback on this


---------02:59----------
video because this


---------03:00----------
how intelligence leads to avoidance is


---------03:02----------
like a big part of this story


---------03:04----------
but there are other elements too and so


---------03:07----------
we actually have


---------03:08----------
um in dr k's guides in the guide on


---------03:10----------
depression


---------03:12----------
there's actually a particular video


---------03:14----------
called falling behind that talks about


---------03:16----------
this sort of stuff and so what i'm


---------03:18----------
tempted to do


---------03:19----------
is actually just share a piece of this


---------03:23----------
video with y'all right now


---------03:25----------
one source of feeling depressed is the


---------03:27----------
persistent feeling of falling behind


---------03:29----------
and i see this way too often that people


---------03:32----------
are kind of feeling like


---------03:33----------
they've fallen behind and everyone else


---------03:35----------
is kind of moving on with their life


---------03:37----------
and here i am kind of stuck unable to


---------03:40----------
kind of catch up


---------03:42----------
and so in order to understand and


---------03:44----------
overcome the sense of


---------03:46----------
falling behind we're going to start by


---------03:48----------
sort of exploring where it comes from


---------03:51----------
then we're going to look at how it


---------03:52----------
manifests in the mind


---------03:54----------
then we're going to take a look at what


---------03:55----------
our mind normally tries to do to fix it


---------03:58----------
and finally we'll show you guys a


---------04:00----------
different way to kind of overcome this


---------04:02----------
sensation


---------04:04----------
so to begin with the sense of falling


---------04:06----------
behind starts with something that i


---------04:08----------
usually call the


---------04:09----------
problem of escalating impossibility so


---------04:12----------
this is best illustrated if you think


---------04:14----------
about procrastinating before a test


---------04:16----------
so let's say that i have a test that's a


---------04:18----------
month away and


---------04:20----------
i kind of look at my syllabus and i say


---------04:22----------
okay i need to study one hour a day for


---------04:24----------
the rest of the month and i'll be fine


---------04:26----------
one hour a day for one month and i'm


---------04:27----------
going to get an a on the test no problem


---------04:30----------
and so is that what we actually do


---------04:33----------
absolutely not


---------04:34----------
right a couple days go by we're


---------04:35----------
definitely not going to study because


---------04:36----------
our mind is we're going to watch a clip


---------04:38----------
plenty of time we just need to study one


---------04:40----------
hour a day we have 27 days left


---------04:42----------
no big deal we're good and then a week


---------04:45----------
goes by


---------04:46----------
and now you start to have this little


---------04:48----------
thought in the back of your mind hey


---------04:49----------
maybe i should start studying like


---------04:50----------
actually a week has gone by and i


---------04:52----------
haven't even cracked the books like not


---------04:53----------
even once


---------04:54----------
i'm gonna have to study about maybe 1.5


---------04:56----------
hours a day but that's still super


---------04:58----------
manageable i can do that every single


---------04:59----------
day


---------05:00----------
and then as that that thought kind of


---------05:01----------
crawls up in the back of your mind you


---------05:03----------
actually try to push it away right


---------05:05----------
so we start to distract ourselves by


---------05:06----------
maybe playing video games or watching tv


---------05:08----------
or whatever


---------05:09----------
in the back your mind your thought is


---------05:11----------
there as you watch each episode binge


---------05:12----------
watching oh maybe i should start


---------05:14----------
studying now


---------05:14----------
maybe i should start studying now but


---------05:17----------
instead you're like no no no let's just


---------05:18----------
keep watching just don't worry about it


---------05:19----------
we'll be fine we have plenty of time


---------05:21----------
and then two weeks roll by and now we've


---------05:24----------
got a couple of weeks left and now the


---------05:26----------
panic


---------05:26----------
just starts to set in just a tiny amount


---------05:29----------
i've wasted two weeks


---------05:31----------
but i've still got two weeks left and i


---------05:33----------
can still do it


---------05:34----------
two hours a day and i'll be totally fine


---------05:36----------
for the test and then


---------05:38----------
each day that goes by that we don't


---------05:40----------
study


---------05:41----------
the panic grows a little bit and then we


---------05:44----------
get into this vicious cycle because the


---------05:45----------
more the panic grows


---------05:47----------
the harder it becomes to study and then


---------05:50----------
i find myself being like okay i have 10


---------05:52----------
days left


---------05:53----------
it's the weekend oh my god am i going to


---------05:56----------
be able to do it and then what we end up


---------05:58----------
doing is like partying all weekend long


---------05:59----------
because we don't want to think about the


---------06:01----------
test


---------06:02----------
and the more negative emotion we feel


---------06:04----------
the more we have to distract ourselves


---------06:06----------
the more we have to try to forget and


---------06:09----------
every day that goes by it can feel like


---------06:10----------
that


---------06:11----------
that perfect score on the test is


---------06:14----------
getting further and further away


---------06:16----------
and then you have to study five hours a


---------06:18----------
day and then you have to study eight


---------06:19----------
hours a day


---------06:20----------
and at some point it starts to feel


---------06:22----------
impossible and at some point you kind of


---------06:24----------
feel this gigantic mishmash of


---------06:28----------
regret for not starting earlier last


---------06:30----------
minute


---------06:31----------
last minute panic to kind of push you


---------06:34----------
forward and actually start studying


---------06:36----------
finally and also like kicking yourself


---------06:39----------
because oh man this would have been so


---------06:40----------
easy if i had started earlier


---------06:42----------
and so in this jumble of emotions we


---------06:44----------
kind of it's like all of these emotions


---------06:46----------
that we're feeling


---------06:47----------
we show up and we we take the test and


---------06:50----------
we try to forget about it immediately


---------06:51----------
right we go and we distract ourselves we


---------06:53----------
go party oh my god it's


---------06:55----------
thank god it's over so the question


---------06:57----------
becomes


---------06:58----------
where did all of that emotional energy


---------07:00----------
that was building up over


---------07:02----------
the course of the month where did it go


---------07:04----------
because you feel that instant relief


---------07:06----------
it's over it's in the past


---------07:07----------
push it out of my mind as hard as i can


---------07:10----------
the problem is that each time we do that


---------07:13----------
that sense kind of


---------07:15----------
that emotional energy sort of gets


---------07:17----------
buried in our mind as a some scott


---------07:19----------
and we sort of have this sense that i'm


---------07:21----------
someone


---------07:23----------
okay chat we're gonna just jump forward


---------07:24----------
okay so that's the general premise


---------07:27----------
there's some stuff in the middle i'm the


---------07:29----------
more insignificant


---------07:30----------
any step i need seen in a long time and


---------07:33----------
so we were at this christmas party i was


---------07:35----------
26 or 27


---------07:37----------
and then she asked me i'll look what are


---------07:38----------
you up to and i was like yeah


---------07:40----------
school and look how far she's come and i


---------07:43----------
haven't even like i haven't even gotten


---------07:45----------
in i don't even know if i'm going to get


---------07:46----------
into medical school and she's


---------07:47----------
already done with it and it can feel so


---------07:51----------
shaming to be in that situation and when


---------07:54----------
i think about


---------07:54----------
like what my mind tells me in that


---------07:56----------
moment it tells me man do you have a lot


---------07:58----------
of catching up to do


---------08:00----------
and this is the tricky thing is that the


---------08:01----------
more that i have to catch up


---------08:03----------
the bigger the mountain that i need to


---------08:05----------
climb the more


---------08:07----------
insignificant any step i need to take is


---------08:10----------
and this is the real problem with


---------08:12----------
catching up which is that catching up


---------08:14----------
is an action that's wrapped in an


---------08:16----------
expectation


---------08:17----------
and what i mean by that is that the


---------08:19----------
actions that i have to take


---------08:21----------
irrespective of whether i'm behind or


---------08:23----------
not that's just all a mental


---------08:24----------
construction


---------08:25----------
the actions that i have to take are


---------08:26----------
actually exactly the same


---------08:28----------
whether i'm trying to lose a bunch of


---------08:30----------
weight if i'm trying to lose 100 pounds


---------08:32----------
or 50 pounds or 20 pounds


---------08:34----------
the action is still the same it's still


---------08:36----------
to go to the gym the problem is that if


---------08:38----------
i'm trying to lose 100 pounds and i go


---------08:40----------
to the gym


---------08:41----------
then it feels like i haven't really


---------08:43----------
taken a step forward


---------08:44----------
and so as i try to catch up the more my


---------08:46----------
mind tells me you need to catch up you


---------08:48----------
need to catch up you need to catch up


---------08:50----------
the harder it is to actually take one


---------08:52----------
step forward


---------08:54----------
so bizarrely what we need to do in order


---------08:57----------
to move forward


---------08:58----------
is to let go of catching up and


---------09:01----------
if we want to move forward from falling


---------09:03----------
behind what we really need to do is let


---------09:05----------
go of catching up


---------09:06----------
and this idea that you've fallen behind


---------09:08----------
because it doesn't matter i mean


---------09:10----------
behind is a mental construction catching


---------09:12----------
up is a mental construction


---------09:13----------
if you want to get into shape you have


---------09:14----------
to go to the gym that's the only way


---------09:16----------
forward


---------09:17----------
your way forward is exactly the same in


---------09:19----------
this complex


---------09:20----------
of falling behind and catching up is


---------09:23----------
just layered on top of your mind


---------09:25----------
and makes every action way more hard


---------09:28----------
so then that begs the question why is it


---------09:29----------
so damn hard to let go of catching up


---------09:32----------
why is it so damn hard to let go of


---------09:34----------
falling behind


---------09:36----------
and this is where the redemption arc


---------09:37----------
comes in because we've been raised on a


---------09:40----------
culture


---------09:40----------
of triumph that the hero at 45 minutes


---------09:43----------
into the movie


---------09:44----------
is you know everything is stacked


---------09:46----------
against him and that's when you dig deep


---------09:48----------
and you really win and you become an


---------09:50----------
amazing person so i remember after that


---------09:52----------
christmas party


---------09:53----------
you know i went home and i was like


---------09:55----------
laying in bed and i was thinking the


---------09:57----------
only way that i can catch up


---------09:58----------
is i have to go to harvard because she


---------10:00----------
didn't go to harvard and if i go to


---------10:02----------
harvard i'm going to do better than her


---------10:03----------
i'll be better than her


---------10:04----------
i can actually catch up the more far


---------10:07----------
behind i fall


---------10:08----------
the more i have to become awesome and


---------10:11----------
magnificent


---------10:12----------
if i've dropped out of a collet if i've


---------10:13----------
dropped out of college i have to start


---------10:15----------
a billion dollar tech startup to make up


---------10:18----------
for it


---------10:18----------
and in that moment what our mind is


---------10:20----------
trying to do is we have all of this


---------10:22----------
dormant


---------10:23----------
emotional energy all of these times that


---------10:25----------
we've told ourselves


---------10:26----------
you can do better you should have


---------10:28----------
started studying earlier why are you so


---------10:29----------
dumb why didn't you start why didn't you


---------10:31----------
start why didn't you start


---------10:32----------
all that emotion emotional energy is


---------10:35----------
sitting down there


---------10:36----------
and so what our mind has to do is i need


---------10:37----------
a triumph i need a victory


---------10:39----------
i need something that can make me feel


---------10:41----------
so good about myself


---------10:43----------
that it's stronger than all of that


---------10:45----------
toxicity


---------10:46----------
of me being a person who's fallen behind


---------10:49----------
and that's the real problem is because


---------10:50----------
if i tell you to stop catching up


---------10:52----------
if i tell you to let go of catching up


---------10:54----------
what are you letting go of


---------10:56----------
is that fantasy of that triumph you


---------10:59----------
become in your


---------11:00----------
mind the hero who just quits at 45


---------11:02----------
minutes


---------11:03----------
right instead of triumphing over


---------11:06----------
everything and being the victor


---------11:07----------
i'm suddenly just a guy who is 26 years


---------11:10----------
old and applying to medical school


---------11:12----------
so the desire to catch up is actually


---------11:15----------
what keeps us stuck


---------11:17----------
and if you really want to move forward


---------11:18----------
you have to let that go


---------11:20----------
you have to let go of the entire


---------11:21----------
construction right because what does it


---------11:23----------
mean to have fallen behind it's a


---------11:25----------
construct of the mind


---------11:26----------
what does it mean to catch up it's a


---------11:28----------
construct of the mind what does it mean


---------11:30----------
to have triumph in redemption


---------11:32----------
it's all thoughts in my head if i meet


---------11:33----------
that my friend you know next year at the


---------11:35----------
christmas party


---------11:36----------
it's just a conversation i'm gonna have


---------11:38----------
if i'm in medical school i'm in medical


---------11:39----------
school if i've caught up


---------11:40----------
i've caught up if i haven't whatever


---------11:42----------
it's just it's all the same if i'm a


---------11:43----------
medical student i'm a medical student


---------11:45----------
reality is one thing and we just layer a


---------11:48----------
construct on top of it


---------11:49----------
so the way to move forward is to let go


---------11:53----------
of catching up


---------11:54----------
the way to move forward is to recognize


---------11:56----------
that action can only be taken in the


---------11:58----------
present


---------11:58----------
and moving forward may never let me


---------12:01----------
catch up but i don't need to catch up


---------12:03----------
all i really need to do to become


---------12:05----------
unstuck is to move


---------12:06----------
forward and so the problem of falling


---------12:09----------
behind


---------12:10----------
this some scatter falling behind is


---------12:12----------
something that people struggle with a


---------12:13----------
lot


---------12:14----------
and my hope is that by understanding how


---------12:17----------
it's born


---------12:18----------
how it's how it manifests how our mind


---------12:21----------
tries to deal with it


---------12:22----------
we can actually take a slightly


---------12:24----------
different approach


---------12:25----------
we can unplug that entire mental


---------12:28----------
construction


---------12:29----------
and start to actually do something that


---------12:31----------
moves our


---------12:32----------
our life in the right direction so let's


---------12:35----------
talk about this for a second


---------12:36----------
so like this is like literally why we


---------12:37----------
made dr k's guides like literally


---------12:40----------
it's because like these problems that


---------12:41----------
people face right like these things that


---------12:43----------
people post 12 hours ago it


---------12:45----------
really wasn't a plan like and you guys


---------12:47----------
know like this is what we deal with


---------12:49----------
and the the issue is that there are


---------12:51----------
actually things that can be done about


---------12:53----------
this so let's kind of unpack this


---------12:55----------
and the reason that i showed it is


---------12:56----------
because frankly any explanation that i


---------12:59----------
give here is


---------13:00----------
not going to be as clean and as polished


---------13:02----------
as like what's in the guide because


---------13:03----------
you know we wrote out a script and we


---------13:05----------
did takes and all that good stuff


---------13:07----------
but here's here are a couple of elements


---------13:09----------
to it okay


---------13:10----------
these are the the guides that are being


---------13:12----------
released in like


---------13:14----------
six weeks or something so here's the


---------13:17----------
thing so someone says okay i'm


---------13:18----------
perfectionistic like why are they


---------13:20----------
perfectionistic


---------13:21----------
so they have the element of you know


---------13:23----------
being gifted at the beginning right


---------13:25----------
which is the whole intelligence leads to


---------13:26----------
avoidance things so check out that


---------13:28----------
youtube video


---------13:29----------
but then here's the big problem with


---------13:30----------
being perfectionistic


---------13:32----------
as i fall behind i have in my mind a


---------13:35----------
mental anchor of where i should be


---------13:38----------
and then the challenge is that if i take


---------13:41----------
a step


---------13:41----------
towards where i should be so like let's


---------13:44----------
say like i'm 100 pounds overweight


---------13:46----------
if i lose two pounds and i


---------13:50----------
set a mental anchor that i need to lose


---------13:52----------
a hundred it feels like i haven't made


---------13:54----------
any progress


---------13:55----------
like if if i feel kind of insecure about


---------13:57----------
myself if i feel like i've fallen behind


---------13:59----------
i lose two pounds of weight and then


---------14:01----------
instead of being inspired by that my


---------14:02----------
body actually does the


---------14:04----------
my my mind does the opposite it says


---------14:05----------
like this is never gonna be enough


---------14:08----------
as long as i strive for perfection as


---------14:10----------
long as i anchor myself to some


---------14:12----------
artificial goal


---------14:13----------
anything that i do is never going to be


---------14:16----------
enough


---------14:17----------
but if i let go of that that


---------14:19----------
perfectionism if i let go of that then


---------14:21----------
like


---------14:22----------
losing two pounds like in order to lose


---------14:23----------
100 pounds i have to lose two pounds


---------14:27----------
absolutely if my goal is to lose a


---------14:29----------
hundred pounds it has to start by losing


---------14:31----------
two i can't lose


---------14:32----------
all 100 all at once but the problem


---------14:35----------
is that when we have this idea of


---------14:36----------
perfectionism we set up this goal for


---------14:39----------
ourselves of what we want to be


---------14:42----------
and as we like move towards that goal


---------14:44----------
instead of like actually be


---------14:45----------
getting positive reinforcement by taking


---------14:47----------
one step forward


---------14:48----------
the more we strive for perfectionism the


---------14:51----------
harder it is to actually take like one


---------14:53----------
step forward because


---------14:55----------
anything that you do on the journey is


---------14:57----------
going to be insufficient


---------14:59----------
won't be perfectionistic so then you end


---------15:01----------
up staying stuck


---------15:03----------
right so like i'm not going to try


---------15:04----------
anything until i can be perfect


---------15:07----------
which in turn means that i'm paralyzed


---------15:09----------
because i can never try anything


---------15:11----------
because the first time i try something


---------15:12----------
i'm never going to be perfect


---------15:14----------
and so this this is a huge problem so


---------15:17----------
how do you let go of that right it's


---------15:19----------
about sort of like


---------15:20----------
understanding where did this idea of


---------15:22----------
perfectionism come from because it is a


---------15:23----------
construct of the mind


---------15:25----------
there's no such thing as a perfect


---------15:27----------
anything


---------15:28----------
like you look around there's no such


---------15:29----------
thing as a perfect like walk outside


---------15:31----------
like i'm you know i'm in a place where


---------15:32----------
there are plants outside so if you look


---------15:33----------
outside


---------15:34----------
there's no such thing as a perfect plant


---------15:36----------
perfection is a construct of the human


---------15:38----------
mind it cannot be found in nature in


---------15:40----------
nature the only thing that is is just


---------15:41----------
like what is there's no such thing as a


---------15:42----------
perfect rock


---------15:43----------
there's no such thing as a perfect orbit


---------15:45----------
there's no such thing as like a perfect


---------15:47----------
anything right it's a human construct


---------15:50----------
even geometric perfection is like that's


---------15:52----------
a that's a human that says that this is


---------15:54----------
geometric perfection


---------15:57----------
right we're the ones who apply the


---------15:58----------
standard of perfection it's not a real


---------16:00----------
thing


---------16:01----------
and so like the more that we chase that


---------16:02----------
idea of perfection


---------16:04----------
the more it actually paralyzes us


---------16:05----------
because anything so this is what i would


---------16:07----------
the


---------16:08----------
key point that i want y'all to


---------16:09----------
understand if you hold on to


---------16:11----------
perfectionism


---------16:12----------
it is actually does not reinforce


---------16:15----------
progress


---------16:16----------
progress and perfectionism are at two


---------16:18----------
ends of the spectrum


---------16:20----------
and because if i like if i want to


---------16:22----------
iterate if i want to try if i want to


---------16:23----------
get better if i want to progress


---------16:25----------
progress is not about the end it's about


---------16:27----------
the beginning or the next step


---------16:29----------
and so the more i hold on to


---------16:30----------
perfectionism the harder it is to


---------16:32----------
progress


---------16:33----------
i won't let myself progress and so


---------16:35----------
that's that's the huge scam about this


---------16:37----------
kind of thinking


---------16:39----------
and y'all are right that like you know


---------16:41----------
it's hard right because if you let go of


---------16:43----------
your perfectionism like what are you


---------16:45----------
left with


---------16:46----------
because the reason that you need the


---------16:47----------
perfectionism is because you have to


---------16:49----------
make up for like all the stuff that you


---------16:50----------
didn't do right


---------16:52----------
we look at this case you know like


---------16:56----------
my mind is now hardwired to do things


---------16:58----------
perfectly or not at all


---------17:00----------
if i'm not in the perfect mood to the


---------17:02----------
gym i don't go


---------17:04----------
right so like this is the problem so


---------17:05----------
then then like where did this come from


---------17:08----------
and so this this this is a result of


---------17:11----------
this right here


---------17:12----------
as i begin setting higher and higher


---------17:14----------
expectations of intelligence for myself


---------17:16----------
i become more and more afraid of falling


---------17:18----------
short and you can't like


---------17:20----------
there's no such thing as falling short


---------17:21----------
falling short is all about


---------17:23----------
not living up to an expectation in your


---------17:25----------
mind if i lose two pounds at the gym i


---------17:27----------
lose two pounds of the gym if i do 10


---------17:29----------
push-ups i do 10 push-ups if i do 20


---------17:30----------
push-ups i do 20 push-ups


---------17:32----------
the action plus the x and the


---------17:34----------
expectation need to be separated


---------17:36----------
so if you're stuck in perfectionism what


---------17:39----------
you need to do is separate the action


---------17:41----------
from the expectation


---------17:43----------
recognize that like everything in your


---------17:45----------
head is just some


---------17:46----------
psychological construct it's not like a


---------17:48----------
real thing


---------17:49----------
and as you separate out the expectation


---------17:53----------
from the action


---------17:54----------
then you'll be able to act practically


---------17:56----------
what that looks like is like


---------17:58----------
you know really exploring you know what


---------18:00----------
makes it hard for you to go to the gym


---------18:03----------
and not be perfect


---------18:04----------
because with the thought of going to the


---------18:07----------
gym and not being perfect like what does


---------18:09----------
that


---------18:09----------
evoke in your mind what's like the


---------18:12----------
emotion that comes up when you think


---------18:14----------
about doing that


---------18:15----------
because chances are it'll be something


---------18:16----------
like shame it'll be something like


---------18:19----------
dissatisfaction it'll be it feels like


---------18:20----------
it's not enough it feels like it's not


---------18:22----------
enough


---------18:22----------
and then i encourage you to like look at


---------18:24----------
that for a second


---------18:26----------
what you're experiencing there is not


---------18:29----------
truth


---------18:30----------
it's an emotion right so like as you


---------18:33----------
experience the emotion recognize that


---------18:35----------
that's just an emotion


---------18:37----------
and this kind of reminds me like this is


---------18:39----------
a lesson that i learned when i was


---------18:40----------
talking to someone who was responsible


---------18:42----------
for security


---------18:43----------
at a college campus and so like


---------18:46----------
we i was dealing with someone in the


---------18:47----------
emergency room who had been through a


---------18:49----------
traumatic experience and i talked to the


---------18:51----------
security officer


---------18:52----------
at the university and then they the


---------18:54----------
university officer said that


---------18:56----------
you know so i mentioned them that this


---------18:58----------
person doesn't feel safe and then the


---------18:59----------
university person said


---------19:00----------
it's my job to make campus safe


---------19:03----------
not to make people feel safe i can't


---------19:06----------
like control the pa


---------19:07----------
the way that people feel what i can


---------19:09----------
control is actually creating an


---------19:11----------
environment that is like safe for them


---------19:12----------
to be in


---------19:14----------
and it was like a shocking thing to say


---------19:16----------
because it sounded


---------19:17----------
so like cold and callous on the one hand


---------19:20----------
right like


---------19:21----------
and the security guy's like yeah i don't


---------19:22----------
care if people feel safe


---------19:24----------
you know that's sort of what it sounded


---------19:25----------
like but i mean he didn't say that


---------19:28----------
he wasn't saying that he didn't care he


---------19:29----------
said that his real responsibility is to


---------19:30----------
create


---------19:31----------
a safe environment and sometimes even in


---------19:34----------
a safe environment people feel


---------19:36----------
unsafe so what are we actually like what


---------19:39----------
are we


---------19:39----------
what are we going off of here like what


---------19:41----------
is our compass


---------19:42----------
are we gonna let our feelings of


---------19:44----------
inadequacy


---------19:46----------
dictate what we actually do


---------19:49----------
because as you tunnel down into


---------19:51----------
perfectionism


---------19:53----------
what you'll discover is like what's


---------19:55----------
actually holding you back like what's


---------19:56----------
what's dictating your life is an emotion


---------19:59----------
and so like the emotion is like i'm not


---------20:01----------
saying that we shouldn't be


---------20:03----------
compassionate towards the emotion


---------20:04----------
the emotion can be valid but at the end


---------20:06----------
of the day it's an emotion


---------20:08----------
and this is the really tricky thing


---------20:10----------
about emotions is that the more


---------20:12----------
strong your emotion is the more you


---------20:14----------
think it is reality


---------20:16----------
when in actuality the less likely it is


---------20:19----------
to be


---------20:20----------
real right so as i become angry


---------20:23----------
my just my perception of reality becomes


---------20:26----------
more distorted


---------20:28----------
the more angry i feel but if you talk to


---------20:30----------
someone who's angry


---------20:32----------
they are going to think that their mind


---------20:34----------
is a hundred percent accurate


---------20:37----------
and so it's a really problematic like


---------20:39----------
conundrum


---------20:40----------
that the more distorted our perceptions


---------20:42----------
are the more convinced we are that our


---------20:43----------
perceptions are correct


---------20:46----------
and so when it comes to perfectionism


---------20:47----------
pay attention to


---------20:49----------
what it is that holds you back from


---------20:51----------
doing something less than perfect


---------20:53----------
because that's where the money is going


---------20:54----------
to be and as you are able to


---------20:56----------
tolerate that negative emotion you will


---------20:58----------
actually become unstuck


---------21:00----------
and yeah i mean that's like just to


---------21:02----------
reiterate like that's


---------21:03----------
this is why we made the guides because


---------21:05----------
like you know this the goal is that like


---------21:07----------
that


---------21:07----------
you know instead of so let's just think


---------21:09----------
about this for a second like instead of


---------21:11----------
like


---------21:11----------
rng right which is okay so


---------21:14----------
someone someone um you know just posting


---------21:17----------
something on reddit it just happens to


---------21:19----------
be the day that we do a community screen


---------21:20----------
like a lot of these answers are in the


---------21:22----------
guides which is why we made them


---------21:24----------
and so the goal is to like actually give


---------21:26----------
you guys you know 70


---------21:29----------
of like what most people need and that's


---------21:32----------
because the last 30


---------21:33----------
tends to be like very individual but you


---------21:35----------
know 70 of it is like


---------21:36----------
i share the same stuff with like 70 of


---------21:39----------
people that i work with


---------21:40----------
so that's what's in there all right


---------21:41----------
moving on to the next one


---------21:44----------
community stream stream speaking of


---------21:46----------
community screen


---------21:48----------
next one okay
