---------00:00----------
so the first answers if you guys have


---------00:01----------
been diagnosed with an actual mental


---------00:03----------
illness or you really think that you're


---------00:05----------
mental like you have true like tried and


---------00:08----------
true depression you should go see a


---------00:11----------
professional alright so like I can tell


---------00:13----------
you guys about this stuff but I


---------00:14----------
ultimately really can I can't treat you


---------00:16----------
over the internet and nothing I say in


---------00:18----------
the next 10 minutes is gonna cure you


---------00:20----------
I'm good


---------00:21----------
but I'm not that good so PTSD is like a


---------00:25----------
real thing and like if you really have


---------00:28----------
it you should go work through it with a


---------00:29----------
professional because while you can


---------00:32----------
overcome a lot of people can overcome


---------00:33----------
parts of mental illness or even overcome


---------00:35----------
mental illness on their own I think


---------00:37----------
that's what's happened in the history of


---------00:38----------
humanity for example like Wims Winston


---------00:40----------
Churchill and like Abraham Lincoln both


---------00:42----------
had really bad depression


---------00:45----------
and they managed to do okay in life so


---------00:48----------
it's possible with the cool thing about


---------00:50----------
the roguelike that you live in is


---------00:53----------
there's a shop and you can just go to


---------00:55----------
the shop and get some mental health


---------00:56----------
treatment so go and get some mental


---------00:58----------
health treatment like that's the first


---------00:59----------
thing you should do like go and like


---------01:02----------
work with an individual human being and


---------01:04----------
this is some Rando on Twitch who's like


---------01:06----------
talking to 115 people at the same time


---------01:09----------
it's like a real person who is dedicated


---------01:12----------
to help you is gonna do way better than


---------01:15----------
I can ever do unless that dedicated


---------01:17----------
person is me and you wind up in my


---------01:19----------
office so go and actually get help so


---------01:23----------
this is another problem that gamers have


---------01:25----------
they don't go and get help you guys


---------01:28----------
watch twitch which I love I'm grateful


---------01:30----------
you're making me successful fantastic


---------01:32----------
and at the same time like go and


---------01:34----------
actually get some help


---------01:38----------
and like go talk to someone and this is


---------01:41----------
where so a lot so someone saying that I


---------01:43----------
don't know you're sounding a lot better


---------01:44----------
than all the shrinks I've had over the


---------01:45----------
decades there's a part of me that's


---------01:47----------
inclined to agree with you because I


---------01:48----------
think that a lot of mental health


---------01:49----------
professionals are operating from a model


---------01:53----------
that's a little bit outdated and this is


---------01:55----------
where I would say if you want to try to


---------01:56----------
find like a mental health professional


---------01:58----------
go see three don't go see one and like


---------02:01----------
because mental health professionals are


---------02:03----------
all about fit like it's not about


---------02:05----------
training


---------02:06----------
it's not about pedigree it's about fit


---------02:08----------
so go and find someone who fits with you


---------02:12----------
but goes because I want you to see three


---------02:14----------
people then pick the one that you like


---------02:16----------
the best it's like if you're going out


---------02:17----------
and buying a car you don't go to a like


---------02:20----------
a car dealership and just like get the


---------02:23----------
first car that they have available right


---------02:25----------
you go and you test drive two or three


---------02:27----------
things and go and meet three people and


---------02:30----------
then try to figure out who like who do I


---------02:33----------
feel like I like and who gets me the


---------02:36----------
other thing to think a little bit about


---------02:37----------
is like see if you can find someone on


---------02:39----------
the younger end so the average like


---------02:42----------
psychiatrist in in America is like 55 so


---------02:46----------
I go so go find someone who's played a


---------02:48----------
video game like start there if you have


---------02:50----------
a problem game because then they're


---------02:52----------
gonna understand you a little bit better


---------02:53----------
and it could help help right I'm not


---------02:56----------
saying that all like the psychoanalysts


---------02:57----------
or that like I mean a lot of them


---------02:59----------
brilliant but like I mean one of them


---------03:01----------
told me that yeah like I was asking her


---------03:03----------
like why do people play video games and


---------03:05----------
her answer is for the same reason they


---------03:06----------
get tattoos and I was like lady you may


---------03:09----------
be brilliant and a professor at the


---------03:11----------
Harvard Medical School but you don't


---------03:13----------
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about


---------03:14----------
so go and find someone


---------03:18----------
that's really what you should do


---------03:19----------
[Music]


---------03:20----------
um but I don't think you guys were


---------03:22----------
looking for that simple of an answer so


---------03:25----------
dealing with in reducing PTSD let's


---------03:27----------
start there so the first thing to


---------03:30----------
understand is that PTSD is actually your


---------03:32----------
body like learning an inappropriate


---------03:34----------
response right so if we think about


---------03:36----------
someone who has like a flashback or let


---------03:39----------
gets triggered by something like if you


---------03:40----------
have so I've done a fair amount of work


---------03:42----------
with veterans and if you have like


---------03:44----------
better like if you have like someone who


---------03:46----------
is like in Afghanistan or Iraq and they


---------03:48----------
like you know got like like a missile


---------03:51----------
was fired at them and then they like


---------03:53----------
they have a trigger every time they hear


---------03:56----------
like a you know muffler expect go bang


---------03:59----------
or a door slam your body is actually


---------04:02----------
like has learned from a survival


---------04:04----------
standpoint that loud sudden sounds mean


---------04:07----------
death and so when you come back to the


---------04:09----------
United States your body can't unlearn


---------04:12----------
that because it's a really important


---------04:13----------
lesson to learn


---------04:16----------
right that's how so PTSD the first thing


---------04:18----------
to understand is that like trauma is


---------04:20----------
your body trying to adapt to a really


---------04:24----------
bad situation and so what you have to


---------04:27----------
teach it how to do is to like unadapted


---------04:29----------
app to a difference situation so this is


---------04:31----------
why people will do things like exposure


---------04:33----------
therapy and stuff like that so a lot of


---------04:35----------
ways to deal with trauma but I think the


---------04:38----------
first thing to understand is that it's


---------04:39----------
an adaptive mechanism which needs to


---------04:41----------
sort of be under that and beyond that


---------04:43----------
like if somebody has trauma and you guys


---------04:45----------
want to like come on stream and talk


---------04:46----------
about it we can do that otherwise it's


---------04:48----------
like really hard for me to I mean it's


---------04:50----------
really hard for me to answer that


---------04:51----------
question in five minutes I could talk


---------04:53----------
about it for an hour about trauma or I


---------04:56----------
could talk to a person but it's hard to


---------04:57----------
give you a substantive answer in like


---------04:59----------
five minutes


---------04:59----------
because it's complicated


---------05:03----------
the second thing is


---------05:05----------
you know how do you overcome depression


---------05:07----------
when you can't get yourself out of bed


---------05:08----------
and the house and feel hopeless every


---------05:10----------
day so like I would really think about


---------05:12----------
getting professional help if that's your


---------05:13----------
situation


---------05:16----------
because gamers don't reach out for help


---------05:17----------
but like sometimes human beings like


---------05:19----------
human beings are communal we're communal


---------05:20----------
creatures like we need help from each


---------05:22----------
other from time to time


---------05:24----------
and if you need it like if you need help


---------05:27----------
like go and get help it's not rocket


---------05:29----------
science like if you're having trouble


---------05:30----------
getting out of bed everyday like go and


---------05:32----------
see a professional this is one I would


---------05:34----------
think about something like medication


---------05:36----------
because I think you can overcome a lot


---------05:38----------
of depression with like meditation and


---------05:40----------
yoga and diet but like all of that stuff


---------05:44----------
requires you to get out of bed alright


---------05:47----------
so I recently had someone in my practice


---------05:48----------
who didn't want to start medication and


---------05:50----------
they wanted to do yoga and stuff and


---------05:52----------
that's great so I asked him like how


---------05:53----------
many times a week were you able to do


---------05:55----------
yoga and they're saying once a week but


---------05:57----------
like once a week is not going to cure


---------05:58----------
your depression like it's just not going


---------05:59----------
to work the dose is not high enough so I


---------06:02----------
recommended a start medication now


---------06:03----------
they're doing yoga everyday the six


---------06:05----------
months from now we're gonna try it


---------06:06----------
stopping the medication if they stick


---------06:09----------
with the yoga and if they stick with the


---------06:10----------
meditation then we'll see what happens


---------06:14----------
right so if you're really having trouble


---------06:17----------
getting out of bed then you should


---------06:20----------
really the best advice is to see a


---------06:21----------
professional but I've got two other


---------06:23----------
points for you the first is think about


---------06:24----------
your diet so there is a lot of there's a


---------06:29----------
lot of recent research which shows that


---------06:32----------
diet is very impactful depression


---------06:34----------
Ayurveda has been saying this for


---------06:35----------
thousands of years so first-line


---------06:37----------
treatment for depression and I revived


---------06:39----------
as dietary change change their diet


---------06:41----------
change the diet change the mind


---------06:44----------
and what that practically means is like


---------06:49----------
how can I say so there was a recent


---------06:51----------
study where they took happy mice they


---------06:55----------
took depressed mice


---------06:57----------
they took the stool from depressed mice


---------07:01----------
and did a stool transplant on the happy


---------07:03----------
mice and the happy mice became depressed


---------07:08----------
crazy right so stool transplant is a


---------07:11----------
whole yeah ice-candy be depressed


---------07:13----------
absolutely


---------07:15----------
so


---------07:17----------
fascinating literature which suggests


---------07:20----------
that like and we're starting to seize


---------07:21----------
there also studies that show that people


---------07:23----------
who have depression have certain kinds


---------07:25----------
of bacteria in their gut at a way higher


---------07:27----------
level than people who don't have


---------07:29----------
depression and so I think the way the


---------07:32----------
reason that I our vet has been curing


---------07:33----------
depression with diet for thousands of


---------07:35----------
years is because when you change your


---------07:38----------
diet you change your gut bacteria and


---------07:39----------
that's somehow a check affects your


---------07:41----------
mental health


---------07:43----------
so if you guys are depressed I'd think a


---------07:46----------
little bit about what you're eating like


---------07:48----------
how many processed foods are you eating


---------07:49----------
are you getting your fruits and veggies


---------07:51----------
of the day you know cuz all that is


---------07:54----------
gonna affect in people who like eat


---------07:55----------
healthy you guys know like when you


---------07:57----------
start eating healthy you start feeling


---------07:59----------
better so if you're depressed I'd start


---------08:01----------
with some basic things like are you


---------08:03----------
drinking water let's start there


---------08:05----------
sure go see a professional but at home


---------08:08----------
start by drinking water


---------08:12----------
you have soda don't drink soda


---------08:16----------
yes so like caffeinated stuff is just


---------08:19----------
gonna throw you out of whack it's gonna


---------08:20----------
give you an artificial energy boost and


---------08:22----------
then you're gonna crash start by


---------08:24----------
drinking water in terms of fruits and


---------08:27----------
vegetables been in every morning and


---------08:28----------
pineapple there's literally I'm gonna


---------08:32----------
find this paper for you because you guys


---------08:33----------
are gonna you mind has been


---------08:35----------
[Music]


---------08:39----------
crap


---------08:42----------
can't find it too good to pass up


---------08:45----------
I'm gonna do something really boring on


---------08:48----------
stream


---------08:50----------
[Music]


---------08:53----------
find it


---------08:57----------
crap


---------08:59----------
I saw a paper about pineapple and


---------09:01----------
depression I think I had


---------09:04----------
we just look


---------09:07----------
we want to find this paper fruits


---------09:14----------
you


---------09:26----------
you


---------09:29----------
let me look


---------09:32----------
you


---------09:34----------
here we go found it


---------09:37----------
[Music]


---------09:41----------
you


---------09:43----------
the box


---------09:47----------
so the papers called so I'm going to


---------09:51----------
just read from


---------09:55----------
z-pak


---------09:59----------
so this is the journal so a lot of this


---------10:02----------
stuff is not published in the US doesn't


---------10:06----------
a pineapple a date ruin your stomach


---------10:08----------
like if you eat too much sure you can


---------10:09----------
ruin it but I'm going to read you guys


---------10:12----------
[Music]


---------10:14----------
so


---------10:22----------
there are no reports and literature


---------10:24----------
pertaining to CNS actions of an


---------10:26----------
anonymous cosmoses fruit in light of the


---------10:29----------
above the present study was undertaken


---------10:30----------
to test the antidepressant potential of


---------10:33----------
pineapples


---------10:35----------
so they juiced pineapples and


---------10:38----------
administered at various concentrations


---------10:40----------
range ranging from 5 to 20%


---------10:44----------
two mice and then they measure their


---------10:48----------
depressive activity and what they found


---------10:51----------
is that the pineapple juice in mice


---------10:53----------
reduced depression to the same amount as


---------10:55----------
fluoxetine right so it's not like a


---------10:58----------
clinical study in human beings do you


---------11:00----------
got to take that with a grain of salt


---------11:02----------
what they basically the way they test


---------11:05----------
depression and mice is they like


---------11:08----------
um so this is fascinate this is gonna be


---------11:12----------
fun so the antidepressant activity was


---------11:16----------
measured using the forced swim test tail


---------11:18----------
suspension test and reserving induced


---------11:21----------
hypothermia the efficacy of pineapple


---------11:24----------
juice was compared with standard


---------11:25----------
antidepressant agents viz fluoxetine in


---------11:28----------
in VIP Ramin the results showed that


---------11:30----------
pineapple juice significantly decreased


---------11:33----------
in mobility time in both for swim tests


---------11:35----------
and TST models it also reversed the


---------11:38----------
hypothermia induced by recipe so what


---------11:41----------
they do is they like they like force


---------11:44----------
rats device to swim


---------11:47----------
and they like depress mice give up and


---------11:49----------
they stop swimming and then like


---------11:51----------
undepressed mice will keep fighting


---------11:53----------
right and if we think about like this


---------11:57----------
person who's hopeless and can't get out


---------11:58----------
of bed like they're not fighting they


---------12:00----------
like give up and they feel hopeless


---------12:03----------
anyway so I don't know that so there


---------12:05----------
have been no clinical trials on


---------12:06----------
pineapple and the effect of depression


---------12:08----------
I've used it in my practice the decent


---------12:11----------
results with some people but start by


---------12:13----------
changing your diet so banana pineapple


---------12:15----------
start with those make sure your bowel


---------12:17----------
movements are good go see your primary


---------12:19----------
care physician you can also get a couple


---------12:21----------
of things tested like your vitamin D


---------12:23----------
level so vitamin D has a big correlation


---------12:25----------
with the depression if you're inside all


---------12:27----------
the time and you're not getting if


---------12:30----------
you're not getting your your daily dose


---------12:32----------
of sunlight chances are that that's


---------12:35----------
contributing to your low mood


---------12:38----------
the last thing is people are asking


---------12:41----------
about pineapple in in pizza and stuff


---------12:43----------
like eat fresh pineapple not canned


---------12:45----------
pineapple going buy a pineapple


---------12:49----------
and then someone else is asking I hear


---------12:51----------
people talk about things such as LSD and


---------12:52----------
shrooms to figure out your emotions what


---------12:54----------
are your thoughts on this I think that


---------12:55----------
there are a couple of very promising


---------12:57----------
studies using psychedelics to treat


---------12:59----------
things like PTSD and treatment


---------13:01----------
refractory depression I've had some


---------13:03----------
patients who have used it to treat


---------13:04----------
addictions and it's gone very well at


---------13:06----------
the same time I think that things are


---------13:08----------
very in a very preliminary stage and


---------13:10----------
there's a huge difference between doing


---------13:13----------
clinically assisted like psychedelic


---------13:15----------
assisted psychotherapy under the


---------13:17----------
guidance of a professional and just


---------13:19----------
getting high so I don't think just


---------13:21----------
getting high actually like helps people


---------13:25----------
I think that using psychoactive


---------13:27----------
substances like antidepressants if used


---------13:31----------
correctly and under guidance and


---------13:34----------
supervision it looks like have a


---------13:36----------
positive impact for mental health


---------13:39----------
um so I think the big thing is people


---------13:42----------
who like to get higher like oh there's


---------13:43----------
studies to support it so I can get high


---------13:45----------
whenever I want that's not actually how


---------13:46----------
it works like I think you need to use


---------13:48----------
them in sort of a targeted fashion so


---------13:50----------
there are some places like rehabs and


---------13:52----------
stuff that I've had a couple of


---------13:53----------
interesting conversation with medical


---------13:55----------
directors from like international


---------13:57----------
institutions that use things like


---------13:59----------
ibogaine and stuff like that and I've


---------14:03----------
had like people use ayahuasca and stuff


---------14:04----------
like that like patients of mine who've


---------14:06----------
reported good results but a lot of


---------14:09----------
people also just get high with this [ __ ]


---------14:10----------
and they don't get better so I think you


---------14:13----------
have to be careful about okay so it is


---------14:17----------
8:25 my time and I think we're gonna


---------14:19----------
have to transition to meditation because


---------14:24----------
we've been screaming for two and a half


---------14:25----------
hours and I'm getting tired


---------14:26----------
[Music]


---------14:36----------
so if you guys have follow-up questions


---------14:39----------
post them in the discord


---------14:42----------
so someone's asking you ask just what


---------14:45----------
about blood tests so I think the three


---------14:47----------
things that tend to be correlated with


---------14:48----------
depression first of all make sure you're


---------14:51----------
not anemic so check your blood levels


---------14:53----------
because if you're feeling tired gonna


---------14:55----------
have like a physiologic cause for


---------14:56----------
depression would be anemia thyroid


---------14:59----------
vitamin D and b12 so any of those


---------15:01----------
deficiencies if you have a thyroid


---------15:03----------
problem you can be depressed that can


---------15:04----------
cause depression low b12 is gonna lead


---------15:07----------
to low energy vitamin D is associated


---------15:09----------
with depression and then anemia those


---------15:11----------
are the four things that when I have a


---------15:13----------
person who clinically comes in those are


---------15:15----------
the things that I test so talk to your


---------15:19----------
doctors about that stuff don't go and


---------15:21----------
just get the lab so like go to your


---------15:23----------
doctor and say hey I have depression


---------15:24----------
what do you think about testing these


---------15:26----------
lab values and see what they say


---------15:27----------
[Music]
