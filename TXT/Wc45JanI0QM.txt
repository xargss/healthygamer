---------00:02----------

---------00:04----------
okay so Jake can you tell me a little


---------00:07----------
bit about yourself and what we're


---------00:09----------
talking about today


---------00:10----------
I sure wait what is that one question or


---------00:15----------
two questions oh yeah we're gonna tell


---------00:19----------
you okay yeah my name's Jake and I'm


---------00:23----------
from LA okay and I am a stream on Twitch


---------00:30----------
I'm known primarily for like IRL


---------00:32----------
streaming or outdoor streaming I lived


---------00:34----------
in Japan for almost three years and


---------00:36----------
started doing IRL streaming out there


---------00:37----------
and then okay it kind of turned into


---------00:41----------
what I do now which is kind of crazy


---------00:43----------
um also fast and yeah a lot of people


---------00:47----------
know me for being out in Japan but I


---------00:48----------
recently moved back home to LA just to


---------00:49----------
kind of make a home base again okay in


---------00:52----------
the midst of kind of weird times but


---------00:54----------
yeah so I'm back home cool and yeah what


---------00:58----------
we talked about today I think is I


---------00:59----------
actually have I'm not I think it's just


---------01:02----------
general like anxiety stuff I struggled


---------01:05----------
it with it once when I was like 19 or so


---------01:07----------
and I kind of did some stuff myself and


---------01:10----------
I actually had totally got over it and I


---------01:12----------
was I'm good and then in the past couple


---------01:14----------
years outside maybe your and a half or


---------01:16----------
two years after streaming I definitely


---------01:19----------
it kind of came back and taken hold and


---------01:22----------
I I can like feel it and I kind of know


---------01:24----------
the duh I know what it feels like when


---------01:31----------
it happens I had before so that's kind


---------01:32----------
of like hearing lingering and I don't


---------01:35----------
know just okay I think or yeah I think


---------01:38----------
it's we're going to be talking about


---------01:39----------
I've never talked to anybody about it


---------01:41----------
like actually ever so I've no no idea or


---------01:45----------
expectation you know yeah that's it let


---------01:48----------
me see if I can I had a feeling


---------01:50----------
something like this might happen let me


---------01:51----------
see if I um so that's really cool Jake


---------01:54----------
so you said that you struggled with


---------01:55----------
anxiety for a little bit when you were


---------01:56----------
19 and then it got better and then maybe


---------01:59----------
it's it's gotten good or it's it started


---------02:02----------
to come back a little bit since you


---------02:03----------
started streaming is that fair to say uh


---------02:06----------
yeah I guess yeah sure okay


---------02:09----------
and can you tell me just a little bit


---------02:11----------
about how you decided to go to Japan


---------02:14----------
sure I went to university in LA and then


---------02:19----------
after university I had an opportunity to


---------02:21----------
study Chinese in China for two years


---------02:23----------
so I went there for two years then I


---------02:25----------
came back to LA and actually started


---------02:26----------
working at a start-up for a year and


---------02:28----------
after a year I was like I just felt like


---------02:31----------
I was the most alive when I was kind of


---------02:33----------
a broad and uncomfortable and learning


---------02:35----------
something and I just I me decided to


---------02:38----------
save up some money quit my job and go to


---------02:40----------
Japan for one year to study Japanese in


---------02:43----------
which case I just started streaming when


---------02:44----------
I went there and then that one year of


---------02:46----------
Japanese learning turned into me


---------02:48----------
streaming now for you know however many


---------02:50----------
years and everything kind of like 118


---------02:53----------
based on you know 118 118 from what I


---------02:55----------
thought you know what would happen so


---------02:58----------
what did you think would happen I mean I


---------03:01----------
original plan was go for years study


---------03:03----------
Japanese come back home and just


---------03:05----------
continue working with hopefully like


---------03:06----------
it's just a more built up or improved


---------03:10----------
version of myself you know with another


---------03:11----------
language ability or something and just


---------03:13----------
continue working you know but yeah I've


---------03:17----------
been just kind of accepted can I tell


---------03:20----------
that can you tell me what what IRL


---------03:23----------
streaming or like like outdoor streaming


---------03:25----------
or what is that and what were you


---------03:27----------
streaming in Japan yeah sounds like one


---------03:32----------
I mean I was yeah it's crazy fun IRL


---------03:35----------
streaming is some people say in your


---------03:37----------
life I call it incorporating real life


---------03:39----------
but it's just you know streaming


---------03:41----------
outdoors whether it be and isn't it to


---------03:43----------
be outdoors I'm sorry but something that


---------03:45----------
is could be I guess like a real life


---------03:48----------
experience that's my idea is like


---------03:51----------
streaming a real life experience so for


---------03:53----------
me I wanted to base it around like okay


---------03:55----------
I wanted the kind of stream my life as


---------03:57----------
it developed in Japan because I went out


---------03:58----------
by myself I didn't have any friends and


---------04:01----------
I wanted to kind of stream that


---------04:03----------
experience for everyone which I think


---------04:05----------
people started to like cool yeah and and


---------04:11----------
so are you still streaming in LA yeah so


---------04:15----------
I moved back I mean the idea was to move


---------04:17----------
back because everything kind of changed


---------04:18----------
more to like traveling and exploring on


---------04:21----------
more of a like


---------04:23----------
a bit more planned content type of stuff


---------04:25----------
some ideas just to have a home base and


---------04:27----------
travel from here quite often actually


---------04:29----------
but ever still streaming I mean doing a


---------04:31----------
lot more computer streams now but just


---------04:34----------
for the time being while the world kind


---------04:35----------
of settles down I think and yeah yeah so


---------04:40----------
everything's still this uh they are


---------04:42----------
still streaming yeah just formats a


---------04:44----------
little bit different yeah and can you


---------04:47----------
tell me a little bit about when you said


---------04:48----------
that you had anxiety when you were 19


---------04:50----------
like that's quite specific can you tell


---------04:53----------
me what yeah what was going on or what


---------04:55----------
you mean by them sure


---------04:58----------
I'm a yeah I've always kind of


---------05:00----------
referenced this on my stream I guess but


---------05:03----------
I think I was like 18 or 19 and I had


---------05:05----------
really bad anxiety which I didn't know


---------05:07----------
at the time what it was when it first


---------05:08----------
started feeling how I felt um and how


---------05:13----------
did you what did you feel can you tell


---------05:14----------
us that yeah so at that time it was it


---------05:18----------
was a very like it was it was


---------05:27----------
it was a feeling of like constant like


---------05:30----------
nervousness and I don't like fear but I


---------05:33----------
was just very very worried person at the


---------05:35----------
time and I mean I don't know if I want


---------05:38----------
to talk about there I mean there I guess


---------05:40----------
the root of the warrior what I really


---------05:42----------
felt that time was I got you know I


---------05:43----------
didn't go outside a lot of stuff I


---------05:44----------
wouldn't go outside to like a big public


---------05:46----------
events I wouldn't like I wouldn't I


---------05:48----------
always worry about weird things like


---------05:51----------
like what oh no oh gosh uh it's okay


---------05:57----------
that I'm irrational thoughts yeah sure I


---------05:59----------
mean I was worried about things like if


---------06:01----------
I went out to a public event and uh


---------06:02----------
because I always have like stomach aches


---------06:04----------
and like nervous stomach I'm like oh


---------06:05----------
what if I can't find a bathroom or like


---------06:06----------
where's the exit at a at a movie theater


---------06:09----------
like it would be weird like I would go


---------06:10----------
to a movie theater and I'd have to know


---------06:11----------
where the I could start where the


---------06:12----------
bathroom is I guess I'd to go to the


---------06:13----------
bathroom


---------06:13----------
mhm it sounds really weird but it's not


---------06:17----------
that weird but we'll get yeah ii yeah


---------06:19----------
sure yeah it those were like the outside


---------06:24----------
the surface feelings I would have about


---------06:26----------
okay exactly that time and it was kind


---------06:28----------
of like Oliver is like deep debility is


---------06:30----------
that the word debilitating


---------06:32----------
sure so exact yeah definitely affect


---------06:35----------
like my normal life and what's crazy


---------06:36----------
about that is that growing up I was


---------06:38----------
always like happy-go-lucky and like when


---------06:40----------
people mention exactly in high school


---------06:41----------
I'd be like like what's that like we'd


---------06:43----------
be talking about dude like just don't


---------06:45----------
worry so much but like it just hit me


---------06:48----------
like kind of randomly and I was like


---------06:49----------
well at first I thought it was a


---------06:50----------
physical problems I went to the doctor


---------06:52----------
and I got you're fine I was like and I


---------06:54----------
was like - and then I had to kind of


---------06:55----------
figure it out and it took a little bit


---------06:56----------
of steps and a lot of like


---------06:57----------
self-realization and like mindset


---------06:58----------
changes actually and I think I really


---------07:01----------
grew a lot out of that when I came out


---------07:02----------
of that and can you tell us about steps


---------07:06----------
what were the steps sure um at the time


---------07:10----------
I kind of slowly realized after like


---------07:12----------
doing my little research and talking to


---------07:15----------
my friends like okay I think I just am


---------07:16----------
struggling from anxiety like this word


---------07:18----------
and I never talked to anybody really


---------07:20----------
about it except for my best friend's and


---------07:24----------
basically after I realized what it was I


---------07:26----------
just would look up different what swords


---------07:31----------
Solutions but like different MEC like


---------07:33----------
different things that people would do to


---------07:34----------
kind of get over their anxiety and I


---------07:35----------
would just tried the little ones like


---------07:36----------
meditating or just what else did you try


---------07:40----------
or what seemed to work uh for meals kind


---------07:47----------
of just trying to find what the root of


---------07:49----------
it was and just like like a little weed


---------07:53----------
that was in there and I'd dig it out


---------07:54----------
like just attack it head first and


---------07:55----------
figure out what is their root cause and


---------07:58----------
figure that out and then like I have a


---------08:02----------
total mindset change that actually so


---------08:05----------
Mike got me what of it what do you think


---------08:06----------
was the root so what I think the root


---------08:11----------
was at that time was I was fearing the


---------08:12----------
future I was fearing things like death


---------08:14----------
like that not specific oh my god I'm


---------08:16----------
framing to die tomorrow like I wasn't


---------08:17----------
like that but it was definitely some


---------08:19----------
weird fear and I think those because I


---------08:20----------
was actually brought up like very


---------08:21----------
religious and for some reason after high


---------08:25----------
school a lot of things hearted changing


---------08:27----------
and you know what I was doing and my


---------08:29----------
really finding my own path I think a lot


---------08:32----------
of fears for like adding up of like you


---------08:35----------
know like after I started feeling a


---------08:37----------
little bit weird I'd be like oh man what


---------08:38----------
if I'm sick like homie I would have you


---------08:39----------
know what if I was into like die and I


---------08:41----------
was like fear these things and I think


---------08:45----------
it honestly was because I don't know I


---------08:49----------
think goes I think someone had to do is


---------08:50----------
the religion poured of my life can you


---------08:53----------
tell us already yeah I just brought up


---------08:56----------
super Christian I guess I go into church


---------08:59----------
all the time and I stopped going and I


---------09:01----------
was like 17 or 18 just because I just


---------09:02----------
didn't feel like it was for me and then


---------09:07----------
so you know I hear people say this


---------09:09----------
actually a fair amount super Christian


---------09:12----------
it's not just Christian it's like super


---------09:14----------
yeah super Christians like Forks super


---------09:18----------
Christians like your mom like Mesa coach


---------09:21----------
every Sunday if you don't go to church


---------09:22----------
then you're like ground like you're in


---------09:23----------
trouble and like it's and you know you I


---------09:26----------
can't I can't play games with any blood


---------09:28----------
in it and I can't watch The Simpsons and


---------09:31----------
that's super what's wrong with The


---------09:33----------
Simpsons I don't know it probably has


---------09:35----------
like you know like anti-semitic or an


---------09:38----------
Tyson would submit not somatic somatic


---------09:40----------
and just anti-christian like jokes or


---------09:42----------
something anima yeah I've never heard


---------09:45----------
anything religious on the Simpsons but


---------09:46----------
you know I haven't hey that's that's why


---------09:48----------
it's super Christian is because I mean


---------09:50----------
baking people can find something out of


---------09:52----------
nothing so interesting and so what was


---------09:55----------
it like growing up in in that kind of


---------09:58----------
house so it sounds like your mom was was


---------10:00----------
quite religious what about your dad uh


---------10:03----------
no my dad really wasn't that really just


---------10:05----------
he's my mom's like typically very


---------10:07----------
conservative and super Christian not


---------10:11----------
that's a bad thing I mean that's just a


---------10:12----------
mom and then my dad is just more


---------10:17----------
aggressive just more like I don't know


---------10:21----------
if the word liberal it's not like a


---------10:22----------
political word all the time is it more


---------10:25----------
like very like maybe Ella I guess just


---------10:28----------
you know purpose I think I'm open minded


---------10:30----------
in it sounds like it may be less rigid


---------10:33----------
and a little bit more flexible maybe


---------10:35----------
that's deaf definitely he's I don't


---------10:38----------
always talk to him whenever there's like


---------10:39----------
anything going on in high school or some


---------10:40----------
serious hanger you know do you have


---------10:43----------
siblings one Brenda and is is your


---------10:47----------
brother religious no he's kind of the


---------10:50----------
same as me I think around you know you


---------10:52----------
always go to church growing up in high


---------10:53----------
school I think he just found his own


---------10:54----------
kind of path as well so me and my


---------10:56----------
brother and my dad had a very kind of


---------10:59----------
various than that and then my mom is yep


---------11:02----------
so I and your brothers will do a younger


---------11:05----------
hold it by eight years oh wow that's a


---------11:09----------
little bit older and and what was


---------11:15----------
y'all's relationship like when you were


---------11:16----------
growing up I mean it's he's quite a bit


---------11:19----------
older than you right so yeah it was uh


---------11:21----------
it was pretty I think standard like you


---------11:25----------
know pick on me come the younger kid but


---------11:26----------
like as we got older we as I got to be


---------11:29----------
like 20 I think and out of high school


---------11:31----------
we definitely started getting cool more


---------11:32----------
clothes and now we're actually very


---------11:34----------
close we actually live in like the same


---------11:35----------
apartment complex when I moved back and


---------11:37----------
like we hang out almost every day but I


---------11:40----------
would say it was very typical there's an


---------11:43----------
yeah just sibling eight years older and


---------11:46----------
you know just the normal pick on you


---------11:48----------
younger kids you're younger check our


---------11:50----------
younger brother kind of stuff it sure


---------11:52----------
and and so you said that you felt like


---------11:56----------
some of your kind of fear of a few


---------11:58----------
or death and it's okay to like yeah how


---------12:02----------
can I say this it's perfectly fine to


---------12:04----------
say things that sound like they don't


---------12:06----------
make sense or are like super


---------12:08----------
psychoanalytic and yeah I'm also


---------12:11----------
probably more hesitant saying it because


---------12:12----------
like I know people are watching so like


---------12:13----------
I'm trying not to make that effect


---------12:15----------
anything I'm not looking at anything but


---------12:16----------
like definitely eyes like a sure what my


---------12:18----------
brain is trained do what what effect


---------12:21----------
does that have let's talk about that


---------12:22----------
what effect does that have on you that


---------12:24----------
people are watching uh I don't know I've


---------12:28----------
always been someone doesn't I try not to


---------12:30----------
really care about people think about me


---------12:31----------
I've always kind of been that way in my


---------12:32----------
life but I think over years of streaming


---------12:35----------
it's just knowing it's not like I'm


---------12:38----------
trying to appeal to anybody play it's


---------12:39----------
just maybe you do have a little bit of


---------12:43----------
feeling of what people are thinking like


---------12:47----------
what they're saying about what you're


---------12:49----------
saying like and and and so it sounds


---------12:53----------
like it occupies it how can I say this


---------12:56----------
so it sounds like knowing that people


---------12:58----------
are watching even if you try to not let


---------13:01----------
it affect you


---------13:03----------
occupies a little bit of space in your


---------13:05----------
mind and there's really no way of


---------13:07----------
getting at around that yes


---------13:09----------
yeah out it's pretty hard I didn't I


---------13:11----------
haven't really I mean I would assume


---------13:14----------
most streamers have that little


---------13:16----------
occupancy yeah so you know this is one


---------13:20----------
of the advantages of being a boomer is


---------13:22----------
that I tend to be oblivious to most


---------13:23----------
things so it's easy for me to forget


---------13:29----------
you'll get there one day man you just


---------13:31----------
need you know it sounds like you're


---------13:32----------
crossing 30 and just give it a couple of


---------13:34----------
years and once once you don't recognize


---------13:38----------
what kids say like once you don't


---------13:40----------
understand terminology on Twitch or


---------13:43----------
don't understand the games that people


---------13:44----------
are playing or this is a big one do you


---------13:47----------
have a younger person who helps you with


---------13:49----------
setup your technology no I mean see


---------13:53----------
that's not a boomer then see you to


---------13:56----------
become a real boomer you have to have


---------13:57----------
someone who helps you set up your


---------13:59----------
technology which you thought I knew how


---------14:01----------
to set up okay and so that's when you're


---------14:05----------
gonna be a real boomer and that's when


---------14:06----------
you'll become impervious to the opinions


---------14:08----------
of people on the Internet


---------14:09----------
but not really impervious


---------14:11----------
no one's impervious but looking forward


---------14:13----------
to it you'll get some damage resistance


---------14:15----------
okay good so tell me a little bit about


---------14:19----------
like when you were saying you know you


---------14:21----------
felt like some of the your fears of


---------14:23----------
death which I know sounds like so


---------14:25----------
grandiose but you know some of your


---------14:28----------
fears were rooted in your religious


---------14:29----------
upbringing can you help us understand a


---------14:31----------
little bit about like how those two


---------14:33----------
things are tied together and even if


---------14:35----------
it's not like a you know like a


---------14:36----------
one-to-one sure uh yeah again I don't


---------14:41----------
think back the full root of that you


---------14:42----------
holding teddy was just like oh I'm


---------14:43----------
afraid to die it's like yeah what I'm


---------14:45----------
trying to say but there's just so some


---------14:47----------
aspects of like all of you worried about


---------14:48----------
like going like just things I couldn't I


---------14:52----------
don't know just stupid stuff but okay as


---------14:54----------
far as that specific question cuz like


---------14:56----------
you know in church you're taught like


---------14:57----------
okay if you don't believe in the perfect


---------14:59----------
way to believe and believe in in this


---------15:00----------
scenario Jesus in blah blah like you go


---------15:03----------
to hell mm-hmm sounds like oh damn like


---------15:05----------
if I if I was in the die I'm gonna go to


---------15:06----------
hell like in about that was a little


---------15:08----------
tiny fear at the time right now I mean


---------15:12----------
that doesn't occupy or it's definitely


---------15:14----------
not an issue right now but at that time


---------15:16----------
that was I think I was in it and like I


---------15:17----------
was like you know looking up on the


---------15:18----------
internet like conspiracy theories and


---------15:21----------
like just like end of the world stuff at


---------15:23----------
the time and those it was like so stupid


---------15:25----------
not looking back but that was a huge


---------15:28----------
that's what cost a lot of stuff a lot of


---------15:30----------
my problems I think was I like this


---------15:31----------
constant bombarding of worrying about


---------15:35----------
what's going to be in the future in sure


---------15:39----------
yeah so so yeah what are you worried


---------15:42----------
about particular aspects of the future


---------15:45----------
sounds like yeah I mean a definite


---------15:47----------
afterlife is one of them but like were


---------15:49----------
there particular things like sometimes


---------15:51----------
people worry about being alone or they


---------15:53----------
worry about you know not being respected


---------15:57----------
or able to support themselves or living


---------15:59----------
up to their potential I honestly I think


---------16:03----------
I was just fearful of like I think the


---------16:09----------
root of it was the death thing and that


---------16:10----------
effort like after I'd be more and more


---------16:13----------
like if your fraud always just continue


---------16:14----------
looking up things about like how bad the


---------16:16----------
world like what's happening to the world


---------16:18----------
right now in ohm mine like into they say


---------16:21----------
honestly into the world stuff like it


---------16:22----------
was kind of weird like 2012 weird like


---------16:25----------
just stuff that I it's I don't know I


---------16:28----------
kind of giggle at it now what yeah does


---------16:31----------
it sound kind of embarrassing to say


---------16:32----------
that stuff it definitely it's definitely


---------16:34----------
embarrassing but I don't know I think a


---------16:36----------
lot of people kind of did that I was an


---------16:37----------
Internet person I was always on there


---------16:39----------
and being you know in putting so much


---------16:40----------
and trying to zip through it and yeah


---------16:43----------
yeah so Jake let me offer if it's okay I


---------16:46----------
want to offer like one or two thoughts


---------16:47----------
about your feeling of embarrassment


---------16:49----------
is that cool yep which is the first


---------16:51----------
thing is that like everyone feels like


---------16:53----------
their anxiety doesn't make sense


---------16:55----------
everyone like but it's not you know


---------16:56----------
anxiety is not designed to sort of make


---------16:58----------
sense it's not it's just not how it


---------17:00----------
works like our mind is a thinking


---------17:03----------
machine and sometimes it generates


---------17:06----------
thoughts that don't make sense and


---------17:08----------
that's actually perfectly okay like like


---------17:11----------
voicing thoughts that feel irrational to


---------17:14----------
you doesn't make you a stupid person


---------17:16----------
it's just your mind just comes up with


---------17:19----------
that [ __ ] yeah


---------17:20----------
and and when you look up stuff how did


---------17:24----------
it affect your anxiety I mean it was


---------17:29----------
just add to it like I think about more


---------17:33----------
things like pile on more [ __ ] yeah so so


---------17:37----------
then let's think about that for a second


---------17:38----------
so what you know what what did you gain


---------17:41----------
and I and I want to acknowledge that you


---------17:44----------
did get something right so let me maybe


---------17:46----------
put it another way


---------17:47----------
how are you satisfied by looking up


---------17:49----------
something on the internet because it


---------17:50----------
sounds like it fueled your anxiety but


---------17:52----------
what did you like you know because I'm


---------17:53----------
guessing getting a sense that you were


---------17:55----------
hungry for something you would do a


---------17:57----------
Google search and then you would read


---------17:59----------
something and then you'd feel satisfied


---------18:00----------
even though your anxiety would increase


---------18:02----------
does that make sense yeah yeah there's


---------18:07----------
like


---------18:10----------
I might have been getting a feeling of


---------18:12----------
satisfaction by by thinking that I was


---------18:14----------
like obtaining some knowledge that I


---------18:16----------
wish everyone else knew like you guys


---------18:18----------
need to know this like come on like this


---------18:19----------
is happening like yeah that's probably


---------18:21----------
cuz I'd like to talk to my friends about


---------18:22----------
it Meg I wasn't like I don't know yeah


---------18:25----------
I'm gonna give you that at that from if


---------18:27----------
I think about it I'd be my answer I


---------18:28----------
think that would make sense like okay


---------18:29----------
you've been thinking back I think that's


---------18:31----------
a feeling that I would get sure so so so


---------18:34----------
you were learning something that other


---------18:36----------
people didn't know did you feel like


---------18:38----------
doing research helped you prepare I mean


---------18:43----------
I didn't really prepare cuz nothing


---------18:47----------
happened but I feel yeah yeah sure right


---------18:52----------
so like there's an unknown there's a


---------18:54----------
problem out there that like maybe the


---------18:55----------
world could end and like what are you


---------18:57----------
gonna do about because your anxieties


---------18:58----------
like what are you gonna do about that


---------18:59----------
yeah


---------19:01----------
does that question make sense it's like


---------19:03----------
we got to do something right so like


---------19:05----------
anxiety drives you to do something great


---------19:08----------
so let mean you have to plan you have to


---------19:10----------
know where the exits are you have to


---------19:11----------
know where the bathrooms are you have to


---------19:12----------
know when the world is gonna end


---------19:14----------
yeah yeah I mean it's almost like a sigh


---------19:19----------
this is a cycle like it's fueling itself


---------19:21----------
I guess yeah is that how it felt to you


---------19:23----------
I mean until I stopped doing that yeah


---------19:28----------
so how did you okay so you said


---------19:31----------
something about a change in mindset so


---------19:33----------
what what changed for you how are you


---------19:35----------
able to stop indulging sure I've always


---------19:42----------
thought that I'm like a pretty like like


---------19:47----------
strong-willed person and what when I


---------19:52----------
when I like realized okay like Jake


---------19:54----------
you're doing something wrong you need to


---------19:55----------
realize what's going on here


---------19:57----------
I actually just really thought about the


---------19:59----------
route like the deepest route of what


---------20:01----------
could cause this and for me the deepest


---------20:04----------
route was like I was like if you go down


---------20:06----------
the trail it's like okay if the world


---------20:08----------
ended what's the worst that can happen


---------20:09----------
you're gonna die and then I took that


---------20:11----------
out as like that's the deep history of


---------20:12----------
what's causing this


---------20:14----------
so I just literally like thought to


---------20:17----------
myself this is like it sounds so stupid


---------20:19----------
in like it's some don'ts gotta just


---------20:22----------
speak okay sorry sorry


---------20:23----------
I do evil I do have a lot of what's that


---------20:26----------
humor called me just appreciate about


---------20:27----------
yourself


---------20:28----------
self-deprecating yeah it's like anyway


---------20:31----------
so it's good in bed but anyway okay so I


---------20:33----------
I just created a mindset and I pulled


---------20:36----------
myself like this and I told myself this


---------20:37----------
over and over again at this time was all


---------20:41----------
right well don't worry about all this


---------20:43----------
other [ __ ] and basically creative


---------20:47----------
mindset where if you were to die


---------20:49----------
tomorrow you want to be happy for the


---------20:51----------
life that you live today and everything


---------20:53----------
before so with that mindset it like


---------20:55----------
actually like completely it's not like


---------20:57----------
one idea welcome to next day a thank you


---------20:58----------
Matt and was fine but they had


---------20:59----------
completely changed everything okay after


---------21:02----------
I created that mindset for myself I


---------21:03----------
started like every day working on myself


---------21:06----------
like physically like not crazy Jim Chad


---------21:09----------
but like I would I would like you know


---------21:11----------
make conscious decisions to wick a


---------21:14----------
little earlier go on a little jog start


---------21:17----------
working out I would start eating


---------21:18----------
healthier I would like basically use all


---------21:20----------
of my time that I had to be very


---------21:21----------
productive and with the mindset that if


---------21:25----------
I was at that tomorrow I'd be happy for


---------21:27----------
everything I did and that's what


---------21:28----------
actually caused me to go to like China


---------21:29----------
and stuff like that was like I just


---------21:31----------
thought I would basically try to take


---------21:32----------
risks and make decisions that would make


---------21:37----------
me like proud of the life that I was


---------21:38----------
living and it sounds great man that was


---------21:42----------
like actually yeah I was in honesty I


---------21:43----------
was in like bliss like after I came out


---------21:45----------
of it I gave you I was 20 and I came out


---------21:47----------
of like a longer they ship to but that


---------21:48----------
the relationship was not a she like


---------21:51----------
actually like a big thing in my head at


---------21:52----------
the time but anyway after that I came


---------21:53----------
after relation if you go you weren't


---------21:55----------
working out but after that I was in like


---------21:56----------
bliss I was in probably the happiest


---------21:58----------
time yeah there's a very just I don't


---------22:03----------
know very positive and fury yeah time


---------22:06----------
yeah so let me ask you something like


---------22:08----------
that what do you what do you think would


---------22:10----------
have happened Jake if you never got that


---------22:11----------
anxiety at the age of 19 what do you


---------22:15----------
think you'd be right now honestly I


---------22:18----------
might have just gone normal route and


---------22:21----------
like just went to college so I working a


---------22:22----------
marketing firm and not really done what


---------22:25----------
I did


---------22:28----------
yeah I mean yeah so think about that no


---------22:32----------
yeah totally when I I've always looked


---------22:34----------
back at that and been like and and it's


---------22:37----------
made me realize a lot of things like


---------22:38----------
when there are you know you have to have


---------22:40----------
downs to know the ups you have to kind


---------22:41----------
of see a little darkness to appreciate


---------22:43----------
the light and like things like that


---------22:44----------
always thought but yeah I mean well I


---------22:50----------
mean that's that sounds like a little


---------22:51----------
bit of an understatement to me to be


---------22:52----------
honest it sounds like a generalization


---------22:55----------
like you there have to be downs to be


---------22:56----------
ups sounds like a safe and logical thing


---------22:58----------
to say but what I'm hearing from you is


---------23:01----------
that you know your anxiety altered the


---------23:03----------
course of your life in a drastic way you


---------23:08----------
know is that what do you think is up


---------23:12----------
with that like do you think that that's


---------23:13----------
how do you understand that or do you not


---------23:16----------
really think about it much or um well no


---------23:19----------
I uh


---------23:20----------
maybe I don't think about it now it's


---------23:23----------
kinda just become normal for me but I


---------23:26----------
can definitely say that it made me learn


---------23:30----------
a lot about myself at that time because


---------23:31----------
I was someone who's like oh I can never


---------23:33----------
get anxiety I always thought like what


---------23:34----------
is this I can I'm fine I'm happy I'm a


---------23:36----------
hat like hmm but but I got it like I


---------23:39----------
didn't know what it was and it was kind


---------23:40----------
of scary and then they made me realize a


---------23:44----------
lot about myself and kind of how I


---------23:46----------
wanted to live after you know like yep


---------23:49----------
yeah hmm and so you went to China


---------23:55----------
sounds like you use the word bliss yeah


---------23:58----------
yeah I don't know if that's the right


---------24:00----------
word but uh sure this yeah


---------24:03----------
just speak your truth man it doesn't


---------24:05----------
have to be right yeah okay and and then


---------24:09----------
you went to Japan and and when did the


---------24:12----------
anxiety start to creep in yes


---------24:17----------
so I mean started maybe I would say


---------24:20----------
let's just say a year and a half ago or


---------24:22----------
more like around a year and a half ago


---------24:23----------
yeah I would say I specifically remember


---------24:26----------
like the first day I like I remember


---------24:28----------
actually the first day I felt the


---------24:31----------
feeling of anxiety and like right away I


---------24:33----------
was like holy [ __ ] cuz like there's some


---------24:36----------
times in life like in kissing sure I do


---------24:39----------
want to say though that there are some


---------24:40----------
times in life or


---------24:41----------
throughout this blissful time that it


---------24:42----------
was like I'd catch myself back oh my god


---------24:44----------
you're a little nervous Jake breathe


---------24:46----------
like I would catch myself out breathe


---------24:47----------
out relax and like I'd be fine


---------24:51----------
but anyways about let's say two years


---------24:54----------
ago or a year and a half ago in Japan I


---------24:56----------
had the feeling of like [ __ ] Jake yellow


---------24:59----------
anxiety or now calm down and it didn't


---------25:02----------
really go away like it usually does it


---------25:06----------
was actually on New Year's Day of 2019


---------25:11----------
Year's Day 2019 okay do you remember I


---------25:17----------
just came back from seeing my family in


---------25:20----------
LA and I did a crazy New Year's Eve


---------25:23----------
stream in Japan like they're like the


---------25:25----------
craziest streams like just out partying


---------25:27----------
all night and just having a really


---------25:29----------
insane stream and then I was supposed to


---------25:31----------
stream the next day on New Year's Day


---------25:33----------
and I just I was like mentally just not


---------25:35----------
feeling like I was like dude like I just


---------25:39----------
don't want to go outside or now I just I


---------25:40----------
was kind of like first time you know in


---------25:43----------
ever since being in Japan or being


---------25:45----------
streaming that I felt that way and I


---------25:47----------
remember talking about all my discord a


---------25:48----------
little bit with Mike my viewers and


---------25:50----------
stuff and uh it was weird because I was


---------25:54----------
like it's a big day


---------25:55----------
first you know but yeah I mean that's


---------26:01----------
the first day that I had it and it


---------26:03----------
slowly would be more and more and then


---------26:05----------
it's been kind of since that last


---------26:08----------
year-and-a-half been kind of just up and


---------26:09----------
down I can feel the exact same symptoms


---------26:11----------
I had before you know a little mental


---------26:13----------
and physical stuff that's being


---------26:15----------
effectively yeah that's it that's about


---------26:17----------
a year and half ago I guess yeah so and


---------26:19----------
what are you when you're what are the


---------26:22----------
what kind of thoughts do you have good


---------26:26----------
breathing by the way oh thanks I did a


---------26:30----------
little yoga this morning good for you


---------26:35----------
that's a very that's a very open-ended


---------26:38----------
question and I know it's supposed to be


---------26:39----------
like that so I'm trying not to think too


---------26:41----------
much about it before I answer I


---------26:45----------
timer right now at that time um at that


---------26:51----------
time I just thought like alright you're


---------26:53----------
just going through a little like maybe a


---------26:55----------
couple days they're just feeling a


---------26:56----------
little nervous anxiety maybe a little


---------26:57----------
bit too much going on maybe just need to


---------26:59----------
relax and chill if you don't you know


---------27:01----------
don't drink so much because and when I


---------27:03----------
went to Japan socially you do drink a


---------27:04----------
lot when you meet people and I was like


---------27:05----------
the majority of my stream is going out


---------27:08----------
and exploring and meeting meeting people


---------27:10----------
and you know they just don't drink and


---------27:13----------
chill and you'll be fine I wasn't yeah


---------27:19----------
is your anxiety continued to grow do you


---------27:22----------
remember what kind of thoughts you had


---------27:24----------
like let's say like end of 2019 or like


---------27:30----------
fall of 2019 would what we were so in


---------27:33----------
the past it was you know your anxiety


---------27:35----------
used to tell you you have to find the


---------27:37----------
exits maybe who had some fear of death


---------27:39----------
yeah what kind of thoughts do you have


---------27:42----------
now now my thoughts and I don't think


---------27:51----------
these thoughts are triggers for the


---------27:53----------
anxiety I think that they are a cycle of


---------27:55----------
adding to what I have but now I'm sure


---------27:57----------
what thinking damn Jake you have these


---------27:59----------
same symptoms like I feel very like


---------28:01----------
fuzzy thoughts like I'm just I feel very


---------28:04----------
like my mental is not as sharp and when


---------28:08----------
I first started mentioning as mushrooms


---------28:09----------
like are you just getting old like it's


---------28:10----------
so normal and maybe maybe that is part


---------28:11----------
of it and maybe I'm just overthinking


---------28:13----------
that I'm just becoming a little more


---------28:14----------
slow but it's like recognized


---------28:17----------
it's like recognizable to me um my


---------28:19----------
vision is like become super blurry in


---------28:21----------
the past year and a half like like it's


---------28:23----------
insane I was always like 20/20 and then


---------28:25----------
like I don't know it's just there's like


---------28:32----------
physical things okay any chance you've


---------28:35----------
seen an optometrist recently I went


---------28:37----------
weeks ago yeah here actually and


---------28:38----------
goodrich gave me clip glasses that are


---------28:41----------
coming soon but you know it was nice I


---------28:44----------
mean it's a relief it's a relief to go


---------28:46----------
and like just to rule out that there's


---------28:48----------
any physical problem it's very nice but


---------28:52----------
um what I know to be honest I'm I'm Oh


---------29:01----------
am I afraid of shoot okay well my first


---------29:04----------
answer is I'm afraid that there is


---------29:05----------
something like a little physical problem


---------29:07----------
like with me that I don't know that sure


---------29:10----------
which is actually really bad because


---------29:12----------
that leads back to my you know good time


---------29:14----------
without always fear what's the you know


---------29:16----------
fear okay and what would it mean if you


---------29:20----------
had a physical problem that you'd be I


---------29:25----------
mean that would be I don't know what


---------29:29----------
that mean yeah I mean I don't underst


---------29:41----------
question what's the significance if you


---------29:43----------
did have a physical problem let's assume


---------29:45----------
it was true then I guess that would just


---------29:52----------
I don't know I mean it would suck or


---------29:59----------
would talk about it that it could


---------30:15----------
answer that okay that's okay um do you


---------30:18----------
feel okay not knowing how to answer some


---------30:20----------
questions it's not like there's a right


---------30:21----------
answer it's just you know sometimes I


---------30:23----------
can ask a bad question frequently are


---------30:26----------
you okay well I don't know I know it's


---------30:28----------
finally I ask away I just don't know


---------30:29----------
like how to answer oh it's like about I


---------30:33----------
mean I guess I just not gonna fall back


---------30:36----------
to what I was already talking about what


---------30:38----------
I've got over is like okay what's the


---------30:39----------
first could happen like okay you're


---------30:41----------
saying you could just die so he's


---------30:43----------
thinking yeah so so okay let's point out


---------30:47----------
what just happened Jake okay so you're


---------30:49----------
doing good buddy


---------30:50----------
stay with me okay nice pink train uh-huh


---------30:54----------
big bad I knew whose Binx who's doing


---------30:59----------
this for not being spanked no not that


---------31:01----------
well don't speak but you know I smell


---------31:04----------
like um you know I I understand I think


---------31:07----------
it's fair for you to feel like you're


---------31:08----------
being spanked but who's doing the


---------31:09----------
spanking that makes sense you know right


---------31:14----------
now I'm kind of spanking myself because


---------31:15----------
I'm yet realizing that there that this


---------31:18----------
isn't a majority I really don't think


---------31:19----------
this is a dirty of what started the


---------31:22----------
cause of this right now but it


---------31:23----------
definitely has become now a part of what


---------31:27----------
yeah well mines ideas right now it


---------31:30----------
Derick Andreea and yeah let me let me


---------31:33----------
understand so I think you were I think


---------31:35----------
you had answers for my questions I just


---------31:38----------
don't think you liked them or weren't


---------31:39----------
comfortable saying them because you gave


---------31:41----------
us a little clue there so I think what


---------31:43----------
the silence was was actually like


---------31:45----------
conflict within you is that fair or were


---------31:48----------
you just drawing a blank


---------31:49----------
no it's not I mean I had like answers


---------31:52----------
inside me I just like thinking is that


---------31:54----------
you don't want to say them yeah yeah so


---------31:57----------
so thanks for giving us a glimpse cuz I


---------31:59----------
think that that's enough to get us


---------32:00----------
started and and you know it's okay to


---------32:02----------
not give us a glimpse but I'll tell you


---------32:05----------
a little bit more about glimpses in a


---------32:06----------
second so the first thing is that what I


---------32:09----------
kind of heard from you is like let me


---------32:12----------
know if this is right okay so you didn't


---------32:13----------
precisely say this but it's kind of like


---------32:15----------
well if I do have something wrong with


---------32:18----------
me then like maybe I could die but oh


---------32:19----------
[ __ ] like we already dealt with that


---------32:21----------
that was like back when we were 19 so


---------32:23----------
like I don't want it to be that again


---------32:25----------
like I thought that that was taken care


---------32:26----------
of yeah


---------32:29----------
what do you think about that that fair


---------32:32----------
yeah no that's that that's totally fair


---------32:34----------
that's why I was kind of like weird


---------32:35----------
answering that way but I but these are


---------32:38----------
just these are thoughts I've had after


---------32:40----------
the after what I feel like was my like


---------32:42----------
when I started getting anxiety again


---------32:43----------
which I really at the time I'm just like


---------32:47----------
I thought it was there was no thoughts


---------32:49----------
of that in my head at that like when it


---------32:51----------
first year first day and and that's so


---------32:53----------
like the anxiety has definitely kind of


---------32:56----------
nuts nope snow balled maybe into like


---------32:58----------
adding on extra little things now which


---------32:59----------
is like [ __ ] not to start like pruning


---------33:01----------
more [ __ ] off before I can get to that


---------33:03----------
root again and ah yeah yeah so so here's


---------33:07----------
here's what I'm hearing from you is that


---------33:08----------
you don't want to say that answer


---------33:10----------
because temporarily your anxiety it's


---------33:14----------
sure it's become maybe a fear of death


---------33:16----------
again but that happened later after the


---------33:18----------
snowball started forming so that's not


---------33:20----------
you're telling yourself that that's not


---------33:22----------
the right answer because you started


---------33:24----------
experiencing anxiety before you started


---------33:27----------
thinking about death maybe yeah so


---------33:30----------
you're kind of discounting that even


---------33:32----------
though that's the answer that pops into


---------33:33----------
your head yeah yeah have you started


---------33:45----------
feeling old recently uh no I think okay


---------33:54----------
yeah I don't think that's ever been like


---------33:57----------
a thought yep I mean you know this chat


---------34:04----------
says you're boomer and it's laugh at it


---------34:05----------
like yeah I'm joke haha I'm going bald


---------34:07----------
but like I don't what about your mental


---------34:10----------
not being as sharp how long have you


---------34:13----------
been feeling that way um honestly just


---------34:16----------
like says the exact since I started


---------34:18----------
feeling anxiety which which was this was


---------34:20----------
like the key thing of when I was like 19


---------34:22----------
or so I was the same I was very foggy


---------34:24----------
like I remember like I remember like


---------34:26----------
specifically when I was young like when


---------34:27----------
anxiety I remember like when I turn my


---------34:29----------
head and I try to look I couldn't focus


---------34:30----------
on things like right away I was like a


---------34:32----------
physical thing that caught that would


---------34:33----------
that was like one physical thing that I


---------34:35----------
had to Aniyah anxiety


---------34:36----------
mm-hm and I noticed that right away


---------34:38----------
you're gonna have to go I was like holy


---------34:39----------
crap like I'm getting anxiety again like


---------34:42----------
I realized I was like [ __ ]


---------34:43----------
you gotta figure this out okay yeah


---------34:47----------
that's it one thing I think yeah Jake


---------34:49----------
I'm gonna offer a couple of thoughts


---------34:51----------
okay the first is that I get the sense


---------34:54----------
that you're trying to give us a the


---------34:56----------
right answer so I don't want the right


---------35:00----------
answer there isn't the right answer


---------35:01----------
I just want whatever's in your head is


---------35:03----------
irrational and as stupid as it is


---------35:05----------
because I don't think it's irrational or


---------35:08----------
stupid and even if you feel it's


---------35:11----------
irrational or stupid like I'm even happy


---------35:13----------
with you sharing with me what your


---------35:16----------
struggle to speak is so even if you


---------35:18----------
can't give me an answer if you can share


---------35:21----------
with me why you can't give me an answer


---------35:23----------
that would be awesome okay so what we


---------35:26----------
want is a window into your mind because


---------35:28----------
like basically we're gonna look under


---------35:30----------
the hood of the car


---------35:31----------
yeah please and and and so like for


---------35:35----------
example this whole process of like you


---------35:36----------
kind of saying I don't know how to


---------35:38----------
answer that I think you had answers but


---------35:40----------
something kept you from sharing those


---------35:42----------
answers because you were judging what


---------35:45----------
your answers were there was judgment


---------35:47----------
there that kept you from speaking does


---------35:48----------
that make sense yeah yeah EE I mean yeah


---------35:51----------
yeah I'm gonna overthink way too much


---------35:53----------
right so so even there so like like what


---------35:56----------
was that was that bad that no what was


---------36:00----------
that how do we describe that I overthink


---------36:02----------
way too much if I admitting something am


---------36:05----------
i real it was it a UH it's a judgment oh


---------36:09----------
okay right so this kind of also goes


---------36:12----------
back to self deprecating like it's true


---------36:15----------
yeah I'm very very self-deprecating and


---------36:18----------
I don't I hope that hasn't affected me


---------36:20----------
like made it worse yeah so I think that


---------36:22----------
there's a certain amount of humor to


---------36:23----------
that which is completely fine but do you


---------36:25----------
judge yourself frequently


---------36:32----------
do you mean like just like I just did


---------36:34----------
when I said yeah I mean yeah yeah oh


---------36:36----------
yeah I guess all the time yeah so I


---------36:38----------
usually do it very light-hearted they


---------36:40----------
usually say typically it's very


---------36:41----------
light-hearted sure I I'm with that cuz I


---------36:44----------
don't think you you strike me so some


---------36:46----------
people like weigh themselves down with


---------36:48----------
heavy judgement you're in you know these


---------36:51----------
are people who like tell themselves that


---------36:52----------
they're ugly or pieces of [ __ ] or things


---------36:54----------
like that you strike me as someone who's


---------36:55----------
quite confident and and has generally


---------36:58----------
speaking like a positive outlook so I


---------37:00----------
don't think you judge yourself in the


---------37:02----------
same way is like the heavy judgments


---------37:04----------
okay yeah yeah that's fair but I still


---------37:08----------
think that you have a very a relatively


---------37:10----------
common subtle judgement going on that


---------37:14----------
because you're a relatively resilient


---------37:16----------
guy you can use humor as a defense


---------37:18----------
mechanism and kind of like laugh it off


---------37:20----------
but you still judge yourself in ways


---------37:24----------
that you can handle but you're still


---------37:26----------
doing it does that make sense yes it


---------37:29----------
does make sense and you've been doing


---------37:32----------
that your whole life for I actually


---------37:36----------
probably I guess yeah I mean I've always


---------37:39----------
been like the class clown that developed


---------37:42----------
into probably that kind of weird using


---------37:45----------
jokes or something to always have a


---------37:47----------
fallback there it is that rears it like


---------37:51----------
a bad no no it's just it makes me want


---------37:53----------
to ask a fall but like a like a fallback


---------37:55----------
from what like what are you falling back


---------37:57----------
from oh I don't know like that's not I


---------38:01----------
could I'm just I don't know like I would


---------38:02----------
just say things mmm oh man I don't know


---------38:05----------
what do you feeling I'm trying


---------38:15----------
what I fall back from I don't know if


---------38:16----------
there's anything specific yeah yeah I


---------38:18----------
know what are you feeling right now


---------38:20----------
Oh is you think about what to fall back


---------38:28----------
from like something happened like you


---------38:29----------
started smiling a lot but I don't think


---------38:31----------
it was I think it was like a deflecting


---------38:32----------
smile that's it a very I smile a lot and


---------38:35----------
a lot a lot is deflecting and I see it


---------38:38----------
made fun of her smiling actually sorry


---------38:40----------
random mm-hm


---------38:41----------
so so what happened if you didn't make a


---------38:43----------
joke what do you think would have


---------38:47----------
happened when you were for lack of a


---------38:49----------
better term and I realize I'm asking you


---------38:50----------
really a broad question when you were


---------38:53----------
yeah is there some weird-ass random


---------38:55----------
thought that pops into your head if I


---------38:57----------
ask a broad question yeah what would


---------39:00----------
happen if you didn't make a joke growing


---------39:01----------
up what were you afraid of I don't know


---------39:10----------
maybe I just liked people laugh like I


---------39:12----------
just liked I mean I like to I like to


---------39:15----------
reactions definitely that's maybe that's


---------39:17----------
okay reactions and that's definitely


---------39:19----------
yeah that's been a good and bad thing in


---------39:21----------
my life I think I like reactions okay


---------39:23----------
that's maybe a yeah maybe I fished too


---------39:26----------
much for reactions do you yeah


---------39:29----------
definitely I mean yeah yep why not like


---------39:33----------
what do reactions do for you they tell


---------39:40----------
me about people what do they tell you


---------39:43----------
about people hmm this is good weird


---------39:48----------
okay sorry I thought we


---------39:50----------
like I gotta watch how I say things no


---------39:52----------
no no it is it no Jake that's a great


---------39:55----------
thing to say man cuz it's I was about to


---------39:56----------
say that's what we [ __ ] do here man


---------39:58----------
okay it gets weird that means we're


---------40:02----------
doing it right like if I said something


---------40:05----------
like kind of weird or obscure and then I


---------40:07----------
use a joke like a laugh or a joke as a


---------40:09----------
fallback after I say the weird and


---------40:11----------
obscure thing you can see how someone


---------40:14----------
reacts and then like kind of get a


---------40:16----------
feeling of like what they think about


---------40:18----------
that and if it's a bad feeling they get


---------40:20----------
then you can fall back on the laughs and


---------40:22----------
it's like a knot it's like normal then


---------40:23----------
you can like wow it's okay yeah so let's


---------40:27----------
think about that it was there a


---------40:29----------
particular that feeling of saying


---------40:31----------
something weird in getting that reaction


---------40:35----------
do you remember a time in your life


---------40:38----------
where like you said something and you


---------40:40----------
got that reaction really really


---------40:42----------
powerfully and you were like nope never


---------40:44----------
gonna do that again


---------40:55----------
specific I can think okay I can't think


---------40:56----------
I can think about that I'm you've been


---------40:58----------
doing in in this Paul with you I'm


---------41:00----------
definitely the unpacking yeah I'm like


---------41:02----------
saying I'm saying that's weird I'm


---------41:03----------
actually kind of curious like I'm not


---------41:05----------
like weirdly curious but in back when


---------41:07----------
I'm like kind of curious like this you


---------41:08----------
think that's weird like yep and Molly


---------41:10----------
and that's that's so can I put words to


---------41:13----------
that yes yes yeah how you doing Jake


---------41:18----------
that's not honestly I'm a little nervous


---------41:20----------
I have no expectations Billy I've never


---------41:22----------
talked to anybody like that's you know


---------41:24----------
that knows you know how are these has


---------41:26----------
some professional background into things


---------41:29----------
so this is kind of cool for me okay so


---------41:31----------
what I'm hearing is a fear of judgment


---------41:33----------
right


---------41:35----------
you're gauging how we're gonna judge you


---------41:38----------
and and and if we don't judge you in the


---------41:42----------
right way then you've got to fall back


---------41:45----------
right and then you can alter our


---------41:47----------
judgment by making a joke correct and


---------41:51----------
then and then so we're gonna we're gonna


---------41:55----------
try okay we're gonna play a little game


---------41:56----------
so say something to me anything [ __ ] I


---------41:59----------
got to do this problem I'm gonna try to


---------42:01----------
keep a face okay so what I'm gonna do so


---------42:03----------
you're gonna say something I'm gonna do


---------42:05----------
my best to be neutral or negative okay


---------42:09----------
and then I want you to notice how you


---------42:11----------
feel and then see yourself want to crack


---------42:14----------
a joke okay okay but I got out okay okay


---------42:21----------
wow you're in Patagonia I think only a


---------42:25----------
bunch of Chad's were Patagonia now


---------42:34----------
good on you you feel it just wait what


---------42:38----------
do you do are you trying to like no why


---------42:41----------
don't you what when I didn't say


---------42:42----------
anything what did you do like what how


---------42:43----------
did you feel did it work I'm not I can't


---------42:45----------
tell not then I was scared that you


---------42:48----------
thought I was serious and that you that


---------42:50----------
you're actually upset that I don't like


---------42:51----------
your Patagonia Jackie which I like and


---------42:53----------
then and then what do you do I just


---------42:55----------
joked about it I said Nadia is cool so


---------42:58----------
when you thought I was serious for a


---------43:00----------
second like did you get that feeling I


---------43:03----------
mean I was also trying to roleplay like


---------43:05----------
you break too broke it down but yeah I


---------43:06----------
did a little bit yeah right and if it


---------43:09----------
was a real-life scenario definitely have


---------43:10----------
that yep


---------43:11----------
right so that's so like and then and


---------43:14----------
then like what is that feeling what does


---------43:16----------
it feel like feels like pressure of


---------43:23----------
worrying about like damn they might not


---------43:26----------
like me because they thought I was or


---------43:27----------
because of what I said sounded stupid or


---------43:30----------
mean or something


---------43:31----------
yeah or dumb is it okay to not be liked


---------43:35----------
yeah that's fine


---------43:38----------
I mean easy to say but yeah I mean it is


---------43:42----------
okay to not be liked do you believe that


---------43:44----------
um maybe maybe not


---------43:52----------
I Wow


---------43:58----------
it's a good question dr. kay I think


---------44:02----------
that I don't worry about if people like


---------44:06----------
me but I don't like when people is this


---------44:09----------
really weird no stop it's not weird


---------44:11----------
I don't care good you're like I'm not


---------44:13----------
trying to be everyone's best friend


---------44:14----------
maybe but I do care about if people


---------44:17----------
dislike me mm-hmm


---------44:20----------
because I always feel like I don't I'm


---------44:23----------
not I I I feel like keep going buddy


---------44:30----------
I figure there's a way to not that


---------44:32----------
there's a way where you don't need to


---------44:33----------
dislike someone whether it's just


---------44:36----------
knowing them more or figuring out what a


---------44:39----------
problem was or something I don't know


---------44:41----------
so let me ask you a different question


---------44:43----------
is it okay for you to be disciplined


---------44:46----------
yeah yes you sure yes yeah I don't know


---------44:53----------
maybe yeah maybe I'm just being weird


---------44:56----------
now no I'm not should I stop saying that


---------44:58----------
that's a bad hat by the way you can even


---------45:01----------
ask my like viewers here I'm a lot like


---------45:04----------
I always say I'm so like I say I'm weird


---------45:07----------
a lot and that's really bad probably


---------45:09----------
okay anyways uh even you're judging the


---------45:13----------
weirdness and you're calling it bad you


---------45:15----------
know it's gonna it's recursive it'll go


---------45:18----------
back until the end of time which is okay


---------45:20----------
just notice it it's just how you are


---------45:22----------
it's not good or bad it's just how you


---------45:25----------
are there are good things about it


---------45:27----------
they're bad things about it we can talk


---------45:28----------
about that in a second but let's stick


---------45:30----------
with this are you are you okay being


---------45:32----------
disliked


---------45:38----------
yeah I I think yeah even looking what I


---------45:42----------
just said son oh yeah I'll say like just


---------45:43----------
the simple answer is yes yeah definitely


---------45:46----------
okay being disliked yeah okay so I know


---------45:49----------
that this is gonna sound weird but that


---------45:51----------
makes perfect I think both statements


---------45:52----------
are true so I think that like so we tend


---------45:55----------
to think about our mind is like a


---------45:57----------
monolith it's like one thing whereas


---------46:00----------
really what we are is like our mind is


---------46:02----------
actually like it's like a party of NPCs


---------46:05----------
who each do kind of whatever they want


---------46:08----------
to and our goal is to sort of get the


---------46:09----------
NPC's to move in the same direction and


---------46:12----------
we want to like Zone into this raid and


---------46:14----------
like do the raid and sometimes they will


---------46:16----------
to work after something huh does you


---------46:19----------
know I play World of Warcraft wrestling


---------46:20----------
I sorry I heard you make these things


---------46:21----------
like okay they're good I mean I just use


---------46:25----------
gaming analogies and like most of it


---------46:27----------
tends to be MOBAs in RPGs because that's


---------46:29----------
what I play by oh yeah all right keep it


---------46:31----------
going yeah so like it's like you know


---------46:33----------
you're you're with this group of people


---------46:34----------
and like so I think that it's it's weird


---------46:36----------
Jake because there's a part of you who I


---------46:38----------
think is genuinely confident mature and


---------46:43----------
resilient and then there are also like


---------46:48----------
nights at your round table that are


---------46:51----------
concerned about dislike are concerned


---------46:53----------
about getting old and are concerned


---------46:56----------
about dying mm-hmm right in that Spectre


---------47:00----------
which you judge yourself or you judge


---------47:02----------
yourself for like oh [ __ ] I thought we


---------47:04----------
dealt with that it's like it's like


---------47:06----------
zombie it's like you killed it once and


---------47:07----------
it's back again yeah and so you've got


---------47:10----------
to be careful because I think like


---------47:12----------
you're doing a very subtle thing where


---------47:13----------
you're even though that's the answer


---------47:17----------
that pops up in your mind your


---------47:19----------
reluctance for that answer to be true


---------47:21----------
allows you to ignore it can you say that


---------47:28----------
was less yes more time so like like even


---------47:30----------
though something pops up in your mind


---------47:31----------
mm-hmm your reluctance for it to be true


---------47:36----------
pushes you to just ignore it feel like I


---------47:39----------
don't want it to be true I don't want to


---------47:41----------
be afraid of death again


---------47:42----------
yeah whereas I would be surprised are


---------47:46----------
you still living every day and every day


---------47:50----------
I don't mean most days I mean


---------47:51----------
are there days where you live where


---------47:54----------
you're no longer thinking about if I die


---------47:56----------
tomorrow would I be happy are you


---------47:58----------
starting to think about the future um


---------48:03----------
yeah I don't live like that every day


---------48:05----------
anymore


---------48:06----------
definitely yep and is there a


---------48:08----------
correlation between not living that way


---------48:10----------
in the resurgence of your anxiety yeah I


---------48:17----------
mean I was I think so but yeah yeah I


---------48:23----------
also I also want to like just say that


---------48:27----------
something that I think has been a key


---------48:30----------
that I've just realized in the timing of


---------48:32----------
all this is I think streaming has


---------48:36----------
changed a lot of how I live it's


---------48:39----------
actually changed out of it completely


---------48:42----------
tell us about mom well when I first went


---------48:47----------
to Japan I went there to live for a year


---------48:51----------
and come back right and I just started


---------48:53----------
distri I happened to stream it was like


---------48:55----------
a I did it everyday but it wasn't I


---------48:57----------
wasn't there to stream I just had the


---------49:00----------
stream following me and after you know


---------49:03----------
six or eight months of like damn this


---------49:05----------
stream has blown up and I need to really


---------49:07----------
focus on this it turned into you just


---------49:13----------
this is like realization I've thought of


---------49:15----------
that I think is a lot but it's turned it


---------49:17----------
turned into me living my life in the


---------49:20----------
stream seeing what my life was to me


---------49:23----------
living the stream and my life was just


---------49:26----------
following mm-hmm and I think that is for


---------49:30----------
me the biggest trigger for this anxiety


---------49:34----------
recently and I might be wrong but I


---------49:37----------
really do think I know myself and I know


---------49:40----------
the changes I like what changes in my


---------49:43----------
life and this was the craziest change


---------49:44----------
I've ever had and I'm not


---------49:47----------
I mean I'll just voice I'm always


---------49:50----------
worried about saying that because I'm a


---------49:51----------
little worried about the judgement from


---------49:52----------
the viewers who are like oh did you just


---------49:54----------
stream like you just make a bunch of


---------49:55----------
money and all you do is go around and


---------49:57----------
get drunk with like I understand that


---------49:58----------
argument but I always I'll just say that


---------50:01----------
it's definitely somehow he's why don't


---------50:02----------
talk about it a lot but it still was um


---------50:04----------
definitely a big change in my life and


---------50:07----------
once I I realized that more so recently


---------50:10----------
of you know it change from the stream


---------50:12----------
fall in my life to my life just being


---------50:14----------
the stream and my life kind of just


---------50:15----------
trailing behind me yeah and uh you know


---------50:19----------
I try to take slow steps and to try and


---------50:21----------
balance that back out to kind of live my


---------50:23----------
life again and that's like LA was one


---------50:25----------
move all the timing kind of sucks with


---------50:27----------
everything going on you know being


---------50:29----------
around and trying to start my little


---------50:30----------
healthy habits a little again um but


---------50:34----------
yeah a lot of my middle space is most of


---------50:39----------
my mental space in the past couple years


---------50:41----------
is just purely dedicated to you stream


---------50:44----------
like everything around being online and


---------50:46----------
everything which it was always like that


---------50:48----------
so yeah so I think that makes a lot of


---------50:51----------
sense Jake so can I have a moment to


---------50:56----------
collect my thoughts


---------50:56----------
yeah please are you playing an ad right


---------51:03----------
now no okay sorry I didn't know if I was


---------51:05----------
like an ad thing or something I don't


---------51:07----------
know


---------51:08----------
I mean sometimes people run ads and I


---------51:12----------
just um but I'm not I'm working with pen


---------51:16----------
and paper bro like everything anybody's


---------51:23----------
okay I'm gonna need a minute


---------51:29----------
[Music]


---------52:07----------
all right either this is gonna either


---------52:09----------
I'm going to lose you guys completely


---------52:10----------
order this is going to be helpful almost


---------52:15----------
there


---------52:26----------
okay


---------52:45----------
boy it's gonna be hard to find the words


---------52:46----------
to say this okay so I'm just gonna start


---------52:51----------
talking oh okay I'm sorry you're scared


---------52:54----------
right now but I'm ready no no it's a


---------52:56----------
mean the reason I'm you know I


---------52:59----------
understand you're afraid but what I'm


---------53:01----------
saying is like it's just like I'm trying


---------53:02----------
to I feel like I've wrapped my head


---------53:05----------
around something but I don't know how to


---------53:07----------
explain what I've wrapped my head around


---------53:10----------
sounds like me everyday I'm ready so the


---------53:14----------
first thing that we're gonna kind of


---------53:15----------
start in the present right so there's


---------53:17----------
there is Jake and bake and then there is


---------53:20----------
Jake and these are two different people


---------53:22----------
and it used to be that Jake was the one


---------53:25----------
who is living life and Jake and bake was


---------53:27----------
following along and now it started to


---------53:30----------
happen is like you started to become


---------53:32----------
more Jake and bake in less Jake and


---------53:36----------
overtime you know so there's like the


---------53:39----------
character and there's you and and I


---------53:41----------
think you described it really well that


---------53:42----------
like you used to just live your life and


---------53:44----------
that was like Jake was the guy who woke


---------53:46----------
up and said I want to be able to die


---------53:49----------
tomorrow with no regrets


---------53:50----------
that was never Jake and bake in fact the


---------53:53----------
anxiety was the idea of you dying a


---------53:56----------
thousand days in the future and like


---------54:00----------
regretting that thousand days which is


---------54:02----------
different about there's a difference


---------54:03----------
between like dying tomorrow and living a


---------54:06----------
life that isn't good enough because


---------54:08----------
you're gonna go to hell


---------54:09----------
it's like a summation of your entire


---------54:11----------
life it becomes greater than today


---------54:14----------
mm-hmm okay so Jake and bake I think


---------54:19----------
then starts to like the more you eat the


---------54:20----------
more the steam grows then you're like oh


---------54:22----------
this is a thing which is like but


---------54:24----------
remember that Jake grew out of a


---------54:28----------
completely different thought process


---------54:29----------
than like this is a real thing now he


---------54:32----------
didn't care if it was a real thing he


---------54:34----------
just did today and once the stream


---------54:38----------
becomes real then you end up with New


---------54:40----------
Year's night where it's huge and it's


---------54:45----------
great and the next day Jake didn't want


---------54:49----------
to go out and stream and Jake and bake


---------54:51----------
said you got a stream bro because it's a


---------54:53----------
real thing and so like on that day Jake


---------54:56----------
and bake took over


---------54:59----------
and he said like hey man like it's not


---------55:01----------
about you anymore it's about me and and


---------55:06----------
so this right so and it was hard because


---------55:10----------
when Jacob Baek takes over like Jake's


---------55:12----------
not ready for it and then you kind of


---------55:13----------
stay at home and and whatnot so fun so


---------55:16----------
now like we get into it another problem


---------55:18----------
which is that once Jake and Baek takes


---------55:20----------
over there's a particular vulnerability


---------55:22----------
that you have which is that you've


---------55:24----------
always been someone who is watching the


---------55:28----------
reactions of other people mm-hmm and so


---------55:31----------
if you have a mind that watches the


---------55:32----------
reactions of other people and can be


---------55:34----------
self-deprecating and can cause them to


---------55:36----------
smile that is like that is just lighter


---------55:40----------
fuel for Jake and Baek right because


---------55:44----------
like you take a guy who's very tuned in


---------55:46----------
to like not wanting to be disliked and


---------55:48----------
now we see the struggle because like at


---------55:51----------
times Jake and Baek speaks and Jake and


---------55:53----------
Baek says yeah I really don't want to be


---------55:54----------
disliked it's not okay for me to be


---------55:56----------
disliked it makes me deeply


---------55:58----------
uncomfortable when I look at someone and


---------56:00----------
I can't make this file but the funny


---------56:02----------
thing is that Jake is there too and Jake


---------56:04----------
is like I embrace discomfort and I


---------56:07----------
challenged myself and I took the road


---------56:09----------
less traveled and I survived and I can


---------56:11----------
be confident in Who I am and there


---------56:13----------
really are people that have disliked me


---------56:14----------
in the past and I can be completely fine


---------56:16----------
with that mm-hmm but Jake and Baek there


---------56:19----------
is also there and he's kind of like


---------56:21----------
looking at the judgments of oh he's like


---------56:23----------
watching the faces of other people like


---------56:24----------
you see that like you're confident you


---------56:27----------
but then Jake and Baek is in the back


---------56:28----------
and he's like watching the faces of


---------56:29----------
other people in psycho [ __ ] that guy


---------56:31----------
doesn't like me better attack a joke


---------56:32----------
hmm so that's how you are and then like


---------56:35----------
Jake and Baek sort of [ __ ] feeds on


---------56:37----------
that is its fertile soil mm-hmm and then


---------56:42----------
it starts to get worse right so like the


---------56:45----------
Jake and Baek sort of takes over on


---------56:47----------
January 1st 2019 and he takes over for


---------56:50----------
just one day and then in on a given day


---------56:53----------
it's like Jake is piloting or Jake in


---------56:56----------
Vegas piloting and depending on who's


---------56:58----------
piloting you feel anxiety or you don't


---------57:00----------
feel anxiety and then what happens is


---------57:03----------
this is just the way that your brain


---------57:04----------
works you doing okay good so then what


---------57:09----------
happens is like your anxiety programming


---------57:12----------
turns on because


---------57:12----------
that's just how our mind works it's like


---------57:14----------
when you see you know when you see a


---------57:16----------
toilet you have a certain automatic


---------57:17----------
programming that kicks in based on the


---------57:20----------
stimulus your mind is like your brain is


---------57:22----------
like okay we're in this situation again


---------57:24----------
let's turn on all the switches that


---------57:26----------
apply to this situation okay and once


---------57:29----------
anxiety starts it's like oh [ __ ] we know


---------57:31----------
this we've done this before


---------57:33----------
fear of death here we go right and then


---------57:35----------
it arises and then your fear of death


---------57:37----------
like sort of starts to come back and


---------57:39----------
it's like what the [ __ ] I dealt with


---------57:40----------
this and it's it's like yeah you dealt


---------57:42----------
with it but your brain is like oh this


---------57:44----------
applies that's how it works so our brain


---------57:46----------
scans our environment looks into the


---------57:49----------
past and says what have we learned about


---------57:52----------
this situation let's access it again and


---------57:55----------
I know it sounds really simple but like


---------57:57----------
that's the way that you know how to


---------57:58----------
function like you can't you know when


---------58:00----------
you get a toothbrush your brain doesn't


---------58:02----------
say like what is this strange device you


---------58:04----------
don't treat it as brand-new your brain


---------58:06----------
recalls what have I done with this thing


---------58:09----------
before what is everything that I know


---------58:10----------
about a toothbrush and let's like turn


---------58:12----------
on that circuitry again and then you


---------58:13----------
brush your teeth and you don't pay


---------58:14----------
attention so it's almost like your brain


---------58:17----------
is reactivating your anxiety right and


---------58:20----------
then you got like okay and then like


---------58:22----------
maybe there's some stuff in here I mean


---------58:23----------
maybe if you want to say a therapist you


---------58:25----------
can talk about it's kind of [ __ ] but you


---------58:26----------
know maybe there's some fear that you


---------58:28----------
are getting older and that like that's


---------58:30----------
sort of giving you like if you know if


---------58:32----------
we want to get super like if you want to


---------58:33----------
talk if it's like the Sigmund Freud sin


---------58:35----------
people say is that your your decrease in


---------58:38----------
vision is giving you a sense of your own


---------58:40----------
mortality and you are facing mortality


---------58:42----------
once again and the fear of death is


---------58:44----------
returning right so you can say all that


---------58:46----------
[ __ ] I don't know if it's true or not


---------58:48----------
yeah and then and then the other thing


---------58:52----------
is that once the anxiety starts then you


---------58:54----------
start becoming future-oriented again


---------58:55----------
right then it then it comes back to like


---------58:57----------
what if something's wrong what if


---------58:58----------
something is a little bit wrong with me


---------58:59----------
hmm


---------59:00----------
and then I ask you well what's the


---------59:01----------
problem with that you say like well like


---------59:03----------
the problem with that is that if


---------59:04----------
something will live it is wrong with me


---------59:06----------
like let's be honest Jake you didn't say


---------59:08----------
it but we all know it is that that


---------59:09----------
little something could be something


---------59:11----------
bigger down the road that's the fear


---------59:13----------
right is that it could be cancer like


---------59:15----------
maybe you've got a brain tumor like


---------59:17----------
that's what you're afraid of in the


---------59:18----------
completely irrational way and if you go


---------59:20----------
search on WebMD it gets worse yeah it's


---------59:23----------
exactly what I thought


---------59:25----------
by the way I do want to like to say it


---------59:27----------
maybe I might have said fear death I


---------59:28----------
think the overall thing was I had really


---------59:29----------
been hypochondria which led to the fear


---------59:31----------
of death yeah same same thing same yeah


---------59:33----------
same conclusion yeah that's when you


---------59:35----------
think you have cancer that's type of


---------59:36----------
community right yeah so good right so


---------59:38----------
like that's what you've been thinking


---------59:40----------
and then if we think about it like once


---------59:42----------
you start thinking that this comes to


---------59:43----------
the crux of it and this is how I think


---------59:44----------
you conquered your anxiety yep


---------59:47----------
anxiety is concerned about what point in


---------59:52----------
time like when is anxiety concerned like


---------59:56----------
what is it worried about the past the


---------59:58----------
present of the future future and when


---------60:01----------
you start living your life in a way that


---------60:03----------
you can die tomorrow when are you


---------60:05----------
concerned


---------60:05----------
what do you concil it absolutely yeah


---------60:08----------
yeah it's that simple yeah right so when


---------60:12----------
you start living in the today like


---------60:14----------
literally as we talked about earlier


---------60:16----------
that there are some things that satisfy


---------60:18----------
your anxiety and feed it right it's just


---------60:20----------
like hunger like what happens when I


---------60:23----------
like if I take a three-year-old and the


---------60:25----------
three-year-old is hungry and I give it


---------60:28----------
food does the three-year-old feel


---------60:29----------
satisfied it's not sure questioner I


---------60:35----------
think yes yes and then what happens to


---------60:38----------
the three-year-old that I feed what does


---------60:41----------
it become full absolutely and then over


---------60:48----------
time they grow right because if you feed


---------60:51----------
something yeah it grows and then what


---------60:53----------
happens to the three-year-olds hunger a


---------60:55----------
year later it gets more eats a little


---------60:58----------
more absolutely right so like then what


---------61:02----------
happens is the more that you start


---------61:03----------
living in the future if you search WebMD


---------61:06----------
or if you do other things like if you


---------61:09----------
let yourself look at the reactions of


---------61:10----------
others in cave to the reactions of


---------61:13----------
others then what happens is all you're


---------61:16----------
doing is like feeding that thing which


---------61:18----------
then grows and grows and grows and then


---------61:20----------
you did something really really amazing


---------61:22----------
which is that like you stopped feeding


---------61:24----------
it right because you felt those


---------61:26----------
anxieties when you woke up every day and


---------61:27----------
you shifted your mindset you can't


---------61:30----------
convince me that you didn't feel that


---------61:32----------
anxiety you just turned away from it you


---------61:35----------
didn't satisfy it and it probably felt


---------61:37----------
very very discomforting


---------61:39----------
as you turned away from it and you were


---------61:41----------
like okay I'm gonna start to live in the


---------61:43----------
present yeah and then you started to


---------61:46----------
feel bliss and you're like wow that


---------61:48----------
sounds super grandiose no Ben but that's


---------61:50----------
how it works like that's what Yogi's in


---------61:52----------
saying for thousands of years is that


---------61:54----------
focusing on the present and freeing


---------61:55----------
yourself from the attachment of the


---------61:58----------
future yeah and because that's what


---------62:01----------
you're doing right you're saying like I


---------62:03----------
could die tomorrow you are letting go of


---------62:06----------
anything that could happen in the future


---------62:07----------
it could all be for naught but you're


---------62:10----------
gonna do today the way that you want to


---------62:12----------
do today and that leads to bliss that's


---------62:15----------
the right word actually it's not a


---------62:17----------
grandiose term yeah that's exactly how I


---------62:20----------
felt and then what happens is as you


---------62:23----------
start living in the future who lives in


---------62:27----------
the future Jake or Jake and baked


---------62:30----------
probably Jake and Pigman here's the


---------62:32----------
reigns right now absolutely right and so


---------62:35----------
then like the more that you live in the


---------62:36----------
future the more it becomes Jake and bake


---------62:38----------
the more it becomes is my stream going


---------62:40----------
uphill or is it going downhill do people


---------62:43----------
like it or do people not like it then


---------62:44----------
you start to think these thoughts and


---------62:46----------
then the opinions of others and all that


---------62:48----------
[ __ ] starts to roll in and then your


---------62:50----------
brain is like oh [ __ ] this is anxiety


---------62:52----------
like let's start being afraid of death


---------62:54----------
again let's oh we're thinking about the


---------62:55----------
future let's throw in a little bit of


---------62:57----------
hypochondria because that's what we do


---------62:58----------
when we think about the future and you


---------63:00----------
move further and further and further


---------63:01----------
away from Jake yep yes I mean damn


---------63:08----------
that's cool that's very uh yeah I still


---------63:13----------
going I'm listening it's good this is


---------63:16----------
very OnPoint right now yeah I think


---------63:19----------
that's like kind of the end of the cycle


---------63:20----------
right so yeah I mean yeah that's it's


---------63:26----------
it's it's cool to see how you kind of


---------63:27----------
mapped it all out this is something that


---------63:30----------
the way you mapped it out I mean it's


---------63:31----------
really well put into words I've kind of


---------63:34----------
had the feeling of like this exact


---------63:36----------
exactly we just said of like I'm just


---------63:39----------
not even like so I live with my


---------63:40----------
girlfriend now and my best friend since


---------63:42----------
I was like nine years old like he's like


---------63:43----------
my brother like we talked through the


---------63:45----------
year like he helped me out when I'm out


---------63:46----------
struggling at that time in 19 I helped


---------63:49----------
out through some stuff and hid like


---------63:49----------
we've been very back and forth I'm like


---------63:51----------
empowering each other but um even my


---------63:55----------
talking to him I think the biggest thing


---------63:57----------
I realize is like I've just lost my say


---------64:00----------
I'm lost in the sauce like I want to


---------64:02----------
joke around with him like I'm kind of


---------64:03----------
lost in the sauce like I'm just I am


---------64:05----------
I've just become a little bit away from


---------64:08----------
who I really am because we're streaming


---------64:11----------
so I've been trying to take these like I


---------64:13----------
say these little steps to get back but I


---------64:15----------
really think and that maybe this is


---------64:17----------
where the problem is like I can't seem


---------64:20----------
to like 100% come in I really think it's


---------64:22----------
hard to do while maintaining a live


---------64:26----------
stream like I don't want it goat so I


---------64:28----------
don't know how deep we can go in a live


---------64:29----------
streaming but like it's just it's such a


---------64:32----------
oh man


---------64:35----------
I'm thinking now about the judgment of


---------64:36----------
that people we need to when streamers


---------64:38----------
talk about their jobs it's always like I


---------64:39----------
know what chat thinks cuz I used to be


---------64:41----------
chat but like many jobs across the board


---------64:46----------
are always demanding all the time


---------64:49----------
streaming is one of those that is like


---------64:51----------
24/7 mental demand and I think that it's


---------64:54----------
hard to find Jake while I stream as I do


---------64:57----------
because it's like if I free Verbeck and


---------65:02----------
I don't know like or maybe it's a good


---------65:03----------
thing maybe if I went fully back to Jake


---------65:05----------
Ansari maybe my she would be cool I


---------65:07----------
don't know like ah yeah anyways I just


---------65:10----------
think it's very hard to pivot and make


---------65:11----------
huge life changes while you are alive


---------65:14----------
streamer because there's just like so so


---------65:17----------
Jake that's the problem just listen to


---------65:19----------
the statement you're making okay this


---------65:20----------
that statement is the problem your


---------65:23----------
salvation never came through pivoting


---------65:25----------
and making huge life changes you never


---------65:27----------
tried to pivot


---------65:28----------
you never said I'm gonna turn around 180


---------65:30----------
degrees what did you say to yourself how


---------65:32----------
did you turn around 180 degrees I just


---------65:36----------
change our mindset anyway why it's not


---------65:38----------
yes you're not carrying just like not


---------65:42----------
not carrying but to just living for


---------65:44----------
right now absolutely right you said


---------65:46----------
about what I don't care about 180


---------65:47----------
degrees and even now you're saying I


---------65:49----------
don't know how to turn things around


---------65:51----------
oh right you see it you're saying I


---------65:55----------
don't know how to go back 180 degrees to


---------65:57----------
what I used to be but that's not how you


---------65:59----------
got to where you used to be you started


---------66:01----------
by moving one degree that's what you


---------66:04----------
should focus on


---------66:06----------
and even though you say oh if I become


---------66:08----------
Jake again I don't know if my stream


---------66:09----------
will explode there it is again


---------66:11----------
still Jake and bake that's Jake and bake


---------66:13----------
hijacking Jake and he says yeah Jake


---------66:16----------
like bu bu buddy like I'm still gonna


---------66:18----------
take the reins but let's let's pretend


---------66:20----------
that you're gonna be in charge it's


---------66:23----------
still Jake ensign I'm still looking I'm


---------66:25----------
looking at Messiah and I'm about to


---------66:26----------
[ __ ] knee it in half


---------66:27----------
do you see this thing sorry it's like


---------66:28----------
yeah there's a site above my head yeah


---------66:31----------
this is a weird it's hovering always


---------66:34----------
hovering oh my god okay Amy's sorry good


---------66:39----------
no it's good it's a very minute we're


---------66:41----------
gonna break it it's very memorable it's


---------66:43----------
cool yeah right so so that's Jake Jake


---------66:47----------
is the one who can recognize that that


---------66:49----------
sign is your curse and is something to


---------66:51----------
be appreciated that your streaming


---------66:53----------

---------66:56----------
that you enjoy it and it's a lot of fun

---------67:07----------

---------67:19----------

---------67:21----------
like sure it's awesome and fulfilling


---------67:23----------
but it's lots of [ __ ] exhausting and


---------67:25----------
sucks sometimes yep Yeah right it's like


---------67:28----------
sometimes I wanted likes it out like


---------67:30----------
sometimes I want to play video games


---------67:32----------
until 4:00 in the morning and then like


---------67:33----------
sleep until noon but the thing is your


---------67:35----------
kid wakes up when they wake up and like

---------67:45----------
and like I wanted to sleep because our


---------67:47----------
along went off at 5:00 in the morning


---------67:48----------
and then and then she like picked up my


---------67:52----------
hat like I was like sleeping and then


---------67:54----------
she was like trying to wake me up and


---------67:55----------
then she like picked up my head and like


---------67:57----------
looked it in the face and then she


---------67:59----------
kissed me on the face and then she laid


---------68:02----------
down on my pillow so that I couldn't


---------68:04----------
even lay down on the pillow and then I


---------68:06----------
put my head I was really actually really


---------68:07----------
cute it's like very nice but it was also


---------68:09----------
like I'm still tired today you know and


---------68:12----------
that's what Jake and bake live is Jake


---------68:15----------
and bake like demands your attention and


---------68:17----------
needs it's like a hungry hungry child


---------68:20----------
and you can appreciate it but also be


---------68:22----------
like man you know gotta like lay off


---------68:24----------
from time to time and you need a break


---------68:26----------

---------68:32----------
like where do you think you go from here


---------68:33----------

---------68:37----------
help yourself yeah I mean I've like I


---------68:42----------
said I've been I've been like trying to


---------68:43----------
work towards little things I know that I


---------68:44----------
really enjoyed doing that really made me


---------68:46----------
feel like I was kind of her production


---------68:49----------
by feel like I was just purpose every


---------68:51----------
day had purpose like you know so little


---------68:53----------
things I used to work like just little


---------68:54----------
work out or a little yoga every morning


---------68:56----------
just like I've been trying to take a


---------68:58----------
little bit more personal time from


---------69:01----------
stream and like off time I think like


---------69:08----------

---------69:11----------
important is that I've kind of like


---------69:12----------
recognized and it's the way you're


---------69:15----------
putting two words is great because it's


---------69:16----------
like even easier to kind of see but I've


---------69:18----------
kind of recognized these things and I


---------69:19----------
just I kind of know how to fix them it's


---------69:22----------
just I've been taking baby steps and


---------69:24----------
like I'm not seeing results fast enough


---------69:26----------
and then like you know not seeing


---------69:28----------
yourself a step is that jqj can bake


---------69:33----------
that might be that might actually just


---------69:35----------
be a Jake thing of me just thinking like


---------69:38----------
wow you did this before you know exactly


---------69:40----------
what it feels like and what it feels


---------69:41----------
like when you have good days we're like


---------69:43----------
there's some days where like if I don't


---------69:44----------
see him for two days I'm actually with


---------69:46----------
my friends we went on a hike the day


---------69:47----------
before and I didn't go on the computer


---------69:49----------
actually like I'll wake up and I'll feel


---------69:51----------
like crisp and I'm like holy [ __ ] like


---------69:53----------
I've had a few those days where I'm just


---------69:55----------
wake up I'm like dude like and those are


---------69:58----------
those are reassuring days it's like dude


---------69:59----------
and that you can it's just gonna take a


---------70:02----------
little time some effort you can do this


---------70:03----------
like those are my reassuring days but um


---------70:06----------
anyways sorry good inside you yeah so so


---------70:09----------
I want to just point that out right so


---------70:11----------
like just just pay attention to this


---------70:13----------
thought look at this thought okay I'm


---------70:15----------
not getting better fast enough and it's


---------70:19----------
gonna take some time okay


---------70:21----------
those are like contrary to me I think


---------70:24----------
one is Jake and bacon one is Jake and


---------70:25----------
you say that the days that you're crisp


---------70:27----------
you say it's gonna take it's gonna take


---------70:30----------
some time and on other days you say it's


---------70:32----------
not happening


---------70:33----------
hmm those are two different people


---------70:36----------
holding the reins I really don't think


---------70:37----------
that that's the same person nobody


---------70:40----------
pulled her in no you're not this is


---------70:42----------
normal buddy this is how everyone is


---------70:44----------
okay so like just just let's think about


---------70:47----------
the scientific me for a second so first


---------70:49----------
of all I think I do think that you know


---------70:50----------
a lot of this stuff I can't put the


---------70:52----------
peace thing you give me the pieces of


---------70:54----------
the puzzle I just put them together like


---------70:56----------
you you're the one who's giving me this


---------70:57----------
so you know this on some level second


---------71:00----------
thing oh yeah


---------71:03----------
second thing is that you're not weird


---------71:04----------
like the reason that I'm able to do this


---------71:07----------
is because you're like other people


---------71:10----------
right like that's the only way that I


---------71:12----------
could do this it's not like I'm


---------71:13----------
discovering something brand-new for the


---------71:15----------
first time it's like this is how people


---------71:17----------
work like the design of the ID works


---------71:18----------
anxiety literally cannot exist in the


---------71:21----------
past and cannot exist in the present it


---------71:23----------
must exist in the future and if your


---------71:26----------
mind is in the present you cannot be


---------71:28----------
experiencing anxiety this is why video


---------71:31----------
games are so [ __ ] addictive because


---------71:32----------
when you're raging at your teammate in


---------71:34----------
law you're not thinking about how sorry


---------71:38----------
yeah at least for kids by the way I


---------71:41----------
don't live you know that hey don't get


---------71:43----------
me started bro


---------71:44----------
a lot of people on my stream like League


---------71:47----------
and I I'm I'm a donum I'm a big fan of


---------71:50----------
dude oh oh yeah man i culture alright


---------71:52----------
sorry let's go boomers boomers of the


---------71:55----------
world unite yeah kids because I played


---------71:59----------
the actually like for the first time a


---------72:00----------
couple weeks ago it's actually kind of


---------72:02----------
fun


---------72:02----------
hey it's just a different game it's like


---------72:04----------
apples and oranges I think it's like one


---------72:06----------
of these everyone can get kind of


---------72:08----------
hoity-toity about what their own


---------72:09----------
personal preferences are right you can


---------72:11----------
think that your personal preferences


---------72:13----------
make you greater than another human


---------72:14----------
being but it's it's more like apples and


---------72:17----------
pre-sliced packaged apples that's the


---------72:19----------
difference so you played oh yeah


---------72:26----------
interesting


---------72:27----------
we're not see I'm I don't play a lot but


---------72:28----------
I'll right now play a lot of Valor in so


---------72:31----------
I totally got sidetracked sorry you're


---------72:32----------
really making profound statements no no


---------72:34----------
that's good as well just get triggered


---------72:36----------
by legal guards great I mean I like see


---------72:39----------
us for a long time so it's fun just like


---------72:42----------
counter-strike with a little cherry on


---------72:43----------
top with all the abilities but you get


---------72:45----------
cool


---------72:47----------
yeah anyway so just thinking so so I


---------72:49----------
think you're not you're not like that


---------72:51----------
weird or anything Jake don't don't worry


---------72:53----------
about it man you're like it's completely


---------72:54----------
like I think a lot of what your thoughts


---------72:56----------
are actually quite logical even though


---------72:58----------
if they don't feel the only reason they


---------73:00----------
seem illogical is because we don't


---------73:02----------
understand like where they're coming


---------73:03----------
from like even your fear of death


---------73:05----------
returning it's like actually kind of


---------73:06----------
makes sense like it doesn't make sense


---------73:08----------
from within the mind but once you


---------73:09----------
understand how the mind works it's just


---------73:11----------
your mind is like oh we've been here


---------73:12----------
before let's turn on our programming yep


---------73:16----------
and and you know yeah so small doses of


---------73:22----------
living in the present like any other


---------73:24----------
thoughts about how you move forward from


---------73:26----------
here I have a couple of suggestions but


---------73:28----------
I'm curious like what you think umm well


---------73:33----------
I don't know I honestly I really thought


---------73:35----------
and I still think that my move back to


---------73:37----------
LA was huge being around friends and


---------73:39----------
family and kind of like being able to at


---------73:41----------
least have some what sometimes don't


---------73:43----------
like than just normal life stuff going


---------73:45----------
on however just like like timing and I


---------73:47----------
was just really bad like I you know just


---------73:50----------
unable to cause I'm like hard to see


---------73:52----------
it's just it's just out of my control I


---------73:54----------
don't I just not gonna worry about that


---------73:55----------
I'm just letting the time go on and like


---------73:57----------
until things kind of stabilize but that


---------74:00----------
was one thing I thought was a huge step


---------74:02----------
was kind of being back home true and


---------74:04----------
good little life little lifestyle things


---------74:06----------
that I I mean sounds kind of weird but I


---------74:09----------
recently bought a car I like driving I


---------74:11----------
haven't drove in years so I lived abroad


---------74:12----------
and just driving my car on the highway


---------74:14----------
makes me feel like human again sounds


---------74:16----------
kind of weird but I like I love that


---------74:18----------
feeling and like I didn't get four years


---------74:21----------
and little things like that I think are


---------74:25----------
really good actually


---------74:27----------
yeah so so I think those are awesome a


---------74:30----------
couple of other things to just think


---------74:32----------
about and and if that's sufficient I


---------74:36----------
mean that may work alright I think it


---------74:38----------
really will work just a couple cherries


---------74:40----------
on top let's call them okay so the first


---------74:43----------
thing is I think a lot of people have


---------74:44----------
this idea that doing something the


---------74:46----------
second time should be easier than doing


---------74:48----------
it the first time in my experience


---------74:50----------
that's actually not true like getting up


---------74:53----------
and working out one day is easier than


---------74:56----------
getting up and working out the


---------74:57----------
next day hmm right so like don't judge


---------75:02----------
yourself for being quote-unquote back to


---------75:05----------
square one because I actually think that


---------75:06----------
you know because you're kind of saying


---------75:08----------
like okay this is the formula that


---------75:10----------
worked for the first time therefore let


---------75:12----------
me implement it again and it should work


---------75:14----------
for the second time I think what you're


---------75:16----------
dealing with is actually different the


---------75:18----------
resurgence of the problem is a different


---------75:20----------
thing


---------75:21----------
the third time is easier than the second


---------75:23----------
time but like I don't know how to say


---------75:26----------
this it's just like you know overcoming


---------75:30----------
something once is different from


---------75:32----------
overcoming it the second time or Rio


---------75:35----------
we're coming yet


---------75:36----------
but third time is also Rio ver coming


---------75:38----------
yet I don't know if that makes sense


---------75:43----------
you mean like the first if you did it


---------75:45----------
the first time the second time is might


---------75:48----------
be difficult and more difficult but the


---------75:50----------
third time because these you've done it


---------75:53----------
you've done it this way and even it this


---------75:55----------
way maybe now you understand I think


---------76:05----------
those are actually different skills sure


---------76:07----------
okay and but the thing is doing


---------76:09----------
something again is its own skill so


---------76:12----------
therefore third fourth fifth sixth


---------76:13----------
seventh eighth ninth tenth times are


---------76:15----------
doing something again so I'll give you


---------76:19----------
just an example okay I got it so like


---------76:21----------
like actually I should have started with


---------76:23----------
this so I in my day job I'm an addiction


---------76:26----------
psychiatrist okay so like let me put it


---------76:29----------
this way when someone gets sober for the


---------76:31----------
first time it's awesome if they relapse


---------76:35----------
getting sober again is actually harder


---------76:38----------
okay because they you know they got


---------76:40----------
sober first and then they were like yeah


---------76:42----------
man I did it and then there's this whole


---------76:44----------
other layer of shame and difficulty if


---------76:47----------
they come crashing down got it right


---------76:50----------
because like building something for the


---------76:51----------
first time is different from like


---------76:54----------
cleaning out the rubble of like failing


---------76:56----------
and then trying to do it again hmm


---------76:58----------
but then the third fourth fifth time


---------77:00----------
that they relapse they actually start to


---------77:02----------
get better at it but that first relapse


---------77:04----------
is a whole different ball game from like


---------77:06----------
the first time you become sober does


---------77:08----------
that make sense yes yes right so like


---------77:11----------
getting so


---------77:12----------
the first time in relapsing relapsing is


---------77:14----------
a whole different ballgame than like


---------77:16----------
doing something first so so I would give


---------77:20----------
yourself a little bit of slack and like


---------77:23----------
cut yourself a break if it does take


---------77:25----------
longer than it's supposed to because


---------77:28----------
it's not the same thing yeah right like


---------77:30----------
like overcoming something when you were


---------77:32----------
19 was different from being a streamer


---------77:35----------
and having this artificial pressure of


---------77:38----------
the stream taking advantage of your your


---------77:42----------
personality of being very tuned in to


---------77:45----------
what people think and becoming disco


---------77:48----------
uncomfortable with their dislike like do


---------77:50----------
you see how like that's the way you've


---------77:52----------
always been but being a stream or just


---------77:53----------
[ __ ] puts that [ __ ] on steroids yeah


---------77:56----------
yeah yeah right so it's it's not like


---------77:59----------
you're not 19 anymore man and like I


---------78:01----------
don't mean that in a good way I like you


---------78:04----------
know it's like it's like it's a whole


---------78:06----------
different ballgame that you're in you're


---------78:07----------
in the big leagues now so your anxiety


---------78:09----------
is gonna have different things to feed


---------78:11----------
on and so it's not it's gonna take it


---------78:13----------
may take longer the next thing is that I


---------78:17----------
would I think it would really help you


---------78:19----------
to be present in the tension so in the


---------78:24----------
past you used to be present in your


---------78:26----------
progress but the question is can you be


---------78:30----------
present in not progressing and like I


---------78:35----------
don't even know if that makes sense but


---------78:37----------
like if you can just even acknowledge


---------78:39----------
that like okay today is a day that I


---------78:41----------
can't move one degree and if you can sit


---------78:45----------
with that and then like because if the


---------78:47----------
thing is when you don't move a single


---------78:48----------
degree what our mind tends to do is move


---------78:50----------
into the future and you think about the


---------78:52----------
consequences of failure today right but


---------78:56----------
there's a funny way that you can


---------78:57----------
actually disarm all of this [ __ ] is if


---------78:59----------
you can sit with your failure today and


---------79:02----------
not projected into the future mm-hmm and


---------79:05----------
it's kind of saying that's kind of like


---------79:07----------
what I'm doing with the fact that


---------79:09----------
there's a virus going on and like I'm in


---------79:11----------
LA like I can't control I'm just kind of


---------79:13----------
letting it great perfect I think that's


---------79:16----------
that's because you're kind of saying


---------79:17----------
like oh I'm stuck and I'm not like I


---------79:19----------
came here to do this and it's not


---------79:20----------
happening is that what you mean


---------79:22----------
yeah but I'm very real about it like I'm


---------79:24----------
just like it's out of my control like I


---------79:25----------
got


---------79:25----------
that kind of play out and then I can


---------79:27----------
beautiful those steps right so I have to


---------79:29----------
let that play out is not like you trying


---------79:32----------
to plan for the exits right so if your


---------79:34----------
anxiety was active if jake and make was


---------79:36----------
active what you would be doing is


---------79:38----------
looking for the exits and looking for


---------79:39----------
the bathrooms planning for eventualities


---------79:41----------
but what's happening Jake is like


---------79:44----------
nothing I can do bro yeah just gotta let


---------79:47----------
it play out


---------79:48----------
and then when things calm down I'll


---------79:49----------
figure out what I'm gonna do and Jake


---------79:51----------
and I don't say pro but yeah yeah yeah


---------79:54----------
yeah


---------79:55----------
si bro um do you yeah I my biggest


---------80:00----------
concern is that it's not inclusive to


---------80:02----------
certain portions of our audience but I


---------80:04----------
sort of use them in gender-neutral way


---------80:06----------
which may mean misogynistic oh yeah well


---------80:10----------
it's the internet so you're everything I


---------80:11----------
don't know yeah so I like you know I I'd


---------80:16----------
say that even if you can sit with the


---------80:18----------
tension of not moving forward and be in


---------80:20----------
the present of not advancing that in a


---------80:24----------
weird way can pull the plug out from


---------80:27----------
your anxiety does that make sense like


---------80:29----------
you don't have to be progressing to be


---------80:30----------
in the present the key thing is to be in


---------80:31----------
the present you don't have to be taking


---------80:34----------
those baby steps even if you sit with


---------80:35----------
the failure of not being able to take a


---------80:37----------
baby step today it'll actually still do


---------80:40----------
the same thing okay


---------80:43----------
and the last thing is sometimes I teach


---------80:44----------
people how to meditate so I can teach do


---------80:47----------
you meditate um no when I was night one


---------80:51----------
of things I tried and I actually got to


---------80:52----------
a point where I tell Sharon a time


---------80:55----------
stream so I there's like one song that


---------80:58----------
triggers my favorite song I'll expect my


---------81:00----------
for relaxation song and there's a point


---------81:03----------
route like I'll just practice meditation


---------81:04----------
YouTube techniques and that one fit I


---------81:06----------
was like super spiritually meditating it


---------81:08----------
was jr. and he kind of like taught me a


---------81:10----------
little bit and there's one point I could


---------81:12----------
meditate so if you if that I hadn't


---------81:13----------
headphones in with music and I could


---------81:14----------
tune out the music was gone and like it


---------81:16----------
was really cool actually but I know I do


---------81:18----------
not meditate but I thought sure you can


---------81:20----------
think that you do you meditate I think


---------81:22----------
for see one's dreams no yeah yes I'm


---------81:25----------
sorry you do meditate yeah sure yeah so


---------81:29----------
I wanted to share that with you cuz I


---------81:30----------
thought that was super but that was


---------81:32----------
actually really cool at that and that's


---------81:33----------
like yeah a lot of people don't believe


---------81:35----------
in meditation but I thought it was


---------81:37----------
really cool that it's real


---------81:38----------
yeah


---------81:39----------
yeah no I do not do you want to learn


---------81:41----------
today I mean maybe yeah I'm open for


---------81:45----------
everything I'm hope I'm an open-minded


---------81:47----------
person and I'm ready for anything I


---------81:50----------
think except for okay things so okay I


---------81:56----------
was gonna say a joke but go for anything


---------81:58----------
Billy I don't need to do that I'll say


---------82:00----------
I'm up for anything except for but stuff


---------82:01----------
like that's the joke I was gonna say but


---------82:03----------
like it's I don't know if this is the


---------82:04----------
right context streaming is like just in


---------82:09----------
there it's just taking fake talking okay


---------82:10----------
just trying to make a joke and Havok you


---------82:11----------
so that's what I'm saying it's like


---------82:13----------
letting him talk but just be aware who's


---------82:15----------
talking right so like let him out from


---------82:16----------
time to time all right


---------82:20----------
I think Jake's Jake's been operating


---------82:22----------
long enough Jake and Baker


---------82:24----------
shake it bake it deserves it a run on


---------82:27----------
the on the track you know I gotta let


---------82:29----------
them exercise and come out there from


---------82:30----------
time to time but yeah yeah so you said


---------82:35----------
maybe and you said you're up for


---------82:36----------
anything so I'm not quite sure yes okay


---------82:39----------
yes I would all right so I'll teach you


---------82:40----------
a meditation technique and and you know


---------82:43----------
what I would tell you is that the goal


---------82:44----------
of is you people ask me how often should


---------82:46----------
I meditate and then I say you know three


---------82:49----------
to five minutes to start out with three


---------82:51----------
to five times a week but in your case


---------82:53----------
the answer is gonna be today okay right


---------82:58----------
so like be careful about setting a


---------82:59----------
schedule for yourself in terms of


---------83:00----------
meditation we do yoga that's really good


---------83:02----------
so you have yes so the last thing is


---------83:08----------
that you you know may be worth your


---------83:10----------
while to see a therapist or mental


---------83:12----------
health professional if this stuff


---------83:14----------
continues or starts to impair your


---------83:16----------
function okay right so like I'm sure


---------83:19----------
that someone somewhere could diagnose


---------83:20----------
you with an anxiety disorder because


---------83:24----------
people like diagnosing people with


---------83:25----------
things but that's not something you I'm


---------83:27----------
not I'm not telling you you have this


---------83:29----------
it's just like you need a more thorough


---------83:30----------
evaluation and they'll ask you a lot of


---------83:32----------
questions that I didn't ask you like for


---------83:35----------
example you know does anyone in your


---------83:37----------
family have anxiety and like you know


---------83:39----------
how long did it last and all this kind


---------83:40----------
of good stuff


---------83:42----------
so you know having to find the exits by


---------83:45----------
the way is something called agoraphobia


---------83:47----------
so that that sense of of like needing to


---------83:51----------
escape and needing


---------83:52----------
safety and being assured of like safety


---------83:55----------
is like oftentimes or is one


---------83:57----------
manifestation of something called


---------83:59----------
agoraphobia which sometimes also people


---------84:01----------
call his like fear of going outside so


---------84:04----------
they stay at home because they're afraid


---------84:06----------
of like what could happen if they leave


---------84:07----------
the house yeah yeah so you know I I'd


---------84:13----------
say that if it really starts to affect


---------84:14----------
you I'd really strongly consider seeing


---------84:16----------
a mental health professional and see if


---------84:18----------
you actually you know do fit criteria


---------84:20----------
for an anxiety disorder and there are


---------84:22----------
treatments for that treatments for


---------84:23----------
anxiety disorders include like


---------84:25----------
psychotherapy like talk therapy exposure


---------84:27----------
therapy which is when you kind of like


---------84:29----------
expose yourself to whatever you know


---------84:31----------
induces the anxiety in medication yeah


---------84:37----------
yeah so let's meditate let me just think


---------84:40----------
I don't want to say anything else any


---------84:41----------
questions for me uh no okay I'm not


---------84:46----------
really I mean yeah so something else for


---------84:50----------
you to just chew on so you know


---------84:52----------
sometimes I talk about Karma garma hmm


---------84:56----------
and and you know you don't have to


---------84:58----------
believe this it's just I find it


---------84:59----------
fascinating that like you know I think


---------85:01----------
that your initial bout of anxiety was


---------85:04----------
part of your the way I see that I'm not


---------85:07----------
saying it's true it's just the way that


---------85:09----------
I conceptualize people I think I look


---------85:12----------
through them through the lens of karma


---------85:14----------
and the really interesting thing is that


---------85:16----------
without your fear of death I don't think


---------85:18----------
you would have become the person that


---------85:19----------
you are today so I see a strong karmic


---------85:21----------
influence there that essentially like


---------85:24----------
you know that was a pretty big event


---------85:27----------
that altered the course of your life and


---------85:29----------
if you feel so inclined to indulge in


---------85:32----------
this kind of irrational thinking and


---------85:34----------
then I would encourage you to think a


---------85:36----------
little bit about your current challenge


---------85:38----------
and whether that's also life signaling


---------85:40----------
you to like take take stock of where you


---------85:44----------
are right now and don't just act on Auto


---------85:48----------
because that's essentially what your


---------85:50----------
fear of death did for you back then is


---------85:52----------
it like kind of woke you up and helped


---------85:54----------
you recalibrate and put you on a path


---------85:56----------
that it sounds like has been very


---------85:58----------
enriching for you as well as like people


---------86:00----------
who watched you yeah so just something


---------86:03----------
to toss out and think about if you if


---------86:05----------
you want


---------86:06----------
appreciate ya okay so any thoughts about


---------86:11----------
that I


---------86:16----------
I mean I've I get I think I've thought


---------86:19----------
something similar just like is


---------86:21----------
everything I'm doing right now


---------86:23----------
the not the word isn't right but it's


---------86:26----------
like is there something that is like I


---------86:29----------
don't know like deeper that is just not


---------86:34----------
not correct right now like is they yeah


---------86:37----------
I thought yeah yeah yeah so I encourage


---------86:39----------
you to continue thinking about it you


---------86:40----------
know I I don't know so being sort of a


---------86:44----------
scientist by background like it's kind


---------86:46----------
of interesting because I don't know if


---------86:47----------
that's true but if you look at things


---------86:51----------
from a data perspective just because


---------86:56----------
it's true doesn't mean that it doesn't


---------86:57----------
have utility right so like


---------87:01----------
good evidence that we rethinking your


---------87:04----------
life through like a broader perspective


---------87:05----------
has utility and positive outcomes even


---------87:08----------
if it's not true hmm anyway so so I'm


---------87:13----------
glad you're thinking about it and


---------87:14----------
encourage you to continue thinking about


---------87:15----------
it maybe meditating on it exploring it


---------87:18----------
talking with your friends and and your


---------87:20----------
brother and girlfriend and stuff like


---------87:22----------
that going for long drives and mulling


---------87:24----------
it over it's a good one yeah going for


---------87:27----------
hikes things like that yeah


---------87:29----------
okay so let's meditate so sit up


---------87:31----------
straight and I'm gonna teach you the


---------87:34----------
practice that we do relatively often on


---------87:37----------
the stream but I'll just you know do it


---------87:38----------
again because we haven't taught it in a


---------87:41----------
little while and it's actually a really


---------87:43----------
really good practice for anxiety and


---------87:45----------
part of the reason it's a good practice


---------87:47----------
for anxiety is because when your mind


---------87:49----------
becomes anxious you actually activate


---------87:52----------
like your adrenaline system and you're


---------87:55----------
like danger neurocircuitry so you start


---------87:58----------
to feel like you're in danger and your


---------87:59----------
heart starts beating fast you start


---------88:01----------
getting sweaty your stomach feels a lot


---------88:03----------
to me yep so this this technique in some


---------88:08----------
so it's a weird amount of scientific


---------88:10----------
support so has some very basic


---------88:12----------
scientific support and has clinical


---------88:14----------
support but the middle part we don't


---------88:16----------
really know to be true which is weird


---------88:18----------
but basically what this technique does


---------88:20----------
is shuts off your sympathetic nervous


---------88:23----------
system and reactivates your


---------88:24----------
parasympathetic nervous system so it


---------88:26----------
shuts off your adrenaline and like kind


---------88:29----------
of like calms you down and like


---------88:30----------
activates your vagus nerve vagus nerve


---------88:32----------
is what slows down your heart adrenaline


---------88:34----------
pumps up your heart there's a vagus


---------88:36----------
nerve here I hit it you knock you out I


---------88:39----------
didn't like that one okay vagus nerve


---------88:43----------
actually runs what kind of along your


---------88:45----------
throat but I'm okay anyway second people


---------88:49----------
get yeah I mean it's it is over there


---------88:51----------
but it's like deeper it's not like near


---------88:54----------
the surface of your neck okay well I am


---------88:57----------
feeling a little nervous for now so I'm


---------88:58----------
really curious then great


---------88:59----------
so is your nose clogged just one nostril


---------89:04----------
but it's fine I can breathe with my nose


---------89:07----------
okay


---------89:09----------
so low it let me see yeah okay so one of


---------89:14----------
your nostrils is gonna be more close


---------89:15----------
than the other do you have a deviated


---------89:17----------
septum


---------89:18----------
you don't know ever been to the doctor


---------89:20----------
for that I know that is never been to


---------89:21----------
the doctor for it


---------89:22----------
okay is is the same nostril always


---------89:25----------
closed for you no but I should keep an


---------89:27----------
eye on that I've never kept tonight all


---------89:30----------
right wait yeah it's my left one so okay


---------89:33----------
good someone remember that okay so if


---------89:37----------
you're curious about that we can have a


---------89:38----------
another conversation about so I'm sort


---------89:41----------
as the rhythm of your nostrils opening


---------89:43----------
and closing but can you do this just


---------89:48----------
fall down yep great so I want you to


---------89:51----------
take your thumb and block your right


---------89:53----------
nostril


---------89:55----------
yep and then breathe in through your


---------89:58----------
left and then block this switch and


---------90:07----------
breathe out breathe in through the right


---------90:12----------
nostril again and when you have a full


---------90:18----------
breath of air switch and breathe out


---------90:24----------
breathe in through the same switch and


---------90:36----------
breathe out in switch out


---------90:54----------
I'll keep talking but go ahead close


---------90:57----------
your eyes B then switch out in switch


---------91:19----------
out it's okay yo


---------91:24----------
it's okay to yawn if you need to in


---------91:34----------
switch out and now continue at your own


---------91:40----------
pace remember to switch on a full breath


---------91:50----------
good so that in in switch on a full


---------91:59----------
breath we'll practice for about 60 to 90


---------92:03----------
seconds


---------92:50----------
you


---------94:10----------
go ahead and finish the round that


---------94:12----------
you're on Laker eyes remain closed let


---------94:19----------
your hands relax when you're done with


---------94:21----------
around and just sit and enjoy


---------95:51----------
oh hi here meditate no d1d I know I was


---------96:14----------
telling the story about you earlier it's


---------96:16----------
okay I'll bring her a minute okay come


---------96:18----------
here okay


---------96:20----------
Oh am I still meditating huh am I still


---------96:25----------
meditating I don't know are you


---------96:27----------
he told me what was that like film is


---------96:30----------
okay I could feel my heart and I was and


---------96:35----------
actually when I felt my heart I was


---------96:36----------
gonna stop and say am I supposed to hear


---------96:38----------
my heart beating but then I turned that


---------96:40----------
potential negative thought into a


---------96:42----------
positive thought and instead I embraced


---------96:44----------
my heartbeat and I wanted to feel the


---------96:46----------
rhythm and think about what it's beating


---------96:48----------
and where all the Bloods going that's


---------96:50----------
why I did actually in my head right now


---------96:51----------
well sounds great I hope so how was it


---------96:57----------
was it a pleasant experience yeah it was


---------97:00----------
I mean so I gave flu or something but it


---------97:04----------
was for me the biggest thing about


---------97:11----------
meditating was always that you have a


---------97:14----------
sense of control over your body that


---------97:16----------
usually don't have a night


---------97:19----------
yeah that's maybe that like you can kind


---------97:21----------
of feel yourself and I don't really do


---------97:23----------
that really but yeah there's definitely


---------97:25----------
that was positive so as you were paying


---------97:27----------
attention to your heart were you


---------97:29----------
thinking thoughts or were you just


---------97:30----------
feeling things there was a lot of fun


---------97:35----------
but then I started to just to try to at


---------97:37----------
the very end there try to just focus on


---------97:38----------
the beat and I tried to just envision it


---------97:42----------
kind of reading the right so as as you


---------97:48----------
and whatever your vision does great yep


---------97:50----------
yeah as you envision it and you focus on


---------97:53----------
it what happens to your thoughts they


---------97:59----------
weren't there anymore


---------98:02----------
yeah it wasn't yeah it was yeah they


---------98:04----------
weren't there yeah so I think that's the


---------98:14----------
point right is to free yourself from the


---------98:16----------
thoughts be quiet so that Daddy can


---------98:18----------
teach no you want attention this is what


---------98:23----------
we call attention seeking behavior any


---------98:26----------
any so Jake you know I'd hey hey she


---------98:34----------
wants to be a streamer I guess she's


---------98:37----------
performing for someone okay so Jake one


---------98:42----------
any questions for me before you wrap up


---------98:44----------
because I think I'm gonna have to go cuz


---------98:45----------
she's hey you want to get out of here


---------98:47----------
you wanna stay uh I don't I don't know


---------98:54----------
if I have any questions right now I mean


---------98:56----------
I was it was kind of it's nice to hear


---------99:01----------
you know how you kind of portrayed


---------99:03----------
things and it's things that I kind of


---------99:06----------
knew but it maybe I just kind of was


---------99:08----------
looking through like it was a little


---------99:09----------
fuzzy still looking at my picture what I


---------99:11----------
think is going on yeah I think you help


---------99:13----------
paint the picture a little bit better


---------99:15----------
um for me I think I'm always someone


---------99:17----------
that like I said before is very


---------99:18----------
strong-willed and I'd it's not it's not


---------99:20----------
gonna be the same but I really think


---------99:22----------
that the knowledge under say of what's


---------99:25----------
causing things is is the first is like


---------99:27----------
for me like a huge step in and after


---------99:29----------
that it's really just not not worrying


---------99:33----------
about it taking a short a long time it


---------99:35----------
like it did the first time and comparing


---------99:37----------
it but just kind of just you know using


---------99:39----------
that knowledge to I don't know float I


---------99:44----------
flow out of things as it's supposed to


---------99:46----------
happen


---------99:46----------
day by day instead of yeah bring about


---------99:48----------
yeah when beautifully put man but I


---------99:51----------
think you know I I agree with you that


---------99:53----------
like understanding what's going on is


---------99:55----------
the first step and and one of the things


---------99:57----------
that I say on stream pretty often is


---------99:59----------
good diagnosis perceives good treatment


---------100:01----------
and until you know what's going on you


---------100:03----------
can't really fix any things true alright


---------100:06----------
