a cool charity i like


---------01:36----------
get gamers for chalk yeah i heard you


---------01:39----------
talking about it it sounds really nice


---------01:41----------
yeah so hopefully we can help them out a


---------01:43----------
little bit um


---------01:44----------
is there something in particular that


---------01:45----------
you were hoping to talk about today or


---------01:48----------
or anything that um any questions or


---------01:50----------
anything that i can potentially help you


---------01:52----------
with


---------01:52----------
you know i i have a couple of topics


---------01:55----------
that uh that came to mind


---------01:56----------
um i don't feel like i


---------02:00----------
have like you know compared to most


---------02:02----------
maybe uh as


---------02:03----------
deserving of a spot on the show


---------02:06----------
um like like my girlfriend actually i


---------02:09----------
think she came on cutie


---------02:10----------
i don't i don't know if you remember it


---------02:12----------
was a bit ago uh


---------02:13----------
you know she she got she got the bag she


---------02:15----------
got anxiety depression the whole works


---------02:18----------
and uh and i feel pretty good you know


---------02:20----------
like um


---------02:23----------
or fortunate i should say that you know


---------02:24----------
i don't have


---------02:26----------
personal problems that i think i mean


---------02:27----------
that i know of that i feel they need to


---------02:29----------
talk to but


---------02:31----------
uh maybe broader subjects like um


---------02:34----------
they talk about uh parasocial


---------02:36----------
relationships a lot on stream


---------02:37----------
sure and uh and i'm sure you have some


---------02:40----------
some sage dumb about it


---------02:42----------
and then um the only other thing is


---------02:45----------
death


---------02:45----------
i figured you probably know what happens


---------02:47----------
after we die and i wanted to ask at some


---------02:49----------
point


---------02:50----------
sure so i let's man


---------02:54----------
well said so like i i i really first of


---------02:57----------
all appreciate how you kind of laid out


---------02:59----------
how you're thinking about coming on


---------03:00----------
stream


---------03:01----------
and the first thing that i want to say


---------03:02----------
is that i think you are just as


---------03:04----------
deserving as anyone else


---------03:06----------
and and i think that um part of the


---------03:10----------
problem i think that we sometimes get


---------03:12----------
into on stream is that


---------03:14----------
we tend to over emphasize people's


---------03:16----------
struggles and really we're not


---------03:19----------
and that gets like i think a little bit


---------03:21----------
too close to psychiatry so like part of


---------03:23----------
actually what i really like about


---------03:24----------
um you know understanding the mind and


---------03:26----------
understanding like life


---------03:27----------
and understanding yourself is that it's


---------03:30----------
not necessarily pathology focused


---------03:32----------
so i think that's where we just you know


---------03:34----------
a lot of people need help and we're here


---------03:35----------
to help people but i think like


---------03:36----------
understanding having conversations


---------03:38----------
around death or having conversations


---------03:40----------
even about


---------03:41----------
what you deserve and what you don't


---------03:42----------
deserve and do people who struggle with


---------03:44----------
anxiety quote unquote deserve


---------03:46----------
more than you do i think those are


---------03:48----------
actually really important conversations


---------03:50----------
too


---------03:51----------
um and i love talking about death cool


---------03:54----------
so yeah i don't i you love that


---------03:57----------
sure all right yeah that's high i love


---------03:59----------
talking about most things


---------04:01----------
sure i guess that makes sense for you um


---------04:04----------
and yeah so what what do you wanna


---------04:07----------
do you wanna talk a little bit more


---------04:09----------
about you know sort of deserving this


---------04:11----------
spot or are we kind of done with that


---------04:12----------
and we can


---------04:13----------
dive right in i feel fine about it just


---------04:15----------
wanted to just


---------04:16----------
lighten it up so i i think um because


---------04:20----------
the other way to think about it ludwig


---------04:21----------
is like if we are going to talk about


---------04:22----------
parasocial relationships and death


---------04:24----------
really the goal of stream is to you know


---------04:26----------
help one person


---------04:28----------
hopefully understand something but


---------04:30----------
really the goal is to like


---------04:31----------
talk about things that would benefit our


---------04:33----------
audience and


---------04:35----------
you know i think these two things like


---------04:37----------
if we have a conversation about these


---------04:38----------
two things i


---------04:38----------
i have to imagine that a lot of people


---------04:40----------
will appreciate it and will benefit from


---------04:42----------
it


---------04:43----------
so i think it's totally cool yeah makes


---------04:45----------
sense i'm on board


---------04:47----------
so we starting with parasocial


---------04:48----------
relationships or death


---------04:51----------
i think you're supposed to end with


---------04:52----------
death so parasocial it is


---------04:55----------
okay so tell me what is uh and i may not


---------04:57----------
have sage advice because i think you


---------04:58----------
guys probably know more about this than


---------05:00----------
i do


---------05:00----------
so can you tell me what a parasocial


---------05:02----------
relationship is


---------05:04----------
okay yeah so well yeah basically it is


---------05:08----------
uh you know


---------05:09----------
a one-way relationship um with


---------05:12----------
with someone and uh and i think that's


---------05:14----------
the gist of it but


---------05:16----------
the way i understand it is basically


---------05:18----------
people who form relationships with me


---------05:20----------
their streamer um even though i can't


---------05:24----------
give anything back personally


---------05:27----------
uh and then you know they might gain too


---------05:29----------
much of an attachment


---------05:30----------
you know a lot of people say things like


---------05:32----------
i love you and


---------05:34----------
and uh and


---------05:37----------
basically treat me as a friend and i


---------05:39----------
can't reciprocate


---------05:40----------
okay and and what do you think about


---------05:43----------
that


---------05:45----------
you know i've always been pretty chill


---------05:47----------
with it because i kind of grew up on


---------05:48----------
youtube


---------05:49----------
and uh and i feel like i grew up pretty


---------05:51----------
fine


---------05:52----------
um but my my roommate slime always


---------05:55----------
seemed very concerned about it


---------05:57----------
and uh and then i think as i grew a bit


---------06:00----------
i was like


---------06:00----------
huh you know this can be a bit


---------06:03----------
problematic


---------06:04----------
because i think my viewership started


---------06:06----------
getting a bit younger


---------06:07----------
and uh and i guess more impressionable


---------06:11----------
um and i just think that especially


---------06:14----------
now that covet people are on twitch so


---------06:15----------
much that you know they


---------06:17----------
sometimes forego irl relationships for


---------06:20----------
online ones with people that


---------06:21----------
can reciprocate what's wrong with that


---------06:27----------
i don't think there's anything


---------06:30----------
inherently wrong with online


---------06:32----------
relationships i


---------06:33----------
think that


---------06:36----------
i see myself being like i read my


---------06:40----------
dms and the dms people send me


---------06:44----------
it feels like it's


---------06:47----------
i mean i don't know if i want to say


---------06:48----------
crossing a line but i'm not the guy for


---------06:51----------
the job


---------06:52----------
a lot of the time um and they're using


---------06:55----------
me as the guy for the job and i can't


---------06:57----------
fulfill the role


---------06:58----------
what what's the job help me understand


---------07:00----------
like


---------07:01----------
hey this is going on do you have any


---------07:05----------
advice


---------07:06----------
you know um


---------07:09----------
i don't know what to do for my


---------07:12----------
major any basically piece of advice or


---------07:17----------
just try to talk to someone who will


---------07:19----------
listen


---------07:20----------
even um like you would with a friend


---------07:23----------
they though they might with me


---------07:25----------
uh and i can't


---------07:28----------
answer of them all because there's a lot


---------07:31----------
sure and


---------07:33----------
and i have in the past a bit but you


---------07:35----------
know then it gets


---------07:37----------
weird too because i don't you know i'm


---------07:38----------
not particularly in


---------07:41----------
like involved in the person's life so i


---------07:43----------
don't know the whole thing so


---------07:45----------
sure so basically that yeah if that


---------07:47----------
makes sense how do you think that these


---------07:49----------
relation


---------07:49----------
why do they dm you for advice about what


---------07:52----------
they should major in


---------07:53----------
how do you understand that i don't know


---------07:57----------
i don't particularly know why i'm the


---------07:59----------
first maybe


---------08:00----------
i've thought about this because people


---------08:01----------
do it for advice they'll also do it for


---------08:03----------
like


---------08:04----------
maybe just like money straight up or


---------08:06----------
they do it


---------08:07----------
just for like like they'll ask you for


---------08:08----------
money yeah or


---------08:10----------
just simple pleasantries or like


---------08:14----------
terms of endearment um and i


---------08:17----------
i think it's maybe a mixture of a shot


---------08:21----------
in the dark


---------08:21----------
and maybe it's just easier to say to me


---------08:24----------
first


---------08:25----------
if that makes sense yeah let me


---------08:27----------
understand that say it to you first


---------08:30----------
like if you were gonna be like you know


---------08:31----------
if i was broke imagine i'm broke as hell


---------08:34----------
and you're my good friend


---------08:35----------
and i like i've come to you before and i


---------08:37----------
don't want to be like yo dr k can you


---------08:38----------
just slap me a thousand


---------08:40----------
like it's easier to just ask a random


---------08:43----------
man on the internet


---------08:44----------
who probably will ignore it but there's


---------08:47----------
a chance i'll answer and at least like


---------08:48----------
practice how i'm gonna say this before i


---------08:51----------
go to you


---------08:53----------
yeah sure so why do you think it's


---------08:55----------
easier to approach the random man


---------08:57----------
on the internet because you don't think


---------08:59----------
they'll respond


---------09:03----------
yeah that's kind of interesting but i


---------09:05----------
also think devastating because what


---------09:06----------
you're suggesting and i think this is


---------09:07----------
true is that


---------09:09----------
sometimes it's easiest to take the


---------09:10----------
chances that we know have the highest


---------09:12----------
likelihood of failure


---------09:14----------
yeah yeah i think people do that a lot


---------09:16----------
they do do that


---------09:17----------
who like send me emails with a resume


---------09:20----------
being like can i be an editor


---------09:22----------
i feel like it's the absolute minimum


---------09:24----------
you could do


---------09:25----------
um but still doing something


---------09:28----------
yeah and and


---------09:32----------
you also mentioned at the early on


---------09:34----------
something about i love you


---------09:36----------
you know and what do you think what do


---------09:38----------
you think people what do you think your


---------09:40----------
viewers


---------09:41----------
what do how do they view their


---------09:43----------
relationship with you


---------09:45----------
well that's what i'm concerned about you


---------09:47----------
know i would hope


---------09:48----------
it is like you know um


---------09:51----------
like youtube was for me as a kid or like


---------09:54----------
any show is


---------09:55----------
i guess like a little form of


---------09:56----------
entertainment you can hop online too


---------09:58----------
and maybe pull some character traits for


---------10:01----------
me that you like and


---------10:02----------
get some laughs but that's kind of the


---------10:05----------
uh


---------10:05----------
the extent of it is that what youtube


---------10:07----------
was for you


---------10:08----------
entertainment it was entertainment in


---------10:11----------
some like life lessons yeah i would say


---------10:13----------
it was both those things but i wouldn't


---------10:16----------
say it was like you know


---------10:18----------
a source of friendship or uh camaraderie


---------10:21----------
or anything


---------10:22----------
so i'm hearing you kind of if i were to


---------10:25----------
infer i'd say that you didn't really


---------10:26----------
form parasocial relationships with the


---------10:28----------
youtubers that you watched


---------10:30----------
i like to think i didn't i could be


---------10:33----------
wrong but i i imagine i didn't


---------10:35----------
did you ever tell a youtuber that you


---------10:37----------
love them


---------10:40----------
i don't think so it's also just weirder


---------10:43----------
in a youtube comment


---------10:45----------
sure um did you ever tell


---------10:49----------
a youtuber did you ask them to for a job


---------10:54----------
no i did send a youtuber my youtube


---------10:56----------
videos


---------10:57----------
asking for advice


---------11:00----------
oh sorry what no we oh my god you got a


---------11:03----------
thousand dollar donation


---------11:04----------
yeah um by anonymous and 500


---------11:07----------
from chewbacca sorry we're get we'll get


---------11:09----------
to donations in a second i don't want to


---------11:11----------
cut me off for a rack that's fair


---------11:14----------
thank you guys very much for supporting


---------11:16----------
chalk


---------11:17----------
yes good job 11k here we come


---------11:21----------
um anyway you were saying that you you


---------11:23----------
never asked them for a job but you maybe


---------11:25----------
did ask for advice


---------11:27----------
i i might have asked for a job you know


---------11:30----------
when you're


---------11:31----------
16. i definitely have asked for jobs in


---------11:33----------
a lazy fashion


---------11:34----------
um before 100 but i do vividly remember


---------11:39----------
asking for advice on a youtube video i


---------11:40----------
made when i was 16


---------11:42----------
from like a larger youtuber and uh he


---------11:44----------
actually replied


---------11:47----------
um which was hype he said


---------11:50----------
kind of funny jokes but [ __ ] quality


---------11:52----------
setup


---------11:55----------
that's what he said yeah and replied


---------11:59----------
what was your question i don't


---------12:00----------
understand no it was like do you have


---------12:02----------
any advice


---------12:03----------
on like my youtube videos because i sent


---------12:05----------
him a video i had made


---------12:06----------
oh i said i thought to this video and


---------12:09----------
how that's pretty good


---------12:10----------
how did that make you feel when you


---------12:12----------
responded


---------12:14----------
it i think didn't matter because i had


---------12:16----------
already quit at that point but i thought


---------12:18----------
it was cool that he replied for sure


---------12:20----------
what was cool about that that he took


---------12:23----------
the time for a young 16 year old boy


---------12:27----------
yeah so we're going to point something


---------12:29----------
out ludwig what did you just do


---------12:35----------
uh thanks the anonymous donator in


---------12:37----------
conjunction with you and brought up a


---------12:39----------
story about


---------12:40----------
uh addiction yeah so so


---------12:44----------
so like you just changed your voice a


---------12:46----------
little bit uh-huh


---------12:47----------
right yeah and yeah you kind of made a


---------12:50----------
joke out of it you're like yeah


---------12:52----------
oh like was nice for a 16 year old boy


---------12:56----------
you're roasting me live on twitch.tv you


---------12:58----------
know well


---------13:00----------
i can stop if it if it makes me oh


---------13:02----------
you're so good you're so good i did do


---------13:04----------
that yeah


---------13:05----------
what well how do you understand why you


---------13:06----------
did that


---------13:08----------
uh how i made the voice you make it more


---------13:11----------
spicy no no no i mean but why did you


---------13:13----------
make the voice in that moment


---------13:16----------
a little flare yeah but why flare at


---------13:20----------
that point i completely agree it's flare


---------13:22----------
you're cracking a joke you're making it


---------13:24----------
a little bit funny


---------13:25----------
well then because i guess it was a bit


---------13:30----------
i was a bit goofy that i uh everybody


---------13:34----------
just put me laughing you got me


---------13:35----------
it was a bit goofy that the whole entire


---------13:37----------
situation but it's something i look


---------13:39----------
maybe fondly back on


---------13:40----------
yep um but you know


---------13:43----------
yeah yes so it's kind of interesting


---------13:45----------
because i i think actually like what


---------13:48----------
you're doing is lightening i think the


---------13:50----------
significance of it


---------13:54----------
okay yeah why'd i do that so so i i


---------13:58----------
think it


---------13:58----------
we can get to that in a second i just


---------14:00----------
let's notice it first right so we start


---------14:02----------
with observations


---------14:03----------
and then like we can develop hypotheses


---------14:05----------
down the road the more data we collect


---------14:07----------
the more accurate right but like


---------14:09----------
i think that sometimes people feel


---------14:10----------
uncomfortable if i had to venture


---------14:12----------
sometimes like people feel uncomfortable


---------14:14----------
like talking about


---------14:16----------
things that are impactful to them and so


---------14:19----------
what we do is we like make light of it


---------14:23----------
gosh okay right yeah well yeah i just


---------14:26----------
don't like bringing too much gravity to


---------14:28----------
gravity to


---------14:28----------
to things that's around me usually i


---------14:30----------
like to keep it light fluffy


---------14:32----------
yeah perhaps that's it yeah so so then


---------14:35----------
if we


---------14:36----------
if you really want to go off the rails


---------14:38----------
what what makes it hard for you to sit


---------14:40----------
with gravity like


---------14:41----------
you know important things well you know


---------14:44----------
gravity comes with a bit of weight and i


---------14:46----------
don't like throwing weight around i like


---------14:48----------
throwing light and fluffy it's a little


---------14:49----------
more


---------14:49----------
fun a little easier yep absolutely


---------14:53----------
it's fun it's easier serious


---------14:56----------
i'm i'm with you so now i'm going to


---------14:58----------
give you a choice ludwig we can dig into


---------15:00----------
that we can go off on that tangent but


---------15:02----------
that tangent is going to be a little bit


---------15:04----------
more personal


---------15:05----------
but i also want to fully respect you


---------15:07----------
know what you want to do and what you


---------15:08----------
don't want to do we're going to ignore


---------15:10----------
twitch chat don't care about what they


---------15:11----------
think it's not about that


---------15:12----------
gotta go down the road dr k that's why


---------15:14----------
you


---------15:15----------
we have to nope i want to


---------15:21----------
do you feel beholden to


---------15:24----------
in yeah okay what does that word


---------15:28----------
mean so it do you feel obligated to hmm


---------15:32----------
um or do you really think it's i think


---------15:34----------
it's a more hype road to go down


---------15:37----------
and that's what i'd prefer okay


---------15:40----------
why do you choose the hype road well


---------15:43----------
because


---------15:44----------
when it's hype it's more fun it would be


---------15:46----------
regrettable to not pick a hype decision


---------15:49----------
yeah so so once again you gravitate


---------15:51----------
towards fun


---------15:52----------

---------21:12----------
like to remember


---------21:13----------
my father uh but i can't remember that


---------21:17----------
much from when i was 10


---------21:19----------
because i had smaller brain less formed


---------21:23----------
uh but it was good i remember we went on


---------21:26----------
a lot of vacations


---------21:27----------
to europe where the family lives so we'd


---------21:30----------
see family a lot


---------21:31----------
um school was pretty bomb


---------21:36----------
uh played a bunch of video games


---------21:39----------
wouldn't you play


---------21:41----------
i was the renowned worst gamer in my


---------21:45----------
friend group but i played a lot of


---------21:47----------
smash and uh


---------21:50----------
pokemon snap and kingdom hearts


---------21:55----------
wow cool um never really got into any of


---------21:58----------
those


---------22:00----------
really yeah well i've seen your show


---------22:03----------
in no offense dr k you're a bit of a


---------22:04----------
boomer i mean you're whipping out like


---------22:06----------
i feel like the references you whip out


---------22:08----------
in the games you're playing are


---------22:10----------
dated yeah they're a little bit older


---------22:12----------
even absolutely man you'll always be


---------22:14----------
like you guys ever play star quest


---------22:15----------
17 and it'd be like for like


---------22:18----------
windows 84 yeah so so you know it's


---------22:21----------
strange thing because i


---------22:22----------
feel the boomer inside me yeah i feel


---------22:25----------
like coming too


---------22:26----------
like it's it's it's interesting because


---------22:28----------
like when i see games now it


---------22:30----------
nowadays i think to myself like this


---------22:32----------
thought pops into my head


---------22:34----------
man games are so much better like


---------22:35----------
everyone talks about ff10 like you guys


---------22:37----------
need to go back and play ff4 and f6


---------22:40----------
yeah you know let me tell you i was just


---------22:42----------
watching right before this


---------22:44----------
uh one of the streamers i really like


---------22:46----------
play ff10 i'm like damn this game's


---------22:48----------
goaded the kids won't know these days


---------22:49----------
they're all playing persona now


---------22:51----------
yeah i need to give persona a shot i


---------22:53----------
want to give pokemon a shot too with my


---------22:54----------
kids but


---------22:55----------
it seems like pokemon sword and shields


---------22:58----------
suck


---------22:59----------
yeah i think pokemon kind of fell off


---------23:01----------
after the ds


---------23:03----------
when they went 3ds it's kind of but the


---------23:05----------
old ones hold up


---------23:06----------
like black black and white um


---------23:09----------
they're good cool so what we just did


---------23:12----------
there is something called coming up for


---------23:14----------
air


---------23:15----------
okay okay so sometimes when we talk


---------23:17----------
about things that are serious


---------23:20----------
we sometimes crack a joke or we talk


---------23:23----------
about games for a little bit and then we


---------23:24----------
kind of come up for air and now we're


---------23:26----------
going to go back in again


---------23:27----------
okay yeah i go for air a lot i don't


---------23:29----------
have a big


---------23:30----------
lung yeah


---------23:34----------
we'll see okay we'll see but yeah i


---------23:37----------
think so i think so


---------23:38----------
i think that's sort of i think you have


---------23:39----------
a bigger lung than you give yourself


---------23:41----------
credit for


---------23:42----------
okay yeah that's fair uh but i would say


---------23:44----------
you do come up for air a lot so let's


---------23:46----------
just try to


---------23:46----------
notice things about what we do right and


---------23:48----------
maybe we'll learn something


---------23:50----------
so you say that you kind of wish you had


---------23:52----------
more memories


---------23:54----------
because can you tell me a little bit


---------23:56----------
about that


---------23:58----------
yeah you know like like


---------24:01----------
dad dead boom i'm 15. remember a good


---------24:04----------
amount


---------24:05----------
only like a few years ago five years


---------24:07----------
later


---------24:08----------
20 in college can't really remember


---------24:11----------
like maybe like his face or something


---------24:14----------
you know it was like you know you forget


---------24:15----------
the voice the face and then you gotta go


---------24:17----------
to like pictures and stuff like


---------24:18----------
just like conjure it up and uh like the


---------24:21----------
smell just like things you'll forget


---------24:23----------
over time because um


---------24:24----------
it happens over time you forget


---------24:27----------
this sounds kind of weird but it almost


---------24:29----------
sounds to me like you're


---------24:30----------
you know he didn't die at the age of 10


---------24:32----------
it sounds to me like you're actually


---------24:34----------
like kind of losing him piece by piece


---------24:37----------
i think you do right i think that's kind


---------24:39----------
of how it


---------24:40----------
i think it's a a constant war when


---------24:44----------
someone dies to


---------24:47----------
keep them as much as you can in their


---------24:48----------
lives and you


---------24:50----------
can't because you will lose to time


---------24:52----------
every time


---------24:56----------
good job no i'm i'm very impressed by


---------24:59----------
you not coming up for air


---------25:01----------
because that's some heavy [ __ ] that's a


---------25:03----------
bar you're the one


---------25:05----------
you're the one dropping bars there bro


---------25:07----------
okay


---------25:08----------
that's it did you notice that like oh i


---------25:10----------
look i tried


---------25:12----------
it man i think coming up for air is good


---------25:15----------
for others as well so if i'm live with


---------25:17----------
you know 20k on the reg you know how it


---------25:19----------
is uh just came back i don't actually


---------25:22----------
i do those that come up for errors come


---------25:23----------
up for air dr k um


---------25:26----------
uh you know i think other people also


---------25:28----------
might appreciate that if they're not


---------25:29----------
trying to have


---------25:30----------
you know because i think the vibe of the


---------25:31----------
stream is expected to be a certain way


---------25:34----------
so


---------25:35----------
you come up a good amount then everybody


---------25:37----------
else gets to come up too


---------25:38----------
yep yeah


---------25:43----------
i wonder if the parasocial relationships


---------25:45----------
form when you don't come up for air


---------25:49----------
dude yeah yeah


---------25:53----------
yeah i feel like even coming on this


---------25:55----------
show could promote social relationships


---------25:56----------
if i'm being too


---------25:57----------
real sure and not


---------26:00----------
as much of a character yeah and then


---------26:03----------
they're like damn


---------26:04----------
it's so real i actually like them now


---------26:07----------
and then they give me their money


---------26:10----------
so they're like i love you and then


---------26:12----------
they're my dm's dr k


---------26:13----------
and and then how does that make you feel


---------26:16----------
a little bad can't respond all you guys


---------26:18----------
appreciate the money easy clap


---------26:20----------
um i'm gonna toss out a word do you feel


---------26:23----------
inadequate


---------26:27----------
i used to i think a good amount


---------26:31----------
i remember i used to stream like a year


---------26:33----------
ago and my viewership was like booming


---------26:35----------
and i'd have like a really good stream


---------26:37----------
like a banger like


---------26:38----------
10k people would be there and then i


---------26:41----------
wouldn't want to stream the next day


---------26:42----------
because i'd be like i'll never hit this


---------26:44----------
again like this is i've peaked this i've


---------26:46----------
done more than i can handle


---------26:47----------
and i would just i would i would not be


---------26:49----------
able to hit the go live button and i


---------26:50----------
would just lie down on my floor for a


---------26:51----------
while


---------26:52----------
but i kind of got over that um


---------26:55----------
i don't know why i can't exactly pin it


---------26:58----------
but i think i got over that


---------27:01----------
yeah so i think there's a lot to cover


---------27:02----------
do you want to you know stick with the


---------27:04----------
dad or you want to talk about the


---------27:06----------
parasocial


---------27:07----------
i'm so open i feel like you're my sherpa


---------27:11----------
in a way and i would


---------27:12----------
hope you can guide me i i'd happy to i'm


---------27:15----------
happy to be your sherpa


---------27:17----------
on this journey on a shit-covered


---------27:18----------
mountain


---------27:20----------
my dream um yeah so tell me what what do


---------27:24----------
you remember


---------27:25----------
i i know that things fade over time and


---------27:27----------
and that's sad


---------27:29----------
yeah but what do you remember about kind


---------27:31----------
of growing up like


---------27:34----------
like like more specific about is this


---------27:38----------
about anything


---------27:38----------
about yeah sure anything any memories


---------27:40----------
from when you're sure


---------27:42----------
uh remember a few from


---------27:46----------
it's funny the thing about memories in


---------27:48----------
that if you


---------27:49----------
look up pictures or videos you will form


---------27:53----------
like fake memories based off your like


---------27:57----------
nostalgic re-looking at it but i would


---------27:59----------
say the actual memories that stick out


---------28:01----------
are


---------28:03----------
i used to do a lot of shower races with


---------28:06----------
my dad


---------28:08----------
which was basically we would both start


---------28:10----------
the shower at the same time who could


---------28:11----------
finish first


---------28:12----------
probably not the best way to teach a kid


---------28:15----------
how to shower


---------28:16----------
on hindsight you know should take your


---------28:17----------
time behind the ears the whole works but


---------28:20----------
uh but those were fun um


---------28:24----------
i remember sleeping over friends houses


---------28:30----------
uh a bunch playing video games


---------28:34----------
and uh yeah there's there's a quit


---------28:37----------
there's a few memories


---------28:38----------

---------28:51----------
um it was it was hewlett-packard and


---------28:54----------
they were just like downsizing


---------28:56----------
um and then instead of looking for


---------28:58----------
another job in software engineering and


---------28:59----------

---------29:00----------

---------29:04----------
got a business major then became a


---------29:06----------
teacher in french and in


---------29:08----------

---------30:52----------

---------32:08----------
yeah i think i have made


---------32:11----------
very uh deliberate decisions


---------32:15----------
to move on from certain things


---------32:19----------
um that felt like i was attached to for


---------32:22----------
no reason


---------32:22----------
like um like i had like his whole


---------32:24----------
wardrobe


---------32:26----------
and i threw out a bunch of stuff and uh

and moved on from the sperry's and like


---------32:31----------
i had a belt that was his that i wore a


---------32:33----------
bunch


---------32:34----------
and i've whittled it down to uh to uh i


---------32:36----------
wear his ring


---------32:37----------
and i have his watch but i'm not wearing


---------32:39----------
the watch right now


---------32:43----------
so it sounds like you know you're not


---------32:44----------
only losing him in your mind you're sort


---------32:46----------
of like


---------32:47----------
losing you're like sort of letting go of


---------32:48----------
the possessions one by one


---------32:51----------
yes yeah because i i thought it was


---------32:54----------
unhealthy


---------32:55----------
what did you think was unhealthy about


---------32:57----------
it like


---------32:59----------
putting so much of an importance on


---------33:01----------
inanimate objects and feeling the need


---------33:03----------
to like


---------33:04----------
use them or wear them when like


---------33:07----------
if i were to look at it objectively like


---------33:09----------
boating shoes are not that convenient


---------33:11----------
for a man who's not on a boat


---------33:14----------
and his shirts are not that stylish


---------33:17----------
anymore


---------33:18----------
so you know it i can keep it in the


---------33:21----------
closet and that's fine and that's great


---------33:23----------
um


---------33:24----------
but i don't think it like it's not like


---------33:26----------
it helps me recall anything


---------33:27----------
and i don't think it is functional in my


---------33:30----------
day-to-day


---------33:31----------
sure where i feel the need to keep it


---------33:33----------
yeah


---------33:35----------
i think sometimes um you know you can


---------33:37----------
also kind of think of it as like growing


---------33:38----------
out of it


---------33:39----------
like i think there are times where you


---------33:42----------
know you may have needed those things


---------33:43----------
for a particular reason and and maybe


---------33:45----------
you just don't anymore


---------33:47----------
um sounds like a natural part of the


---------33:49----------
grief process to me


---------33:51----------
yeah i would i would agree and and how


---------33:54----------
did he


---------33:55----------
pass away if you don't mind me asking


---------33:57----------
alcoholic


---------33:59----------
uh and i forget my mom told me


---------34:02----------
like a couple years ago but the nitty


---------34:04----------
gritty is


---------34:06----------
probably not that fun to talk about


---------34:09----------
because it's like something


---------34:10----------
but basically it comes down to he was an


---------34:12----------
alcoholic [ __ ] up his insides


---------34:14----------
was refusing to go to the hospital


---------34:16----------
coughed up blood for a bit


---------34:17----------
and then uh and then just died


---------34:25----------
internal bleeding stuff like that i


---------34:26----------
think


---------34:30----------
wow that's kind of grim yeah


---------34:34----------
yeah you wanna i can we can come up for


---------34:36----------
air


---------34:38----------
i'm okay are you okay i'm good i'm good


---------34:42----------
um i mean did you understand what was


---------34:46----------
happening


---------34:49----------
yeah yeah i was 10 i do remember this


---------34:52----------
quite vividly


---------34:54----------
i was sleeping in my mom's room because


---------34:56----------
he was like


---------34:57----------
not having the best day he was sleeping


---------34:59----------
in the guest room


---------35:01----------
and uh at some point during the evening


---------35:05----------
my sister went to the neighbors because


---------35:07----------
she was like a bit like stressed out


---------35:08----------
like she gets really stressed and


---------35:12----------
then he went into the bathroom and then


---------35:13----------
my mom got up and i think he started


---------35:15----------
throwing up blood she called the cops


---------35:17----------
they came i went to the neighbors


---------35:19----------
and they came back the next day and it


---------35:20----------
was uh it was bad news


---------35:24----------
do you remember anything about what you


---------35:26----------
thought was happening or how you felt at


---------35:28----------
the time


---------35:30----------
uh i was pretty scared when i was in my


---------35:34----------
mom's room


---------35:35----------
and then i went to the neighbors and i


---------35:36----------
just kind of slept and chilled


---------35:38----------
and just tried to like wait and then


---------35:42----------
yeah and then they came back and i and i


---------35:44----------
got and i kind of got it


---------35:45----------
frame one cried i think things that died


---------35:47----------
for me before


---------35:48----------
so i kind of knew what death was i'm


---------35:51----------
sorry i always


---------35:52----------
what like like animals have died i think


---------35:56----------
oh is is my thing cut out where are we


---------35:59----------
good


---------35:59----------
no no no no i just understood you i


---------36:01----------
thought you said things have died for


---------36:02----------
you before


---------36:04----------
yeah like i think i understood the


---------36:06----------
concept of death i think we had had


---------36:08----------
a family cat die and and so i think i


---------36:10----------
had understood my mom had explained it


---------36:12----------
to me because one time i asked her i


---------36:13----------
said how many lives do we get


---------36:16----------
after playing like mario 64 and she's


---------36:18----------
like oh


---------36:19----------
like one and i was like damn that sucks


---------36:22----------
and she was like yeah


---------36:24----------
so i kind of knew going in that you get


---------36:26----------
the game over bowser screen


---------36:29----------
um on your first go so when


---------36:32----------
she was like he's dead i was like oh


---------36:33----------
that sucks


---------36:35----------
you know should have got 100 coins kind


---------36:37----------
of stupid of them but hmm


---------36:40----------
just a quick come up just a quick yeah i


---------36:42----------
know it's okay


---------36:45----------
um if i don't come up with you it's


---------36:46----------
because i'm trying to stay down


---------36:48----------
and and you'll if i come up with sure


---------36:50----------
we'll be up for a little while


---------36:51----------
i just can't farm too many sages i have


---------36:53----------
a quota


---------36:54----------
yep that's why we come up for air the


---------36:57----------
ultimate way to come up for air is a


---------36:58----------
dick joke


---------37:00----------
that's yeah to tie a dick joke into my


---------37:03----------
dad's death would be phenomenal


---------37:05----------
yeah i'll come up with one rigor mortis


---------37:07----------
who knows


---------37:09----------
right there look at that look at how


---------37:11----------
easy it is


---------37:14----------
look at how look at how buoyant your


---------37:16----------
mind is classic good one


---------37:18----------
yeah that's what you got to come up with


---------37:21----------
um


---------37:26----------
it's important to you to be funny isn't


---------37:27----------
it yeah it's my job now


---------37:30----------
yeah coming up is what you do for a


---------37:34----------
living


---------37:35----------
yeah i would agree um


---------37:38----------
you're very good at it you're very funny


---------37:41----------
i think uh


---------37:42----------
weaving serious topics while i guess


---------37:44----------
we'll phrase it coming up is uh


---------37:47----------
i think good because it allows you to


---------37:49----------
talk about more serious things with


---------37:50----------
people who might not want to


---------37:52----------
because it usually sucks yep it's it's


---------37:56----------
very very


---------37:56----------
um healthy actually so i think it's


---------37:59----------
interesting because one of the things we


---------38:00----------
realized uh


---------38:02----------
in the healthy gamer community


---------38:02----------
communities we're like starting to


---------38:04----------
actually like


---------38:06----------
get into comedians or it seems like a


---------38:09----------
lot of comedians seem to


---------38:11----------
really need a lot of mental health


---------38:13----------
support i think they're another


---------38:14----------
population that like


---------38:15----------
gets very very poorly served by the


---------38:17----------
mental health system


---------38:18----------
so it's a bizarre thing that we're sort


---------38:20----------
of noticing


---------38:22----------
um and i think that there is a lot of


---------38:23----------
like there's a lot of truth in comedy


---------38:25----------
right comedy helps us


---------38:27----------
sit with very very scary things yeah


---------38:30----------
more easily i i i know that you know


---------38:34----------
sometimes some of the


---------38:35----------
in a sense most insensitive jokes but


---------38:38----------
also some of the most


---------38:40----------
important jokes that we make or after


---------38:42----------
codes in the hospital


---------38:44----------
a code is um when you know like on these


---------38:47----------
like medical shows when they're doing


---------38:48----------
chest compressions and


---------38:49----------
they say clear and paddles and stuff


---------38:51----------
like that i think you'll hear the most


---------38:53----------
jokes like after that


---------38:56----------
really yeah okay it's just hard to sit


---------38:59----------
with like trying to keep someone alive


---------39:01----------
for 40 minutes and then


---------39:02----------
you know yeah so they die yeah


---------39:06----------
so you got to break it yep um


---------39:10----------
but you know did you understand that


---------39:12----------
your dad was an alcoholic when you were


---------39:13----------
growing


---------39:14----------
up yeah for sure


---------39:17----------
i think yeah how did you know that


---------39:20----------
he got arrested for a dui we lived very


---------39:23----------
close to the liquor store


---------39:25----------
uh maybe a mile away and i think he just


---------39:28----------
he went


---------39:28----------
he bought it six to 12 pack whatever


---------39:31----------
cracked one


---------39:32----------
and then they pulled him over in our


---------39:34----------
driveway actually arrested him took him


---------39:36----------
to jail


---------39:37----------
i don't think he was even drunk and then


---------39:39----------
he got his license suspended so


---------39:41----------
it was obvious because he would walk to


---------39:43----------
the liquor store


---------39:44----------
every day uh and like you know


---------39:48----------
like i was like eight nine but i know


---------39:49----------
where he's going you know because i also


---------39:51----------
called her the candy store because they


---------39:52----------
had candy there


---------39:53----------
but he was never going for candy doctor


---------39:55----------
kevin it was always for the alcohol


---------39:58----------
uh and kids had brought it up as well


---------40:01----------
and


---------40:02----------
oh kids that brought about what what is


---------40:03----------
that yeah i mean


---------40:06----------
this [ __ ] zack on the bus one


---------40:08----------
grade older


---------40:10----------
uh would sit in the back because that's


---------40:11----------
where the cool kids sit and


---------40:13----------
he was just like i forget exactly how it


---------40:15----------
started but he's like


---------40:17----------
he was just roasting me because my dad


---------40:19----------
didn't have a license and would


---------40:20----------
go buy alcohol and walk there and [ __ ]


---------40:23----------
like that


---------40:25----------
yeah that sounds do you remember how you


---------40:27----------
felt or how you responded


---------40:29----------
i think i got mad called him a pimple


---------40:30----------
butt


---------40:32----------
you should have seen him he was torn up


---------40:34----------
from that one


---------40:36----------
nice yeah well well played


---------40:40----------
um and do you know if your mom had


---------40:44----------
did your mom and dad ever talk about


---------40:45----------
their his drinking


---------40:48----------
yeah i mean they definitely had some


---------40:49----------
some fights about it she definitely


---------40:51----------
wanted him to not


---------40:52----------
drink because she was like you're gonna


---------40:54----------
die if you keep drinking


---------40:56----------
and he had periods where he would stop


---------40:58----------
because of that


---------40:59----------
um but then you know he's addicted so


---------41:02----------
he would eventually relapse and he


---------41:05----------
didn't really like professional help


---------41:06----------
because i think he thought it was like


---------41:08----------
maybe admitting a problem too much or


---------41:10----------
whatever so


---------41:11----------
and he just thought he had control over


---------41:13----------
it and uh i don't think he really did


---------41:18----------
now ludwig i would i would say that you


---------41:21----------
know


---------41:22----------
sometimes uh kids in your situation


---------41:25----------
end up being very very like angry


---------41:29----------
with their dad but what i'm hearing from


---------41:32----------
you


---------41:32----------
is that it's super matter of fact


---------41:37----------
yeah i don't think addiction's his fault


---------41:40----------
i think that was


---------41:41----------
like passed to him yeah do you blame him


---------41:48----------
no not really i think he could have gone


---------41:51----------
to the hospital


---------41:52----------
and he would have probably had a few


---------41:54----------
more years but


---------41:55----------
no i think he uh he did good as a dad i


---------41:59----------
feel he did a good job


---------42:01----------
for 10 years could have done it longer


---------42:04----------
admittedly but the 10 were good so you


---------42:08----------
know


---------42:11----------
who are you to complain i can't complain


---------42:14----------
i got a good tenant


---------42:23----------
kids who have a worse upbringing are


---------42:24----------
more deserving than you huh


---------42:26----------
to complain um yes


---------42:30----------
they are in fact yeah


---------42:34----------
people who haven't like so you know


---------42:36----------
other people with anxiety their


---------42:38----------
their deserve to come on but you know


---------42:42----------
a kid who loses his dad from alcohol and


---------42:45----------
watches his dad vomit blood


---------42:47----------
and um then dies you don't deserve to


---------42:50----------
come on


---------42:51----------
and get support


---------42:54----------
i would agree


---------43:00----------
agree with what that


---------43:03----------
at the end of the day if anything bad


---------43:06----------
happens in life


---------43:09----------
someone else had it worse and i think


---------43:13----------
that you can uh just look at the


---------43:14----------
positives


---------43:20----------
i'm gonna have to sit with that for a


---------43:21----------
second and also i'm gonna grab a tissue


---------43:23----------
is that okay


---------43:25----------
go for it just let me let me think about


---------43:26----------
my comeback


---------43:30----------
if he says pimple butt we're over


---------43:32----------
professionally and romantically


---------43:44----------
hmm


---------43:48----------
full disclosure i came up for her when


---------43:49----------
you were gone oh you did


---------43:51----------
yeah just full disclosure what'd i miss


---------43:54----------
it was


---------43:55----------
it's less funny if i tell you if you go


---------43:56----------
back and watch it you might have a laugh


---------44:06----------
okay


---------44:09----------
do you remember thinking when you were


---------44:11----------
young that there are people who are like


---------44:12----------
like you're actually pretty lucky


---------44:15----------
despite your dad passing away


---------44:18----------
that i was yeah i mean that you were


---------44:20----------
lucky to have him around as long as you


---------44:22----------
did and stuff like that


---------44:23----------
yeah for sure


---------44:29----------
so i mean i'm a yeah i was gonna say i


---------44:32----------
think in general i had a good


---------44:33----------
upbringing like you know in middle class


---------44:37----------
dad died but he had life insurance so


---------44:41----------
college paid mostly outside of like a


---------44:44----------
bit of student loan but true you know i


---------44:47----------
think that's that's pretty


---------44:48----------
pretty good that's a good life


---------44:52----------
mom bought me a car that's nice that's


---------44:54----------
easy


---------44:55----------
move to la you have a lot to be grateful


---------44:57----------
for yes


---------44:58----------
yes let me ask you something if you have


---------45:02----------
a lot to be grateful for does


---------45:04----------
it mean that you have


---------45:07----------
is it possible to be grateful for things


---------45:09----------
and ungrateful for things at the same


---------45:11----------
time or is it either or


---------45:13----------
it is but i think the energy spent


---------45:16----------
reflecting on what you're grateful for


---------45:18----------
is more valuable than what you aren't or


---------45:21----------
upset about


---------45:22----------
because that you cannot change and what


---------45:24----------
you're grateful for


---------45:25----------
is something that you can keep


---------45:28----------
and continue to grow and like you know


---------45:33----------
i think it's more valuable


---------45:39----------
i can get behind that


---------45:47----------
at the same time i disagree


---------45:50----------
look you know i can be 15 maul that you


---------45:53----------
know


---------45:53----------
my jonah had a dad until he was 17 and


---------45:57----------
my dad died at 10


---------45:58----------
or i can be like damn i got this sweet


---------46:00----------
car because my mom is nice


---------46:03----------
that's pog and i think that it's a


---------46:06----------
better head space to be in the second


---------46:07----------
world


---------46:10----------
i agree with that so there's there's


---------46:12----------
there's one thing there's one thing that


---------46:13----------
i would


---------46:14----------
switch in your words okay sure you can


---------46:16----------
be mauled at


---------46:18----------
whoever that is at 15 because they have


---------46:20----------
a dad or


---------46:21----------
you can be grateful for the the car


---------46:24----------
and this is where i would say replace


---------46:25----------
the ore with an end


---------46:29----------
but why be mauled


---------46:32----------
because you're only mauled at life which


---------46:34----------
you have no control over


---------46:36----------
getting mad at something i have no


---------46:37----------
control over seems like a fruitless


---------46:40----------
endeavor


---------46:50----------
let me think about that for a second


---------46:52----------
because i i think you're


---------46:54----------
right


---------47:00----------
what do you have control over


---------47:05----------
current life relationships


---------47:08----------
and um how do you have control over your


---------47:12----------
relationship what do you have control


---------47:13----------
over in your relationship


---------47:15----------
how i act in them


---------47:17----------
[Music]


---------47:18----------
uh and


---------47:21----------
i would say that's the biggest one yeah


---------47:23----------
how i act in relationships


---------47:25----------
how i show appreciation everything


---------47:27----------
perfect right so what do you have


---------47:29----------
control over in your stream


---------47:31----------
um everything really


---------47:35----------
if it even starts you have control over


---------47:37----------
your viewership


---------47:38----------
i in a way i would say yeah how so


---------47:42----------
i can choose what i do uh which will


---------47:46----------
influence it


---------47:47----------
i think everything i do will impact that


---------47:49----------
okay


---------47:50----------
okay hold on though so sure what i'm


---------47:52----------
hearing is that in your relationship you


---------47:54----------
have control over your actions


---------47:55----------
in the relationship you don't have


---------47:57----------
control over


---------47:58----------
qd's responses right that is true yeah


---------48:02----------
in streaming you don't really have


---------48:03----------
control over your viewership but you


---------48:05----------
have control over what you do


---------48:08----------
i think the comparison


---------48:11----------
of like because i get it like i don't


---------48:13----------
have control over other people's


---------48:14----------
responses i would say two things one you


---------48:17----------
can


---------48:18----------
like kind of predict based off of


---------48:22----------
like previous encounters what might be a


---------48:24----------
positive response


---------48:26----------
and i think that is even more viable in


---------48:29----------
streaming where data is


---------48:31----------
everywhere and i can very quickly


---------48:35----------
understand you know hey this will do


---------48:37----------
great so let's be a little bit precise


---------48:41----------
i have control over flushing the toilet


---------48:44----------
but i don't have control over whether


---------48:46----------
the poop goes down


---------48:51----------
yeah but it's gone down like almost


---------48:54----------
every time


---------48:55----------
sure but let's let's be precise okay


---------48:58----------
sure


---------48:58----------
what i have control over is whether the


---------49:00----------
toilet gets flush


---------49:02----------
that is true right i did i've never i


---------49:04----------
always thought i made the poop go down


---------49:06----------
but you're right i only just


---------49:07----------
flick the nozzle yep yep


---------49:11----------
and and so i i i ask you to kind of


---------49:14----------
revisit this idea of like okay so


---------49:16----------
you know what do you have control over


---------49:18----------
like you can't change it like you can't


---------49:20----------
change anything anyway


---------49:25----------
i think if i thought that way


---------49:28----------
i would not be a big streamer though


---------49:31----------
because if i thought i had that little


---------49:32----------
control i would never have tried


---------49:34----------
streaming because i would thought i


---------49:35----------
can't get people to come on stream


---------49:37----------
yeah so this is this is the really


---------49:38----------
challenging thing ludwig is i think you


---------49:40----------
i think you're doing great i don't think


---------49:42----------
you're someone who has all these


---------49:43----------
problems or things like that i i don't


---------49:45----------
mean to make a mountain out of a


---------49:46----------
molehill


---------49:48----------
um at the same time i think that there


---------49:50----------
are still like areas that all human


---------49:52----------
beings can grow


---------49:53----------
and i think the real challenge here is


---------49:55----------
that


---------49:57----------
what we have to what i think would help


---------49:59----------
you move forward in life which by the


---------50:01----------
way i think it's just


---------50:02----------
you know i i don't know if you if i had


---------50:04----------
asked you to start with death


---------50:07----------
do you think we like it's just weird


---------50:09----------
like the themes are just like


---------50:11----------
in your face from today right so first


---------50:14----------
of all


---------50:14----------
you toss out this comment about how


---------50:16----------
you're not deserving to be here


---------50:18----------
it's also kind of like i think you could


---------50:20----------
ask a thousand people on the street


---------50:21----------
you know you're you're grateful for


---------50:23----------
everything that you had in life which is


---------50:25----------
awesome but like i think


---------50:26----------
if you polled a thousand people and


---------50:27----------
they're like you know this kid had his


---------50:29----------
dad die from alcoholism at the age of 10


---------50:31----------
and he saw him vomiting up blood like


---------50:32----------
and he's grateful like is that you know


---------50:35----------
feels a little bit weird to me


---------50:38----------
and yeah i mean if you boil it down sure


---------50:41----------
yeah right so so you didn't even add in


---------50:43----------
the pog car


---------50:45----------
sure and a car makes it okay wow


---------50:48----------
like it was a dog car


---------50:52----------
i mean must have been yeah right to


---------50:54----------
outweigh


---------50:55----------
losing your dad at the age of 10. yeah


---------50:58----------
well i mean


---------50:58----------
jetta they do it right in germany i'll


---------51:00----------
tell you yeah


---------51:02----------
so so i and and like i don't and i think


---------51:04----------
what you're doing is


---------51:05----------
is healthy right so i think you're right


---------51:07----------
that like most people


---------51:08----------
learn that dwelling on the past and like


---------51:12----------
getting hung up on things that i can't


---------51:14----------
change is not like productive or healthy


---------51:16----------
and doesn't make me happy


---------51:17----------
i'm with you we've we can talk to or


---------51:20----------
have talked to on stream i've certainly


---------51:22----------
talked with people


---------51:24----------
not even patients just people who get


---------51:26----------
caught up in the past


---------51:27----------
and it's not healthy so i'm with you


---------51:29----------
there but i think that like the


---------51:31----------
challenge is that when we think about


---------51:33----------
you know growth there's the low-hanging


---------51:36----------
fruit


---------51:37----------
and then there's the high-hanging fruit


---------51:40----------
and i think where we


---------51:41----------
are is all the low-hanging fruit has


---------51:43----------
been taken care of like you've survived


---------51:45----------
you've thrived you've grown


---------51:47----------
it sounds like you're in a healthy


---------51:48----------
relationship sounds like you appreciate


---------51:50----------
your mom sounds like you know i haven't


---------51:52----------
asked you if you drink and stuff but


---------51:54----------
you know i don't think we need to but


---------51:55----------
you know i'm guessing that you


---------51:57----------
don't and that it isn't a problem for


---------51:59----------
you even though genetically you may be


---------52:01----------
predisposed


---------52:03----------
once a week you do a what a classy once


---------52:06----------
a week


---------52:07----------
what's a classy like a classy once a


---------52:09----------
week drink


---------52:11----------
what does that mean like you know just


---------52:13----------
like like a classy one


---------52:15----------
it's not like early enough and i'll just


---------52:17----------
do like once a week


---------52:18----------
just have my classy drinks and then move


---------52:21----------
on with the rest of my week


---------52:23----------
okay um and


---------52:27----------
yeah so like i was saying you realize


---------52:29----------
you railed you my bed


---------52:30----------
it's it's all good man um


---------52:34----------
but you i gotta i gotta get back on the


---------52:36----------
rails hold on a second


---------52:38----------
yeah so like low hanging fruit and high


---------52:39----------
hanging fruit right so i think this is


---------52:41----------
the challenge so if you look at like the


---------52:42----------
yogis would say that


---------52:45----------
the first problems you solve in your


---------52:47----------
mind are the easy ones


---------52:49----------
and the more the higher up you go the


---------52:51----------
more you level up


---------52:52----------
like it's almost like an rpg where you


---------52:54----------
need more xp to level up


---------52:56----------
and the issues become more and more


---------52:58----------
subtle and


---------53:00----------
i think you've adapted really well


---------53:01----------
you've bounced back really well you have


---------53:03----------
a lot of like really like you're an


---------53:04----------
incredibly resilient person


---------53:06----------
right you've learned how to look at the


---------53:08----------
positive instead of the negative


---------53:09----------
that's helped you like not wash away


---------53:12----------
with like the negativity that you deal


---------53:14----------
with


---------53:14----------
it probably has a lot to do with like


---------53:16----------
how successful you are on twitch because


---------53:18----------
your mind is it's really healthy it's


---------53:20----------
like your mind has learned how to shift


---------53:21----------
away from the negative and look to the


---------53:23----------
positive


---------53:25----------
the challenge is that looking at the


---------53:28----------
positive instead of the negative


---------53:29----------
doesn't actually make the negative go


---------53:32----------
away


---------53:33----------
yeah and and this is where you know if


---------53:37----------
you really i think there's this like


---------53:39----------
there's a and i think we'll get to this


---------53:42----------
because you already said we're gonna


---------53:43----------
talk about that today


---------53:45----------
so so you know i i i mean i wonder if


---------53:47----------
that has anything to do with


---------53:49----------
um oh god you know whether there's


---------53:52----------
whether it's one life and then game over


---------53:54----------
or you can collect coins and


---------53:56----------
and you know i wonder if there's some


---------53:58----------
part of you that's like


---------53:59----------
curious about like where is your dad now


---------54:03----------
yeah yeah probably


---------54:06----------
i think he thought he was very uh


---------54:10----------
agnostic he was like you know


---------54:14----------
it'll be nothingness type of guy


---------54:18----------
sucks for him if that's the case why is


---------54:21----------
that bad


---------54:24----------
it doesn't seem very fun


---------54:31----------
what you want to talk about that


---------54:34----------
let's do it i wanted to coming in what


---------54:38----------
did you want to talk about


---------54:39----------
uh help me understand what you want to


---------54:40----------
understand about death


---------54:42----------
okay so i had this moment in


---------54:45----------
disneyland i think before my dad died i


---------54:48----------
was like nine


---------54:49----------
um where i had a dream and then the


---------54:52----------
dream


---------54:53----------
was life after death and but my dream


---------54:55----------
was nothing


---------54:57----------
and then i woke up with a panic attack


---------55:02----------
and then i think i've been a little


---------55:04----------
monka w on death ever


---------55:06----------
since what does monka w on death mean


---------55:08----------
scared


---------55:13----------
what are you afraid of when it comes to


---------55:18----------
that


---------55:20----------
if i'm right


---------55:24----------
um then


---------55:28----------
life is so much better


---------55:35----------
than death yeah and death is so much


---------55:37----------
longer


---------55:41----------
than life


---------55:44----------
okay so ludwig we can


---------55:48----------
do this two ways okay i can just tell


---------55:51----------
you


---------55:52----------
oh yeah or we can like you know


---------55:56----------
ask you questions and sort of like or we


---------55:58----------
could just explain how death works


---------56:00----------
hey i prima strategy guided every game


---------56:03----------
as a kid i am unoffended if you just


---------56:05----------
tell me the answers


---------56:06----------
okay so let's talk about death


---------56:12----------
so let me think about how to do this


---------56:28----------
where do you start


---------56:34----------
man a little bit


---------56:38----------
prepared sure should i ask questions


---------56:42----------
sure you you can but i i may just get


---------56:45----------
there if i i'm just trying to figure out


---------56:46----------
the sequence of things but


---------56:47----------
go ahead and ask a question oh okay dr k


---------56:51----------
what happens after you die


---------56:54----------
it's a good question let me think about


---------56:57----------
it


---------56:59----------
so i think to understand what happens


---------57:00----------
after you die you have to start by


---------57:01----------
understanding like


---------57:02----------
what is like how does the how does like


---------57:05----------
the universe work


---------57:06----------
okay so i'm gonna start actually with a


---------57:08----------
story


---------57:10----------
so i was um i was working uh at


---------57:14----------
um this place called massachusetts


---------57:16----------
general hospital and if you grew up in


---------57:18----------
new hampshire sometimes you know we


---------57:19----------
would get people from new hampshire


---------57:21----------
um and you know i'm a psychiatrist so i


---------57:24----------
was doing my


---------57:25----------
psychiatry consult rotation which means


---------57:27----------
that you work in the general part of the


---------57:29----------
hospital you don't work on the psychoard


---------57:30----------
and so different teams will call you so


---------57:33----------
like we would manage alcohol


---------57:35----------
so like sometimes you know someone would


---------57:36----------
come in for like a knee replacement


---------57:38----------
and then they would start going into


---------57:39----------
alcohol withdrawal so we would like help


---------57:41----------
people manage alcohol withdrawal and i


---------57:44----------
got a call from


---------57:45----------
the the folks in the neuro icu okay so


---------57:48----------
this is the neurological part of the


---------57:49----------
hospital


---------57:50----------
intensive care unit and so


---------57:53----------
um there was a patient who had gotten


---------57:56----------
into a motor vehicle accident was in a


---------57:58----------
coma for two months


---------58:00----------
and then was out and then so anytime you


---------58:03----------
consult a service you have to have like


---------58:04----------
a question


---------58:05----------
so you can't just like call a


---------58:06----------
cardiologist and be like


---------58:08----------
we need help you have to call a


---------58:10----------
cardiologist and you have to say


---------58:11----------
hey we did an ekg which is something


---------58:13----------
that checks your heart rhythm and the


---------58:14----------
ekg looks weird


---------58:16----------
we don't know what to do with it can you


---------58:17----------
come help us out so the consult question


---------58:19----------
for us as psychiatrists says the patient


---------58:21----------
cries when no one is looking


---------58:25----------
and so they're like we're not really


---------58:26----------
sure like what's going on


---------58:28----------
like he cries when no one's looking and


---------58:30----------
so i'm like all right cool so we get a


---------58:32----------
lot of weird questions because a lot of


---------58:33----------
people don't have the vocabulary to like


---------58:35----------
understand


---------58:36----------
what you know how to frame things for


---------58:40----------
a for psychiatrist so i was like okay


---------58:41----------
cool so i go and i talk to the guy


---------58:43----------
and you know i asked the team i'm like


---------58:46----------
you know what you know what's going on


---------58:47----------
like what's his prognosis and they're


---------58:48----------
like oh he's gonna like he's gonna need


---------58:50----------
to do probably three months of physical


---------58:51----------
therapy


---------58:52----------
he'll make a full recovery his family is


---------58:55----------
thrilled


---------58:55----------
they come in every day he's got two


---------58:57----------
young boys


---------58:59----------
um you know like they're all super happy


---------59:01----------
like they were super worried for a while


---------59:03----------
he seems to be happy that he's with them


---------59:05----------
okay like what's going on with his job


---------59:07----------
and they're like i don't know because we


---------59:08----------
don't ask those kinds of questions i'm


---------59:09----------
like okay so like maybe he's upset about


---------59:11----------
you know something so i go and i ask him


---------59:13----------
and i screen him for depression


---------59:16----------
and the screen is negative i ask him are


---------59:17----------

---------59:19----------
like what's your understanding of like


---------59:21----------

---------59:22----------

---------59:24----------

---------59:25----------

---------59:27----------
how are things with your wife things are


---------59:29----------
great she's super happy they were


---------59:30----------
worried for a while i'm glad


---------59:32----------

---------59:33----------
glad she's good being you know


---------59:35----------
everything's going to be okay so like no


---------59:36----------

---------59:38----------
you know you guys like having marital


---------59:40----------
trouble he's like no


---------59:41----------
he's like okay so maybe it's the job


---------59:43----------
right like maybe his dude's been in a


---------59:44----------
coma for two months so he's like broke


---------59:46----------
financially and like that's why he's


---------59:48----------
depressed


---------59:48----------
it's like no my boss is super


---------59:50----------
understanding i have really good health


---------59:51----------
insurance like you know i'll go back to


---------59:53----------

---------59:57----------
just like really confused and i'm like


---------60:00----------

---------60:03----------
screen's negative for depression i'm


---------60:05----------
just not sure like i don't understand


---------60:07----------

---------60:09----------
and so then like i check on him every


---------60:11----------
day because that's what we've been


---------60:12----------
assigned to him and i go to the team and


---------60:13----------
they're like what's wrong with him have


---------60:15----------

---------60:21----------

---------60:24----------
i was like what the [ __ ] am i supposed


---------60:25----------

---------60:26----------

---------60:27----------

---------60:29----------
have him stop crying he's like really


---------60:31----------
like bothering like the nurses are super


---------60:33----------

---------60:34----------
and so i check on him day after day


---------60:36----------
after day asking you know you think


---------60:37----------

---------60:39----------

---------60:41----------

lot to be grateful for


---------60:48----------
a lot of gratitude i've got a nice job


---------60:50----------
i've got healthy


---------60:51----------
family kids you know i could have been


---------60:53----------
disabled i could have been brain damaged


---------60:54----------
i could have been dead and those things


---------60:56----------
are true


---------60:57----------
so finally like on day four day five i'm


---------61:00----------
working this weekend


---------61:01----------
and it's a [ __ ] saturday and i'm


---------61:02----------
[ __ ] pissed because it's a saturday


---------61:04----------
i'm


---------61:04----------
at the hospital come see this guy every


---------61:05----------
single day then i'm like dude so i just


---------61:07----------
asked him i'm like so you don't seem


---------61:08----------
depressed you say everything is fine


---------61:10----------
why do the nurses keep on writing my ass


---------61:12----------
about you crying when no one's looking


---------61:15----------
just that i was like why do you cry when


---------61:16----------
no one's looking [ __ ] tell me


---------61:19----------
and so he's conceived that i'm


---------61:20----------
frustrated and this is you know it's


---------61:22----------
actually a little bit of a calculated


---------61:24----------
play but i


---------61:24----------
you know i've come and i built a rapport


---------61:26----------
with him and i asked him just tell me


---------61:27----------
like what's going on why do you cry


---------61:29----------
and he says doc if i tell you you're


---------61:30----------
going to think i'm crazy


---------61:32----------
and and then i say okay i mean


---------61:36----------
that's i mean i may think you're crazy


---------61:38----------
but i'd love to hear


---------61:40----------
and he says like when i was in a coma


---------61:42----------
like i lived another life


---------61:44----------
and like i have memories just like from


---------61:46----------
this life


---------61:47----------
and i was married and i had two little


---------61:49----------
girls and like i was happy in that life


---------61:51----------
i was


---------61:52----------
you know he was like some kind of


---------61:54----------
engineer or something like he remembers


---------61:56----------
like


---------61:56----------
he remembers all of these things and


---------61:58----------
he's like the reason i cry is because i


---------62:00----------
realize like i'm never going to see my


---------62:02----------
girls again


---------62:03----------
and i mean what do you mean you're never


---------62:04----------
going to see your girls i thought you


---------62:05----------
had two sons and he's like yeah i have


---------62:07----------
boys in this life but i like i had girls


---------62:09----------
and like


---------62:10----------
i loved them i was there when they were


---------62:11----------
born i was there when you know my


---------62:13----------
daughter got her first period because


---------62:15----------
my wife was like traveling for work and


---------62:17----------
like i had to go pick up tampons and


---------62:18----------
like i have all of these like


---------62:20----------
memories and and what i realized is like


---------62:23----------
the dude is like he's like


---------62:24----------
grieving a life that existed within his


---------62:28----------
coma


---------62:30----------
and it's really wild because if you


---------62:31----------
actually talk to people who are


---------62:33----------
in comas this is a relatively common


---------62:35----------
experience


---------62:37----------
that what they experience in the coma


---------62:39----------
feels real


---------62:42----------
what do you think about that uh sounds


---------62:46----------
like some inception [ __ ] it is some


---------62:48----------
inception [ __ ]


---------62:49----------
yeah um


---------62:52----------
yeah i don't know it sounds


---------62:56----------
it sounds interesting


---------63:01----------
and i feel like


---------63:04----------
there's some explanation


---------63:08----------
in your brain right neurons firing yeah


---------63:11----------
yeah some nerdy scientists who can use


---------63:13----------
words to explain that but


---------63:16----------
yeah so that's where you know it's


---------63:18----------
interesting because


---------63:20----------
science so you know when we look at


---------63:22----------
scientific evidence


---------63:24----------
there's no evidence of any kind of thing


---------63:27----------
in the afterlife


---------63:28----------
or anything like that right yeah so


---------63:30----------
you've got like religions who believe in


---------63:32----------
heaven and hell and whatnot


---------63:34----------
but the really interesting thing like


---------63:35----------
the the method that i kind of prescribe


---------63:37----------
to is is a couple of things first is


---------63:40----------
that


---------63:41----------
you have to understand the nature of


---------63:43----------
like experience


---------63:45----------
mind consciousness and existence and


---------63:48----------
what i mean by that is like


---------63:50----------
how do you know ludwig that you were


---------63:52----------
alive


---------63:55----------
uh cause i because i am


---------63:58----------
okay so how do you know that you are


---------64:04----------
because i interact with a human world in


---------64:06----------
a


---------64:08----------
i feel like a way that


---------64:11----------
is tangible and vivid enough that it


---------64:14----------
can't be fabricated


---------64:16----------
okay hold on a second so let's let's get


---------64:18----------
into tangible and vivid


---------64:20----------
what about the world is tangible


---------64:24----------
and what about the world is vivid what


---------64:26----------
do you mean by those words


---------64:28----------
well like everything you know like i


---------64:30----------
like i can i can like i can pick up a


---------64:31----------
crush


---------64:32----------
cup and crush it you know how do you


---------64:33----------
know that the cup is real


---------64:36----------
because it feels real okay it looks real


---------64:40----------
yep okay so so if we think about it


---------64:43----------
yep so so if we really think about it


---------64:45----------
what you're saying is that you're using


---------64:47----------
your sense organs


---------64:49----------
to collect data from the outside world


---------64:51----------
yeah but


---------64:52----------
ultimately it is your feeling of those


---------64:56----------
things that determines existence


---------65:00----------
yes right so this is kind of interesting


---------65:03----------
because like let's say i'm gonna you


---------65:04----------
know ask you i hope this is a safe


---------65:05----------
question


---------65:06----------
do you love cutie yeah how do you know


---------65:14----------
feel good when so it's feelings right so


---------65:17----------
like this is


---------65:18----------
this is really important to understand


---------65:20----------
so there's a barrier


---------65:22----------
between the outside world and the inner


---------65:24----------
world and all of our understanding of


---------65:26----------
what happens in the outside world is


---------65:27----------
actually through the inner world


---------65:32----------
it is your experience of things that


---------65:34----------
that determines


---------65:35----------
that is the foundation of what you


---------65:37----------
understand to be real


---------65:38----------
okay right and and this is where like


---------65:41----------
this is um


---------65:42----------
you know descartes sort of said cogito


---------65:44----------
ergosome i think therefore i am


---------65:46----------
yeah and what descartes sort of noticed


---------65:48----------
is that like even if i'm hallucinating


---------65:50----------
there has to be something that is


---------65:51----------
experiencing just yarn bro it's cool


---------65:54----------
just um there has to be there has to be


---------65:57----------
something that is


---------65:58----------
still being tricked right even in a


---------66:00----------
hallucination


---------66:01----------
even if the outside world is real there


---------66:04----------
has to be something that is observing


---------66:05----------
the hallucination


---------66:06----------
so something has to exist yeah


---------66:10----------
and the yogis determined the same thing


---------66:12----------
and what they realized is that actually


---------66:14----------
like if you look at dreams and reality


---------66:16----------
there's actually no difference between a


---------66:17----------
dream and reality


---------66:19----------
because in the dream it feels just as


---------66:21----------
real as reality does


---------66:24----------
okay right so so then it


---------66:27----------
yeah what about like the laws


---------66:31----------
like i feel like science makes


---------66:35----------
everything make sense like it's real if


---------66:38----------
that makes sense like


---------66:39----------
there are laws and rules and a system


---------66:43----------
and it's and everything falls in line


---------66:45----------
quite well


---------66:46----------
and we can predict the mars will be here


---------66:48----------
because it


---------66:49----------
does that and i feel like in dream you


---------66:52----------
know


---------66:53----------
i i'm running away from big crab man and


---------66:56----------
like it feels real in the moment but


---------66:59----------
like a a dream has an internal


---------67:02----------
consistency


---------67:03----------
okay why do we wait the internal


---------67:06----------
consistency of waking more than the


---------67:08----------
internal consistency of dreaming


---------67:12----------
because if you really think about it in


---------67:14----------
the dream you're not like


---------67:15----------
there's no such thing as internal


---------67:17----------
there's like giant walking crab men


---------67:19----------
you do sometimes though right like


---------67:21----------
occasionally the dream will be so


---------67:23----------
preposterous that you'll like you'll be


---------67:25----------
like


---------67:26----------
and wake up okay now we're getting


---------67:29----------
somewhere wait was it a trap


---------67:31----------
okay if by trap mean you've made a very


---------67:34----------
important discovery then yes


---------67:36----------
okay right so so this is where there's a


---------67:40----------
set of meta


---------67:41----------
so what happens in that moment in the


---------67:43----------
dream


---------67:44----------
usually i wake up


---------67:48----------
yeah so tell me about your experience


---------67:49----------
just say as much as you can


---------67:51----------
sure yeah i remember i had dreams a lot


---------67:53----------
as a kid that a samurai would come to my


---------67:55----------
house


---------67:56----------
and i would wake up in my house and i


---------67:58----------
saw the samurai through the window


---------68:00----------
bad samurai the samurai was coming to


---------68:02----------
kill my mother


---------68:03----------
and i i couldn't lock the doors the


---------68:07----------
samurai would always break through


---------68:09----------
and then and then would get go into my


---------68:11----------
mom's room


---------68:12----------
and and i was like [ __ ] this guy is


---------68:14----------
owning me because it happened so many


---------68:15----------
times


---------68:16----------
and then a couple times the samurai came


---------68:19----------
through


---------68:19----------
and then i would i would i would be like


---------68:23----------
you know i would try to notice something


---------68:24----------
specific


---------68:26----------
about the samurai that looked goofy


---------68:28----------
because


---------68:29----------
and i would be like that's samurai i was


---------68:31----------
wearing no shoes or something then i'd


---------68:32----------
be like that's weird


---------68:34----------
and then i would and then i would wake


---------68:35----------
up


---------68:37----------
okay so you would find some internal


---------68:38----------
consistent inconsistency in the dream


---------68:41----------
yeah you would wake up yeah right


---------68:48----------
let me think about how to


---------68:52----------
so this is i'll just sort of try to toss


---------68:55----------
something i'm going to toss out a


---------68:56----------
hypothesis okay


---------68:57----------
so the first thing to understand is that


---------68:59----------
like with the the experience of things


---------69:01----------
in the dream


---------69:02----------
is just as real as the experience of


---------69:04----------
things in reality


---------69:07----------
yeah the fear that you feel in a dream


---------69:09----------
is just as real


---------69:10----------
you know if you wet your pants in a


---------69:12----------
dream it's it feels the same


---------69:14----------
yeah the interesting thing though is i


---------69:16----------
thought i peed myself today


---------69:20----------
can't remember my dream but i woke up


---------69:21----------
and i was like i [ __ ] peed myself


---------69:23----------
and there's no pee on me so i was good


---------69:25----------
yeah yeah so


---------69:27----------
so it and then similarly like if we


---------69:29----------
think about it like if if you


---------69:30----------
you know went to bed with heartburn in


---------69:33----------
reality


---------69:34----------
in the dream the heartburn disappears


---------69:37----------
right so like there are conditions from


---------69:39----------
reality that disappear in dreams


---------69:41----------
and their conditions and dreams that


---------69:42----------
disappear from reality


---------69:44----------
yeah and we tend to wait


---------69:47----------
reality but really we're not waiting


---------69:49----------
reality we're just


---------69:50----------
waiting wherever our mind is at the


---------69:52----------
moment as real


---------69:55----------
yeah okay so then the question becomes


---------69:58----------
how do you do this thing of snapping out


---------70:00----------
of it


---------70:01----------
and what what the yogis sort of realize


---------70:03----------
is that that there is


---------70:04----------
there is actually something that is


---------70:07----------
outside of your mind so this is where


---------70:09----------
like the next step is that they realize


---------70:11----------
that


---------70:11----------
the observer and the observer


---------70:14----------
the in the object of observation can


---------70:16----------
never be the same


---------70:20----------
so when you look at your face in a


---------70:21----------
mirror what are you looking at


---------70:24----------
are you looking at yourself


---------70:28----------
yes no uplift


---------70:32----------
no you're not looking at yourself what


---------70:33----------
are you actually looking at what is


---------70:35----------
what absolutely you're looking at an


---------70:38----------
image


---------70:39----------
right right so you're looking at


---------70:40----------
something outside of you so the eyes


---------70:42----------
cannot observe themselves you can never


---------70:45----------
see your eyes


---------70:47----------
what do you think about that i


---------70:50----------
get it conceptually but i still feel


---------70:52----------
like i know my eye


---------70:54----------
like if oh if i pulled out my eye


---------70:58----------
i would know that's my eye have you ever


---------71:01----------
seen your eye before


---------71:05----------
only through reflections good right so


---------71:09----------
so i don't doubt that you know what your


---------71:11----------
eye is


---------71:12----------
and now we're getting into sort of the


---------71:13----------
nature of knowledge you know what your


---------71:15----------
eye is because you have an


---------71:16----------
experience of your eye but you have


---------71:18----------
never seen your


---------71:19----------
eye you've seen pictures of your eye


---------71:21----------
you've seen reflections of your eye


---------71:23----------
you've seen images of your eye


---------71:25----------
completely agree but you've never seen


---------71:27----------
your


---------71:27----------
eye yeah so the yogi sort of realized


---------71:31----------
like this is kind of weird because if i


---------71:32----------
can observe my


---------71:33----------
thoughts then my there must be something


---------71:36----------
outside of me that is not my mind


---------71:40----------
and what i would say is that in the


---------71:42----------
dream so we're going to call that thing


---------71:44----------
consciousness


---------71:45----------
okay and i would say in the dream


---------71:49----------
you become conscious that the mind in


---------71:52----------
this reality is not real


---------71:55----------
and it is that rising of consciousness


---------71:58----------
above the mind which experiences


---------72:00----------
thoughts and fears


---------72:01----------
and predictions and analysis and tries


---------72:04----------
to control the


---------72:05----------
reactions of others that all happens


---------72:06----------
within the mind and then the


---------72:08----------
consciousness realizes they're like


---------72:10----------
oh [ __ ] this is this is weird


---------72:13----------
yeah and then you snap out of it okay so


---------72:16----------
is this also like


---------72:18----------
because i used to lucid dream as a kid


---------72:20----------
is the ability to live in your mind


---------72:22----------
understanding it's something your mind


---------72:23----------
created similar then too


---------72:26----------
sure we'll get there okay so i'm not


---------72:30----------
surprised that you lucid dreams so


---------72:31----------
there's a very interesting


---------72:32----------
garment to this entire conversation


---------72:35----------
about is it worth it


---------72:36----------
karma karma okay okay so


---------72:39----------
uh because i i think i'm going to teach


---------72:40----------
you a meditation technique which which i


---------72:42----------
think is


---------72:44----------
works better for people who are capable


---------72:46----------
of lucid dreaming


---------72:47----------
okay because lucid dreaming is sort of


---------72:49----------
the first step that allows you to


---------72:51----------
separate consciousness from mind


---------72:53----------
essentially what i'm going to try to


---------72:55----------
teach you is how to lose a dream while


---------72:57----------
you're awake


---------72:58----------
okay that'd be hard i've not done it in


---------73:01----------
like 15 years


---------73:02----------
so so this is where like the yogis


---------73:04----------
ultimately what they concluded so


---------73:07----------
if you succeed at pulling your


---------73:09----------
consciousness out of your mind


---------73:12----------
that is what we call samadhi or


---------73:15----------
temporary enlightenment


---------73:17----------
and what happens to people who become


---------73:19----------
enlightened is they begin to realize


---------73:21----------
that there literally is no difference


---------73:23----------
between


---------73:23----------
dream and reality


---------73:26----------
now people may think that that means


---------73:28----------
that what you do becomes


---------73:30----------
irrelevant but we'll get to that in a


---------73:32----------
second it's not actually true


---------73:34----------
okay um it actually becomes even more


---------73:37----------
relevant


---------73:38----------
and but essentially like so the nature


---------73:41----------
of reality is that like there's this


---------73:42----------
thing called


---------73:43----------
consciousness so now i'll just explain a


---------73:45----------
couple of other things so the yogis


---------73:46----------
ultimately came to the conclusion


---------73:48----------
that so they did these practices where


---------73:50----------
they essentially like lucid dreamed in


---------73:52----------
reality


---------73:54----------
and they did a lot of thorough studies


---------73:56----------
their particular techniques which are


---------73:57----------
funny because the techniques around


---------73:59----------
dreaming and the techniques around death


---------74:01----------
are very closely related


---------74:02----------
so they're actually like a stepwise if


---------74:04----------
you really want to understand


---------74:05----------
death you have to start with techniques


---------74:07----------
around dreaming


---------74:08----------
and it's all part of like it's bizarre


---------74:10----------
that you're a lucid dreamer you're


---------74:11----------
interested in learning about death and


---------74:12----------
like we're going to teach you about that


---------74:15----------
um so this is what they ultimately


---------74:17----------
concluded that reality the basic unit of


---------74:19----------
existence


---------74:20----------
is consciousness that when consciousness


---------74:23----------
oscillates at a particular wavelength i


---------74:25----------
know this is going to sound


---------74:26----------
super hokey you know it doesn't need to


---------74:28----------
make sense because ultimately all this


---------74:30----------
is experiential


---------74:31----------
once you experience this then you'll


---------74:33----------
understand it it's like i'm trying to


---------74:35----------
explain to you


---------74:36----------
you know what what love is and like


---------74:38----------
you're not gonna understand it until you


---------74:39----------
experience it


---------74:40----------
yeah so based on some of their


---------74:42----------
explorations and i'll teach you one


---------74:43----------
practice today the conclusions that they


---------74:45----------
came to is that


---------74:46----------
consciousness is the basic unit of


---------74:48----------
existence when consciousness


---------74:51----------
coalesces it forms energy and when


---------74:54----------
energy coalesces


---------74:56----------
it forms matter so in a small amount of


---------74:58----------
matter there's an exponential amount of


---------75:00----------
energy and when there's in a small


---------75:01----------
amount of energy there's an exponential


---------75:03----------
amount of consciousness


---------75:04----------
and what is this thing consciousness


---------75:06----------
it's kind of hard to describe but the


---------75:08----------
best experience that you're going to get


---------75:09----------
is it's your awareness that exists


---------75:11----------
outside of mind


---------75:13----------
okay yeah so then


---------75:16----------
we sort of start to get to death and


---------75:18----------
it's like so what is death so death is


---------75:20----------
sort of the annihilation of body and


---------75:22----------
mind but the yogis


---------75:24----------
actually claim that the consciousness


---------75:26----------
still persists like so matter and energy


---------75:28----------
cannot be destroyed right like


---------75:30----------
nothing in this world can truly be


---------75:31----------
destroyed yeah that's true


---------75:33----------
it just changes so then the question


---------75:35----------
becomes like


---------75:36----------
okay so your matter changes into fish


---------75:38----------
food your body is made of stardust


---------75:41----------
that we're fine with energy cannot be


---------75:43----------
created and destroyed


---------75:45----------
but what about consciousness now this is


---------75:47----------
where there's like a very important


---------75:48----------
deviation between west and east because


---------75:51----------
west says that consciousness is simply


---------75:56----------
a manifestation of neurons firing


---------75:59----------
but i don't know how to explain this but


---------76:01----------
like it's fundamentally wrong because


---------76:03----------
like


---------76:03----------
an experience is not an experience is


---------76:06----------
qualitatively different


---------76:08----------
from matter and is it qualitatively


---------76:10----------
different from energy


---------76:11----------
does that make sense yeah like you do


---------76:14----------
there


---------76:15----------
they might fire the same but they can be


---------76:17----------
different no


---------76:18----------
it's like it's exists on a different


---------76:21----------
like so you know matter and energy are


---------76:22----------
fundamentally different right


---------76:24----------
yes is experi is experiencing something


---------76:29----------
yeah matter


---------76:32----------
i would think not right and is


---------76:35----------
experiencing something energy


---------76:38----------
i would think not maybe like energy of


---------76:42----------
me burning my brain cells but


---------76:43----------
no no but that's all matter right so


---------76:45----------
what i'm saying is that fundamentally


---------76:47----------
these buckets


---------76:48----------
are like different stuff the stuff of


---------76:51----------
experience


---------76:52----------
sure there's a neurological correlate


---------76:54----------
like i don't


---------76:55----------
doubt that right so for example when i


---------76:57----------
drink this water


---------76:58----------
i have taste buds on my tongue that will


---------77:01----------
detect certain chemicals


---------77:03----------
those chemicals will route to my


---------77:05----------
gustatory cortex


---------77:06----------
and my gustatory cortex will sort of


---------77:09----------
route to my gustatory association cortex


---------77:11----------
and will tell me this water is good yeah


---------77:14----------
but


---------77:15----------
even though that neurological pathway


---------77:18----------
happens


---------77:19----------
it doesn't capture the actual experience


---------77:22----------
of water


---------77:23----------
yeah okay so you can study the


---------77:26----------
neuroscience of fear as much as you want


---------77:28----------
to


---------77:28----------
it's not going to teach you what feeling


---------77:30----------
afraid is like


---------77:33----------
yeah okay so the yogis sort of concluded


---------77:36----------
that like


---------77:37----------
there are these three buckets experience


---------77:40----------
is its own bucket


---------77:41----------
and this is where things get really


---------77:42----------
interesting because still in a dream


---------77:44----------
you experience so they actually


---------77:46----------
concluded that dreams and reality are


---------77:48----------
actually like no different


---------77:50----------
that all of and so when we talk about


---------77:53----------
enlightenment


---------77:54----------
one of the things that people say is you


---------77:55----------
sort of like wake up


---------77:57----------
and that's when you become enlightened


---------77:59----------
and that may sound like super mystical


---------78:01----------
but we actually do this [ __ ]


---------78:02----------
all the time where like you kind of talk


---------78:04----------
about getting caught up and stuff right


---------78:06----------
so you say that you used to feel


---------78:07----------
inadequate


---------78:08----------
you would lie down on the floor and your


---------78:10----------
mind would be telling you all sorts


---------78:12----------
of things and then i think at some point


---------78:14----------
you woke up


---------78:16----------
and you stopped doing that and you're


---------78:17----------
more at peace because you kind of just


---------78:19----------
woke up and if someone were to ask you


---------78:22----------
ludwig how do i stop caring about my


---------78:24----------
viewers


---------78:24----------
and you'd be like i don't know and


---------78:27----------
they're like how did you do it and you


---------78:28----------
were like


---------78:29----------
i laid down for a while the thoughts


---------78:31----------
were in my head


---------78:32----------
i tortured myself and then it just kind


---------78:35----------
of stopped one day


---------78:37----------
and then they they go and they lay down


---------78:39----------
and they're like i'm being tortured


---------78:40----------
ludwig how do i stop and you're like


---------78:42----------
i don't know it just kind of happened


---------78:44----------
that is an example


---------78:45----------
of you becoming more conscious


---------78:50----------
okay you're less trapped within your


---------78:52----------
mind it's just like you snap


---------78:54----------
out of the dream and then you awake to


---------78:55----------
reality you snap out of that mental


---------78:58----------
pattern you're like


---------78:59----------
i really can't do anything about it i'm


---------79:00----------
just gonna make the [ __ ] content that


---------79:02----------
i want to


---------79:03----------
i'm just gonna control whatever i can


---------79:05----------
which is myself it's like does that make


---------79:07----------
sense you become more conscious


---------79:09----------
it's also like we call this like taking


---------79:11----------
a step back


---------79:13----------
right where sometimes you get so tangled


---------79:14----------
up in something


---------79:16----------
and then you learn how to take a step


---------79:17----------
back and if we think about what you did


---------79:20----------
in the dream


---------79:21----------
you took a step back from the dream and


---------79:22----------
it shattered the dream


---------79:25----------
and so what the yogis say is that this


---------79:26----------
is something that can be learned it is a


---------79:28----------
skill


---------79:29----------
the process of learning to stay take a


---------79:31----------
step back


---------79:32----------
makes you more conscious results in more


---------79:35----------
peace


---------79:36----------
and tranquility results in more control


---------79:39----------
over your mind


---------79:40----------
and moves you one step towards something


---------79:43----------
that they call divinity which is like


---------79:45----------
the ultimate realization


---------79:46----------
that it's like taking the complete step


---------79:48----------
back


---------79:51----------
yeah with me you can only do that


---------79:54----------
you can just do that whenever is like


---------79:57----------
this complete step back


---------79:59----------
sort of yeah or arguably you've already


---------80:01----------
done it


---------80:02----------
you just don't realize it i have i have


---------80:05----------
one


---------80:07----------
hole that i want to talk about real


---------80:09----------
quick yeah


---------80:10----------
people old people are my whole why are


---------80:13----------
old people your whole


---------80:15----------
because they get we


---------80:18----------
get like dumber and when you're older


---------80:21----------
your brain starts to i feel like


---------80:22----------
deteriorate a bit


---------80:23----------
and it can be because of you know


---------80:25----------
whatever


---------80:27----------
uh malady you've gone through but you


---------80:30----------
know like the older you get like when


---------80:32----------
you're like


---------80:33----------
95 sometimes your brain starts to like


---------80:36----------
you know get a little less sharp but


---------80:39----------
wouldn't the conscious only get stronger


---------80:42----------
why would the consciousness get stronger


---------80:45----------
because it's experienced more and it's


---------80:47----------
not weighted to


---------80:48----------
bodily problems


---------80:56----------
let me think about that so you're saying


---------80:59----------
that


---------81:01----------
since there is a brain that decays and


---------81:04----------
older people appear to be less conscious


---------81:08----------
the more their brain decays wouldn't


---------81:10----------
that imply that consciousness is born of


---------81:12----------
the brain


---------81:14----------
yes


---------81:19----------
yes you are correct


---------81:22----------
bro the yogi should have brought me in


---------81:25----------
what now so that's where i would


---------81:30----------
i don't know whether consciousness


---------81:35----------
i the short answer is that's something i


---------81:37----------
actually don't know so the only way to


---------81:39----------
really understand that


---------81:41----------
i think it's actually still holds up but


---------81:43----------
really the true way to understand that


---------81:45----------
is to have


---------81:46----------
a mental decay and see if you can


---------81:48----------
preserve a sense of consciousness


---------81:51----------
yeah because i guess we only know that


---------81:54----------
based off how we perceive them to act


---------81:55----------
but maybe their brain is


---------81:57----------
chilling yep so so you may just you just


---------82:00----------
may be aware and this happens sometimes


---------82:01----------
right where like you're observing your


---------82:03----------
mind going wild


---------82:06----------
like you'll see this a lot in people


---------82:08----------
have panic attacks


---------82:09----------
where they recognize that their mind is


---------82:11----------
going crazy and there's a part of them


---------82:12----------
that's like holy [ __ ]


---------82:14----------
my mind is wild i can't control it at


---------82:16----------
all it happens


---------82:17----------
sometimes if i take an edible you so you


---------82:20----------
can still


---------82:21----------
so so but then the question is someone


---------82:23----------
on the outside


---------82:24----------
even though your awareness of your mind


---------82:27----------
and your consciousness may be intact


---------82:29----------
someone on the outside would say you're


---------82:31----------
impaired


---------82:33----------
i it's not that they outwardly say it


---------82:35----------
but i'm like that's what the perception


---------82:37----------
would be


---------82:38----------
yes yes right so so like and i think so


---------82:41----------
then the question becomes does your


---------82:42----------
quality of so


---------82:43----------
actually you can do this experiment so


---------82:44----------
this is where ultimately ludwig like


---------82:46----------
it's not going to be logic that pokes a


---------82:48----------
hole in this


---------82:49----------
the only way you can ever poke a hole in


---------82:51----------
this is to experience something


---------82:54----------
come to me and then you're not going to


---------82:55----------
poke a hole you're going to tell me


---------82:57----------
you are wrong because then you will have


---------82:59----------
an experience of it so this is what i


---------83:00----------
would say


---------83:02----------
first of all understand that the the


---------83:05----------
quality of consciousness


---------83:07----------
and then see if the quality of


---------83:08----------
consciousness alters


---------83:11----------
through alterations in your


---------83:13----------
neurochemistry


---------83:15----------
and this is where like one of my


---------83:16----------
favorite experiences is meditating while


---------83:18----------
drunk


---------83:20----------
because my experience has actually been


---------83:22----------
that the consciousness remains exactly


---------83:24----------
the same


---------83:25----------
it is simply the mind and the body which


---------83:27----------
change


---------83:28----------
yeah and actually the more that i think


---------83:31----------
about it


---------83:32----------
that actually what your suggestion is


---------83:34----------
probably actually gives us better


---------83:36----------
evidence


---------83:37----------
for what i'm saying which is that mind


---------83:39----------
and body are actually fundamentally


---------83:40----------
different from consciousness


---------83:44----------
i'm following i have never thought about


---------83:47----------
that but it is


---------83:48----------
true that i have reflected on how


---------83:51----------
i am acting which yeah yeah that's


---------83:55----------
philosophically deep for my brain i


---------83:57----------
think so forget about philosophy this is


---------83:59----------
not about philosophy this is about


---------84:01----------
experience


---------84:02----------
okay so the question is like close your


---------84:04----------
eyes right now


---------84:06----------
okay and notice yes okay [ __ ] okay


---------84:10----------
notice your thoughts


---------84:13----------
and notice that there's a noticing


---------84:15----------
capacity and then there are thoughts


---------84:18----------
sure right and so now like the next time


---------84:21----------
you take an edible i'm not saying that


---------84:23----------
you should use drugs but if you use


---------84:25----------
drugs yeah try to see


---------84:28----------
what the difference between those two


---------84:29----------
things is and see what it is that has


---------84:31----------
changed within you


---------84:33----------
yes and and this is where what you'll


---------84:36----------
really discover is like this gets like


---------84:37----------
super deep into [ __ ] like the self right


---------84:39----------
what is it that's you


---------84:41----------
you're ludwig you have facial hair right


---------84:45----------
now


---------84:46----------
i do i haven't shaved and there was a


---------84:48----------
ludwig that existed before you had


---------84:50----------
facial hair


---------84:51----------
is that still ludwig


---------84:54----------
yes so how do you know who ludwig is


---------84:59----------
because it's not your physical form if


---------85:02----------
you lost a hand would you still be


---------85:03----------
ludwig


---------85:06----------
i think it's uh


---------85:09----------
how i interact with the world


---------85:12----------
based off of my previous experiences


---------85:15----------
okay so this is stuff that you should


---------85:17----------
explore but essentially what the yogis


---------85:19----------
concluded is that you think about


---------85:21----------
anything that you use to define ludwig


---------85:24----------
including your name


---------85:26----------
and that's not really who you are yeah


---------85:29----------
because you could say ludwig is a twitch


---------85:31----------
streamer and but you were


---------85:33----------
ludwig before you were a twitch streamer


---------85:34----------
you're gonna be ludwig after your twitch


---------85:36----------
streamer


---------85:37----------
yeah ludwig is single like so if we look


---------85:39----------
at in cells like in cells identify


---------85:41----------
with the concept of being in cell and


---------85:43----------
then one day they get a girlfriend like


---------85:44----------
what happens do they


---------85:45----------
are they shattered so this thing that we


---------85:47----------
call identity this is a hamkar ego the i


---------85:50----------
feeling


---------85:50----------
or identity is all false and the yogis


---------85:54----------
realize that the only thing that truly


---------85:56----------
exists


---------85:56----------
is this consciousness that your mind


---------85:59----------
changes your emotions change


---------86:00----------
your bodies change your status and life


---------86:03----------
changes and therefore


---------86:04----------
all of these things cannot be real so


---------86:07----------
matter can change but at the end of the


---------86:09----------
day there's like a finite amount of


---------86:11----------
matter in the universe there's a finite


---------86:13----------
amount of energy in the universe and


---------86:14----------
there's a finite amount of this third


---------86:16----------
thing called consciousness


---------86:18----------
and the essence of who you are still


---------86:22----------
exists


---------86:22----------
no matter what kind of change you go


---------86:24----------
through


---------86:25----------
and so now we get to death because what


---------86:29----------
happens to that essence


---------86:32----------
when you die


---------86:35----------
is death a physical thing


---------86:38----------
is it a mental thing both right


---------86:42----------
sure is it a thing of but what we're


---------86:45----------
saying is that there's a consciousness


---------86:47----------
there is a ludwig essence yeah that


---------86:50----------
[Music]


---------86:51----------
transcends your body and your mind


---------86:53----------
because your body and your mind change


---------86:54----------
all the time but there's a certain


---------86:56----------
constant blood weakness


---------86:58----------
and that is your consciousness yeah so


---------87:00----------
what the yogis would claim


---------87:02----------
actually and this claim is based on


---------87:04----------
practice


---------87:05----------
so what they claim is that that


---------87:08----------
ludwigness


---------87:09----------
is like always going to be there just


---------87:12----------
like


---------87:12----------
matter is always going to be there and


---------87:14----------
energy is always going to be there


---------87:16----------
it can change form but there is a


---------87:18----------
certain amount of


---------87:19----------
permanence of stuff in the universe


---------87:22----------
which is actually like scientifically


---------87:23----------
supported right so


---------87:24----------
like we know that matter and energy


---------87:26----------
can't be destroyed and so now the real


---------87:28----------
question is is this


---------87:29----------
do we have scientific evidence of this


---------87:31----------
third thing and the short answer is


---------87:33----------
not really but maybe and this is where


---------87:36----------
you get into hokey stuff around quantum


---------87:38----------
mechanics which


---------87:39----------
one of my friends a lot of people like


---------87:40----------
draw parallels between like yoga and


---------87:42----------
like these


---------87:43----------
eastern mystics and quantum mechanics


---------87:44----------
and i have a friend who's a quantum


---------87:45----------
physicist who's like


---------87:46----------
that shit's [ __ ] quantum mechanics


---------87:48----------
is about math it's not about like yoga


---------87:50----------
hippies saying that like


---------87:51----------
you know whatever we can get into that


---------87:53----------
if you want to so now going back to your


---------87:55----------
original question of like what happens


---------87:57----------
after death


---------87:58----------
and why do you think this question is


---------87:59----------
important to you


---------88:01----------
because i'm gonna die and everyone i


---------88:04----------
know will


---------88:06----------
so you know i'd like to know like if a


---------88:08----------
friend moves to europe i'd like to know


---------88:10----------
if they're okay and they're doing well


---------88:14----------
is it about your dad for sure


---------88:17----------
yeah right yeah so you want to know


---------88:19----------
everything i mean every everybody right


---------88:22----------
yes everyone but i think for you like


---------88:24----------
let's admit it and i think your mind


---------88:25----------
deviates away from this right because


---------88:27----------
your mind focuses on the positive


---------88:29----------
yeah but you want to know if your dad is


---------88:31----------
doing okay yeah


---------88:34----------
that's it right yeah sure all this other


---------88:36----------
[ __ ] is philosophical


---------88:37----------
that's the way that your mind cloaks


---------88:40----------
something negative


---------88:41----------
in something positive if you don't look


---------88:43----------
at the badness and like you want to know


---------88:45----------
like is my dad doing okay and it's okay


---------88:47----------
to


---------88:47----------
ask that right this is where now we get


---------88:49----------
to the subtle layers of where you need


---------88:51----------
to grow


---------88:52----------
it's okay to sit with that thought and


---------88:55----------
like not


---------88:56----------
know you don't have to think about your


---------88:58----------
friends and what's gonna happen to you


---------89:00----------
it's okay to like


---------89:01----------
not know and sit with that negativity it


---------89:04----------
doesn't mean that you're molding and


---------89:06----------
this is where


---------89:07----------
molding is within the mind the more you


---------89:09----------
become conscious and now we come full


---------89:11----------
circle


---------89:12----------
because what i'm saying is that as you


---------89:13----------
gain in consciousness


---------89:15----------
you don't need to wait positive greater


---------89:17----------
than negative


---------89:19----------
everything is what it is right so like


---------89:22----------
you used to be


---------89:23----------
trapped in this idea of like oh my god


---------89:25----------
i'm not gonna get enough viewers i'm not


---------89:27----------
gonna get enough viewers


---------89:28----------
nothing changed when you became more


---------89:30----------
conscious


---------89:31----------
you were just like i just can't control


---------89:33----------
that [ __ ] whatever i'll get viewers i


---------89:34----------
won't get viewers


---------89:35----------
i know analytics i've done my homework


---------89:38----------
i've studied for the test i can't


---------89:40----------
control where i


---------89:40----------
whether i get an a but i can be


---------89:42----------
confident in the work that i have done


---------89:44----------
yeah i like that analogy right


---------89:48----------
and that's that's consciousness so then


---------89:50----------
suddenly if i had asked ludwig before


---------89:52----------
your realization and after


---------89:53----------
your realization ludwig


---------89:57----------
hold on let me think about this i just


---------89:58----------
lost it because it's trying to tie so


---------90:00----------
many


---------90:01----------
threads together


---------90:04----------
[ __ ] i had something oh yeah so


---------90:08----------
so prior to your realization negativity


---------90:12----------
meant more to you even though your


---------90:15----------
situation doesn't change


---------90:18----------
your mind was like more like nothing


---------90:20----------
changed after your realization right


---------90:22----------
like


---------90:23----------
all of the bleak things that you were


---------90:24----------
worried about are still exactly the same


---------90:28----------
does that make sense yeah that's true


---------90:30----------
and so


---------90:31----------
the negativity was born of your mind it


---------90:33----------
wasn't actually born of reality and when


---------90:35----------
you become more conscious


---------90:36----------
that negativity that all of the all of


---------90:38----------
those things that you were struggling


---------90:39----------
with were just as true


---------90:41----------
although they feel less negative you


---------90:44----------
with me


---------90:44----------
yeah i'm with you and so as


---------90:46----------
consciousness grows the difference


---------90:48----------
between positivity and negativity starts


---------90:50----------
to shrink


---------90:52----------
and now we get to where you need to grow


---------90:54----------
because your mind focuses on the


---------90:55----------
positive instead of focusing on the


---------90:56----------
negative


---------90:57----------
which is absolutely adaptive the next


---------91:00----------
step


---------91:01----------
is to recognize that you don't need to


---------91:02----------
do that anymore because there's no


---------91:04----------
difference


---------91:06----------
right [ __ ] happens so be it i don't have


---------91:08----------
to look away from it


---------91:10----------
yeah yeah i feel that


---------91:13----------
sometimes i do think about the negative


---------91:16----------
sometimes then though when i think about


---------91:17----------
the negative i feel like i'm thinking


---------91:18----------
about it in a performative way like i


---------91:20----------
need to think about this


---------91:22----------
yep which is also a weird experience


---------91:25----------
um like even like just by myself so


---------91:29----------
yeah so that's why it there's a lot of


---------91:32----------
reasons why


---------91:33----------
it feels weird to think about the


---------91:36----------
negative i think


---------91:38----------
yep and so the key thing is going to be


---------91:41----------
that you don't


---------91:42----------
as you grow in consciousness you don't


---------91:44----------
need to focus on the positive anymore


---------91:47----------
okay and you can sit with both things


---------91:50----------
you can be grateful that you got a car


---------91:51----------
but for [ __ ] sake man


---------91:53----------
your dad died when you were 10 yeah and


---------91:56----------
you're allowed to be upset about that


---------91:58----------
like what the [ __ ]


---------92:00----------
yeah right you're allowed to like you're


---------92:02----------
entitled to a little bit of like


---------92:05----------
sag and pity and compassion from other


---------92:09----------
people


---------92:10----------
and it doesn't change the two are


---------92:11----------
completely unrelated like


---------92:14----------
like how the [ __ ] just look at that it's


---------92:17----------
absurd that your mind has an equation


---------92:19----------
where the death of your dad in a car or


---------92:21----------
like


---------92:23----------
one to one it's more one to one just the


---------92:26----------
fact that your mind even associates


---------92:27----------
those two things is like [ __ ] dumb


---------92:29----------
okay sure okay right yeah that's


---------92:33----------
not wrong and so that's that's how


---------92:35----------
you've that's how you've grown and


---------92:37----------
that's how you've adapted and it's like


---------92:39----------
awesome that you have gratitude for life


---------92:41----------
it's awesome that you're compassionate


---------92:43----------
it's awesome that you put other people


---------92:44----------
first


---------92:45----------
it's awesome that you try to make people


---------92:46----------
laugh


---------92:48----------
and are you a positive person yes but


---------92:50----------
being a positive person doesn't mean


---------92:52----------
that you're not entitled to like some


---------92:53----------
amount of grief


---------92:55----------
and some amount of like that sucks for


---------92:57----------
me


---------92:58----------
yeah right and so like learning to sit


---------93:00----------
with it is gonna happen the more like so


---------93:02----------
the more you try to learn how to sit


---------93:04----------
with it the more conscious you will


---------93:05----------
become


---------93:06----------
the more conscious you become the more


---------93:07----------
you will be able to sit with it


---------93:09----------
okay so the advantage of sitting with


---------93:11----------
negative thoughts and emotions


---------93:13----------
is that i'll become more conscious


---------93:16----------
ideally yes


---------93:17----------
because sitting with it is not reacting


---------93:19----------
to it the even the phrase sitting with


---------93:21----------
it implies that the consciousness is


---------93:23----------
there


---------93:23----------
so the opposite of sitting with it is


---------93:25----------
getting wrapped up in it


---------93:27----------
and if you talk about getting wrapped up


---------93:29----------
in it then we're kind of stuck where


---------93:30----------
we're


---------93:30----------
walking around in the fogginess of our


---------93:32----------
mind where our mind is telling us all


---------93:34----------
kinds of things and we think that and


---------93:35----------
this is wild


---------93:36----------
just think about this for a second you


---------93:38----------
think your thoughts are true


---------93:41----------
yeah which is the dumbest [ __ ] thing


---------93:42----------
in the world because like what is a


---------93:44----------
thought


---------93:48----------
chatting uh yeah that's a good point


---------93:51----------
that's a good right


---------93:52----------
but when we get caught up in our mind


---------93:53----------
it's like i can think about


---------93:56----------
you know i'm gonna make a paladin who's


---------93:59----------
a half orc half unicorn that's a [ __ ]


---------94:02----------
thought it has no bearing on reality


---------94:05----------
yeah like that's gonna be my next dd


---------94:07----------
character


---------94:09----------
you've thought it up already it doesn't


---------94:12----------
make it real


---------94:13----------
like it's just thought yes


---------94:17----------
i yeah i've always thought i guess it's


---------94:18----------
not real until it's actualized


---------94:23----------
you know yeah but then we get down to


---------94:24----------
the whole rack of the road of dreams and


---------94:26----------
[ __ ] right so then like ultimately yeah


---------94:28----------
you know yeah so is that is a dream real


---------94:31----------
because you certainly experience it


---------94:33----------
so if dreams didn't exist for sure


---------94:35----------
nothing happens after we die


---------94:38----------
because if dreams didn't exist we'd have


---------94:40----------
no qualitative evidence


---------94:42----------
that anything but nothing


---------94:45----------
is uh certain after death right like i


---------94:48----------
feel like dreams are the one


---------94:50----------
wrench in the science community's


---------94:54----------
beliefs


---------94:54----------
on death no because the science


---------94:57----------
community's beliefs on death will just


---------94:58----------
be that dreams are just figments of the


---------95:00----------
like they're very materialistic in their


---------95:02----------
view yeah


---------95:03----------
they just say that like dreams are a


---------95:05----------
creation of the brain


---------95:07----------
whereas the way that i talk about it is


---------95:09----------
like just because you see the sign


---------95:12----------
of something reflected in something else


---------95:14----------
does not mean that that is all there is


---------95:16----------
so what i mean by that is let's say i


---------95:18----------
have a sheet hanging in the wind


---------95:20----------
and all i see is the movement of the


---------95:22----------
sheet and therefore i conclude that the


---------95:25----------
wind doesn't exist and all that exists


---------95:26----------
is the sheet


---------95:27----------
because it's all that i observe it's the


---------95:30----------
only thing that i can see it's the only


---------95:31----------
thing that i can touch


---------95:32----------
but the wind exists outside of the sheet


---------95:36----------
and ripples into the physical world on


---------95:39----------
the sheet


---------95:40----------
so in the same way just because the


---------95:42----------
brain is a physical ripple


---------95:44----------
of experience doesn't mean that the


---------95:46----------
brain is the only thing that exists


---------95:48----------
yes i don't know if that's going to make


---------95:50----------
sense or not i think that analogy caught


---------95:52----------
on for me yeah


---------95:53----------
yeah right so it's just the brain is


---------95:55----------
simply like the physical reflection


---------95:57----------
of certain things that happen and we're


---------96:00----------
falling into a really tricky trap


---------96:02----------
because just because we can observe the


---------96:03----------
brain and we can't


---------96:04----------
actually it's not a tricky trap it's


---------96:05----------
just how science works we just don't


---------96:07----------
have any direct ways to observe


---------96:08----------
consciousness yet


---------96:10----------
and so all we can see is the brain so


---------96:12----------
that's all we think exists


---------96:13----------
do you think that's okay though that we


---------96:14----------
don't sure i think it's the way that


---------96:16----------
science works


---------96:18----------
right so this has been around huh


---------96:20----------
they've been around like no one's done


---------96:22----------
it you know what i mean like observed it


---------96:23----------
in a


---------96:25----------
yeah so so that gets into the problem of


---------96:27----------
the observed and the observe


---------96:28----------
that the observer and the observed can't


---------96:30----------
be the same thing


---------96:31----------
yeah right so this is where this is


---------96:33----------
where the hokie quantum mechanics stuff


---------96:36----------
kind of comes in because some people


---------96:38----------
believe like there's this thought


---------96:39----------
experiment called schrodinger's cat are


---------96:40----------
you familiar with that


---------96:42----------
yeah yeah of course so like the thing


---------96:43----------
with schrodinger's cat is that


---------96:45----------
reality doesn't actually exist reality


---------96:47----------
is just sort of this weird wave form of


---------96:50----------
probabilities


---------96:51----------
and that matter is like coalesces into


---------96:54----------
reality through the act of observation


---------96:56----------
which is [ __ ] wild because the yogis


---------96:58----------
for thousands of years


---------97:00----------
have been saying that the most


---------97:01----------
fundamental thing that exists is the act


---------97:03----------
of observation


---------97:05----------
yeah right and so this is where the the


---------97:07----------
counter argument to that if you're a


---------97:08----------
physics is you can say whatever you want


---------97:10----------
to with real language


---------97:11----------
but unless there's math to back it up


---------97:13----------
you don't know what the [ __ ] you're


---------97:14----------
talking about


---------97:15----------
which is you know fair yeah


---------97:18----------
has a yogi or anyone ever gone


---------97:21----------
in to the wake up mode um enlightenment


---------97:24----------
and then just and then just


---------97:25----------
never came back to their body because i


---------97:27----------
feel like that


---------97:28----------
would be a a good observation


---------97:32----------
of it being real does that make sense he


---------97:36----------
has not come back to their body but then


---------97:38----------
how would you know then if they had


---------97:39----------
gained enlightenment because then it was


---------97:43----------
it was like they self-actualized leaving


---------97:47----------
the body like if i said


---------97:49----------
hey i'm a dip now i'm going to let my


---------97:52----------
brain leave


---------97:53----------
and then my body never comes back and i


---------97:55----------
called my own shots


---------97:58----------
yeah so so this is the short answer is


---------98:01----------
yes


---------98:01----------
lots of people but i sort of have


---------98:03----------
skepticism over that


---------98:05----------
so a lot what a lot of people will so


---------98:07----------
this is where like people in


---------98:08----------
religious traditions ramakrishna you can


---------98:10----------
look him up on wikipedia


---------98:12----------
it's just the first person that comes to


---------98:14----------
my mind who sort of did this and he's


---------98:16----------
like i'm a peace out now


---------98:18----------
i'm done you call this shot yeah and


---------98:20----------
then everyone was around and then he


---------98:21----------
just never came back


---------98:22----------
yep that's insane i think it happens a


---------98:25----------
lot so this is also where i think what


---------98:27----------
happens is religious traditions


---------98:30----------
say that that's what their spiritual


---------98:31----------
master does when they just die


---------98:34----------
yeah okay so i'm a skeptic by by nature


---------98:38----------
so ultimately ludwig so that has people


---------98:41----------
have called their shots absolutely


---------98:43----------
ultimately this is what i'm going to


---------98:44----------
tell you if you want to understand what


---------98:45----------
happens with death


---------98:48----------
step number one is like just experience


---------98:51----------
it


---------98:51----------
and i don't mean commit suicide so i


---------98:53----------
don't think you should commit suicide


---------98:54----------
but what what i what i mean by that is


---------98:56----------
like there are certain meditations that


---------98:58----------
you can do


---------98:59----------
to like recall your past lives and so


---------99:02----------
that [ __ ] is just it's hard to describe


---------99:04----------
but it's just


---------99:04----------
wild it's like the best thing that i can


---------99:08----------
that's what i can use wonderful so


---------99:11----------
basically you have


---------99:12----------
memories of your past right yeah


---------99:15----------
so so like there's some meditation


---------99:16----------
techniques that you can do where you


---------99:18----------
just like


---------99:19----------
have memories of your past except


---------99:22----------
they're just not


---------99:23----------
this life yeah it's like you remember


---------99:25----------
like this thing that you used to do with


---------99:26----------
your dad where you guys used to do the


---------99:28----------
shower race


---------99:29----------
yeah it's like you know you just have a


---------99:31----------
memory where like you and your dad used


---------99:32----------
to like


---------99:34----------
you know put horse horseshoes on a horse


---------99:37----------
and you're like oh [ __ ] i was a girl


---------99:39----------
back then and i just it's just


---------99:40----------
it's the same quality of memory and then


---------99:42----------
you're like whoa that's [ __ ] weird i


---------99:44----------
have


---------99:44----------
this whole like pile of memories sitting


---------99:46----------
in my hard drive


---------99:47----------
that i just don't that now i remember


---------99:50----------
even though


---------99:51----------
and it just it's weird it like really


---------99:53----------
causes you to question because


---------99:54----------
you've got this whole consistent memory


---------99:56----------
bank but it's just not from this life


---------99:58----------
and then like then how do you reconcile


---------100:01----------
that


---------100:02----------
do you call it fantasy but it feels so


---------100:04----------
consistent


---------100:05----------
and it's so like longitudinal


---------100:08----------
and and this is where like i've seen


---------100:10----------
this in [ __ ] weird ways okay so like


---------100:12----------
i had this one patient who had like


---------100:14----------
really bad ptsd except


---------100:17----------
she had never had a trauma she went to


---------100:20----------
like a bunch of psychiatrists


---------100:22----------
and this is weird like i i'm i'm the


---------100:24----------
first one to say like i don't know what


---------100:25----------
the [ __ ] to make of this


---------100:27----------
except it's happened she went to a lot


---------100:29----------
of psychiatrists and wound up with me


---------100:30----------
because


---------100:31----------
you know she was interested in holistic


---------100:33----------
psychiatry like meditation oh my god


---------100:35----------
so we like did that [ __ ] for a while and


---------100:37----------
it wasn't really helping and then like


---------100:38----------
i kind of asked her i was like you know


---------100:40----------
so it seems like you've got all the


---------100:41----------
features of ptsd


---------100:43----------
but like there's no trauma like we dug


---------100:45----------
and dug and dug and dug and dug


---------100:47----------
couldn't find any trauma in her life and


---------100:48----------
it's like what the [ __ ] so then one day


---------100:50----------
we were just like kind of talking i was


---------100:52----------
like


---------100:52----------
did you get traumatized in a past life


---------100:54----------
and she was like yes


---------100:55----------
and i was like tell me about that and


---------100:57----------
then she just started telling me all


---------100:58----------
this [ __ ]


---------100:59----------
that didn't happen to her and i [ __ ] you


---------101:02----------
not she got sexually abused by a cult


---------101:03----------
leader in a past life


---------101:05----------
and then like the second we figured that


---------101:07----------
out i know it sounds weird it's [ __ ]


---------101:09----------
weird it didn't happen to her it's not


---------101:11----------
real


---------101:11----------
but from a clinical perspective once we


---------101:13----------
did therapy over that trauma


---------101:16----------
she got better and as a scientist i have


---------101:19----------
no idea


---------101:20----------
how to understand that yeah


---------101:24----------
so this is like the best i can come up


---------101:26----------
with is maybe she saw like a movie


---------101:28----------
when she was a kid and she thought it


---------101:31----------
was her and that was traumatic


---------101:33----------
but that just sounds like a stretch


---------101:35----------
right like


---------101:36----------
yeah i mean people i would just


---------101:40----------
mark it off as loony yeah absolutely


---------101:43----------
so she's off her rocker i'm off her


---------101:45----------
rocker i sure as hell i'm not scientific


---------101:48----------
you know because that doesn't bear in


---------101:49----------
reality but as a clinician


---------101:51----------
like what do you do when you do therapy


---------101:54----------
for memories that don't exist


---------101:56----------
and a patient gets better like how do


---------101:57----------
you understand that like the clinical


---------101:59----------
result


---------102:00----------
is absolutely real i don't know


---------102:03----------
i really don't know


---------102:08----------
yeah and this this happens occasionally


---------102:10----------
you'll get people who like you know


---------102:11----------
hypnotize and like it's like really bad


---------102:13----------
science like really


---------102:15----------
kind of hokey [ __ ] i don't trust most of


---------102:17----------
it i wouldn't trust myself like


---------102:19----------
it's not a technique that i employ on a


---------102:21----------
regular basis it's like because i don't


---------102:22----------
know what the [ __ ] happened there i mean


---------102:23----------
maybe she's delusional maybe i'm


---------102:25----------
delusional


---------102:26----------
maybe i implanted something or steered


---------102:28----------
her in a certain way i have no idea


---------102:30----------
yeah anyway that's earnest


---------102:35----------
yeah so questions thoughts


---------102:38----------
um i think my current thoughts


---------102:42----------
are uh to sit with negative emotions


---------102:46----------
and then the rest of it kind of sounds


---------102:48----------
like the avatar state


---------102:50----------
which i don't think i can do at this


---------102:52----------
point but seems cool


---------102:56----------
yeah i'm gonna teach you two practices


---------102:59----------
i'm down i'm just so you know let me


---------103:00----------
just say this i gotta dip in about


---------103:02----------
i would say about like five minutes


---------103:04----------
that's totally fine practices are gonna


---------103:06----------
be short


---------103:07----------
perfect so first practice


---------103:10----------
i'm going to teach you step one and it's


---------103:12----------
going to be sort of the same as step two


---------103:14----------
okay i want you to sit in the moment


---------103:18----------
between inhalation and exhalation


---------103:21----------
but don't hold your breath


---------103:24----------
okay okay i'm manually breathing now


---------103:27----------
though


---------103:28----------
yep so notice the inhalation


---------103:31----------
notice the exhalation don't pause in


---------103:34----------
between


---------103:36----------
but there is a space where between


---------103:40----------
inhalation and acceleration must exist


---------103:43----------
it does exist i can't tell if i've


---------103:44----------
manually made it longer or


---------103:46----------
slower or faster you know yep so just


---------103:49----------
sit in that space


---------103:51----------
helps with your eyes closed we're going


---------103:52----------
to do this for about 60 seconds


---------104:47----------
okay come back to us what was that like


---------104:51----------
for you


---------104:52----------
breathing out is way easier


---------104:55----------
okay were you able to even find any


---------104:58----------
inkling of the space between the two


---------105:02----------
yeah i think in a way i don't know it


---------105:04----------
felt like i'm like a mario party mini


---------105:06----------
game


---------105:07----------
yep and i was good you know i was i was


---------105:09----------
thinking about that great way to


---------105:10----------
describe it


---------105:11----------
yeah that's how it felt okay wow that's


---------105:13----------
the best description of meditation i've


---------105:15----------
ever heard now that i thought about it


---------105:17----------
so here's the next thing okay so this is


---------105:20----------
going to be practice


---------105:21----------
for the real technique okay catch the


---------105:23----------
moment of sleep


---------105:27----------
so there is a moment where you were


---------105:30----------
awake


---------105:31----------
and then there is a moment that you were


---------105:33----------
asleep yeah right


---------105:36----------
yeah sit in the in between space


---------105:39----------
between wakefulness and sleeping okay


---------105:43----------
and and come back out or just try to sit


---------105:45----------
there sit there baby


---------105:47----------
don't be asleep and don't be awake i


---------105:49----------
catch the moment a lot actually because


---------105:51----------
the way i sleep is with my head hanging


---------105:52----------
off the bed and i have my phone and i


---------105:54----------
usually have a stream open


---------105:56----------
and the moment i'll fall to sleep i'll


---------105:58----------
let go of the phone


---------105:59----------
and so i'll catch myself in that moment


---------106:01----------
a lot right before i fall asleep


---------106:03----------
because the phone will fall out of my


---------106:04----------
hands stay there


---------106:07----------
yeah stay there as long as you can


---------106:10----------
okay okay and and this is where it's


---------106:13----------
interesting because


---------106:14----------
there's another conversation for another


---------106:16----------
day about your karma and how you were


---------106:18----------
meant


---------106:19----------
for this okay that you are halfway on


---------106:22----------
this road baby you're already halfway


---------106:24----------
there i'm just gonna give you a couple


---------106:25----------
of techniques


---------106:26----------
to help you go the rest of the way if


---------106:27----------
the techniques don't work you're going


---------106:29----------
to get there the rest of the way on your


---------106:30----------
own


---------106:31----------
okay okay


---------106:34----------
and then once once you do those for a


---------106:36----------
while then we'll give you a technique


---------106:37----------
specifically on death


---------106:39----------
but in that transition period when your


---------106:42----------
mind


---------106:42----------
it's anyway i won't say anymore but just


---------106:44----------
