---------00:00----------
like to support you in these things i'd


---------00:01----------
like to help you get into a good college


---------00:04----------
but when i try to do that like you seem


---------00:06----------
to fight me and then i get stuck


---------00:11----------
what do you think i should do about that


---------00:14----------
hey laila thank you so much for coming


---------00:17----------
give me one second


---------00:20----------
all right so


---------00:21----------
patrick thanks for joining us people


---------00:23----------
from patrick's community welcome


---------00:26----------
um so layla let me go ahead and figure


---------00:28----------
out how to get this do you have video or


---------00:31----------
no


---------00:32----------
i do have a video do i need to turn it


---------00:35----------
on or is it okay if just to beat off


---------00:38----------
um so it's it


---------00:40----------
so here's our approach so just to give


---------00:42----------
you a little bit of orienting you don't


---------00:45----------
have to do anything you don't want to do


---------00:46----------
today you don't have to answer any


---------00:49----------
questions that you don't feel


---------00:50----------
comfortable answering you do not have to


---------00:51----------
show your face if you don't want to


---------00:54----------
at the same time


---------00:56----------
i certainly benefit a lot from seeing


---------00:58----------
people's faces and i think the audience


---------01:00----------
does as well because sometimes you know


---------01:02----------
if we're just communicating by voice


---------01:04----------
like facial expressions like can


---------01:06----------
mean a lot


---------01:07----------
um but at the same time you know for


---------01:09----------
privacy concerns and things like that if


---------01:11----------
you don't feel comfortable doing that


---------01:12----------
you absolutely do not have to thank you


---------01:14----------
so i would prefer to not uh have a


---------01:18----------
video okay so that's totally fine thank


---------01:20----------
you


---------01:21----------
so um and are you okay with sort of the


---------01:24----------
rest of it like you feel okay uh you


---------01:26----------
know if i ask you anything that you


---------01:28----------
don't feel comfortable answering you're


---------01:29----------
kind of okay


---------01:30----------
saying yeah i don't want to answer that


---------01:32----------
yeah if i don't feel comfortable i'll


---------01:34----------
let you know


---------01:35----------
so is it is it just for me or someone


---------01:37----------
else also there and they can hear us or


---------01:41----------
or what


---------01:42----------
yeah was that not clear to you


---------01:44----------
so we are we're no


---------01:46----------
i they i know whoever sent me that email


---------01:49----------
uh and texted me


---------01:51----------
and just it seems that i just have an


---------01:54----------
appointment not with you know other


---------01:56----------
people


---------01:57----------
it seems to me you know


---------01:59----------
but could you please explain


---------02:01----------
yeah so let's let's maybe


---------02:04----------
let's maybe pause


---------02:06----------
because this is something that's very


---------02:07----------
very important to understand


---------02:09----------
so um what we try to do here at healthy


---------02:12----------
gamer is like have conversations with


---------02:15----------
individual people but we stream those


---------02:17----------
conversations on the internet


---------02:19----------
and so if you are not kind of aware of


---------02:22----------
that


---------02:23----------
um i think maybe what we should do is


---------02:25----------
like pause because


---------02:27----------
this is being streamed live


---------02:29----------
and and so


---------02:30----------
it you know


---------02:32----------
i don't wanna i would almost say like if


---------02:34----------
that's not what you understood like i


---------02:36----------
wouldn't even i don't think it's even


---------02:37----------
appropriate to ask you are you okay with


---------02:39----------
that because like i want you to make


---------02:41----------
that decision with a clear head


---------02:44----------
does that make sense i i think it's i'm


---------02:46----------
okay i just wanna we don't need to name


---------02:50----------
our our uh kids or just no no don't


---------02:53----------
answer the questions


---------02:54----------
yeah absolutely so so i think and i


---------02:56----------
think that's okay yeah so the other


---------02:59----------
thing about you know like i said earlier


---------03:00----------
like privacy is very important to us so


---------03:03----------
um you know if you don't want to use


---------03:04----------
your full name if you don't want to use


---------03:06----------
your kids name if you don't want to um


---------03:10----------
you know it


---------03:11----------
it's not you don't have to share


---------03:13----------
anything in fact we wouldn't recommend


---------03:14----------
that you do that okay okay sounds good


---------03:18----------
you sure about that


---------03:19----------
yes i am


---------03:21----------
positive


---------03:22----------
okay


---------03:23----------
okay so layla then why don't you tell me


---------03:25----------
a little bit about


---------03:26----------
so just the last thing to just to


---------03:28----------
clarify with you because i'm not sure


---------03:30----------
exactly what you understood so while i


---------03:32----------
am a psychiatrist um i don't do i don't


---------03:35----------
deliver medical advice over the internet


---------03:37----------
so i won't be diagnosing you with


---------03:39----------
anything i won't be diagnosing your kid


---------03:41----------
with anything and i'm not actually your


---------03:43----------
doctor do you understand that


---------03:45----------
yep


---------03:47----------
okay


---------03:48----------
okay so um then let me just share with


---------03:50----------
you a little bit about is it okay if i


---------03:52----------
kind of share with you a little bit


---------03:53----------
about why we do stream this on the


---------03:55----------
internet absolutely yes please


---------03:58----------
so i think what's going on in society


---------04:00----------
right now is that there's a disconnect


---------04:02----------
between parents and their children so


---------04:04----------
what we try to do at healthy gamer is we


---------04:06----------
have interviews oftentimes with you know


---------04:08----------
people like your kids


---------04:10----------
where they share their perspective and


---------04:12----------
their experience of growing up in this


---------04:13----------
world their relationship with their


---------04:15----------
parents


---------04:16----------
oftentimes we've found that parents who


---------04:19----------
watch kind of even like not you know


---------04:21----------
obviously it's not their kid but


---------04:22----------
watching someone who could be their kid


---------04:25----------
talk about their experience of life is


---------04:27----------
very educational for the parents


---------04:29----------
and helps them better understand their


---------04:32----------
their own children and how to


---------04:33----------
communicate with them and what could be


---------04:35----------
going on with their kids does that make


---------04:37----------
sense


---------04:38----------
yeah


---------04:39----------
now what we're trying to do is actually


---------04:42----------
flip it around because what we've


---------04:43----------
realized that healthy gamer is that so


---------04:45----------
most of our audience we reach somewhere


---------04:48----------
i don't know anywhere between like a


---------04:49----------
million and 20 million people um a month


---------04:53----------
what we've realized is that like


---------04:55----------
your kids or like the generation of your


---------04:58----------
children


---------04:59----------
could probably benefit from


---------05:01----------
understanding their parents perspective


---------05:04----------
and so the reason that we've asked you


---------05:05----------
to come today is to share your


---------05:07----------
experience of you know what you're like


---------05:08----------
what your ex what your situation with


---------05:10----------
your kid is like and so that hopefully


---------05:13----------
all of the kids out there who are


---------05:14----------
listening


---------05:15----------
will learn something about what a parent


---------05:17----------
goes through and we hope that by the


---------05:20----------
kids understanding what the parents go


---------05:22----------
through that it'll improve their


---------05:24----------
relationship


---------05:26----------
yeah does that make sense


---------05:27----------
yeah


---------05:29----------
okay


---------05:30----------
so why don't you tell me a little bit


---------05:31----------
about um you know what your situation is


---------05:34----------
and and maybe if there's anything i can


---------05:36----------
help you with


---------05:37----------
yeah so well i have a 14 years old uh


---------05:42----------
son who is you know recently so i mean


---------05:46----------
since the since the pandemic


---------05:48----------
and


---------05:49----------
he's been you know playing a lot on the


---------05:51----------
computer xbox and using his phone a lot


---------05:54----------
before then


---------05:55----------
we had a


---------05:57----------
time for phone and everything but since


---------05:59----------
you know the pandemic happened and


---------06:02----------
they were staying home all kids and they


---------06:04----------
didn't have much fun so


---------06:07----------
we just kind of break our rule


---------06:10----------
and now it becomes like more and like


---------06:12----------
kind of addiction


---------06:14----------
so okay and it definitely i mean it it


---------06:17----------
affects our relationship and i'm very


---------06:20----------
concerned about um


---------06:22----------
his


---------06:23----------
his school and his you know academic


---------06:27----------
sure so um let me ask you how is it that


---------06:30----------
what it what changes have you noticed in


---------06:32----------
your son


---------06:34----------
well using a lot i mean spending a lot


---------06:37----------
of time with it with his you know with


---------06:39----------
his phone and and xbox and you know


---------06:45----------
computers you know


---------06:47----------
when you


---------06:48----------
when you say a lot what does a lot mean


---------06:52----------
well


---------06:54----------
i mean during this so of course now you


---------06:56----------
know school soros


---------06:59----------
he can he he cannot use his phone as


---------07:01----------
much as he used to


---------07:03----------
but


---------07:04----------
after school like let's say


---------07:07----------
from 6 to 10 10 30 he use his his phone


---------07:12----------
and he i mean and


---------07:14----------
all others like xbox


---------07:17----------
so we're talking about like four to four


---------07:18----------
and a half hours per day


---------07:20----------
yes and then on weekends all day long uh


---------07:25----------
he's on his phone


---------07:27----------
what is he doing on his phone


---------07:29----------
well i mean talking to his friends you


---------07:31----------
know snapchat tick tock and stuff like


---------07:35----------
that


---------07:36----------
okay


---------07:37----------
and when you say he talks to his friends


---------07:38----------
he's like texting with his friends or


---------07:39----------
he's on like voices no phone like phone


---------07:42----------
calls


---------07:43----------
okay


---------07:44----------
and and this is a problem in your eyes


---------07:49----------
of course


---------07:50----------
i know sometimes i ask silly questions


---------07:54----------
it's just to kind of confirm so what do


---------07:56----------
you think is the problem here


---------07:59----------
well he we we don't understand you know


---------08:01----------
time together he doesn't you know


---------08:04----------
do


---------08:05----------
like


---------08:06----------
exercising you know doing other things


---------08:09----------
it's just it's just using phone all day


---------08:12----------
long


---------08:13----------
okay


---------08:14----------
um and what would you what would you


---------08:17----------
think would like what would you like him


---------08:19----------
to do like what would what would it what


---------08:21----------
would a healthy relationship with


---------08:23----------
technology look like in your mind well


---------08:26----------
like let's say


---------08:28----------
kind of actively like going like walking


---------08:30----------
or hiking or playing outside even either


---------08:34----------
with his friends or family


---------08:37----------
doing chores you know


---------08:39----------
doing something you know he he it could


---------08:41----------
be like you know


---------08:43----------
drawing it could be


---------08:45----------
some some other thing some other like


---------08:47----------
you know doing some art or doing


---------08:49----------
whatever you know


---------08:51----------
anything except


---------08:53----------
using his phone and


---------08:55----------
yeah that's that's what i'm hearing


---------08:57----------
right anything like that you know i


---------08:58----------
don't really care as long as it's


---------09:00----------
something besides the phone outside


---------09:02----------
cleaning someone's house


---------09:05----------
sure


---------09:07----------
and and what what happens when you try


---------09:09----------
to you know


---------09:11----------
how how do you try to get him to do


---------09:14----------
other things like what does that look


---------09:15----------
like


---------09:20----------
like how do you get him to try to do


---------09:21----------
chores or exercise oh how i mean


---------09:24----------
i have to


---------09:27----------
end up fighting


---------09:28----------
sometimes


---------09:30----------
turn off turn off the you know internet


---------09:33----------
or turn off you know because i have


---------09:35----------
access to his xbox


---------09:37----------
computer and i can turn off the internet


---------09:40----------
pause it


---------09:41----------
but i really for 14 years old i don't


---------09:44----------
want to get to that point and i don't


---------09:45----------
want any conflict any fighting i want


---------09:48----------
him to kind of understand and i tried a


---------09:50----------
lot a lot of things


---------09:52----------
so tell me what you've tried


---------09:55----------
well like you know


---------09:59----------
i mean give him like okay after you do


---------10:02----------
this i'll give you you know more time


---------10:04----------
i'll give you this oh you know


---------10:07----------
like some kind of prize not really you


---------10:10----------
know prize but something that motivate


---------10:12----------
him


---------10:13----------
and and what do you try to motivate for


---------10:15----------
short short terms you know and then


---------10:18----------
he kind of gave up and then he he just


---------10:20----------
doesn't want to do that


---------10:23----------
so leila um it sounds like you you know


---------10:25----------
here's what i'm hearing


---------10:27----------
yeah so your your son maybe had


---------10:29----------
healthier habits that kind of pandemic


---------10:31----------
hit


---------10:32----------
things got way worse


---------10:34----------
and now


---------10:35----------
you genuinely recognize that you know


---------10:37----------
it's starting to really become a problem


---------10:39----------
and you're doing your best to respect


---------10:42----------
his preferences


---------10:43----------
you try really hard to help him


---------10:46----------
understand um you try really hard not to


---------10:49----------
fight not to punish you don't want to


---------10:51----------
just be like you know a dictator in the


---------10:53----------
house you're not just going to unplug


---------10:54----------
the internet and you're kind of doing


---------10:56----------
your level best


---------10:57----------
to not resort to those severe


---------11:00----------
punishments


---------11:01----------
but that something is kind of getting


---------11:03----------
lost in communication and sometimes


---------11:05----------
you're almost forced into that position


---------11:07----------
yeah


---------11:09----------
is that pretty fair


---------11:10----------
yes


---------11:12----------
what is that like for you to be forced


---------11:14----------
into that position


---------11:19----------
for for sam to to do like


---------11:22----------
you you mean by by force force him or


---------11:26----------
well no i mean i was kind of wondering


---------11:27----------
like so here i what i'm sort of


---------11:30----------
envisioning is that you're you're a mom


---------11:32----------
who loves your son


---------11:33----------
and he's doing something that's


---------11:34----------
unhealthy for him


---------11:36----------
and i was just kind of noticing that it


---------11:38----------
must be like really hard for you to be


---------11:40----------
put into this situation where it's like


---------11:43----------
either he ruins his life


---------11:45----------
or


---------11:46----------
you're the bad guy


---------11:48----------
right there's like it almost feels like


---------11:49----------
a lose-lose situation to me


---------11:53----------
well no i i do i do that but um


---------11:57----------
i


---------11:58----------
i do kind of you know turn off like you


---------12:01----------
know i mean pause his cell phone his you


---------12:03----------
know


---------12:04----------
i if i


---------12:06----------
notice that he really needs but


---------12:08----------
sometimes he


---------12:11----------
by like late but he does it he he does


---------12:15----------
whatever he needs to maybe


---------12:17----------
a lot of reminds


---------12:19----------
i have to do


---------12:21----------
but i want him to i want to kind of be


---------12:23----------
um


---------12:24----------
like you know


---------12:26----------
i want him to understand and


---------12:29----------
i want him to manage his time


---------12:32----------
i don't want i the thing i want


---------12:35----------
um for him is like he understand that he


---------12:38----------
needs to manage his time and


---------12:41----------
i don't want to be on top of him always


---------12:45----------
okay kind of like policing him no yeah


---------12:47----------
sure


---------12:48----------
so how do you get your child to manage


---------12:51----------
their own time how does that happen


---------12:56----------
well


---------12:58----------
so since i mean since he was a kid i i


---------13:02----------
like kind of


---------13:04----------
give him like a time for doing his you


---------13:06----------
know things like for example if he wants


---------13:09----------
something i said okay you have to do


---------13:11----------
this between this and this time and then


---------13:13----------
you will get that so it was okay until


---------13:18----------
sometimes you know um back and forth


---------13:21----------
back and forth you know um


---------13:23----------
fighting not not fighting like you know


---------13:25----------
arguing


---------13:27----------
and you know uh since you know he turns


---------13:30----------
to the teenage


---------13:32----------
and it gets a little bit conflict


---------13:36----------
yeah so can you help me understand like


---------13:39----------
like almost what a conversation looks


---------13:41----------
like like what what'll you say first


---------13:44----------
when will you say it what will you say


---------13:45----------
next and then how do things kind of end


---------13:47----------
up in a fight


---------13:50----------
well i i tried to send i tried to say it


---------13:53----------
very nicely and then ask him


---------13:55----------
so what would you say several times


---------13:58----------
please do for example do your homework


---------14:01----------
and then you have this this time to do


---------14:03----------
it and then remind him sometimes and if


---------14:06----------
he


---------14:07----------
and


---------14:08----------
he doesn't do that then i i i started to


---------14:11----------
um i mean do like you know taking his


---------14:14----------
phone


---------14:15----------
or um or


---------14:18----------
other like computers or whatever you


---------14:19----------
know xbox he he plays


---------14:22----------
so yeah so let me let's kind of tunnel


---------14:24----------
into that and by the way leila you're


---------14:26----------
are you feeling okay with the


---------14:27----------
conversation do you feel okay kind of


---------14:28----------
continuing yeah


---------14:31----------
okay this is really helpful for me and


---------14:33----------
and i really hope will uh because i


---------14:35----------
think what you're describing is


---------14:36----------
something a lot of parents struggle with


---------14:37----------
a lot of kids struggle with right yep so


---------14:39----------
i'm kind of curious when you say please


---------14:41----------
do your homework what do you understand


---------14:47----------
uh


---------14:48----------
when you say please do something so if i


---------14:50----------
lay like i were to say like hey layla


---------14:52----------
please give me a call tomorrow i mean is


---------14:55----------
that something that you think is sort of


---------14:56----------
like a request or an order or a favor or


---------14:59----------
what does that mean


---------15:01----------
this is kind of request


---------15:04----------
it's a request right so like yeah


---------15:06----------
requests can be denied right


---------15:11----------
uh


---------15:12----------
it depends


---------15:15----------
so when it depends who requests that


---------15:18----------
so if it's i mean it depends


---------15:22----------
yeah so like when you say please it's


---------15:24----------
between parents if it between parents


---------15:26----------
and kids of course it's going to be most


---------15:28----------
of the time denied


---------15:31----------
okay so so like but what i'm kind of


---------15:33----------
saying is when you when you ask your son


---------15:35----------
to do something


---------15:36----------
i'm curious like in your mind does he


---------15:39----------
have to do it or he's allowed to refuse


---------15:43----------
no he has to do it


---------15:45----------
okay and so what i'm hearing is that


---------15:47----------
you're giving him an order


---------15:49----------
but you're phrasing it like a request


---------15:55----------
well it's it's both


---------15:58----------
but it's still it's it's order yeah he


---------16:00----------
needs to do that but i i


---------16:03----------
i i don't want to like do it you ha i


---------16:05----------
mean like saying the way that's the way


---------16:07----------
that say we we say it's it's


---------16:10----------
it's different


---------16:12----------
yeah so


---------16:13----------
yeah and laila i think this could be


---------16:15----------
part of the problem right because what


---------16:17----------
i'm hearing is that


---------16:18----------
you say something and you don't want to


---------16:20----------
order him


---------16:22----------
but you're kind of ordering him


---------16:26----------
so you think it shouldn't be


---------16:28----------
which way should it be it should be


---------16:30----------
request or it should be order or both or


---------16:33----------
what do you think


---------16:35----------
i think


---------16:36----------
whatever it is should be consistent


---------16:39----------
right so if in your mind it's an order


---------16:42----------
it should be clearly communicated as an


---------16:44----------
order and if in your mind is a request


---------16:46----------
it should be clearly communicated as a


---------16:48----------
request


---------16:50----------
because here's the thing so like if if


---------16:52----------
my so i used to be addicted to video

and my mom told me the same thing that


---------16:57----------
that you did


---------16:59----------
yeah right and so she would say please


---------17:01----------

---------17:08----------
does that does that make sense to you


---------17:10----------
yeah yes yes totally yes


---------17:13----------

---------17:14----------
hour later and she would be like she

more because that's really


---------17:48----------
useful to hear layla thank you so much


---------17:49----------
for clarifying that so like let's say


---------17:51----------
like what when is this conversation


---------17:53----------

---------18:06----------

---------18:14----------
conversation


---------18:16----------
i do


---------18:17----------
okay and what do you say awesome you're


---------18:19----------

---------18:21----------
we're gonna get to the bottom of this


---------18:22----------
okay uh i said you need to do your


---------18:25----------
homework


---------18:27----------
okay before this time for example before


---------18:29----------
10.


---------18:30----------
fantastic you need to do homework before


---------18:32----------
10.


---------18:33----------
yep and how does he respond


---------18:36----------
well


---------18:37----------
it


---------18:38----------
he he doesn't do right away but he


---------18:41----------
doesn't okay and are you okay with that


---------18:45----------
yes as long as he does it


---------18:49----------
so


---------18:49----------
so what does that communication look


---------18:51----------
like so you say hey you need to do your


---------18:52----------
homework before 10. yeah


---------18:54----------
one that that that works my my problem


---------18:57----------
is it's uh


---------18:59----------
about um


---------19:01----------
his screen time honestly


---------19:04----------
okay so now i'm gonna even though i


---------19:07----------
don't i don't care that i'm not let's


---------19:10----------
not say that


---------19:11----------
i don't care actually he does his his


---------19:14----------
homework and he's you know school but


---------19:16----------
still


---------19:17----------
he is on his phone a lot


---------19:20----------
so


---------19:21----------
yeah i want him to


---------19:25----------
minimize that


---------19:26----------
okay i'm i'm with you 100 but let's try


---------19:29----------
to look at that from kind of hit like


---------19:31----------
let's not steer away from the homework


---------19:33----------
yet is it okay if i just kind of


---------19:35----------
because i want to get that kind of


---------19:36----------
pinned down because i want to understand


---------19:38----------
your interaction there so you come in at


---------19:40----------
7 8 you say you have to do your homework


---------19:41----------
before 10. when does he end up doing do


---------19:43----------
you when does he end up doing his


---------19:44----------
homework


---------19:45----------
he's always like you know in the last


---------19:47----------
minutes sure so like he starts at nine


---------19:49----------
maybe yeah okay so he starts at nine and


---------19:52----------
he finishes it by ten so you've given


---------19:54----------
him an order


---------19:55----------
and he come like do you do you talk to


---------19:57----------
him at all between seven and nine or


---------19:59----------
like you're kind of like you know he's


---------20:00----------
gonna do it


---------20:02----------
uh a couple of reminder but i know that


---------20:06----------
he he he does it


---------20:08----------
so a couple of reminders help me


---------20:09----------
understand what a reminder actually


---------20:11----------
sounds like


---------20:13----------
like did you finish did you do it


---------20:16----------
something what does he say


---------20:18----------
he said i'll do it


---------20:20----------
he says i'll do it okay so you remind


---------20:22----------
him like maybe at like 8 30 let's say


---------20:24----------
uh yeah kind of


---------20:26----------
okay and he says i'll do it and then he


---------20:28----------
ends up doing it and then


---------20:30----------
do you


---------20:31----------
is there any discussion afterward like


---------20:32----------
what happens at 10 pm do you guys talk


---------20:34----------
about it


---------20:36----------
well just checking with him did you do


---------20:38----------
it and then check it and then if he


---------20:41----------
did it


---------20:42----------
so then he's all set


---------20:44----------
okay but the other thing


---------20:46----------
he does it because he he wants to get to


---------20:48----------
to the screen he wants to get under the


---------20:50----------
screen and then play for late time and


---------20:53----------
then go to bed late so


---------20:56----------
mostly that yeah we'll get to that in a


---------20:58----------
second so when he does his homework and


---------21:00----------
you check it and he does it what he what


---------21:02----------
do you do you say anything after that


---------21:06----------
like


---------21:07----------
like what


---------21:08----------
like good job


---------21:10----------
of course


---------21:13----------
i know it's kind of a weird question but


---------21:14----------
are you sure you say that no no no it's


---------21:16----------
no it's not weird but i i i i didn't


---------21:19----------
know what what do you mean exactly by


---------21:21----------
sure asking that yes


---------21:24----------
okay and how does he respond to that


---------21:27----------
well you know 14 years old doesn't


---------21:29----------
respond you know if you say good job


---------21:32----------
thank you they are like yeah


---------21:34----------
yeah right he doesn't he doesn't really


---------21:35----------
know how to respond to that no do you


---------21:37----------
get


---------21:38----------
do you get the sense like how do you


---------21:40----------
feel when he's done his homework well i


---------21:43----------
although he doesn't say anything but i


---------21:45----------
feel like he's he's also happy to do


---------21:48----------
that on time i mean by that time and


---------21:51----------
then he's free he i i can feel it that


---------21:53----------
he feels that he's free to go


---------21:56----------
okay so he's happy that he's done with


---------21:59----------
his chores yeah and that he has followed


---------22:02----------
your orders so he's happy to be free


---------22:05----------
of the homework and even arguably he's


---------22:08----------
on his own time and then he can do


---------22:10----------
like


---------22:12----------
being on his phone or being on xbox or


---------22:14----------
you know playing games


---------22:16----------
so layla when he does his homework by 10


---------22:18----------
pm how do you feel emotionally


---------22:22----------
well of course i i feel


---------22:25----------
i feel good


---------22:27----------
are you sure about that he did it


---------22:29----------
yeah are you sure you feel good that he


---------22:31----------
does his homework


---------22:34----------
yes


---------22:37----------
are there any other feelings there


---------22:41----------
um


---------22:43----------
i


---------22:44----------
honestly i don't know what do you mean


---------22:45----------
by that yeah


---------22:47----------
i know it's really confusing right so


---------22:49----------
this is going to be like so i'm going to


---------22:51----------
toss something i'm not i'm and you let


---------22:52----------
me know right if this makes sense to you


---------22:54----------
or not


---------22:55----------
but what i'm sort of hearing is that


---------22:57----------
like you can't really be upset that he


---------23:00----------
did his homework but in the back of your


---------23:02----------
mind you're not really like happy


---------23:04----------
because the only reason he's doing his


---------23:06----------
homework is to get to the screen time


---------23:09----------
right and like what i'm almost hearing


---------23:11----------
from you is that you're almost like even


---------23:13----------
though he did what he was supposed to do


---------23:15----------
he's not like doing it for the right


---------23:16----------
reasons and you can't really be happy


---------23:20----------
if he's just complying with your orders


---------23:22----------
because he's not understanding he's not


---------23:24----------
doing it for the right reason he's just


---------23:26----------
complying with your orders to get you


---------23:27----------
off of his back so that he can like go


---------23:29----------
back to the addiction and how can any


---------23:31----------
parent be happy when they're you know


---------23:33----------
the kid is just sitting there like


---------23:35----------
waiting


---------23:36----------
okay mom are we done yet can i get back


---------23:38----------
to it can i get back to it now okay


---------23:40----------
great like how can a mom truly be happy


---------23:42----------
in that situation


---------23:45----------
that's true


---------23:46----------
what what do you think is that because


---------23:49----------
because it's interesting because you


---------23:50----------
you're even doing this thing where i'll


---------23:51----------
ask you about the homework and then you


---------23:53----------
kind of like will change the topic and


---------23:55----------
you'll be like i just don't want him to


---------23:56----------
use the screen


---------24:00----------
do you understand does that make sense


---------24:02----------
yes yes yes so are you actually like


---------24:04----------
satisfied like i know that he did what


---------24:06----------
he was supposed to do so technically you


---------24:08----------
can't be like upset with him


---------24:10----------
but i wouldn't be surprised at all if


---------24:13----------
there was a part of you that was like


---------24:14----------
still uneasy about the way that you had


---------24:17----------
to force him to do it and that you can't


---------24:20----------
really be happy about the way things


---------24:21----------
ended up


---------24:24----------
yeah that's true


---------24:26----------
yeah one what yeah one part one part yes


---------24:30----------
it's you know it's right and the other


---------24:31----------
part still he's getting on on on the


---------24:34----------
screen which is which i don't like it


---------24:36----------
that's true yeah


---------24:38----------
and and so


---------24:39----------
how


---------24:40----------
so when you dislike his screen usage


---------24:44----------
does that


---------24:45----------
get communicated to him in any way


---------24:50----------
either in tone or even facial expression


---------24:53----------
or like through words


---------25:00----------
may i ask one more time i mean yeah tell


---------25:02----------
me your question please


---------25:04----------
yeah so like so what i'm hearing is that


---------25:06----------
you're kind of happy that he did his


---------25:08----------
work right yeah yeah but then you're


---------25:10----------
also kind of like unhappy that he's like


---------25:12----------
missing the bigger point


---------25:14----------
which is that the only reason he's doing


---------25:16----------
the work is to like feed his addiction


---------25:19----------
and so you're kind of unhappy with that


---------25:22----------
right


---------25:23----------
yes


---------25:24----------
and so you know when people communicate


---------25:26----------
with each other sometimes the emotions


---------25:28----------
that we feel


---------25:30----------
will get communicated to the your son


---------25:33----------
for example so does that happiness get


---------25:35----------
commu does the unhappiness that you feel


---------25:39----------
get communicated to him in any way


---------25:42----------
yes because then after yeah after he


---------25:46----------
does his homework then i tell him hey


---------25:49----------
you ha you don't have much time


---------25:52----------
to


---------25:53----------
play a lot you have just this time to


---------25:55----------
get i mean you need to get off


---------25:58----------
uh you know early because you need to go


---------26:00----------
to bed


---------26:02----------
so


---------26:04----------
yeah he


---------26:05----------
most i mean not most of time but he


---------26:09----------
uh


---------26:10----------
he does it but sometimes i need you know


---------26:13----------
i end up to to pause


---------26:16----------
he's uh he's a screen


---------26:19----------
okay so sometimes he'll like listen to


---------26:21----------
that order as well sometimes yeah and


---------26:24----------
and other times you he doesn't listen to


---------26:27----------
the order yeah and i have yeah i have to


---------26:30----------
so you can your action yeah you're


---------26:32----------
forced into like setting a hard boundary


---------26:35----------
yes okay


---------26:36----------
and how does he how does he res how does


---------26:38----------
that communication happen and how does


---------26:40----------
he respond to that


---------26:43----------
well


---------26:45----------
he said okay okay okay but he it's not


---------26:48----------
like he really he he said he he doesn't


---------26:51----------
really mean that


---------26:53----------
of course and yeah


---------26:55----------
and then i have to get an action take an


---------26:57----------
action what is taking an action what is


---------26:59----------
that like paint me a picture if i was


---------27:01----------
like in your house


---------27:03----------
and what would i say


---------27:05----------
yeah i have to pause me


---------27:07----------
pause he's from from my phone i can


---------27:10----------
pause you know


---------27:12----------
and any devices that i have


---------27:15----------
on the internet so i can pause it


---------27:17----------
so you use your phone and you just like


---------27:19----------
pause the internet pause the yes not


---------27:22----------
pause the internet pause the device i


---------27:24----------
can pause the device so you can pause


---------27:26----------
his xbox his pc his phone from your


---------27:29----------
phone yeah


---------27:30----------
and do you tell him you're doing that or


---------27:34----------
before i do it yes i said you have for


---------27:36----------
example you have 10 minutes and if you


---------27:38----------
don't get off it's gonna i'm gonna pause


---------27:41----------
it


---------27:42----------
okay he gets very upset he gets where


---------27:44----------
sometimes he asks me can i have like two


---------27:46----------
more minutes to i mean


---------27:49----------
no i i but i do it


---------27:51----------
and when you say that that was great so


---------27:53----------
he says can i have two more minutes no i


---------27:55----------
said no and he gets really upset and


---------27:58----------
then sometimes i scream but i don't care


---------28:01----------
he screams or you scream


---------28:03----------
no he screams sometimes that yeah i need


---------28:06----------
to finish this and i said no and then he


---------28:09----------
get you know gets back to whatever go to


---------28:11----------
bed


---------28:12----------
so so he's he screams and says i need to


---------28:14----------
finish it and then do you yell back or


---------28:17----------
do you're just like sorry


---------28:19----------
no i just make him cry just be quiet go


---------28:21----------
to your bed tomorrow is another day


---------28:24----------
okay


---------28:25----------
yeah


---------28:26----------
and um


---------28:30----------
how do you


---------28:32----------
how do you understand that interaction


---------28:34----------
like help me understand how how do you


---------28:36----------
feel about that dynamic


---------28:41----------
about


---------28:42----------
i mean doing that with him sure


---------28:45----------
so he needs to understand i mean i feel


---------28:48----------
of course i feel bad that i feel bad for


---------28:50----------
him but he needs to understand that


---------28:53----------
this i mean the time managing he needs


---------28:55----------
to understand that sure that makes a lot


---------28:58----------
of sense to me so like you you wish it


---------29:00----------
was different


---------29:01----------
it's not that like you don't want to


---------29:03----------
upset your son but at the end of the day


---------29:05----------
like


---------29:06----------
as his parent it is like your


---------29:07----------
responsibility to


---------29:09----------
help him understand the things that he


---------29:11----------
needs to understand right yeah so if


---------29:13----------
sometimes if that means a little bit of


---------29:15----------
tough love like that's okay


---------29:17----------
like it's a necessary evil


---------29:19----------
is that fair to say


---------29:21----------
yeah


---------29:22----------
yeah so let's talk about this for a


---------29:23----------
second layla um i i don't blame you at


---------29:26----------
all by the way are you feeling okay like


---------29:27----------
do you feel like i'm i'm trying to like


---------29:29----------
make you sound bad or making you


---------29:31----------
painting you out to be a bad parent or


---------29:32----------
anything like that


---------29:34----------
no but i would like to hear more about


---------29:36----------
and how we can help kids absolutely so


---------29:41----------
we're just getting there yeah so i think


---------29:43----------
the first thing is to kind of map out


---------29:45----------
what your interactions are like


---------29:47----------
and then try to look at so let me give


---------29:50----------
you a little bit of road map so we want


---------29:51----------
to map out like what the individual


---------29:53----------
interactions are like


---------29:54----------
and once we understand what your


---------29:56----------
interactions are like we can start to


---------29:58----------
understand


---------29:59----------
how people


---------30:00----------
feel


---------30:02----------
after those interactions


---------30:04----------
and then we can start to change our


---------30:06----------
interactions to try to move in a


---------30:08----------
different direction does that make sense


---------30:12----------
yeah okay so you say he needs to


---------30:15----------
understand right layla


---------30:17----------
yes how do people understand things


---------30:20----------
what is the process through which we


---------30:22----------
gain gain understanding


---------30:25----------
well by by telling them


---------30:29----------
by telling them so like by telling them


---------30:32----------
and by you know making rules for


---------30:34----------
them


---------30:36----------
uh


---------30:38----------
so explain to them


---------30:41----------
okay explain making rules so let's kind


---------30:43----------
of think about that okay


---------30:45----------
so


---------30:46----------
if i want to learn mathematics


---------30:48----------
how do i learn mathematics


---------30:53----------
so by um


---------31:00----------
doing your homework doing class four


---------31:03----------
follow your teacher and


---------31:06----------
that's how you learn


---------31:08----------
and if i'm not understanding in


---------31:10----------
mathematics what is the way so let's say


---------31:13----------
like i'm a math teacher and i have a


---------31:15----------
student and i give a lecture for like an


---------31:17----------
hour and then i give the homework and


---------31:19----------
then the kid can't do the homework what


---------31:21----------
should i do next as the teacher


---------31:23----------
so i


---------31:25----------
ask


---------31:27----------
why he doesn't understand or she doesn't


---------31:29----------
understand which way i mean what party


---------31:32----------
does he or she doesn't understand


---------31:34----------
explain it more


---------31:36----------
okay so do you ask your son


---------31:40----------
why he spent so much time on the screen


---------31:44----------
yes i did and he said that uh


---------31:47----------
there is nothing to do nothing else to


---------31:49----------
do except that


---------31:52----------
okay


---------31:52----------
and then what do you think about that


---------31:56----------
so it's it's not right


---------31:59----------
and i asked him some and i asked him i i


---------32:02----------
i i put him for a basketball class


---------32:04----------
tennis class


---------32:06----------
all the sports club most of the sports


---------32:08----------
classes and he he does it he liked it


---------32:12----------
but at the end still he wants to be on


---------32:14----------
his phone


---------32:16----------
okay so i'm a little bit confused


---------32:18----------
because he says there's nothing to do


---------32:21----------
and then you say like that for example


---------32:23----------
yeah yeah that's not right i said yeah


---------32:25----------
you you can do chores at home like


---------32:29----------
cleaning your room cleaning house


---------32:32----------
you know


---------32:33----------
out is i mean playing with your friends


---------32:35----------
outside doing exercising stuff like that


---------32:39----------
but he's not motivated for that


---------32:43----------
okay why isn't he motivated for that


---------32:47----------
why why


---------32:48----------
why isn't he motivated to do the things


---------32:50----------
that you tell him to do


---------32:52----------
well because he thinks yeah he enjoys a


---------32:54----------
lot on his phone


---------32:56----------
because


---------32:57----------
how do you come to that conclusion


---------33:02----------
uh like


---------33:06----------
what do you mean by that how do i


---------33:08----------
how do you know why what you so you have


---------33:11----------
an assumption


---------33:13----------
that he is not motivated to do things


---------33:15----------
like basketball even though he enjoys


---------33:17----------
them


---------33:18----------
right


---------33:19----------
but like so it sounds like when i ask


---------33:22----------
you


---------33:23----------
why he's like to explain his motivation


---------33:26----------
it sounds to me like you're making an


---------33:28----------
assumption about his motivation


---------33:31----------
which is that he just likes the phone


---------33:33----------
more


---------33:36----------
no because i i see again i see him that


---------33:39----------
as soon as he finished that until you


---------33:42----------
know he's with basketball whatever what


---------33:44----------
is whatever sports yeah as soon as he


---------33:46----------
finishes he wants to get to his phone


---------33:49----------
i see him he wants to get it


---------33:52----------
okay so now layla i'll i'll give you


---------33:54----------
kind of like uh some


---------33:57----------
information okay so you let me know what


---------33:59----------
you think about that so just like a math


---------34:01----------
you know if a math student


---------34:03----------
is not learning math i think the right


---------34:05----------
way to get them to understand is as a


---------34:08----------
teacher don't just teach it again


---------34:10----------
just like you said you have to ask them


---------34:13----------
like what part is confusing for them


---------34:15----------
right


---------34:16----------
so oddly enough like the right move for


---------34:18----------
a teacher in that situation is not to


---------34:20----------
tell the student that they're wrong


---------34:23----------
not to explain it again but to try to


---------34:25----------
understand the student's understanding


---------34:28----------
does that make sense


---------34:30----------
yes


---------34:31----------
and so oddly enough what i'm kind of


---------34:33----------
hearing is that you'll ask hey why do


---------34:35----------
you like the game but then


---------34:37----------
as soon as he gives you an answer what


---------34:39----------
i'm noticing you're doing is like you


---------34:41----------
just kind of say that's wrong


---------34:44----------
and you're not really like understanding


---------34:47----------
his perspective


---------34:48----------
you're just saying that his perspective


---------34:50----------
is incorrect


---------34:55----------
does that make sense


---------34:58----------
so


---------34:58----------
let me ask you a question do you mean


---------35:01----------
that when he wants to get back to his


---------35:03----------
phone


---------35:04----------
i feel like it's wrong right yep


---------35:09----------
so


---------35:11----------
it is kind of wrong because he wants to


---------35:14----------
get his phone right i mean for i mean


---------35:17----------
sure 24 7. so


---------35:20----------
if i don't


---------35:21----------
yeah if i don't make him to do something


---------35:23----------
except you know being on his phone then


---------35:25----------
of course


---------35:26----------
so yeah i know i need to tell him that


---------35:30----------
being on on the phone it's not it's not


---------35:32----------
right


---------35:33----------
okay so let's see i don't think it means


---------35:34----------
that all of us i mean i i i as a as an


---------35:37----------
adult i'm on my phone


---------35:39----------
also sometimes


---------35:41----------
not 24 students but i also


---------35:45----------
i don't i don't say that he shouldn't be


---------35:47----------
on his phone


---------35:49----------
no i this is not my point my point is he


---------35:52----------
can be on his phone he can you know go


---------35:54----------
to


---------35:55----------
a play xbox he can be on a snapchat tick


---------35:58----------
tock whatever but like


---------36:00----------
i mean certain time


---------36:02----------
not all yes this is my opinion that's it


---------36:05----------
yeah so let me i'm going to just toss


---------36:07----------
out words and i'm going to kind of group


---------36:09----------
them okay


---------36:10----------
so


---------36:11----------
what you're describing is like you kind


---------36:13----------
of telling him that this is wrong i'm


---------36:15----------
not saying you're wrong for saying that


---------36:16----------
by the way okay


---------36:18----------
so it's wrong you can order him you can


---------36:21----------
make him


---------36:22----------
that's like one camp right like there


---------36:24----------
were right and wrong it's black and


---------36:26----------
white you have to do it that's like one


---------36:29----------
approach the other approach involves


---------36:31----------
motivation understanding


---------36:34----------
asking questions


---------36:36----------
do you see how like those two are like


---------36:38----------
different things yes


---------36:41----------
so what what i'm kind of noticing is


---------36:43----------
that like you can force him to do stuff


---------36:45----------
and he'll do it because you have more


---------36:47----------
power in the relationship


---------36:49----------
but forcing him to do things is not how


---------36:52----------
you make someone understand right like i


---------36:54----------
mean you're a parent yeah that's true


---------36:56----------
right so and this is where like when you


---------36:59----------
ask him a question i don't really get


---------37:01----------
the sense that you're


---------37:02----------
i think you need to ask the next


---------37:04----------
question right so like help me


---------37:05----------
understand like here's a question that i


---------37:07----------
would ask your son


---------37:08----------
so


---------37:09----------
it's been my observation that when you


---------37:11----------
actually go to basketball you seem to


---------37:13----------
enjoy it and i'll even ask you like hey


---------37:15----------
did you have a good time


---------37:18----------
and that you know you do want to do well


---------37:20----------
in school so like these things seem


---------37:22----------
important to you and you seem to enjoy


---------37:24----------
them


---------37:24----------
but every time when i try to get you to


---------37:27----------
do something you resist me a lot


---------37:29----------
can you help me understand why you


---------37:31----------
resist me so much like i'm kind of


---------37:34----------
confused because these two things don't


---------37:35----------
line up for me


---------37:38----------
what do you think about that question


---------37:42----------
so i do i do it i do the same


---------37:46----------
and what does he say


---------37:47----------
good job


---------37:49----------
yeah i do it but he


---------37:51----------
he


---------37:52----------
he doesn't answer like you know


---------37:55----------
he doesn't have any answer he's like i


---------37:57----------
enjoy it for example if i ask okay


---------37:59----------
you have a good time in a basketball or


---------38:03----------
whatever


---------38:04----------
and i see you you enjoy it and then you


---------38:07----------
want it also you want it you like it but


---------38:10----------
then you as soon as you get home i see


---------38:12----------
you on the phone always


---------38:14----------
and he said mom i i play and i enjoy now


---------38:18----------
i wanted to spend time with my friends


---------38:20----------
that's that's all he says


---------38:23----------
okay


---------38:24----------
so that doesn't what you're saying


---------38:26----------
doesn't really sound like a question to


---------38:28----------
me


---------38:31----------
right it sounds to me like you're making


---------38:32----------
a point


---------38:36----------
i know it's kind of weird


---------38:38----------
but like you're kind of


---------38:40----------
i'm almost getting like


---------38:42----------
the subtitles


---------38:44----------
for what you're saying is you shouldn't


---------38:45----------
be on your phone


---------38:49----------
oh you mean instead of asking


---------38:52----------
telling him you shouldn't just i mean i


---------38:56----------
think what i'm hearing is that sometimes


---------38:58----------
you'll you remember earlier when we were


---------38:59----------
talking about like making requests


---------39:01----------
versus giving orders


---------39:03----------
yeah what i'm hearing is that when you


---------39:05----------
ask a question it's not really a


---------39:07----------
question you're making a point with a


---------39:09----------
question mark at the end


---------39:11----------
what do you think about that well i i i


---------39:15----------
didn't think you know that it's like


---------39:16----------
that i thought this is like a kind of


---------39:18----------
question


---------39:20----------
yeah so so i understand


---------39:22----------
just pointing to yeah yeah i mean that's


---------39:24----------
sort of what i'm hearing and i'm


---------39:26----------
concerned that that's what he could be


---------39:27----------
hearing too


---------39:29----------
because what i'm hearing is sometimes


---------39:31----------
he'll give you answers


---------39:33----------
and your response to his answers or his


---------39:35----------
opinions


---------39:37----------
is that's wrong


---------39:40----------
yeah


---------39:40----------
okay and so i'm just gonna like kind of


---------39:43----------
i'll say it right so if you're like if


---------39:45----------
you're in a relationship where you share


---------39:47----------
an opinion with someone


---------39:49----------
and their response is that's wrong


---------39:52----------
i'm not gonna want to continue to


---------39:54----------
communicate with that person


---------39:59----------
right my answers are just going to


---------40:00----------
become simple


---------40:02----------
there's no like dialogue


---------40:06----------
what do you think about that


---------40:09----------
yeah


---------40:10----------
i get it


---------40:12----------
right so i'm not trying to make you feel


---------40:14----------
like a bad parent i i genuinely don't


---------40:16----------
think you're a bad parent i think what's


---------40:18----------
happening nowadays is that


---------40:20----------
video conversation can makes a lot of


---------40:22----------
difference yeah yep and video game


---------40:25----------
addiction


---------40:26----------
requires a sophistication of


---------40:29----------
communication


---------40:31----------
by parents


---------40:32----------
that we didn't need anymore


---------40:35----------
need in the past because there is so


---------40:37----------
much dopamine there's so much addictive


---------40:39----------
stuff like that's the way these apps are


---------40:40----------
designed that's the way the games are


---------40:42----------
designed and so as a parent we have to


---------40:45----------
be we have to have a sophistication of


---------40:47----------
our communication that counters the


---------40:49----------
addictiveness of devices


---------40:52----------
yeah


---------40:53----------
does that make sense


---------40:55----------
yes


---------40:57----------
so you know what i would say like if you


---------40:58----------
want some concrete advice because i get


---------41:00----------
the sense you want that for me so we'll


---------41:02----------
let's give you some it's to ask the next


---------41:05----------
question


---------41:06----------
right so and this is the kind of thing


---------41:08----------
where if you don't understand if you


---------41:10----------
disagree with something or you think


---------41:12----------
that something is wrong


---------41:14----------
it's okay for you to share that opinion


---------41:16----------
but i would try to understand his


---------41:18----------
perspective just like a math teacher


---------41:20----------
right so if like if i'm trying to teach


---------41:21----------
someone an addition and they say two


---------41:23----------
plus two is six and i say that's wrong


---------41:26----------
two plus two is four and i can say that


---------41:28----------
15 times but until i ask the student how


---------41:31----------
are you getting two plus two equals six


---------41:34----------
does that make sense like you have to


---------41:36----------
understand like how they're getting to


---------41:37----------
the wrong conclusion in the first place


---------41:39----------
because that's really when you can help


---------41:41----------
them understand how two plus two equals


---------41:42----------
four


---------41:46----------
yeah so you know when i think you're


---------41:49----------
doing a lot of the right stuff right


---------41:50----------
you're asking him like why is it that


---------41:52----------
you don't you know you seem to like


---------41:53----------
basketball but you want to do snapchat


---------41:55----------
and then he says well i just like being


---------41:57----------
with my friends


---------41:59----------
right so and that could be a big part of


---------42:00----------
it so this is where one of the things


---------42:02----------
that we've also noticed is that when we


---------42:04----------
work with parents


---------42:06----------
we help them try to


---------42:08----------
ask lots of questions that they may not


---------42:10----------
think about asking for with their kids


---------42:12----------
so for example like maybe he gets


---------42:14----------
bullied at basketball


---------42:16----------
do you know if that's the case


---------42:19----------
no


---------42:20----------
i isn't you know that he doesn't get


---------42:22----------
bullied or you're not sure yeah yeah i


---------42:24----------
know that yeah because i i talk to him a


---------42:26----------
lot


---------42:27----------
and he tells me everything


---------42:29----------
the good things about my son is he tells


---------42:32----------
me everything


---------42:33----------
that's very good if he gets upset i mean


---------42:37----------
he even if he doesn't talk


---------42:39----------
i can i can and notice from his face and


---------42:42----------
his attitude and after i said there is


---------42:45----------
there anything you want to share with me


---------42:47----------
here start talking which is great wow


---------42:50----------
that's awesome how did you get to the


---------42:52----------
point where your son shares everything


---------42:54----------
with you well because since since the


---------42:57----------
beginning i talked to him a lot and i


---------42:59----------
was involved um


---------43:02----------
everything with him


---------43:03----------
and


---------43:05----------
i i just talked to him a lot and i was


---------43:07----------
very friend and i never i mean never


---------43:10----------
punished him like you know really you


---------43:12----------
know punished just i want him to be


---------43:14----------
friend with me not scared of me


---------43:16----------
so


---------43:17----------
we have this good relationship at least


---------43:20----------
he tells me everything which is great


---------43:23----------
yeah i mean i i think that it's clear


---------43:26----------
that you guys have a very good and


---------43:27----------
loving relationship


---------43:29----------
and at the same time


---------43:31----------
it also sounds like sometimes you know


---------43:34----------
you're turning off pausing his devices


---------43:36----------
and kind of pissing him off


---------43:39----------
and so i wonder a little bit about


---------43:41----------
how that would affect his communication


---------43:44----------
with you


---------43:45----------
well


---------43:47----------
i mean the good thing about my son is he


---------43:49----------
gets mad easily but


---------43:51----------
in a second he turns back to his


---------43:54----------
you know normal


---------43:55----------
which is great yeah so he's really mad


---------43:58----------
at me and you know right after he just


---------44:01----------
you know become quiet he's i mean very


---------44:04----------
easily and then he


---------44:05----------
he continued


---------44:07----------
which is good yeah


---------44:08----------
so so it sounds like he doesn't hold on


---------44:11----------
to the anger and he doesn't start to


---------44:12----------
resent you and that you guys have a very


---------44:14----------
solid foundation of communication


---------44:16----------
yeah so this is what i'd say layla i


---------44:18----------
think like this is where you know what i


---------44:20----------
would really do is is sit down with your


---------44:22----------
son


---------44:23----------
and ask him


---------44:24----------
[Music]


---------44:25----------
questions like i don't know maybe you've


---------44:27----------
done this do you want me to force you to


---------44:29----------
do your homework


---------44:30----------
have you ever asked him that


---------44:33----------
no i haven't


---------44:36----------
what do you think would happen if you


---------44:38----------
did ask him that


---------44:41----------
well


---------44:42----------
i never think about it


---------44:44----------
yeah right so so like it's kind of a


---------44:46----------
different question right like what do


---------44:48----------
you think about that question


---------44:57----------
so


---------44:57----------
what was your call you said what what do


---------44:59----------
i think he thinks


---------45:01----------
no what do you what do you think about


---------45:03----------
the question do you want me to force you


---------45:05----------
to do your homework how would you how do


---------45:07----------
you feel about that question is that


---------45:08----------
like you think it's a good i mean this


---------45:10----------
is this is a good question this is great


---------45:12----------
but the thing is


---------45:14----------
uh


---------45:16----------
i don't know what it what he's gonna


---------45:18----------
answer


---------45:19----------
that's the thing yep


---------45:21----------
does he have any answer for that


---------45:23----------
yeah so so so the here's the thing laila


---------45:26----------
the questions you need to be asking your


---------45:28----------
son are the ones that you don't know how


---------45:30----------
he's going to answer


---------45:32----------
that's exactly what you should be asking


---------45:34----------
him right because there's a fundamental


---------45:36----------
disconnect


---------45:38----------
between


---------45:41----------
his view of things and your view of


---------45:43----------
things yes


---------45:44----------
and in order to get on the same page


---------45:46----------
with your kid you can try to drag him


---------45:49----------
over to your side as much as you want to


---------45:51----------
which is what i think you've been doing


---------45:53----------
that's what most parents do right


---------45:55----------
but like i think this is the point where


---------45:56----------
he's not 12 anymore he's not 10 he's 14.


---------45:59----------
he's starting to form his own opinions


---------46:01----------
he's starting to have his own beliefs


---------46:04----------
yes right


---------46:05----------
and so it's really good that you guys


---------46:06----------
have this really solid foundation and so


---------46:08----------
i think really like asking him questions


---------46:10----------
that you kind of don't know the answer


---------46:11----------
to


---------46:12----------
because you're you're a mother who knows


---------46:14----------
everything about your son you can tell


---------46:15----------
right


---------46:16----------
yeah so now this is the point where he's


---------46:18----------
going to start to be a little bit more


---------46:20----------
closed off because he's a 14 year old


---------46:21----------
boy


---------46:22----------
right he's like probably going through


---------46:24----------
puberty and stuff so i'm sure


---------46:26----------
you know they're going to be like maybe


---------46:27----------
thoughts or feelings that he has that


---------46:28----------
maybe he's not sharing with his mom


---------46:30----------
because that's what 14 year old boys do


---------46:32----------
when they go through puberty you


---------46:33----------
wouldn't be there


---------46:35----------
yes and so like this is the time where


---------46:37----------
it's


---------46:38----------
time to start changing the way that you


---------46:40----------
communicate with him yes and really


---------46:43----------
trying to understand his perspective


---------46:47----------
so


---------46:48----------
other things other like suggestions for


---------46:50----------
conversations are just asking him you


---------46:52----------
know how important is school to you


---------46:55----------
do you want to do well in school


---------46:59----------
yeah what do you think about those


---------47:00----------
questions


---------47:06----------
that's great yeah


---------47:08----------
right so do you know did you talk to him


---------47:10----------
about that


---------47:12----------
yes i did yes and he's he said what do


---------47:15----------
you think mom of course it is


---------47:18----------
yeah he said of course it is it is


---------47:21----------
important


---------47:22----------
and then what do you say next


---------47:24----------
you know you know these kids what type


---------47:26----------
of words they do i'm not dumb i'm not


---------47:28----------
stupid or stuff like that they use


---------47:32----------
but you really don't know what's going


---------47:34----------
on in their brain that's the thing


---------47:36----------
so when he says of course it's important


---------47:38----------
what what do you say next


---------47:42----------
i said okay if it's important then


---------47:45----------
how come that


---------47:47----------
you don't do this that you know no no


---------47:50----------
see that's an accusation layla you're


---------47:52----------
losing him right at that moment you see


---------47:53----------
that


---------47:57----------
if it's important why don't you


---------47:59----------
why don't you


---------48:01----------
that you're losing him right there


---------48:03----------
does that make sense


---------48:05----------
yes so instead i have to i have to say


---------48:07----------
oh then you should do this no no no no


---------48:09----------
no no no no no no here's the thing okay


---------48:12----------
here's the one thing you got to do later


---------48:13----------
you're doing fantastic just got to


---------48:15----------
change one thing


---------48:16----------
you shouldn't say anything after that


---------48:18----------
you should ask another question


---------48:21----------
okay


---------48:22----------
right because he says of course it's


---------48:23----------
important


---------48:25----------
and then this is going to be kind of


---------48:26----------
weird right and then you ask him help me


---------48:28----------
understand why


---------48:30----------
why is school important to you


---------48:36----------
right because here's the thing in his


---------48:38----------
mind there is a conflict


---------48:41----------
school is important and i want to play


---------48:43----------
the video game


---------48:45----------
and so this is what happens with


---------48:46----------
teenagers is the more you push him the


---------48:49----------
more he's going to push back


---------48:50----------
and this is the thing right because like


---------48:52----------
you you ask him like hey is school


---------48:53----------
important to you he says yes and then


---------48:55----------
you're like yay we win right


---------48:57----------
leila he understands what he's supposed


---------48:59----------
to understand he's giving you the right


---------49:01----------
answer


---------49:02----------
and so then your mind you're like


---------49:04----------
everyone charge let's attack then why


---------49:06----------
don't you do this like let's go like


---------49:08----------
change like you just gave me like you


---------49:11----------
gave me an inch of ground so i'm gonna


---------49:14----------
go all in you kind of get what i'm


---------49:16----------
saying why don't you then you're like


---------49:17----------
why don't you do this why don't you do


---------49:18----------
this and when you ask the question like


---------49:20----------
when i why like for example we're gonna


---------49:22----------
try this okay leila so it's gonna maybe


---------49:24----------
just be ready for it


---------49:26----------
if i ask you with a question layla why


---------49:28----------
don't you ask why don't you try to


---------49:30----------
understand your son better


---------49:32----------
if i ask you that question how does it


---------49:33----------
make you feel


---------49:37----------
yeah


---------49:40----------
yeah i got it yeah you're right ah let's


---------49:43----------
articulate it right because we can't see


---------49:44----------
your face right now i'm sure if we could


---------49:46----------
see your face we'd be able to see what


---------49:48----------
your answer is how does that make you


---------49:50----------
feel


---------49:54----------
of course you know it's like kind of um


---------49:58----------
forcing


---------49:59----------
yeah


---------50:01----------
right and so in a weird way like does


---------50:03----------
that inspire you to act do you feel like


---------50:05----------
i'm on your team


---------50:07----------
do you feel like we're on the same team


---------50:08----------
here


---------50:10----------
no


---------50:14----------
right and so


---------50:15----------
and this is the tricky thing about this


---------50:17----------
layla is like you're not wrong at all in


---------50:19----------
fact you're 100 right


---------50:22----------
and this is like where the


---------50:23----------
sophistication of communication comes in


---------50:25----------
because you're right that like you know


---------50:27----------
spending like four hours a day on


---------50:29----------
snapchat is like not good for your kid


---------50:31----------
you know it's not good for your kid he


---------50:33----------
knows it's it's not good for him


---------50:36----------
he understand like you don't think your


---------50:38----------
kid understands that playing video games


---------50:40----------
for 10 hours a day on the weekend is


---------50:41----------
like a waste of his time


---------50:47----------
yeah he gets that right yeah yes yeah on


---------50:50----------
some level he gets it


---------50:52----------
yes and and the problem is like he's


---------50:55----------
addicted


---------50:57----------
so like he even like sometimes it he may


---------51:00----------
not be addicted i'm kind of using that


---------51:02----------
simply but even like people who are


---------51:03----------
addicted like the whole point is that


---------51:05----------
they can't stop


---------51:07----------
they like they know it's bad but they


---------51:09----------
can't stop


---------51:10----------
like your son understands that like you


---------51:13----------
know he understands how like


---------51:14----------
relationships and dating and stuff works


---------51:16----------
he understands that if he spends 10


---------51:17----------
hours a day on the weekends like on his


---------51:19----------
phone instead of playing basketball and


---------51:21----------
exercising like it's gonna be hard for


---------51:23----------
him to like date


---------51:24----------
like he's not an idiot


---------51:27----------
you with me


---------51:28----------
yes


---------51:30----------
and the problem though is that something


---------51:32----------
is going on that has him retreating or


---------51:35----------
escaping to the to the device


---------51:37----------
and even to the point where he sort of


---------51:39----------
recognizes and i think this is part of


---------51:41----------
the reason that


---------51:42----------
you all have such a good relationship


---------51:43----------
because a lot of things that you do to


---------51:45----------
him like would piss a lot of kids off


---------51:47----------
right and he gets pissed off but he


---------51:48----------
doesn't hold on to it


---------51:50----------
why doesn't he hold on to it because he


---------51:52----------
recognizes on some level that first of


---------51:54----------
all you love him and secondly like what


---------51:56----------
you're doing what you're forcing him to


---------51:57----------
do is actually for his benefit and i


---------51:59----------
suspect he understands that what do you


---------52:01----------
think


---------52:04----------
no he understand that yeah right so i


---------52:07----------
think that's why y'all's relationship is


---------52:08----------
as good as it is and i think really all


---------52:11----------
you need to do is


---------52:13----------
start at like ask like one or two more


---------52:15----------
questions


---------52:17----------
you know because here's the cool thing


---------52:18----------
like i i i


---------52:20----------
is it okay if i keep talking or you want


---------52:22----------
to jump in or


---------52:24----------
yes yeah okay yeah so like here's like


---------52:26----------
so here's sequence number one you know


---------52:28----------
help me understand like why do you play


---------52:30----------
video games i thought you liked


---------52:31----------
basketball and he's like yeah or let's


---------52:33----------
let's talk about great so you say you


---------52:34----------
know is school important he says yes and


---------52:36----------
then like option one is like then why


---------52:38----------
don't you dot dot dot right and then he


---------52:41----------
feels kind of attacked he's like he kind


---------52:43----------
of feels ashamed because you're right


---------52:44----------
right like you're clearly making a good


---------52:46----------
point like you can't really argue


---------52:48----------
against it and so he kind of shuts down


---------52:50----------
and gives you a very short response


---------52:53----------
fair am i


---------52:55----------
okay so let's like look at option number


---------52:56----------
two right which is like okay this school


---------52:58----------
important to you says yes


---------53:00----------
and then you can say help me understand


---------53:02----------
why school is important to you what


---------53:04----------
about school is important to you and as


---------53:06----------
you get him to articulate he says well


---------53:08----------
school is important to me because like


---------53:10----------
you know i want to go to a good college


---------53:12----------
and then it's like another question like


---------53:14----------
why is going to a good college important


---------53:16----------
to you like why do you want to go to


---------53:18----------
college


---------53:19----------
as you get him to articulate and bring


---------53:21----------
out of him


---------53:23----------
yeah you know what he really cares about


---------53:25----------
and what he values in life


---------53:28----------
then you're setting yourself up and then


---------53:30----------
you kind of like the next you know the


---------53:31----------
third or fourth or fifth question that


---------53:32----------
you ask him is like


---------53:34----------
so i'm a little bit confused because you


---------53:37----------
tell me that you want to go to college


---------53:39----------
because you want to be intellectually


---------53:41----------
challenged and that you want to make a


---------53:43----------
difference in the world


---------53:45----------
and i'm kind of confused because like on


---------53:47----------
a day-to-day basis


---------53:50----------
your actions are not really like aligned


---------53:52----------
with that


---------53:54----------
so as a parent i don't know


---------53:57----------
what to do


---------53:59----------
i don't know because on the one hand i


---------54:01----------
want to support you in all of these


---------54:03----------
goals which i think are the right goals


---------54:08----------
but every time and even i mean i know


---------54:10----------
you right and we're talking about this


---------54:12----------
so i'd like to support you in these


---------54:14----------
things i'd like to help you get into a


---------54:15----------
good college


---------54:17----------
but when i try to do that like you seem


---------54:19----------
to fight me and then i get stuck


---------54:24----------
what do you think i should do about that


---------54:27----------
and that's when he'll start to


---------54:28----------
understand


---------54:30----------
right because you're sort of explaining


---------54:32----------
your


---------54:33----------
situation to him you're not telling him


---------54:35----------
what's right or wrong


---------54:37----------
you're almost


---------54:38----------
recruiting him to be on your side and


---------54:41----------
you're working with him you're like hey


---------54:43----------
son this is a problem you and i have to


---------54:45----------
solve together


---------54:48----------
does that make sense


---------54:50----------
yes


---------54:51----------
right and and i think that's when


---------54:53----------
understanding is going to come


---------54:58----------
yes yes i that yeah i i understand


---------55:03----------
you are right


---------55:04----------
okay so let's just think about that for


---------55:07----------
a second


---------55:08----------
if you agree with me


---------55:10----------
how did you unders did you understand


---------55:12----------
that at the beginning of the


---------55:13----------
conversation


---------55:17----------
yes


---------55:19----------
okay


---------55:20----------
i was a little bit confused by that


---------55:22----------
because i was expecting you to say no so


---------55:24----------
i feel like you've learned something


---------55:26----------
over the course of our conversation am i


---------55:28----------
wrong


---------55:29----------
you you said the the beginning of the


---------55:31----------
conversation you mean the


---------55:33----------
you mean this conversation or the


---------55:35----------
beginning of our meeting our beginning


---------55:38----------
of our meeting yeah


---------55:40----------
so like


---------55:41----------
let's just so you've learned something


---------55:43----------
over the course of our meeting right


---------55:46----------
how did you learn what have you learned


---------55:48----------
let's start there


---------55:50----------
so i


---------55:51----------
well i learned that um


---------55:55----------
how


---------55:57----------
uh to communicate better with my son


---------55:59----------
instead of you know because my actually


---------56:02----------
my


---------56:03----------
conversation was


---------56:05----------
different then you just told me


---------56:09----------
i have to start with question and then


---------56:11----------
keep continue until he


---------56:14----------
he tells me instead of i tell him and i


---------56:16----------
force him he starts to tell me


---------56:19----------
and i get the words from here him


---------56:22----------
more than i talk to him or i mean more


---------56:26----------
than i thought and i taught


---------56:28----------
beautifully put layla i think that is


---------56:30----------
the essence of the goal that we set for


---------56:33----------
our parents


---------56:35----------
yeah which is instead of teaching your


---------56:37----------
kid


---------56:38----------
yes


---------56:39----------
bring him to a point of understanding


---------56:41----------
because as long as you're teaching him


---------56:43----------
he's on one side and you're on the


---------56:45----------
opposite side yeah not in in stop


---------56:47----------
lecturing


---------56:49----------
listening more i got it yeah so now


---------56:51----------
let's ask you a question


---------56:53----------
how did you learn that today


---------56:57----------
oh i i i learned honestly i learned


---------57:01----------
especially this you know that at the end


---------57:03----------
i learned a lot


---------57:04----------
but how what did we do well you know i


---------57:07----------
mean the thing is i mean


---------57:11----------
uh our


---------57:13----------
generation was way different than these


---------57:16----------
new generations so of course


---------57:18----------
and the way that we grew it wasn't like


---------57:21----------
that and then basically we use kind of


---------57:23----------
our


---------57:24----------
um


---------57:27----------
our parents


---------57:29----------
manner


---------57:30----------
and then use it for our kids


---------57:32----------
absolutely


---------57:33----------
yeah and that's why we need more


---------57:36----------
uh


---------57:38----------
more help and more um so


---------57:42----------
sorry to interrupt i wouldn't say what


---------57:43----------
you're doing is wrong


---------57:45----------
no no no i mean i i didn't i don't mean


---------57:47----------
it's wrong like you know


---------57:49----------
just the way


---------57:50----------
different ways


---------57:52----------
yeah i i cause i i think i would just


---------57:56----------
that that degree of judgment


---------57:58----------
laila concerns me a little bit because i


---------58:01----------
don't think what you're doing is wrong


---------58:03----------
i think it's insufficient


---------58:05----------
for the current challenges that you're


---------58:08----------
of the world


---------58:10----------
i agree yes


---------58:11----------
you know


---------58:12----------
and so maybe i explained yeah you


---------58:14----------
explained a bit and maybe mine was a


---------58:16----------
little bit confusing yes no no i i


---------58:18----------
that too i think it's like this is the


---------58:20----------
point of communication right is we just


---------58:21----------
make sure we're kind of on the same page


---------58:24----------
and


---------58:25----------
and so the other point that i was kind


---------58:26----------
of making is that like you know over the


---------58:28----------
course of this conversation


---------58:31----------
[Music]


---------58:32----------
most of what i've been doing is like


---------58:34----------
asking questions


---------58:35----------
yes


---------58:36----------
right and i think that's like to


---------58:38----------
illustrate the point of like that's


---------58:39----------
where understanding comes from yeah yeah


---------58:43----------
and and it's kind of giving you stuff to


---------58:45----------
play with is what i


---------58:47----------
call it right like i'm not saying like


---------58:48----------
so for example when i gave you two


---------58:50----------
options and i like okay here's


---------58:51----------
communication style one hey do you think


---------58:53----------
school is important yes then why don't


---------58:55----------
you do it here's communication style


---------58:56----------
number two


---------58:57----------
um you know


---------58:59----------
do you think school is important yes


---------59:00----------
tell me why it's important to you and


---------59:02----------
keep on asking questions and then i


---------59:04----------
don't tell you which one is right


---------59:06----------
right i'm not saying one is good and one


---------59:08----------
is bad i'm saying hey here are two


---------59:09----------
options which one do you like more


---------59:12----------
and that's what in my experience that's


---------59:14----------
what brings out the understanding is


---------59:16----------
that it comes from a place that like it


---------59:18----------
sounds like your son and you have a


---------59:19----------
really solid relationship it sounds like


---------59:22----------
you'll have a really solid foundation it


---------59:23----------
sounds like he's a smart kid


---------59:25----------
and so i think interestingly enough like


---------59:27----------
now that he's 14


---------59:30----------
instead of teaching him stuff you can


---------59:32----------
actually rely on him to like figure


---------59:34----------
things out for himself


---------59:36----------
yeah just guide him


---------59:38----------
absolutely like give him the questions


---------59:40----------
not the answers


---------59:42----------
because i think he he'll i mean he knows


---------59:44----------
the answers you baked that into him you


---------59:45----------
know he understands and that's why he


---------59:47----------
doesn't fight you he doesn't hold on to


---------59:48----------
resentment because deep down he knows


---------59:50----------
you're right


---------59:52----------
and and helping him so you don't


---------59:54----------
actually need to teach him anything he


---------59:56----------
already understands it you just need to


---------59:58----------
bring his understanding to the surface


---------60:00----------
and sometimes the way that we


---------60:02----------
communicate with our kids


---------60:04----------
results in like denial or defensiveness


---------60:08----------
and when you say something that causes


---------60:09----------
him to kind of like


---------60:11----------
pull back and put up a wall like then


---------60:13----------
there's not going to be understanding


---------60:14----------
does that make sense


---------60:16----------
yes you're going to get these like


---------60:18----------
because i want to mom like he's going to


---------60:20----------
get you these really crappy


---------60:22----------
short answers that are like hard to


---------60:24----------
engage in right he's like kind of


---------60:25----------
shutting down the conversation


---------60:29----------
yeah


---------60:30----------
that's true


---------60:32----------
so um


---------60:34----------
i feel like we've covered some decent


---------60:35----------
ground today and that we're at like kind


---------60:37----------
of decent kind of pausing point or even


---------60:39----------
stopping point


---------60:41----------
how do you feel


---------60:44----------
well it was great for me it was very


---------60:47----------
good conversation and i learned a lot


---------60:49----------
from from that


---------60:51----------
are are there any questions that you


---------60:54----------
have remaining i mean we still have some


---------60:56----------
time if you want it but like any


---------60:57----------
questions that you have or any other way


---------60:59----------
that i can potentially be of help well i


---------61:02----------
i want to know uh about this is this


---------61:05----------
course can be continuing or is just one


---------61:08----------
one time


---------61:09----------
oh no no so yeah so let me tell you a


---------61:11----------
little bit about our parent program so


---------61:12----------
here's what we try to do


---------61:14----------
we have a 12-week course okay so every


---------61:17----------
week there's like a lecture


---------61:19----------
and the the topics of the lecture are


---------61:22----------
first of all communication and alliance


---------61:24----------
building so our approach is first and


---------61:26----------
foremost how to communicate effectively


---------61:28----------
with your child and more importantly how


---------61:30----------
to build what we call an alliance so


---------61:33----------
i'll just give you an example like once


---------61:35----------
you talk to your kid


---------61:36----------
about why school is important to them


---------61:39----------
then any kind of limit that you set


---------61:42----------
is not because you think it's good


---------61:44----------
the reason you're setting these limits


---------61:46----------
are because of what they care about


---------61:49----------
hey you've told me that you want to go


---------61:50----------
to a good college because you want to


---------61:52----------
study


---------61:54----------
you want to be a doctor one day


---------61:56----------
so


---------61:57----------
it's because i support your goal that i


---------61:59----------
have to turn off the internet at 10


---------62:01----------
o'clock


---------62:03----------
it's not about what i want it's actually


---------62:05----------
about what you want and then what


---------62:06----------
happens is kids or once you build an


---------62:08----------
alliance with your kid


---------62:11----------
the


---------62:12----------
they're going to be a lot less resistant


---------62:14----------
to the boundaries that you set so the


---------62:15----------
first thing is communication


---------62:17----------
understanding and getting on the same


---------62:18----------
team with your kid it's not even about


---------62:20----------
restricting to two hours a day or ten


---------62:22----------
hours a day or five hours a day or


---------62:24----------
anything like that that's where everyone


---------62:25----------
wants to start is like how do i get my


---------62:27----------
kids to play less video games we don't


---------62:29----------
start there we start by communication


---------62:31----------
and alliance building


---------62:32----------
then what we do is we teach you how to


---------62:34----------
set good boundaries


---------62:35----------
so like


---------62:36----------
it kind of goes into like you know once


---------62:38----------
we understand communication then how do


---------62:40----------
you set an effective boundary and that's


---------62:42----------
where we also like want to bring your


---------62:44----------
kid into the boundary setting so you can


---------62:46----------
say hey uh son here are my goals for you


---------62:49----------
i want you to exercise you know what


---------62:51----------
you've said is important to you


---------62:53----------
um i want you to do chores and you say


---------62:55----------
you don't want to so like maybe there's


---------62:57----------
some wiggle room there and you say you


---------62:59----------
want to do well on school but you also


---------63:01----------
say that because if you talk to your kid


---------63:02----------
you'll also discover things like maybe


---------63:04----------
they are getting bullied at school or


---------63:06----------
maybe they feel embarrassed about their


---------63:08----------
acne or maybe they're overweight or


---------63:10----------
whatever and that's the reason that he


---------63:11----------
spends so much time online with his


---------63:13----------
friends because it's hard for him to


---------63:14----------
make friends in real life


---------63:16----------
so there may be all kinds of stuff going


---------63:17----------
on it sounds like your son communicates


---------63:19----------
with you so maybe less important in your


---------63:20----------
case but for a lot of parents there are


---------63:22----------
things that they don't know about their


---------63:24----------
kids so once you understand what drives


---------63:27----------
him towards the video game


---------63:29----------
it can help you set healthy boundaries


---------63:32----------
right because now you understand like


---------63:33----------
why he's resisting why he's fighting


---------63:36----------
and so then we try to help people set


---------63:39----------
you know very kind of like detailed


---------63:41----------
boundary setting plans so like you know


---------63:43----------
when are you going to play what are you


---------63:44----------
going to play what's more important to


---------63:46----------
you so that's like a question that we


---------63:48----------
encourage our parents to ask a lot you


---------63:50----------
know i understand that you want to play


---------63:52----------
games with your friends like is it more


---------63:53----------
important to like stay up late on friday


---------63:55----------
nights or play an hour with them or two


---------63:58----------
hours with them every day like which one


---------64:00----------
is more important to you


---------64:01----------
and so once you sort of start to get


---------64:03----------
like what they care about you can even


---------64:06----------
like so then they kind of know that


---------64:07----------
you're like sort of trying to support


---------64:09----------
them right you understand what they want


---------64:11----------
and you're setting limits but you're not


---------64:13----------
setting limits that you you know


---------64:14----------
he has to do his homework but whether he


---------64:17----------
does his homework


---------64:19----------
an hour every day or all over the


---------64:21----------
weekend like he can sort of decide that


---------64:23----------
if that makes sense


---------64:25----------
yes so you want you want to enroll him


---------64:27----------
make him a part of the process of the


---------64:29----------
limit setting


---------64:31----------
you know it's kind of like no taxation


---------64:32----------
without representation like you want to


---------64:34----------
give him a voice


---------64:36----------
in the limit setting in the boundaries


---------64:38----------
yeah


---------64:39----------
and then we'll we'll sort of help you


---------64:41----------
set boundaries and we'll help you


---------64:42----------
troubleshoot boundaries because at the


---------64:44----------
end of the day like they're thing you


---------64:45----------
know you can set these boundaries and


---------64:47----------
he's not going to listen to him and then


---------64:49----------
how do you have conversations with him


---------64:51----------
how do you set limits on him how do you


---------64:53----------
draw the line how do you enforce things


---------64:55----------
and then also we'll give you like


---------64:56----------
communication tips and sort of like you


---------64:58----------
know how to have those conversations


---------65:01----------
the other big thing that we do in the


---------65:03----------
program is we help decompress your


---------65:05----------
emotions this is a huge thing


---------65:07----------
so you know these little things like


---------65:09----------
because in the back of your mind if you


---------65:11----------
just you know layla what i get the sense


---------65:12----------
of is that you just don't like him being


---------65:14----------
on his phone you just don't like it


---------65:17----------
and that kind of feeling is gonna


---------65:21----------
translate in your words and in your tone


---------65:24----------
and so even when he does everything that


---------65:25----------
you ask him to you're not gonna be happy


---------65:28----------
and he's gonna feel that


---------65:30----------
which means that when he does what you


---------65:32----------
ask him to


---------65:33----------
it there's not really like a positive


---------65:35----------
emotional reinforcement because you're


---------65:37----------
not truly happy


---------65:39----------
does that make sense


---------65:40----------
yes so you're gonna say good job but


---------65:42----------
you're gonna say it with a little bit of


---------65:44----------
like


---------65:45----------
it's not gonna be like hey awesome job


---------65:47----------
it's gonna be like good job


---------65:50----------
i know you did it today but i'm not


---------65:52----------
really happy on the inside good job does


---------65:54----------
that make sense


---------65:55----------
yes yes so we want we don't want those


---------65:58----------
emotions to to come out with


---------66:02----------
with your kid we want you to bring those


---------66:04----------
emotions into our program and let them


---------66:06----------
come out with the other parents


---------66:08----------
work on that like work on your fear for


---------66:11----------
your child we haven't really talked


---------66:12----------
about this but a lot of parents will be


---------66:14----------
like afraid right like what happens when


---------66:16----------
my kid goes to college and i'm not there


---------66:18----------
to force him what's gonna happen and all


---------66:21----------
of that fear that you hold all of that


---------66:23----------
frustration that you hold we want you to


---------66:25----------
process it with us


---------66:27----------
so that when you are talking with your


---------66:29----------
kid when you're interacting with your


---------66:30----------
kid you can be calm you can be collected


---------66:33----------
you can be focused and disciplined


---------66:35----------
because he's going to feed off of your


---------66:37----------
energy


---------66:39----------
and so it's a 12-week program where


---------66:40----------
there's lectures but then we also have


---------66:42----------
you all meet for 90 minutes a week in


---------66:44----------
addition lecture you can watch on your


---------66:46----------
time it's like a video


---------66:48----------
and we're gonna teach you a lot of stuff


---------66:49----------
so we'll also teach you about like


---------66:50----------
marijuana usage and autism spectrum


---------66:52----------
disorder and like how to understand like


---------66:55----------
what questions to ask your kids and what


---------66:57----------
kind of games your kids like and there's


---------66:58----------
a lot like information about video game


---------67:00----------
addiction how video games affect your


---------67:02----------
child's brain how they affect their


---------67:04----------
psychology how they affect their


---------67:06----------
self-esteem


---------67:07----------
um you know how to have conversations


---------67:09----------
around self-esteem and your kid feeling


---------67:11----------
like they're a failure or whatever


---------67:12----------
there's a bunch of stuff in there and


---------67:14----------
then for 90 minutes a week we're going


---------67:16----------
to give you guys opportunities to


---------67:17----------
practice so you're going to have a coach


---------67:19----------
and you all will do things like role


---------67:20----------
play you're going to practice you know


---------67:23----------
not using the word should why don't you


---------67:25----------
do this then you should do this we're


---------67:28----------
going to give you like literally like a


---------67:30----------
chance to practice those communication


---------67:32----------
skills


---------67:32----------
and support each other as parents and


---------67:34----------
what we really see is that at the end of


---------67:36----------
12 weeks


---------67:38----------
parents who are able to actually commit


---------67:39----------
to the program their relationship is


---------67:41----------
very different with their kids


---------67:46----------
okay it sounds great and then how okay


---------67:49----------
is it something um


---------67:52----------
how much we should pay for is it


---------67:54----------
something we have to pay for it or it's


---------67:56----------
yeah i actually don't know the price but


---------67:58----------
it is something that you have to pay for


---------68:00----------
um if you guys you know if you're in a


---------68:02----------
position of financial hardship just kind


---------68:04----------
of let us know


---------68:05----------
sometimes we have subsidy funds for


---------68:07----------
people who can't afford afford it yeah


---------68:10----------
um let me actually try to figure out


---------68:12----------
what the price is


---------68:13----------
i think it may be like oh i don't want


---------68:15----------
to misquote


---------68:16----------
let me see if i can ask it should say


---------68:23----------
yeah so the cost is fifty dollars a week


---------68:26----------
fifty dollars


---------68:28----------
yep


---------68:30----------
a week and then uh


---------68:32----------
how about the other the one that you


---------68:34----------
said there is someone i mean i mean how


---------68:36----------
about the 90 minutes


---------68:38----------
you said once a week 90 minutes what's


---------68:40----------
that


---------68:41----------
that's all part of the course so what we


---------68:43----------
do in our courses there's a there's


---------68:44----------
going to be a lecture that you watch


---------68:47----------
and then there's 90 minutes of like


---------68:49----------
group work


---------68:50----------
it's going to be role play skills


---------68:52----------
practice processing your own emotions


---------68:54----------
talking to other parents


---------68:56----------
troubleshooting communication issues


---------68:58----------
troubleshooting boundary issues


---------69:01----------
and like you got to do both


---------69:05----------
yeah and then and then uh is it uh that


---------69:08----------
one also covered by this or yeah yeah


---------69:10----------
it's all included


---------69:11----------
so our experience has been that set like


---------69:14----------
letting people just watch a series of


---------69:15----------
lectures is not actually like that


---------69:18----------
effective what's really effective


---------69:20----------
because you have an individual case with


---------69:21----------
your child right


---------69:23----------
so like you can watch a lecture but


---------69:25----------
adapting the principles of the lecture


---------69:27----------
to your individual case requires like


---------69:30----------
actual individual support so we have a


---------69:33----------
group that every you know there'll be


---------69:35----------
like somewhere between like six and


---------69:36----------
eighty all usually


---------69:38----------
so like we're gonna get like like let's


---------69:40----------
say seven parents together once a week


---------69:42----------
for 90 minutes where you guys will learn


---------69:45----------
the practical application of the theory


---------69:47----------
that you learn in the lectures okay any


---------69:49----------
questions that you guys have any trouble


---------69:51----------
that you run into we want to support you


---------69:53----------
through all that because like you know


---------69:55----------
in the lecture i may say like you know


---------69:57----------
ask this question but then if if your


---------69:59----------
kid's answer is like something that's


---------70:01----------
unexpected then like


---------70:03----------
what do you do about that


---------70:05----------
right you may not know so that's why we


---------70:06----------
have the group every week so you can


---------70:08----------
come in and you can talk to your coach


---------70:09----------
and you can say hey i asked my kid do


---------70:11----------
you care about school and he said no


---------70:14----------
now i don't know what to say i don't


---------70:15----------
know what to do


---------70:17----------
you know and so like we want to help you


---------70:19----------
troubleshoot your individual situation


---------70:21----------
and practice these skills


---------70:23----------
okay and also do they uh kid also


---------70:27----------
involve at some point or


---------70:29----------
no cheating involved no so so most of


---------70:31----------
our clients actually laila are your kids


---------70:34----------
so we've had like


---------70:35----------
7 000 kids come through our program but


---------70:38----------
their program is different


---------70:40----------
mm-hmm


---------70:42----------
for them


---------70:43----------
uh so like we work on things like


---------70:45----------
motivation


---------70:46----------
you know figuring out what you want to


---------70:47----------
do with your life things like that but


---------70:50----------
you have to be at least 16 to enter that


---------70:51----------
program


---------70:52----------
because kids have to want to change


---------70:55----------
so


---------70:56----------
okay and that's where we like you know


---------70:57----------
most of what we try to help because like


---------70:59----------
here's the thing you know your kid


---------71:01----------
wants to do well in life right but like


---------71:04----------
he may be addicted so even internally


---------71:07----------
he's like conflicted so we try to help


---------71:09----------
people work through their internal


---------71:11----------
conflict


---------71:12----------
yeah


---------71:14----------
great so okay


---------71:16----------
oh sorry we've had 10 000 people come


---------71:18----------
through


---------71:19----------
my wife is correcting me


---------71:23----------
and then


---------71:25----------
so sh


---------71:26----------
when i decided to do this course 12 week


---------71:29----------
course


---------71:30----------
how i can register or you know do i have


---------71:33----------
to is there anyone we'll send you so i


---------71:36----------
think you've been talking to someone in


---------71:37----------
our organization we will send you


---------71:39----------
information


---------71:40----------
okay


---------71:42----------
sounds good


---------71:43----------
yeah


---------71:44----------
any other questions


---------71:46----------
that's it thank you so much it was very


---------71:49----------
nice to meeting you and pleasure to talk


---------71:51----------
to you i


---------71:53----------
i learn a lot honestly and i'm sure if i


---------71:55----------
continue i


---------71:57----------
i do learn more


---------71:59----------
yeah so leila i just want to say thank


---------72:01----------
you so much for coming on i think the


---------72:03----------
situation that you're in


---------72:05----------
is very representative of what people


---------72:08----------
other parents in the program have


---------72:09----------
experienced which is that you're you're


---------72:11----------
a good parent


---------72:12----------
you have a good kid


---------72:14----------
video game addiction or technology use


---------72:16----------
or screen use has like really gotten out


---------72:18----------
of hand during the pandemic


---------72:20----------
and like the things that used to work


---------72:22----------
for parents just aren't enough anymore


---------72:26----------
and so


---------72:27----------
you know what we really try to do is


---------72:29----------
empower y'all to like navigate this


---------72:32----------
tricky world this digital world


---------72:35----------
with a little bit more kind of


---------72:36----------
communication support a little bit more


---------72:38----------
understanding and to really like get on


---------72:40----------
the same team with your kid


---------72:41----------
which often times is not about them


---------72:43----------
understanding it's just as often about


---------72:46----------
you understanding


---------72:49----------
so thank you so much


---------72:50----------
thank you


---------72:51----------
thank you i really appreciate your time


---------72:54----------
yeah thanks a lot take care layla


---------72:56----------
you too bye bye


---------72:59----------
all right chat what did y'all think


---------73:04----------
right


---------73:06----------
good huh so this is why we love like we


---------73:08----------
love working with parents like i love


---------73:09----------
working with parents


---------73:11----------
absolutely love it


---------73:14----------
right yeah i i wasn't expecting her to


---------73:17----------
ask all the stuff about the sales pitch


---------73:18----------
like i just you know i didn't even know


---------73:20----------
if she's gonna sign up for the pro i


---------73:22----------
as you guys could tell there was a


---------73:24----------
miscommunication about her kind of


---------73:25----------
coming on and what she was coming on for


---------73:27----------
i didn't know that she was even


---------73:28----------
interested in the program


---------73:30----------
but


---------73:31----------
i think like this it's it's a prime


---------73:33----------
example of like you know parents


---------73:35----------
want to do really well right


---------73:38----------
the the problem is that like


---------73:40----------
when they're emotionally like so scared


---------73:43----------
for their children


---------73:46----------
any time the kid gives them an inch the


---------73:48----------
parent goes all in right any it's like


---------73:50----------
it's like the kid is forming a dam and


---------73:52----------
if there's a crack in the damn like the


---------73:54----------
water's coming all the way out and so


---------73:56----------
the parents are going to use any crack


---------73:58----------
they can then why don't you do this


---------73:59----------
don't you see don't you see and i'm


---------74:01----------
really glad i hope layla doesn't feel


---------74:03----------
like you know a bad parent i think


---------74:04----------
sometimes when we point out things that


---------74:06----------
we believe are mistakes it can make


---------74:08----------
people feel kind of bad i think she's a


---------74:09----------
fantastic parent but this is the thing


---------74:11----------
that we've really discovered is that


---------74:13----------
like it's just changing your


---------74:14----------
communication


---------74:16----------
you can change it changes the


---------74:17----------
relationship entirely by understanding


---------74:20----------
like what to say and when to say it


---------74:22----------
and it's like because it sounds like


---------74:24----------
she's got a really good relationship


---------74:25----------
with her kid i don't know that he's


---------74:26----------
telling her everything by the way but


---------74:28----------
you know maybe


---------74:30----------
you know maybe that's me projecting


---------74:32----------
but you know


---------74:33----------
but i thought it was really fantastic


---------74:35----------
she was super open-minded


---------74:37----------
um really cares about her kid you know


---------74:39----------
has tried a lot of stuff we can really


---------74:40----------
hear that she kind of gets at her wits


---------74:43----------
end right and like ultimately like she


---------74:44----------
can't let her kid fail


---------74:46----------
like so she has to pull the plug and


---------74:48----------
that's not her fault


---------74:49----------
you know she's like she tries to do it


---------74:52----------
i do think there's a little bit more


---------74:54----------
about the request versus the order which


---------74:56----------
i think she's sometimes mixing up so i


---------74:58----------
think that's probably also creating


---------74:59----------
confusion with her kid because she'll


---------75:01----------
phrase things like a request but they're


---------75:03----------
actually in order and then there's like


---------75:06----------
not really transparent communication and


---------75:08----------
then that's gonna discourage the kid


---------75:09----------
from like participating because you mean


---------75:12----------
one thing and you're saying something


---------75:13----------
else


---------75:14----------
and so if that's the dynamic of your


---------75:15----------
communication your kid isn't gonna like


---------75:17----------
really


---------75:18----------
you know they're gonna say one thing and


---------75:20----------
they're gonna mean something else too


---------75:22----------
and that's just frustrating for everyone


---------75:23----------
involved because they're going to say


---------75:24----------
like yeah i'll do my chores but they


---------75:26----------
mean something else because the dynamic


---------75:27----------
of your communication is that we say one


---------75:29----------
thing we say what we're supposed to


---------75:31----------
but we really mean something else


---------75:34----------
we say what we're supposed to which is


---------75:35----------
oh please do your chores


---------75:37----------
please


---------75:38----------
but inside it's like better do your


---------75:40----------
chores


---------75:41----------
right so then your kid is going to play


---------75:42----------
the same damn game they're going to be


---------75:44----------
like oh yeah of course mom i'll do my


---------75:46----------
chores but inside i'm never going to do


---------75:47----------
my chores it's the same thing the kids


---------75:49----------
are going to learn whatever


---------75:50----------
communication style


---------75:52----------
you teach them


---------75:54----------
right


---------75:55----------
and so that's why when you start


---------75:56----------
expressing an interest in understanding


---------75:58----------
their viewpoint something magical


---------76:00----------
happens


---------76:01----------
they will start expressing an interest


---------76:03----------
in understanding yours


---------76:05----------
they take their cues from you


---------76:07----------
kids take their cues from parents that's


---------76:09----------
like


---------76:10----------
even mannerisms and stuff


---------76:12----------
like my grandmother does this thing


---------76:14----------
where she like has this really big sigh


---------76:16----------
every time she sits down she's like oh


---------76:19----------
and i even noticed like


---------76:21----------
early on my my older kid spent a lot of


---------76:24----------
time with my grandmother and she started


---------76:25----------
doing it too you'd have this like 18


---------76:27----------
month old that would be like ah


---------76:29----------
man


---------76:30----------
like what a day


---------76:32----------
right it was like an 18 month old kid


---------76:34----------
it's hilarious so they learn from you


---------76:36----------
they take their cue from you


---------76:38----------
it's great it's it's neat seeing like uh


---------76:41----------
an 18 year old with like grandmother


---------76:44----------
mannerisms


---------76:46----------
um yeah she doesn't do it anymore


---------76:49----------
unfortunately


---------76:52----------
okay


---------76:53----------
any questions from y'all


---------77:00----------
i just have a request from you it's only


---------77:02----------
undeniable yeah


---------77:10----------
okay this is great this is the maybe the


---------77:11----------
first time in in


---------77:13----------
in uh in our history that you guys don't


---------77:16----------
have questions which is fantastic


---------77:19----------
um


---------77:22----------

---------77:33----------

---------77:35----------
the birds and the bees one day


---------77:38----------
someone posted on our subreddit they're


---------77:39----------
like


---------77:40----------

---------77:42----------
think we may have to do that at some


---------77:44----------
point i actually like do a quick bit so


---------77:46----------
for my patients who are like teenagers


---------77:48----------
and young adults like i give them the


---------77:50----------
talk which is not like a


---------77:52----------
anyway it's like about birth control and


---------77:54----------
stuff like that and it it's pretty good


---------77:57----------
i mean sometimes people will be like wow


---------77:59----------
i'm so glad this may be like the most


---------78:01----------
useful you know hour we've ever spent


---------78:03----------
together so we we may try to put that


---------78:05----------
together for y'all


---------78:08----------
um


---------78:12----------
twitch sure


---------78:15----------
no i mean like but seriously like this


---------78:17----------
is important stuff right like so


---------78:19----------
so we'll we'll think about that we'll


---------78:21----------
see if it's it may be against tos so


---------78:23----------
maybe we can't do it i don't know


---------78:25----------
so we'll see


---------78:28----------
okay who are you rating chat


---------78:35----------
so what happens when when the kid says


---------78:37----------

okay like here are the problems with


---------78:50----------
school


---------78:52----------
um then


---------78:56----------
you know


---------78:59----------
that then like then you'll explore right


---------79:01----------
because that that's when you really


---------79:02----------
uncover the problems oh like the reason


---------79:04----------
i don't like school is because i'm


---------79:05----------
getting bullied and it's like then


---------79:07----------
you're like you know that's big


---------79:09----------
so you know if they say they don't like


---------79:11----------
school that's actually a really


---------79:13----------
important discovery on your part because


---------79:15----------
then like no wonder you're fighting an


---------79:17----------
uphill battle it like trying to get them


---------79:18----------
to go to school


---------79:21----------

---------79:44----------
sushi dragon


---------79:51----------
yeah what if the answer for why the kid


---------79:53----------

---------79:54----------
like boring that's a great so then you


---------79:56----------
can say what's boring about it what are


---------79:58----------

---------80:20----------
that stuff so like help me understand


---------80:22----------
what are you excited by help me


---------80:24----------
understand when school


---------80:25----------
stop when school became boring what


---------80:28----------
happened when school became boring and


---------80:29----------
oftentimes what you'll find is like


---------80:31----------
you'll uncover other things like oh it


---------80:33----------
turns out that your kid has adhd and so


---------80:35----------
the reason that school is boring is


---------80:36----------
because they literally can't pay


---------80:38----------
attention and it gets like


---------80:39----------
they don't they're just sitting there


---------80:41----------
and everything that they're being taught


---------80:43----------
is like


---------80:44----------
you know fl flying like right through


---------80:47----------
their brain and nothing sticks and so no


---------80:49----------
wonder school would be boring


---------80:52----------
so sometimes we also devalue that which


---------80:54----------
we fear we are not good at


---------80:57----------
so i did this when i was kind of


---------80:58----------
becoming a monk or trying to become a


---------81:00----------
monk where i was like i suck at life so


---------81:03----------
let me just say that life is not worth


---------81:05----------
you know is not worth it so i'm gonna


---------81:07----------
rise above all this materialistic crap


---------81:10----------
and i'm gonna be unattached from grades


---------81:12----------
and worldly success because that's for


---------81:14----------
people who are


---------81:15----------
spiritually


---------81:18----------
you know bereft of any kind of


---------81:20----------
spirituality they're so materialistic


---------81:22----------
and the reason that i get f's is because


---------81:25----------
i am better than them right so like you


---------81:27----------
devalue things that you're afraid you


---------81:29----------
suck at


---------81:31----------
and so that's


---------81:32----------
you know so like when kids say boring


---------81:34----------
like let's try to understand what's


---------81:36----------
really underneath that


---------81:39----------
right and sometimes they'll like you


---------81:40----------
know school will be boring so we see


---------81:42----------
that too where like the kids are not


---------81:44----------
challenged at school and so my solution


---------81:46----------
there is like okay try to find your kid


---------81:48----------
like an internship somewhere like what


---------81:49----------
do what is exciting to them maybe they


---------81:51----------
want to volunteer at like an animal


---------81:53----------
shelter or maybe they want to like go to


---------81:55----------
space camp or like you know you can do


---------81:57----------
other things as a parent to support them


---------81:59----------
you can say hey i want to help you what


---------82:01----------
can we do that would be less boring and


---------82:02----------
the cool thing is it's not really about


---------82:03----------
finding out the solution it's just that


---------82:06----------
once they understand as a child that you


---------82:08----------
as a parent are genuinely trying to help


---------82:10----------
them and following their lead about what


---------82:13----------
needs to change in their life that's


---------82:14----------
when we really see a really strong


---------82:16----------
alliance built and then even as a parent


---------82:18----------
like once they know you're in their


---------82:19----------
corner you can even say like hey even


---------82:22----------
though i know it's boring for you


---------82:24----------
i still think it's really important that


---------82:26----------
you do this and then the kid is like


---------82:27----------
okay fine it's bizarre like they just


---------82:29----------
won't fight you as much


---------82:32----------
okay i don't know what this what's going


---------82:33----------
on with sushi dragon


---------82:35----------
this sounds this seems weird


---------82:40----------
so


---------82:42----------
what is this


---------82:48----------
dizzy onion


---------82:54----------
by the way anyone playing lost ark


---------82:58----------
hey are you already waiting can i just


---------83:01----------
quit yeah hey so i saw some of you guys


---------83:04----------
in chat said that like you know you wish


---------83:06----------
that your parents could experience


---------83:08----------
something similar


---------83:10----------
so if you guys um want to help us get


---------83:12----------
the word out that would be really cool


---------83:15----------
because we've got 108 spots and we're


---------83:17----------
starting november 11th


---------83:19----------
um and our coaches are really excited so


---------83:21----------
we're hoping that we can get enough


---------83:23----------
parents


---------83:24----------
in the program um so anything you all


---------83:26----------
can do to help us get the word out that


---------83:27----------
would be awesome i think the command is


---------83:29----------
in discord here


---------83:31----------
what


---------83:33----------
sorry not discard in chat


---------83:35----------
oh


---------83:38----------
yeah so you know you guys can reverse


---------83:39----------
uno your parents so what often times


---------83:41----------
happens is our p we'll get phone calls


---------83:43----------
from parents and they're like can i sign


---------83:44----------
up my kid for coaching and we say no you


---------83:46----------
can't this kid has to want to sign up


---------83:48----------
for coaching and then the parents are


---------83:50----------
like screw you and then we're like maybe


---------83:52----------
you should sign up for coaching and


---------83:53----------
they're like screw you i'm not the one


---------83:55----------
with the problem my kid is the one with


---------83:56----------
the problem we're like no actually you


---------83:58----------
should sign up so you all can reverse


---------83:59----------
uno them


---------84:01----------
right and you can be like hey hey


---------84:02----------
parents i think you should sign up for


---------84:04----------
this thing


---------84:06----------
uh yeah so if you want to reverse enter


---------84:08----------
them awesome but also like you know


---------84:10----------
getting their whatsapp groups and stuff


---------84:12----------
like that that'd be really cool they're


---------84:13----------
facebook groups etc so the the other


---------84:16----------
thing that's really neat about this


---------84:17----------
sorry can i keep going yep i'm excited


---------84:20----------
okay good okay great the other thing


---------84:21----------
that's really cool about this is our


---------84:22----------
coaches love working with parents yeah


---------84:25----------
so we were surprised like we have like


---------84:27----------
other kinds of coaching opportunities


---------84:29----------
like content creation and things like


---------84:30----------
that but the coaches themselves are


---------84:33----------
super excited


---------84:34----------
with working with parents and the


---------84:36----------
coaches are like y'all they're from like


---------84:37----------
our community right


---------84:39----------
so i was a little bit surprised by how


---------84:41----------
eager they are to like help parents like


---------84:43----------
connect with their kids so it's actually


---------84:45----------
really like fantastic


---------84:48----------
um


---------84:50----------
how old do our kids have to be to


---------84:52----------
qualify for coaching for parent


---------84:55----------
oh so so parent coaching is sort of


---------84:57----------
divided in two ways


---------84:58----------
um


---------84:59----------
i think like if your kid is younger than


---------85:01----------
a teenager maybe you may get a little


---------85:03----------
bit less out of it but basically we try


---------85:06----------
to think about two groups so this is


---------85:08----------
what we call pre-insight and


---------85:09----------
post-insight basically does your kid


---------85:12----------
know they have a problem or not


---------85:14----------
more practically it's kind of like the


---------85:16----------
two camps are like under 18 like kids


---------85:18----------
that are living at home maybe a little


---------85:19----------
bit older and then over 18 is kind of


---------85:22----------
what those are the two groups and


---------85:23----------
generally speaking


---------85:24----------
the experiences and struggles and


---------85:26----------
challenges that parents face are quite


---------85:28----------
different so if you've got a 14 year old


---------85:30----------
like that's really different from having


---------85:32----------
a 24 year old you know


---------85:36----------
but i'd say like


---------85:37----------
you know under not like 10 because a big


---------85:40----------
part of this remember is like


---------85:41----------
communication


---------85:43----------
so if your kid is not old enough to be


---------85:46----------
able to like really like answer


---------85:47----------
questions or like internalize like


---------85:49----------
understand what's going on inside them


---------85:51----------
then it may not be as effective we


---------85:53----------
actually don't have great data on like


---------85:55----------
kids under 10 for example so i don't


---------85:57----------
know if it would actually help parents


---------85:58----------
in that situation


---------86:00----------
um it's really geared towards like


---------86:01----------
because remember this is a program that


---------86:03----------
was built off of our work with y'all


---------86:05----------
right so what we did is like ask


---------86:07----------
ourselves


---------86:09----------
now that we understand what being a


---------86:10----------
gamer is like


---------86:12----------
what how can we equip parents to deal


---------86:14----------
with us with twitch chat basically


---------86:18----------
okay so there seems to be some cool


---------86:20----------
music going on from chris taylor


---------86:24----------
to layer


---------86:25----------
so check that out


---------86:28----------
i'd like to learn how to better


---------86:29----------
communicate with my autistic son yeah so


---------86:31----------
then you can definitely


---------86:34----------
i don't know how old your son is but


---------86:36----------
we do have so this was a big part that


---------86:38----------
we added in this most recent launch


---------86:42----------
we added a section on neurodiversity


---------86:44----------
where we talk a little bit about autism


---------86:47----------
unfortunately it's been my experience


---------86:49----------
that you cannot


---------86:51----------
i guess you could but


---------86:53----------
autism is such a


---------86:55----------
varied presentation


---------86:57----------
that we can't have like a communication


---------87:00----------
guide for autism right because different


---------87:02----------
people on the autism spectrum their


---------87:04----------
communication abilities are going to be


---------87:05----------
like wildly different


---------87:07----------
so that's where


---------87:08----------
you know you can absolutely learn the


---------87:10----------
principles but then you need to adapt


---------87:12----------
those principles or filter them through


---------87:14----------
whatever limitations your your child


---------87:17----------
actually has so like some kids with


---------87:18----------
autism are non-verbal completely right


---------87:21----------
so


---------87:22----------
what we teach you is gonna like not


---------87:24----------
really work very well other kids will be


---------87:26----------
like hyper logical


---------87:28----------
and may need a lot of concrete stuff so


---------87:30----------
you can't really ask them like questions


---------87:32----------
about


---------87:34----------
you know it's going to be hard for them


---------87:35----------
to answer questions about internal


---------87:37----------
feelings and motivation and stuff like


---------87:38----------
that you have to really make things like


---------87:39----------
concrete


---------87:41----------
so there are a lot of like different


---------87:42----------
adaptations but the tricky thing is that


---------87:45----------
those tend to be very individualized


---------87:49----------
yeah so it's tough um we're working on


---------87:52----------
it


---------87:53----------
um but so we do have some information


---------87:55----------
but but the real answer and i hate to


---------87:57----------
say this but as much as i want to say


---------87:59----------
that our program can fix all problems i


---------88:02----------
hate to say this but my actual


---------88:03----------
recommendation to parents in the program


---------88:05----------
is they can learn some


---------88:07----------
but then it's really to take the


---------88:08----------
principles that we teach


---------88:10----------
and filter them through your your


---------88:13----------
child's actual communication


---------88:15----------
pattern


---------88:17----------
and sometimes that involves like


---------88:18----------
collaborating with a clinician ideally


---------88:26----------
um okay


---------88:29----------
oh yeah so some people are asking and


---------88:31----------
and i think dana mentioned that so


---------88:32----------
sometimes we'll have like both parents


---------88:34----------
show up


---------88:35----------
and uh i i told this story uh recently


---------88:38----------
but sometimes it's funny because like


---------88:40----------
this is hilarious so we were doing i was


---------88:43----------
running a group session with the parents


---------88:44----------
i was giving a lecture or something


---------88:46----------
and in the background right so the


---------88:48----------
parents like i'm like there's a laptop


---------88:50----------
and then there's a couch and both of the


---------88:51----------
parents are sitting on the couch


---------88:53----------
and so i'm giving this lecture and i can


---------88:55----------
see them you know on the zoom call and


---------88:57----------
then in the background i see like like a


---------88:59----------
teenage kid like a teenage boy like walk


---------89:01----------
by and the kid like does a double take


---------89:04----------
and then he like asks his parents and


---------89:05----------
he's like is that dr k


---------89:07----------
and then the parents are like do you


---------89:09----------
know who this is


---------89:10----------
and then the kid is like do you know who


---------89:12----------
this is


---------89:13----------
and then he like got freaked out and he


---------89:15----------
left and it's like hilarious


---------89:17----------
right


---------89:20----------
um


---------89:21----------
so


---------89:22----------
we we oftentimes get both parents


---------89:25----------
and that's totally fine


---------89:32----------
yeah so that's as a tour that's one of


---------89:34----------
my favorite stories about parent


---------89:35----------
coaching


---------89:36----------
but um yeah right that's how we know


---------89:39----------
we've made it it's like when the parents


---------89:40----------
have heard of us and the kids have heard


---------89:42----------
of us but that's really like our point


---------89:44----------
right it's like be a healthy gamer we're


---------89:45----------
not we're and that's


---------89:47----------
don't worry chat we've got your back


---------89:49----------
because i don't know if you guys caught


---------89:50----------
this but nowhere did i tell layla like


---------89:52----------
yeah he's gotta stop playing video games


---------89:54----------
you know nowhere did i say that we don't


---------89:56----------
and so sometimes parents are like


---------89:59----------
you know it's really about supporting


---------90:01----------
your kid in achieving their goals


---------90:03----------
and helping them form like healthy


---------90:05----------
gaming habits
