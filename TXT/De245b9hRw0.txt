---------00:00----------
thank you he's very sweet he uh


---------00:04----------
has some bad anxiety himself but he's


---------00:07----------
good


---------00:09----------
yeah i i recently heard that um that you


---------00:12----------
know people will give


---------00:14----------
uh dogs like anti-anxiety medication


---------00:17----------
yeah he could use some


---------00:18----------
i think um i've tried like cbd treats


---------00:21----------
for him but it just puts him to sleep so


---------00:25----------
yeah that does no good so he's fine he's


---------00:29----------
just a stress case


---------00:30----------
i i once tried to play a joke on my boss


---------00:33----------
when i was in training


---------00:34----------
that i wanted to do pet therapy


---------00:37----------
[Laughter]


---------00:38----------
and and so people think that pet therapy


---------00:40----------
is like when you have like a therapy


---------00:41----------
support animal right


---------00:44----------
and so like it's like you know i want to


---------00:46----------
you know work with animals to help


---------00:47----------
people with mental health


---------00:48----------
but then i tried to explain her no no i


---------00:50----------
don't want to i don't want to do pet


---------00:52----------
i don't want to do therapy with pet i


---------00:53----------
want to be a pet therapist


---------00:55----------
so i want to i want a dog so if we're


---------00:58----------
giving them medication


---------00:59----------
we should also do psychotherapy with


---------01:01----------
them and so have a dog come to my house


---------01:04----------
it could be it could be his stream


---------01:09----------
he's not happy about it yeah he seems a


---------01:13----------
little bit


---------01:13----------
anxious or something yeah


---------01:17----------
um so and and how do i refer to you


---------01:20----------
um you can call me blair blair okay


---------01:24----------
and um blair i'm all oak or people call


---------01:27----------
me dr k


---------01:28----------
you can call me either one okay um


---------01:31----------
and so tell me a little bit thank you


---------01:33----------
very much for coming on on stream


---------01:35----------
of course and tell tell me a little bit


---------01:38----------
about what we're talking about today


---------01:40----------
or if there's something um goodness


---------01:43----------
that is so hard yes um


---------01:46----------
no what yeah sorry yeah


---------01:49----------
um i uh i don't know


---------01:53----------
i don't know i i think i like talked in


---------01:56----------
the dms


---------01:56----------
um about like some different things we


---------01:59----------
could touch on i don't


---------02:00----------
i just like my biggest as stupid as this


---------02:02----------
is and i know i shouldn't be worried


---------02:04----------
about this


---------02:04----------
i'm just like so worried about like


---------02:08----------
like i talk about mental health on my


---------02:09----------
stream all the time because like uh


---------02:12----------
so i have i've had uh like generalized


---------02:14----------
anxiety


---------02:15----------
um it used to be really severe for


---------02:18----------
like probably around six years at this


---------02:21----------
point um but i've gotten much better at


---------02:23----------
it


---------02:23----------
um but so i talk about anxiety a lot


---------02:27----------
plus i went through


---------02:28----------
uh i have like a really bad hypochondria


---------02:32----------
that is backed up by like really cool


---------02:34----------
ocd tendencies so i get like i can


---------02:37----------
spiral out of kind of like control


---------02:40----------
essentially and just get


---------02:41----------
wrapped up in a bunch of irrational


---------02:43----------
thoughts and so i had like


---------02:44----------
a big episode of that like a year ago


---------02:47----------
and so i like talked my stream a lot


---------02:49----------
about


---------02:50----------
mental health and so it's like i talk


---------02:51----------
about mental health a lot um


---------02:54----------
but i i the interesting thing is since


---------02:57----------
i'm on twitch


---------02:58----------
whenever i do talk about mental health i


---------02:59----------
delete um


---------03:02----------
like i delete my vods afterwards because


---------03:04----------
i don't want to be harassed over it does


---------03:06----------
that make sense


---------03:07----------
sure so it's weird to like it's not


---------03:10----------
weird but it's like


---------03:12----------
it's different to like come on here


---------03:15----------
and be like okay we're talking about it


---------03:17----------
and there's you know like


---------03:19----------
not no going back but like we're gonna


---------03:20----------
be productive about it


---------03:24----------
well i mean so first let me start by


---------03:25----------
saying we can go back


---------03:28----------
right so if if anything happens that


---------03:30----------
you're not comfortable with or things


---------03:31----------
like that we can


---------03:33----------
stop uh him down


---------03:36----------
that's okay um so so


---------03:39----------
you know we can we can always pull the


---------03:42----------
plug


---------03:43----------
okay right that's that's fair


---------03:46----------
um i don't want you to feel i mean i


---------03:48----------
imagine you're gonna feel pressured but


---------03:50----------
i don't want you to


---------03:51----------
give in to the pressure and if we talk


---------03:54----------
about something that's uncomfortable or


---------03:55----------
making you uncomfortable


---------03:57----------
that's totally cool like we can stop or


---------03:59----------
what may


---------04:00----------
actually be useful is for us to


---------04:02----------
understand what makes you uncomfortable


---------04:04----------
and where that comes from


---------04:06----------
yeah okay um so what i'm set like have


---------04:10----------
you been harassed over it before


---------04:13----------
um the my biggest thing


---------04:17----------
is i think i think


---------04:21----------
i'm kind of like a perfectionist and so


---------04:23----------
being on the internet


---------04:25----------
is just hard in general because the


---------04:28----------
things that they can harass you over


---------04:30----------
is like so minuscule and


---------04:33----------
to try to not get wrapped up in that is


---------04:37----------
exhausting i guess um to try to like


---------04:39----------
dehumanize yourself


---------04:41----------
because you want to be a streamer and


---------04:43----------
you want to be successful


---------04:44----------
um like it


---------04:48----------
so it's like i've gotten harassed over


---------04:50----------
the weirdest things like i


---------04:51----------
i have the word bald band in my chat


---------04:54----------
because like people would come in and


---------04:55----------
they'd be like oh cutie cinderella you


---------04:57----------
look like you're balding or


---------04:58----------
are you going bald and so then like i


---------05:00----------
was so


---------05:02----------
distraught by this like i went to


---------05:04----------
multiple doctors i like


---------05:05----------
went to a plastic surgeon i had multiple


---------05:08----------
people i've like looked into rogaine


---------05:09----------
like i'm so concerned about going


---------05:11----------
bald and it's like the craziest things


---------05:14----------
that can just like trigger this


---------05:15----------
this train of thoughts that it's just


---------05:18----------
it's like it's so


---------05:19----------
annoying because it's like uh you want


---------05:21----------
to be a human on the internet but it


---------05:22----------
seems impossible sometimes


---------05:25----------
wow that sounds so you you seem like you


---------05:29----------
have


---------05:29----------
somewhat of a


---------05:33----------
you gotta let me know so if i say


---------05:34----------
something out of line you gotta let me


---------05:35----------
know and i okay


---------05:36----------
i don't mean to be mean but it sounds


---------05:38----------
like you've got a couple of like things


---------05:40----------
that are really like


---------05:41----------
coalescing and and feel pretty bad like


---------05:44----------
it sounds awful like if you've got


---------05:46----------
some amount of hypoch chondriasis or ocd


---------05:50----------
and then like that sounds like a


---------05:52----------
terrible combination


---------05:54----------
with people picking random and


---------05:56----------
making memes out of it because it sounds


---------05:58----------
quite like it like one feeds the other


---------06:01----------
does that make sense


---------06:02----------
no it does it's it's it's like it's


---------06:05----------
exhausting


---------06:06----------
in a way um especially like uh


---------06:11----------
i uh it's weird because like to grow on


---------06:14----------
this platform


---------06:15----------
and i kind of talked about this on my


---------06:16----------
stream last night to grow on this


---------06:17----------
platform


---------06:18----------
it's like you have to have so many


---------06:20----------
realms of like social media like you


---------06:22----------
have to post on instagram you have to


---------06:24----------
post on twitter you have to


---------06:26----------
do all these things and to do that with


---------06:29----------
confidence


---------06:32----------
is so scary i guess is the word like


---------06:36----------
i uh i can't like i i just can't take


---------06:39----------
pictures of myself because if i post it


---------06:42----------
people are going to call me names and if


---------06:44----------
they don't call me names and they think


---------06:45----------
that i'm full of myself because i'm


---------06:47----------
posting pictures of myself it's like


---------06:48----------
there's always two


---------06:50----------
thoughts going into everything and so it


---------06:51----------
feels like there's never any right


---------06:53----------
answer


---------06:54----------
you seem really really conflicted yeah


---------06:57----------
like you want to talk about mental


---------06:58----------
health and then you pull off the bond


---------07:00----------
yeah like you need to be human and


---------07:02----------
authentic but being human and authentic


---------07:06----------
screws you yeah that sounds tough


---------07:10----------
i i don't know how you navigate the


---------07:12----------
world without a right answer


---------07:15----------
yeah and it's like in everything i do i


---------07:17----------
feel like i never


---------07:18----------
i feel like i'm never confident in


---------07:22----------
what i should be saying what i should be


---------07:24----------
doing


---------07:25----------
in myself like sometimes


---------07:29----------
sometimes i'll be streaming and


---------07:33----------
i'll feel fine i'll feel fine and then


---------07:34----------
it's like i i don't think i don't think


---------07:37----------
chat realizes because i


---------07:38----------
i don't know if you've heard this from


---------07:40----------
other streamers before but it's like


---------07:41----------
you get that like people are like oh


---------07:43----------
just don't read the don't read chat


---------07:45----------
forehead right like


---------07:46----------
just don't read it and you're like oh


---------07:47----------
okay but like


---------07:49----------
how i've always explained it is like


---------07:50----------
i'll be sitting there playing


---------07:52----------
mario and someone will say


---------07:56----------
uh like someone will just come in and be


---------07:58----------
like who's this ugly


---------08:00----------
like literally that's all they'll say


---------08:01----------
and you're like okay cool band whatever


---------08:04----------
you know like let's just move on i'm


---------08:05----------
playing a


---------08:06----------
video game like why are why are my looks


---------08:08----------
part of this conversation and then


---------08:10----------
a few minutes later somebody else comes


---------08:11----------
in and like oh she looks stupid or like


---------08:14----------
and it's just like a constant like


---------08:15----------
banging over the head to the point that


---------08:17----------
i'm like well i need to end stream


---------08:19----------
like i just i can't do it anymore and so


---------08:21----------
it's like


---------08:22----------
i guess my question is like what do you


---------08:25----------
like how do you how do you like how can


---------08:28----------
you be successful


---------08:29----------
when it gets so hard to even


---------08:32----------
stay live or stay in front of people um


---------08:36----------
in that capacity it's a great question


---------08:41----------
can i think for a second yeah for sure


---------08:52----------
i mean so the first thought that i have


---------08:53----------
is like when people say just don't read


---------08:55----------
chat


---------08:57----------
that defeats the purpose of twitch yeah


---------09:00----------
right without chat you're just playing


---------09:02----------
video games by yourself


---------09:03----------
that's not what twitch is about twitch


---------09:05----------
is about chat


---------09:06----------
chat is like chat is like what twitch is


---------09:09----------
about right


---------09:10----------
yeah kinda weird um


---------09:13----------
because without twitch chat it's just


---------09:15----------
playing video games


---------09:17----------
so and then the other thing that i'm


---------09:19----------
hearing from you is


---------09:21----------
how do you continue to stream when


---------09:23----------
people say things


---------09:25----------
to you i mean what i'm hearing from you


---------09:27----------
is that like you have a health bar


---------09:29----------
and that sometimes when people say


---------09:32----------
certain things


---------09:33----------
you like lose some hp and then


---------09:35----------
eventually you run out of hp and then


---------09:37----------
you can't stream anymore


---------09:40----------
is that fair to say yeah and i think


---------09:43----------
it's like


---------09:44----------
there's a big part that i feel like


---------09:46----------
people don't


---------09:48----------
i feel like people don't even know and


---------09:51----------
maybe i'm just too sensitive of a person


---------09:53----------
but it's like i don't think people know


---------09:55----------
all the time what they're saying and why


---------09:56----------
it's hurtful like


---------09:58----------
i am i'm friends with other streamers so


---------10:00----------
people will come in my chat and they'll


---------10:01----------
say hey what is


---------10:02----------
so and so doing and it's like i'm like


---------10:05----------
don't use me as your way to get to


---------10:08----------
somebody else like you know what i'm


---------10:09----------
saying like


---------10:10----------
it makes me feel so inhuman like just go


---------10:13----------
to


---------10:13----------
like go to their chat like you don't


---------10:15----------
have to ask me or


---------10:17----------
or like uh i don't know just say like


---------10:21----------
there's just like this game of comparing


---------10:23----------
too so it's like


---------10:24----------
like again i'm friends with lots of


---------10:25----------
streamers so people will come in and


---------10:26----------
they'll be like oh you have less viewers


---------10:28----------
than


---------10:30----------
than so and so you know and it's just


---------10:31----------
like it's this never-ending game of like


---------10:33----------
comparing yourself


---------10:34----------
to people and maybe that's my fault like


---------10:37----------
maybe i shouldn't think of it that way


---------10:39----------
um but that how it that's how it like


---------10:41----------
feels a lot is that i'm constantly


---------10:43----------
like in order to be successful i have to


---------10:45----------
be this and why am i not


---------10:47----------
at a thousand viewers is it because of x


---------10:50----------
y and like


---------10:51----------
and so then i look at the people that


---------10:52----------
are at a thousand viewers and what are


---------10:54----------
they doing that i'm not doing and it's


---------10:56----------
just like this


---------10:56----------
constant train of like


---------11:01----------
never-ending thoughts if that makes


---------11:02----------
sense yeah so if i were to


---------11:05----------
to he


---------11:08----------
if i were to recap what i heard so what


---------11:11----------
i'm hearing is what i would call a lot


---------11:12----------
of should thoughts


---------11:15----------
so like you should be doing this there's


---------11:18----------
a lot of comparison


---------11:20----------
yeah you should be streaming more you


---------11:23----------
should be on instagram you should be


---------11:25----------
this you should be this you should be


---------11:26----------
this


---------11:28----------
what do you think about that um


---------11:32----------
i think i think


---------11:37----------
i think i just like i've always been a


---------11:39----------
very hard worker um


---------11:42----------
and so like twitch has never been my


---------11:44----------
full-time job until recently


---------11:46----------
so i just actually put in my two weeks


---------11:48----------
due to covid


---------11:50----------
i've been like working and not getting


---------11:51----------
paid for the past two months so finally


---------11:52----------
i was like okay i'm gonna put in my two


---------11:54----------
weeks i'm gonna do this twitch thing


---------11:56----------
here we go i haven't like my two weeks


---------11:58----------
isn't up yet but


---------11:59----------
i've always said to myself that i


---------12:00----------
couldn't handle twitch mentally


---------12:03----------
um as a full-time job so i'm like i'm


---------12:05----------
very scared


---------12:06----------
and it's also like i've always been


---------12:08----------
successful at anything i've ever done


---------12:09----------
like i was


---------12:10----------
top in my company i was in an interior


---------12:13----------
design firm and it's like


---------12:15----------
going into twitch knowing that i'll


---------12:16----------
never be the top is kind of like


---------12:19----------
very daunting because i guess i think i


---------12:21----------
like


---------12:22----------
i find and i've said this to a lot of


---------12:25----------
people because i felt very defeated like


---------12:27----------
quitting my job because i find my


---------12:30----------
self-worth


---------12:31----------
100 in oh she is successful and now i'm


---------12:34----------
not that


---------12:35----------
and so it's like well now who am i


---------12:39----------
that seems weird to say out loud but


---------12:41----------
yeah


---------12:43----------
what are you feeling disappointed


---------12:47----------
in yourself yeah


---------12:50----------
and what is disappointing about you


---------12:55----------
i don't know um i just feel like


---------12:58----------
this sounds dumb um


---------13:03----------
i just feel like


---------13:07----------
i i feel like


---------13:11----------
i'm like trying to climb a mountain that


---------13:14----------
like there isn't


---------13:15----------
necessarily like a top to and i don't


---------13:18----------
know how i'm gonna do it


---------13:19----------
and i don't know why i'm putting myself


---------13:20----------
in that situation if i like


---------13:22----------
like i'm a planner and what gives me


---------13:24----------
like with ocd you probably know this


---------13:26----------
what like gives me


---------13:27----------
comfort is knowing that there is a plan


---------13:29----------
and if i know there's not a plan


---------13:31----------
then i can get very wrapped up in just


---------13:33----------
these horrible trains of thoughts and


---------13:34----------
like


---------13:35----------
then that's where like my ocd tendencies


---------13:37----------
come in like okay well if i drink a


---------13:38----------
coffee


---------13:39----------
before i go live every day my stream's


---------13:40----------
gonna be better and then that turns into


---------13:42----------
if i drink a coffee with this amount of


---------13:44----------
creamer in it then my stream is gonna be


---------13:46----------
better and then it's like if i use this


---------13:47----------
cup


---------13:48----------
then it slowly compounds all these


---------13:50----------
patterns that i just start using as a


---------13:51----------
way of comfort


---------13:52----------
because that's the only way that i have


---------13:54----------
control in the situation because in


---------13:56----------
reality i have so much limited control


---------13:58----------
of what i can do it


---------13:59----------
like it it drives me crazy


---------14:03----------
okay excellent


---------14:07----------
blair you're doing great


---------14:10----------
and i'm hopeful for you i feel weird


---------14:14----------
yes i can imagine so what feels weird


---------14:18----------
right now um


---------14:22----------
i don't know i'm worried that this is


---------14:23----------
like i'm worried that this is stupid i'm


---------14:25----------
worried that


---------14:26----------
people don't like i'm worried that


---------14:28----------
people like


---------14:29----------
as stupid as like i've worn that people


---------14:31----------
think it's boring i worry that people


---------14:33----------
are like this is dumb why are we talking


---------14:35----------
about this like


---------14:38----------
i don't know okay let me tell you why


---------14:40----------
we're talking about it i think this is


---------14:41----------
great


---------14:42----------
okay there's so much to say i just


---------14:46----------
okay here's the issue so you lack


---------14:49----------
confidence okay so let's just think


---------14:52----------
about


---------14:53----------
what that does to someone so


---------14:57----------
here's why you try to control so there


---------14:58----------
are a lot of things going on first is


---------15:00----------
that you try to control things you're


---------15:01----------
perfectionistic you have anxiety


---------15:03----------
how does all that fit together and


---------15:05----------
what does that have to do with


---------15:06----------
confidence


---------15:07----------
what does that have to do with your


---------15:08----------
feelings of disappointment i'm going to


---------15:09----------
try to lay it out usually i lay things


---------15:11----------
out at the end


---------15:12----------
but now i'm gonna try to lay things out


---------15:13----------
at the beginning because you've done


---------15:15----------
such an awesome job


---------15:16----------
of showing us what's in your mind so


---------15:19----------
let's try to piece it together


---------15:21----------
so the first thing is


---------15:26----------
let's say that like i'm good at like


---------15:28----------
hunting and foraging


---------15:30----------
and taking care of myself and i'm


---------15:32----------
confident that i can survive in the


---------15:34----------
wilderness


---------15:36----------
how much preparation do i have if i go


---------15:39----------
camping


---------15:40----------
how much preparation do i need let me


---------15:42----------
ask ask that


---------15:44----------
um i mean a lot


---------15:47----------
is sort of writing yeah


---------15:50----------
maybe it's a bad example um so so i


---------15:54----------
i guess what i mean to say is generally


---------15:57----------
speaking


---------15:59----------
if i'm confident in myself i don't have


---------16:02----------
to control a whole lot of variables


---------16:04----------
okay does that make sense yes


---------16:08----------
how so um


---------16:12----------
i think of it like uh one thing i'm okay


---------16:16----------
at


---------16:16----------
is like baking and so it's like if i


---------16:19----------
bake


---------16:19----------
i don't need like i can just i can just


---------16:22----------
start doing it


---------16:23----------
because i've done it for years so i


---------16:25----------
never like yeah


---------16:26----------
exactly right so so like like how bad is


---------16:29----------
your ocd or your anxiety when it comes


---------16:32----------
to baking


---------16:33----------
not bad okay so this is important


---------16:37----------
because if you're confident in yourself


---------16:39----------
then you know that you can handle the


---------16:42----------
challenges that come


---------16:43----------
and if you're not confident in yourself


---------16:45----------
that leads to let's call it anxiety and


---------16:47----------
ocd although i don't really know if it's


---------16:49----------
ocd


---------16:50----------
but uh what that means is that you have


---------16:53----------
to control


---------16:54----------
everything because you're not assured of


---------16:56----------
the result like you have to have your


---------16:57----------
coffee with x amount of creamer


---------16:59----------
and that removes a little bit of


---------17:01----------
uncertainty from the equation so you're


---------17:04----------
you fight a war against uncertainty


---------17:07----------
every day


---------17:09----------
and the reason that you have to fight


---------17:10----------
that war is because


---------17:12----------
if we think about like what is how how


---------17:14----------
do we define confidence


---------17:16----------
confidence is like literally the ability


---------17:18----------
to face uncertainty


---------17:21----------
if i go out fishing and i know that i


---------17:23----------
know how to fish


---------17:24----------
i don't have to control a whole lot i'm


---------17:26----------
like i'm going to grab my fishing rod


---------17:27----------
i'm going to grab some bait


---------17:28----------
and i'm going to figure it out you have


---------17:30----------
faith in yourself that you're gonna


---------17:31----------
figure it out


---------17:32----------
you don't need the world to give you


---------17:33----------
certainty because you


---------17:35----------
have faith that you can handle it


---------17:38----------
whatever comes


---------17:39----------
so the first thing is that you know


---------17:42----------
i think you try to exert a lot of


---------17:44----------
control because if we think


---------17:46----------
about it like control is an antidote to


---------17:48----------
anxiety


---------17:49----------
what is anxiety it's like i worry this


---------17:51----------
is going to happen i worry this is going


---------17:52----------
to happen i worry this is going to


---------17:54----------
happen


---------17:54----------
and so how do we deal with those worries


---------17:56----------
what we do is we control those things


---------17:58----------
right if i if i have a hat on people may


---------18:02----------
not comment


---------18:03----------
about me being bald yeah right


---------18:07----------
so yeah so we control all kinds of


---------18:09----------
little variables


---------18:11----------
to remove those anxieties out of the


---------18:13----------
equation


---------18:15----------
the funny thing is that every time we


---------18:19----------
control a variable


---------18:20----------
to get rid of a little bit of anxiety


---------18:22----------
was that hurtful when i said no you're


---------18:24----------
okay


---------18:25----------
you're okay uh


---------18:28----------
is that why you wear a hat uh


---------18:32----------
a lot of the time yeah right so see like


---------18:35----------
so so we can see that what


---------18:37----------
so here's the problem though i'm sorry i


---------18:39----------
didn't i didn't mean to make you feel


---------18:40----------
self-conscious


---------18:41----------
no you're okay um so


---------18:44----------
i mean i i did mean that i used it


---------18:47----------
i used that as an example because i i


---------18:50----------
think i think it's a perfect example


---------18:52----------
yeah okay and they're your camera okay


---------18:53----------
there we go so so the


---------18:55----------
the reason that we do that look look at


---------18:57----------
me don't look at chat


---------18:58----------
minimize chat you know what's great chat


---------19:01----------
no i was looking over at my twitter i'll


---------19:03----------
minimize that okay um so


---------19:07----------
here's the thing so you have this beast


---------19:10----------
of anxiety which is based on confidence


---------19:12----------
but if you control the variables and


---------19:15----------
remove those from the equation what


---------19:17----------
happens to your sense of confidence when


---------19:19----------
you do something


---------19:21----------
when i do anything so so let's say that


---------19:24----------
you


---------19:24----------
stream and you're concerned about having


---------19:26----------
a bad stream so you drink your cup of


---------19:27----------
coffee


---------19:28----------
and then you have a good stream how


---------19:30----------
confident are you the next time


---------19:34----------
i'm not absolutely now this is an


---------19:36----------
interesting question why not


---------19:40----------
um because i never know who's gonna come


---------19:43----------
and chat i never know who's gonna be


---------19:45----------
rude to me today i never know


---------19:47----------
what they're gonna be offended by i


---------19:48----------
never know if they're gonna be mad that


---------19:50----------
i'm wearing too much makeup or not


---------19:51----------
enough makeup or they're gonna tell me


---------19:53----------
again like


---------19:54----------
how small my tits are because


---------19:55----------
they're smaller than the other girls on


---------19:57----------
this platform like it's exhausting


---------19:59----------
okay so that is that is the


---------20:03----------
manifestation the all of those thoughts


---------20:06----------
are the manifestation of your lack of


---------20:08----------
confidence


---------20:10----------
that's what lack of confidence grows


---------20:12----------
into


---------20:13----------
right but here's my question if you have


---------20:16----------
a good stream


---------20:17----------
and people don't say those kinds of


---------20:18----------
things why does that not lead to


---------20:20----------
confidence


---------20:21----------
because one would think that a success


---------20:24----------
should lead to confidence


---------20:25----------
but in your case it doesn't um why i


---------20:28----------
don't know people ask me that like


---------20:30----------
i think my mom my mods ask me that all


---------20:32----------
the time they'll be like cutie there's a


---------20:33----------
hundred nice comments in chat


---------20:35----------
why does one make you stop stream you


---------20:37----------
know what i'm saying like


---------20:38----------
it's just like it's so it's frustrating


---------20:41----------
like i don't know


---------20:42----------
like i don't know but it's like i guess


---------20:45----------
i i


---------20:45----------
i think it's like for example when


---------20:48----------
people say like oh


---------20:49----------
like cutie you're not funny that one


---------20:51----------
doesn't hurt me because i'm like


---------20:54----------
no i'm funny you know like i know i'm a


---------20:55----------
funny person but like


---------20:57----------
when people come in and they're like


---------21:00----------
cutie


---------21:01----------
looks like you've gained weight or


---------21:04----------
like all these superficial things it's


---------21:06----------
like well i can't control that as much


---------21:08----------
as i try like i've always looked this


---------21:10----------
way


---------21:10----------
okay i'm gonna try to i'm gonna try to


---------21:14----------
draw


---------21:15----------
all right so this could end poorly um


---------21:19----------
so give me a second because i think this


---------21:21----------
is important


---------21:23----------
all right so let me start can i uh


---------21:26----------
[Music]


---------21:27----------
what do i need


---------21:31----------
sorry sorry about this you're okay i'm


---------21:34----------
excited


---------21:35----------
i think i'm gonna try to teach you


---------21:39----------
something


---------21:40----------
so the question is okay so there are


---------21:41----------
some things so let's like try to


---------21:43----------
understand


---------21:44----------
the the nature of confidence okay


---------21:47----------
and where confidence comes from okay


---------21:50----------
so here's the thing so there's some


---------21:51----------
things that you're confident about like


---------21:52----------
baking


---------21:54----------
and being funny so what i want to point


---------21:57----------
out to you is that when your confidence


---------21:58----------
level let's let's say you have low


---------22:00----------
confidence


---------22:02----------
and then this leads to anxiety


---------22:06----------
or ocd and then this leads to


---------22:11----------
controlling things actually let me put


---------22:14----------
this here


---------22:15----------
so let's say that your anxieties are


---------22:18----------
where at actually that's wrong


---------22:24----------
sorry i'm trying to figure this out as i


---------22:26----------
go okay you're okay so


---------22:28----------
balding wait


---------22:32----------
and then what's something else that


---------22:35----------
you're


---------22:36----------
you said a couple of things uh just like


---------22:37----------
my face in general


---------22:39----------
people will say i look like a horse um


---------22:43----------
the okay so these these are the


---------22:45----------
anxieties


---------22:47----------
these are the manifestations of anxiety


---------22:49----------
do you understand what i mean by


---------22:50----------
manifestation of anxiety


---------22:52----------
um like where they live yeah so like


---------22:55----------
you're


---------22:56----------
you have anxiety and then it like


---------22:59----------
it bears fruit like a particular thought


---------23:03----------
does that make sense like so you're


---------23:05----------
anxious about balding your weight


---------23:06----------
comparison


---------23:07----------
horse face whatever yeah then what


---------23:10----------
happens is in order to reduce so this is


---------23:12----------
high anxiety


---------23:13----------
in order to reduce the anxiety


---------23:18----------
what you do is you exert control yeah


---------23:21----------
right so wear hat


---------23:24----------
um you know uh careful


---------23:29----------
about shapeliness


---------23:33----------
yeah i'll usually throw on a hoodie or


---------23:36----------
like


---------23:36----------
beautiful right so we can call that we


---------23:39----------
know that's gonna happen


---------23:40----------
okay so then what happens is that your


---------23:42----------
anxiety kind of goes down


---------23:44----------
right yeah so then something weird


---------23:47----------
happens so so we have all of our control


---------23:48----------
factors


---------23:50----------
so now what we're going to do is this


---------23:53----------
and then so you control for all of these


---------23:55----------
things


---------23:57----------
right so let's move that down here and


---------24:00----------
then let's say that this results in


---------24:04----------
having a good stream see i'm even i'm


---------24:07----------
scared to like say these things like


---------24:09----------
even on the internet like i'm scared to


---------24:11----------
be like oh i hate when you guys


---------24:12----------
say that i'm balding i hate when you


---------24:14----------
guys say that i'm fat i hate when you


---------24:15----------
guys say that i'm ugly because i feel


---------24:16----------
like it just encourages people


---------24:18----------
to like do it for a 10 you know so i


---------24:20----------
feel like my my chat is going to be


---------24:21----------
a disaster when i stream again like i


---------24:24----------
i'm


---------24:25----------
very nervous about that yeah so so i


---------24:28----------
understand that you're nervous


---------24:29----------
and i think unfortunately some of that


---------24:32----------
anxiety is warranted


---------24:33----------
yeah okay and and so i'm not going to


---------24:37----------
tell you not to feel nervous because


---------24:38----------
sometimes people are on the


---------24:40----------
internet and that's just how it is


---------24:42----------
yeah and i'm sorry that you feel that


---------24:44----------
way what i am


---------24:46----------
hoping is that


---------24:49----------
what we're doing right now is we're


---------24:50----------
we're rolling the dice


---------24:52----------
and my hope honestly blair my hope is


---------24:54----------
that by


---------24:55----------
exposing yourself you have the


---------24:57----------
opportunity to learn about yourself


---------25:00----------
in a way that will help you more than


---------25:02----------
the on the internet can heart


---------25:04----------
harm you i see okay how do you feel


---------25:07----------
about that


---------25:08----------
uh sounds great


---------25:12----------
right so blair my hope is to like


---------25:15----------
start you on the journey today to free


---------25:17----------
yourself of this


---------25:19----------
general problem yeah i see okay


---------25:22----------
so now the question is like if you have


---------25:24----------
a good stream


---------25:25----------
does that lead to increase in confidence


---------25:30----------
or decrease incompetence


---------25:33----------
um increase


---------25:36----------
incorrect okay that's what it should do


---------25:39----------
right


---------25:40----------
this is what we think is gonna happen


---------25:41----------
but what does that actually do to you


---------25:43----------
like this is you just said i asked you


---------25:45----------
when you have a good stream do you feel


---------25:46----------
better about yourself and what did you


---------25:48----------
say


---------25:50----------
i said i think because it just makes me


---------25:52----------
more nervous that the next one won't be


---------25:53----------
as good as the last one


---------25:55----------
exactly so this is the first really


---------25:57----------
really important thing to understand


---------25:58----------
okay


---------25:59----------
is that we think confidence comes


---------26:03----------
from like if we think confidence comes


---------26:05----------
from successes


---------26:06----------
right but the truth is that somehow this


---------26:10----------
decreases your confidence now that's


---------26:12----------
kind of weird because like now like


---------26:13----------
let's just look at the situation that


---------26:15----------
we're doing so like


---------26:16----------
how like this is weird right so then


---------26:18----------
what happens is like


---------26:20----------
because here's the thing this


---------26:25----------
goes here right yeah and then anxiety


---------26:28----------
increases


---------26:31----------
and then this increases this increases


---------26:34----------
this increases


---------26:36----------
then you control things more and then


---------26:39----------
you have a good stream


---------26:41----------
and then your confidence decreases you


---------26:44----------
see how it's a cycle


---------26:45----------
uh-huh and this is why you're screwed


---------26:48----------
right it's weird


---------26:49----------
yeah no it's true it's like like i


---------26:52----------
talked


---------26:52----------
i i've given this example before but


---------26:54----------
like i used to


---------26:56----------
like on my personal instagram which has


---------26:58----------
like maybe a hundred followers


---------27:00----------
that i used to use years ago it's like


---------27:01----------
if i was feeling very unconfident about


---------27:03----------
the way i looked it was like


---------27:04----------
i would i would dress up and i'd put


---------27:07----------
makeup on and i'd take a cute selfie and


---------27:09----------
this was years ago


---------27:11----------
like literally six seven years ago i'd


---------27:13----------
take a selfie and post it and it'd get


---------27:14----------
like 30 likes and i'd be like oh like


---------27:16----------
people think i'm pretty like i'd feel so


---------27:17----------
good about myself


---------27:18----------
but then um there was a guy i was seeing


---------27:21----------
at the time and it was like


---------27:22----------
new and he like showed me to his sister


---------27:25----------
and his sister like instagram stalked me


---------27:26----------
and he said


---------27:27----------
wow she must be full of herself because


---------27:29----------
she has lots of selfies


---------27:30----------
and so like ever since then now i can't


---------27:33----------
take pictures because it's like this


---------27:34----------
battle of like


---------27:35----------
well i want to be confident but i don't


---------27:37----------
want people to think that i'm a shitty


---------27:38----------
person because i'm trying to be


---------27:40----------
confident so it's it's weird like


---------27:41----------
there's like


---------27:42----------
there's always like a battle between


---------27:44----------
like


---------27:46----------
like trying to be like like happy with


---------27:49----------
yourself and then also like


---------27:51----------
the way you present yourself i don't


---------27:52----------
know like it doesn't make sense yes it


---------27:54----------
makes perfect sense and we'll get there


---------27:56----------
and this so blair this comes down to the


---------27:58----------
basic issue here


---------28:00----------
is that your sense of self-worth is


---------28:02----------
determined by other people


---------28:04----------
i see okay right so like you're taking


---------28:08----------
it like so if i'm taking a selfie


---------28:09----------
because i want to take a selfie


---------28:12----------
and and then people say like oh dr k is


---------28:15----------
full of himself because he's taking


---------28:17----------
selfies


---------28:18----------
like they're allowed to think that but


---------28:20----------
that's not why i'm doing it


---------28:22----------
okay and so like why does the


---------28:26----------
why do you value the reasons that they


---------28:30----------
think you do it over why you actually do


---------28:32----------
it


---------28:35----------
um right so they think that you do it


---------28:38----------
because you're a narcissistic


---------28:40----------
yeah you do it because you like to take


---------28:43----------
selfies


---------28:45----------
and so like but what happens is that


---------28:46----------
anytime there's like there's a conflict


---------28:49----------
between you and them


---------28:50----------
you default to their position there are


---------28:52----------
a hundred people who say nice things to


---------28:54----------
you


---------28:54----------
there's one person who calls you


---------28:56----------
maulding and then


---------28:58----------
you like default to that person yeah


---------29:01----------
so that's that's because literally what


---------29:03----------
you're doing is you have an opinion of


---------29:04----------
yourself


---------29:10----------
and then they have an opinion of you


---------29:14----------
uh let's


---------29:19----------
their opinion and what you do


---------29:23----------
is this yes


---------29:27----------
right so this is because so this is


---------29:30----------
because of a lack of confidence so we're


---------29:31----------
going to get there in a second we'll


---------29:32----------
talk more about that okay


---------29:34----------
okay so the first thing that that that i


---------29:36----------
mean does that make sense because you


---------29:37----------
don't have faith in yourself


---------29:38----------
you don't have a sense of your intrinsic


---------29:40----------
worth i also like i also just like


---------29:43----------
i just like as stupid as it is it's like


---------29:46----------
i just want


---------29:47----------
them to be happy does that make sense


---------29:48----------
like i said like yeah


---------29:50----------
like right yeah i don't know that you


---------29:53----------
want them to be happier do you want them


---------29:54----------
to like you


---------29:56----------
i think yeah maybe maybe like me i mean


---------29:59----------
but if you


---------30:00----------
like me then they're happy right


---------30:03----------
so now we get to the root of it


---------30:08----------
that's the problem


---------30:11----------
then though


---------30:15----------
man blair you're giving me too much i'm


---------30:17----------
sorry


---------30:18----------
no it's great it's actually really good


---------30:20----------
so now the question is


---------30:22----------
when did you start believing that


---------30:25----------
people liking you made them happy


---------30:29----------
um that you have to be a particular way


---------30:32----------
to make


---------30:33----------
other people happy probably like


---------30:36----------
high school okay so like that's where we


---------30:39----------
need to dig into this belief


---------30:41----------
yeah because their happiness does not


---------30:43----------
depend on them liking you


---------30:45----------
but like i understand that you have a


---------30:47----------
part of your mind that believes that


---------30:49----------
yeah


---------30:51----------
right so like this is something that's a


---------30:53----------
big problem in our community which is


---------30:54----------
that


---------30:57----------
we believe first of all that we have the


---------30:59----------
capacity to make


---------31:00----------
other people like us and also that we


---------31:02----------
have the capacity to make other people


---------31:04----------
happy


---------31:05----------
yeah and the more that you try to get


---------31:07----------
them to like you


---------31:09----------
and the more that


---------31:12----------
you try to make them happy the more


---------31:16----------
this increases because you're valuing


---------31:20----------
them


---------31:20----------
over yourself and then the question


---------31:23----------
becomes


---------31:24----------
why do you val does that make sense you


---------31:25----------
with me then the question becomes why do


---------31:28----------
you value yourself


---------31:29----------
less than them and that essentially


---------31:31----------
comes back


---------31:32----------
to confidence or in this case i would


---------31:35----------
put it slightly differently


---------31:36----------
worth so blair


---------31:40----------
what are you worth


---------31:46----------
uh i don't know how to answer that


---------31:49----------
that's a hard question right so let me


---------31:51----------
put it to you this way


---------31:54----------
what are you worth when you're the top


---------31:57----------
seller at your interior design place


---------32:00----------
um i am worth


---------32:04----------
millions of dollars absolutely so we're


---------32:07----------
gonna call that a lot


---------32:10----------
yeah and then what are you worth if you


---------32:11----------
no longer have that job


---------32:15----------
zero dollars so we're going to call that


---------32:17----------
very little worth


---------32:18----------
yeah and now we get to the core of your


---------32:20----------
fear which is that your worth as a human


---------32:23----------
being is not


---------32:24----------
intrinsic it's based on external stuff


---------32:30----------
yeah and as long as that's true


---------32:34----------
as long as like so now i'm gonna turn


---------32:35----------
this off for a second okay


---------32:37----------
okay and we're gonna go back to


---------32:41----------
this and we're gonna see your face for a


---------32:43----------
moment maybe we can go back to the ipad


---------32:45----------
so here's the thing


---------32:49----------
as long as you


---------32:52----------
i just see why do i see two of me


---------32:58----------
there we go boom or dr kale catch up at


---------33:01----------
some point


---------33:02----------
thank you thank you for letting me know


---------33:03----------
though so here's the thing like like


---------33:05----------
as long as your worth is determined by


---------33:07----------
external things like


---------33:09----------
that that that's the very definition


---------33:12----------
of lack of confidence right because like


---------33:14----------
confidence is about


---------33:15----------
worth that comes from within okay


---------33:19----------
and then the question becomes well how


---------33:20----------
do you get that


---------33:24----------
yes you do because because


---------33:27----------
what is your worth when it comes to


---------33:29----------
baking


---------33:33----------
[Music]


---------33:35----------
are you good at baking but it's like


---------33:38----------
nobody needs that


---------33:39----------
nobody needs a cupcake what where the


---------33:42----------
 do you get that idea i think the


---------33:44----------
world would be


---------33:45----------
a way better place just think think


---------33:47----------
about what you just said


---------33:49----------
yeah because i think the exact opposite


---------33:52----------
is true


---------33:55----------
i think sometimes


---------34:00----------
the only thing that people need is a


---------34:04----------
cupcake


---------34:06----------
uh yeah i don't i don't know


---------34:09----------
i mean it's like it's so frivolous like


---------34:11----------
it's so


---------34:12----------
it's not though okay so let me let me


---------34:15----------
ask you a question so let's say


---------34:16----------
hypothetically so i work at an inpatient


---------34:18----------
psychiatric hospital


---------34:20----------
there are lots of people there who are


---------34:21----------
depressed suicidal


---------34:23----------
addicted with drawing and i go to i go


---------34:27----------
to work every day and we talk about


---------34:28----------
all of their problems and we adjust


---------34:30----------
their medications and stuff like that


---------34:32----------
how fun do you think their life is


---------34:36----------
not fun okay what do you think happens


---------34:39----------
to their life if i bring in a dozen


---------34:41----------
cupcakes and give one to each of my


---------34:42----------
patients


---------34:44----------
i think they're excited about cupcakes


---------34:46----------
absolutely do i'm telling you do not


---------34:49----------
underestimate the value of a cupcake


---------34:52----------
i i have always said that like the


---------34:55----------
reason


---------34:56----------
that i'm in to baking is it it it's


---------34:59----------
always been that that way for me to like


---------35:01----------
have an easy way to fit in if that makes


---------35:03----------
sense like if i go to a party it's like


---------35:04----------
i bring


---------35:05----------
cookies and then it's like people are


---------35:07----------
like oh it's the girl that brought


---------35:08----------
cookies and so they're like nicer to me


---------35:10----------
yeah so i think that's that's tricky


---------35:12----------
right because it's feeding into your


---------35:14----------
insecurity so


---------35:15----------
here's kind of the punch line around


---------35:16----------
confidence


---------35:18----------
is so if i actually let me ask you this


---------35:21----------
so let's say like i'm trying to teach my


---------35:22----------
kid to ride a bike


---------35:23----------
and she's got training wheels right so


---------35:26----------
if i want


---------35:27----------
so when she rides a bike the reason that


---------35:31----------
she falls over


---------35:32----------
is because she has uh sorry she the


---------35:34----------
reason she doesn't fall over


---------35:36----------
is because she has training wheels or


---------35:38----------
because she knows how to ride a bike


---------35:42----------
um probably because she has training


---------35:45----------
wheels


---------35:46----------
absolutely right so if she's anxious


---------35:48----------
about her ability to ride a bike and i


---------35:50----------
add training wheels her anxiety goes


---------35:52----------
down and what happens to her confidence


---------35:55----------
she it's lower because she's relying on


---------35:58----------
the training oils right like she's


---------36:00----------
there we go right okay okay okay so now


---------36:03----------
we're gonna go we're gonna go back


---------36:04----------
my cookies are my training wheels


---------36:07----------
absolutely my friend


---------36:09----------
beautifully beautifully put hold on okay


---------36:12----------
now i gotta try to share this now we're


---------36:15----------
gonna go back


---------36:18----------
okay can you see this yes


---------36:21----------
okay all right so now we're gonna go


---------36:24----------
back here oh


---------36:26----------
so here's the problem


---------36:31----------
what happens if you don't wear a hat


---------36:35----------
[Music]


---------36:38----------
my forehead looks big okay and then you


---------36:41----------
and then you stream yeah and then if you


---------36:44----------
have a good stream then what happens


---------36:47----------
if i stream and i'm not wearing a hat


---------36:49----------
yep i mean it doesn't matter because


---------36:51----------
it's always


---------36:52----------
you know a new person's gonna come in


---------36:54----------
tomorrow sure


---------36:57----------
what happens at the end oh hold on a


---------37:00----------
second


---------37:02----------
hello hey


---------37:08----------
huh


---------37:18----------
oh sweet okay


---------37:22----------
come on okay


---------37:26----------
there we go fixed thank you


---------37:31----------
whoa


---------37:34----------
damn my producers and tech people are


---------37:38----------
legit


---------37:41----------
that's great okay so here here's the


---------37:43----------
thing all right


---------37:44----------
so if you um


---------37:48----------
so if you don't wear the hat your


---------37:50----------
anxiety increases


---------37:53----------
but then what happens is you're taking


---------37:55----------
the training wheels off


---------37:56----------
all right yeah okay and here's the


---------37:58----------
problem is that you could have a good


---------38:00----------
stream or you could have a bad stream


---------38:02----------
yeah but the funny thing is i think


---------38:04----------
either way


---------38:05----------
your confidence is going to increase


---------38:08----------
interesting right because like if i if i


---------38:12----------
have my kid and i take the training


---------38:14----------
wheels off


---------38:15----------
she could fall yeah it's gonna happen


---------38:19----------
yeah but she's not always gonna fall


---------38:22----------
and the more she falls or not falls


---------38:27----------
the more she's able to tolerate her


---------38:28----------
anxiety because like here's the


---------38:30----------
i mean i don't know if you can imagine


---------38:31----------
this but literally like if i talk to her


---------38:33----------
about taking the training wheels off


---------38:35----------
she panics because she's afraid


---------38:39----------
yeah she's anxious yes and so


---------38:42----------
here's the thing if you're talking about


---------38:44----------
overcoming anxiety


---------38:46----------
wearing a hat is not overcoming anxiety


---------38:48----------
it's feeding into it


---------38:50----------
yeah it's making it go away artificially


---------38:54----------
you know if you use drugs or other forms


---------38:57----------
of things to like make your art like


---------38:58----------
your anxiety like


---------39:00----------
artificially decrease instead of


---------39:01----------
grappling with it


---------39:03----------
your confidence is never going to grow


---------39:06----------
all that's going to happen is you're


---------39:07----------
going to fall into the cycle


---------39:08----------
over and over and over again


---------39:11----------
and what you need to do unfortunately is


---------39:14----------
face


---------39:15----------
your anxiety right and we kind of talk


---------39:18----------
about that and like with with my


---------39:19----------
daughter like what we do is we we


---------39:20----------
take the training wheels off and then we


---------39:22----------
explain to her that hey like you could


---------39:24----------
fall but you may not i have faith in you


---------39:26----------
if you do fall i'm going to be here and


---------39:29----------
i'm going to help you get back up


---------39:31----------
and we're going to try again and the


---------39:34----------
more that we do that the more confident


---------39:36----------
she's going to be


---------39:39----------
interesting okay so here's the other


---------39:41----------
thing


---------39:42----------
when it comes to baking and it when it


---------39:44----------
comes to you being funny


---------39:47----------
i think somewhere along the way


---------39:50----------
you let yourself crack a junk in spite


---------39:53----------
of your anxiety yes


---------39:57----------
and when you crack jokes in spite of


---------40:00----------
your anxiety


---------40:01----------
then what happens to your confidence uh


---------40:04----------
it goes down


---------40:06----------
confidence goes down or up i think down


---------40:09----------
doesn't it because isn't that just like


---------40:10----------
a bad coping mechanism


---------40:12----------
i don't think so so so here's my thought


---------40:15----------
okay so like


---------40:16----------
i have a joke


---------40:20----------
okay and so then you have low confidence


---------40:27----------
right so if you give in to your low


---------40:28----------
confidence stay silent


---------40:35----------
therefore um


---------40:38----------
i'm not funny


---------40:43----------
does that make sense yeah okay so let's


---------40:46----------
say yeah okay


---------40:48----------
i am funny this is what you believe


---------40:51----------
right like you know you're funny


---------40:53----------
yeah so if this route leads to i'm not


---------40:56----------
funny


---------40:58----------
how do we get here so how do you know


---------41:01----------
you're funny


---------41:02----------
by making a joke and having people laugh


---------41:04----------
at it


---------41:07----------
make a joke but like


---------41:10----------
how did you make a joke if you're not


---------41:12----------
confident


---------41:15----------
okay i see now right so the funny thing


---------41:20----------
is this is possible too this is


---------41:24----------
inaction coping


---------41:28----------
giving in to


---------41:32----------
insecurity


---------41:35----------
this is is insecurity and


---------41:38----------
confidence like this like is being


---------41:42----------
secure and being confident the same


---------41:43----------
thing


---------41:44----------
i think so okay well sort of


---------41:47----------
so so insecure confidence so so let me


---------41:50----------
just finish this like


---------41:51----------
do you get how like here either you


---------41:53----------
control for factors and don't open


---------41:55----------
yourself up to hurt


---------41:57----------
which is giving in into insecurity or


---------41:59----------
you roll the dice


---------42:01----------
yeah and then sometimes you make a joke


---------42:07----------
i'm not funny yeah right


---------42:11----------
yes but here's the crazy thing is when i


---------42:13----------
ask you about that blair this is the


---------42:16----------
only time that we've talked about you


---------42:18----------
not doing a good job and what are you


---------42:20----------
doing right now


---------42:22----------
laughing how do you feel right now


---------42:26----------
uh how do i feel in this moment


---------42:29----------
i don't know i feel okay why because i


---------42:31----------
just talked about all the jokes that you


---------42:33----------
made that aren't funny


---------42:34----------
and when you remember all the times you


---------42:36----------
weren't funny


---------42:37----------
how the are you laughing instead of


---------42:39----------
like falling into your anxiety


---------42:41----------
because even when they're not funny


---------42:43----------
they're kind of funny


---------42:44----------
that's confidence my friend that's


---------42:48----------
it okay


---------42:51----------
even when i'm not funny i'm funny that's


---------42:53----------
the nature of confidence


---------42:55----------
even when i have a bad stream it's a


---------42:58----------
good stream


---------42:59----------
even when people call me balding i'm


---------43:02----------
i'm a beautiful person okay


---------43:06----------
do you see how like literally what


---------43:07----------
you're doing right now is something


---------43:08----------
that's very very important and very


---------43:10----------
beautiful to see


---------43:12----------
which is that you were accepting that


---------43:14----------
you were flawed and you're


---------43:15----------
laughing in its face


---------43:17----------
and you're okay with it yeah but that's


---------43:20----------
easy like i don't know being funny like


---------43:22----------
saying like accepting your sense of


---------43:24----------
humor is so much easier than like


---------43:25----------
accepting the way you look


---------43:27----------
does that mean is that fair i think it's


---------43:29----------
fair


---------43:30----------
for you okay


---------43:33----------
right so i'm sure you can imagine that


---------43:35----------
there are people out there


---------43:37----------
who are who


---------43:41----------
beg to differ right there are people out


---------43:44----------
there who are anxious about how funny


---------43:46----------
they are


---------43:47----------
okay yeah and maybe don't care so much


---------43:51----------
about their looks


---------43:52----------
but i generally speaking i agree that


---------43:54----------
it's easier to be anxious about your


---------43:55----------
looks than it is


---------43:56----------
to be about you know being funny i see


---------43:59----------
two of me again


---------44:00----------
oh sorry thank you okay


---------44:03----------
all right okay so


---------44:07----------
but i i think like so here's the thing


---------44:08----------
is i i think you've done it right so


---------44:10----------
you've learned how to gain confidence


---------44:11----------
and the key thing is that you got to


---------44:13----------
roll the dice at some point


---------44:15----------
and the more that you give in to your


---------44:17----------
anxiety and this is true of ocd as well


---------44:20----------
like i've worked with some people who


---------44:23----------
have ocd


---------44:24----------
and the more they feed their ocd like


---------44:26----------
the stronger it grows


---------44:29----------
yeah so the most extreme case of ocd


---------44:32----------
that i've ever heard of


---------44:34----------
i'm not a personal person like i don't


---------44:35----------
even know if it's real


---------44:37----------
so one of my ocd instructors once


---------44:40----------
told me that like someone had such a


---------44:42----------
phobia of bugs


---------44:44----------
that they like they like dug


---------44:47----------
into the ground around their bed


---------44:51----------
and they dug a trench and they put like


---------44:53----------
toxic chemicals


---------44:55----------
they encircled their bed they moved it


---------44:57----------
to the middle of the room they encircled


---------44:59----------
their bed


---------44:59----------
in a moat of toxic chemicals so that


---------45:02----------
bugs couldn't fall inside


---------45:04----------
that's kind of hype it's crazy


---------45:07----------
i think well i i i'm that way with like


---------45:09----------
flying like flying on airplanes is that


---------45:11----------
way


---------45:12----------
uh like i'll drive 18 hours before i'll


---------45:16----------
fly for the sake of avoiding a flight


---------45:18----------
yeah and so the interesting thing is


---------45:20----------
that when you do that


---------45:22----------
it makes that person feel less anxious


---------45:25----------
because they feel protected


---------45:27----------
yeah but it doesn't actually like it


---------45:30----------
makes your experience of anxiety


---------45:32----------
less and it makes the size of the


---------45:35----------
anxiety beast in your mind


---------45:37----------
bigger yeah yeah


---------45:40----------
i understand that i think i think the


---------45:43----------
hardest thing is like


---------45:44----------
um with the confidence is like i i i


---------45:47----------
like


---------45:48----------
after like years of like not


---------45:51----------
being confident speaking of i think i


---------45:53----------
just like picked a zit so that's


---------45:54----------
embarrassing um


---------45:55----------
years of not being confident like how i


---------45:58----------
don't i just don't know like it seems it


---------46:00----------
seems like such a daunting task to try


---------46:02----------
to like figure out how to be confident


---------46:04----------
you know what i'm saying like


---------46:04----------
absolutely so so that's awesome it is


---------46:08----------
exhausting


---------46:09----------
so this is where i think it starts with


---------46:10----------
like little things right


---------46:12----------
so it starts with like uh honestly


---------46:14----------
you've got to roll the dice and you've


---------46:15----------
got to take a chance


---------46:17----------
because i think the other big big


---------46:19----------
confusing thing is that people assume


---------46:20----------
confidence comes from success


---------46:22----------
but actually confidence comes from


---------46:26----------
failure


---------46:32----------
i see what do you see like


---------46:36----------
are you saying like if you fail then you


---------46:37----------
can like like reflect on it in a way and


---------46:40----------
know that you like at least you tried


---------46:42----------
like i


---------46:43----------
or no it survived it that


---------46:46----------
okay right because here's the thing like


---------46:47----------
you're afraid of something coming to


---------46:49----------
pass


---------46:50----------
i'm afraid of failing a class yeah


---------46:53----------
and then once i actually fail a class


---------46:55----------
and then it's like oh


---------46:56----------
i'm actually still around and i


---------46:58----------
recovered from that


---------46:59----------
like you're down in the pits for a


---------47:01----------
little while and then you come out of it


---------47:03----------
and that's where you have faith in


---------47:04----------
yourself that's where faith in yourself


---------47:06----------
comes from


---------47:07----------
it comes from overcoming challenges not


---------47:10----------
stacking the deck in your favor so that


---------47:12----------
you don't have to face them


---------47:14----------
what about like what about like just


---------47:16----------
like fitting in in general you know what


---------47:18----------
i'm saying like how do you like


---------47:21----------
like is that something you even spend


---------47:22----------
your time worrying about or


---------47:25----------
yeah so absolutely right so at some


---------47:28----------
point and when it comes to fitting in


---------47:30----------
you have to take a chance so you're not


---------47:33----------
going to feel confident


---------47:35----------
until you give people the chance to


---------47:37----------
reject you


---------47:38----------
and they don't


---------47:43----------
cool that sounds not fun


---------47:47----------
yep but you've done it before when it


---------47:48----------
comes to jokes


---------47:50----------
yeah i see right yeah how concerned are


---------47:54----------
you about the zit or whatever


---------47:56----------
it's like it's eating me up a lot in the


---------47:58----------
inside yeah yeah okay so that's fine


---------48:00----------
no no it's not fine okay so close your


---------48:03----------
eyes blair


---------48:04----------
we're gonna meditate now bleeding


---------48:07----------
okay people can see my zits bleeding


---------48:10----------
okay i mean that's


---------48:14----------
i know it doesn't feel all right well


---------48:16----------
now your camera's blurry so i think


---------48:17----------
we're fine


---------48:19----------
okay so blair can you put put the tissue


---------48:22----------
down


---------48:23----------
okay no licking all right so you feel it


---------48:26----------

---------48:26----------
okay never mind you can leave it there


---------48:28----------
you want to leave it there do it


---------48:30----------
yeah okay just leave it there close your


---------48:32----------
eyes


---------48:33----------
okay so tell me what you feel


---------48:36----------
anxious huh i said anxious


---------48:40----------
okay what are you anxious about uh


---------48:44----------
uh my zit is bleeding and it's gross


---------48:48----------
okay and people are gonna think i'm


---------48:50----------
gross


---------48:52----------
okay so look at my face uh-huh


---------48:56----------
wait i can't see your face wait why


---------48:58----------
can't you see my face


---------48:59----------
i don't know


---------49:02----------
 there it is okay look at your


---------49:04----------
face i'm so sorry


---------49:07----------
okay so so look at my face is this the


---------49:09----------
face


---------49:10----------
of someone who's grossed out


---------49:13----------
no i don't know maybe you're pretending


---------49:16----------
not to be grossed out maybe you are


---------49:17----------
grossed out okay there it is


---------49:19----------
right so so now what's your mind doing


---------49:22----------
maybe i'm pretending yeah but but


---------49:26----------
the sensory input that you're receiving


---------49:28----------
now look at my face let's not we'll get


---------49:29----------
to whether i'm pretending in a second


---------49:31----------
is this the face of someone who is


---------49:33----------
grossed out


---------49:35----------
no okay so when you see the sensory


---------49:38----------
input


---------49:39----------
what does your mind do


---------49:43----------
it continues to assume that you're


---------49:45----------
exactly yeah


---------49:46----------
exactly right i've always said this is


---------49:49----------
like a weird thing and maybe this is


---------49:50----------
like totally


---------49:51----------
off base but like i've always said like


---------49:54----------
it as weird as it is like


---------49:55----------
so my mom used to uh she used to text me


---------49:59----------
every single day and be like


---------50:00----------
i hope you're having a good day remember


---------50:02----------
that you're beautiful or just like stuff


---------50:03----------
like that like just constantly telling


---------50:05----------
me like


---------50:06----------
positive things about myself sorry this


---------50:08----------
is super dumb


---------50:10----------
um but then when she died it was like


---------50:13----------
i lost that and so it's like


---------50:16----------
something as little as like being told


---------50:18----------
something positive about yourself every


---------50:19----------
single day to like not having that i


---------50:21----------
think like


---------50:22----------
 me up yeah


---------50:26----------
because it's like with and i'd always


---------50:27----------
say like oh your mom has to say that


---------50:29----------
like your mom has to be nice to you and


---------50:31----------
that was my way of like oh it doesn't


---------50:32----------
mean anything


---------50:33----------
but now that i don't have someone who


---------50:35----------
has to be nice to me it's like


---------50:36----------
 what is that feeling of


---------50:41----------
sad yeah


---------50:44----------
when did she pass away uh four years ago


---------50:49----------
sounds like she was actually really


---------50:50----------
supportive yeah she was awesome


---------50:53----------
well i grew up so i grew up mormon um


---------50:56----------
and the rest of my family is very very


---------50:58----------
lds um and even my mom was lds


---------51:01----------
but she was still supportive of me in


---------51:03----------
like like even though like


---------51:07----------
even though i don't know if that makes


---------51:08----------
sense like even though i wasn't


---------51:11----------
exactly holy or i wasn't perfect or i


---------51:14----------
wasn't


---------51:15----------
following the words of wisdom or all


---------51:17----------
that mormon stuff


---------51:18----------
um i'm like like my dad has said to me


---------51:21----------
like oh like


---------51:22----------
i'll never pay for your wedding if you


---------51:23----------
don't get married at a mormon temple


---------51:25----------
which is fine like it's like i don't


---------51:26----------
need my dad to pay for my wedding but


---------51:27----------
it's stuff


---------51:29----------
it's stuff like that where it's just


---------51:31----------
like


---------51:32----------
well i'll never be good enough to


---------51:34----------
him but i was good enough to my mom but


---------51:37----------
no she's not


---------51:38----------
here to tell me that i'm good enough i


---------51:40----------
don't know is that weird


---------51:42----------
no not at all i don't know so


---------51:45----------
here's what i'm i i think everything


---------51:47----------
just clicked for me


---------51:49----------
because here's what i'm hearing i'm


---------51:52----------
hearing that


---------51:54----------
in order to be valued you were taught


---------51:58----------
because we asked you this question


---------51:59----------
earlier right when did you learn that


---------52:02----------
you had to like


---------52:03----------
be a certain way and get people to like


---------52:06----------
you to make them happy


---------52:08----------
when you like my whole life right i


---------52:11----------
think it happened earlier than high


---------52:12----------
school i didn't say that


---------52:14----------
but now we kind of see because you've


---------52:15----------
been taught your entire life that your


---------52:18----------
value as a human being has nothing to do


---------52:20----------
with who you are


---------52:22----------
it has to do with what you do on the


---------52:24----------
outside


---------52:25----------
yeah and you had one person in your life


---------52:27----------
who said


---------52:28----------
actually whether you wear a hat or you


---------52:30----------
wear makeup or this


---------52:32----------
or any of that does not matter i


---------52:34----------
care about you


---------52:35----------
for you the person who you are


---------52:38----------
not the person that you pretend to be


---------52:40----------
not the top seller at the interior


---------52:42----------
design


---------52:43----------
not the person who streams but the


---------52:45----------
person the core


---------52:46----------
of who you are as a person is someone


---------52:48----------
that i like and value and appreciate


---------52:51----------
and she she was the one beacon that gave


---------52:55----------
you value in a world


---------52:56----------
that judged you for all kinds of


---------53:01----------
yeah like stupid stuff like i like if i


---------53:04----------
wore a tank top my dad would


---------53:05----------
like always be like oh you're like you


---------53:07----------
know showing yourself off and it's like


---------53:09----------
i don't like you know like just silly


---------53:11----------
stuff like that like it's not silly


---------53:12----------
though right


---------53:14----------
it's about as silly as giving someone a


---------53:15----------
cupcake is meaningless


---------53:17----------
yeah seriously i'm not kidding i mean


---------53:20----------
it's not a joke


---------53:21----------
yeah right because you you do this thing


---------53:24----------
where you invalidate a lot and you


---------53:26----------
downplay a lot of like what your


---------53:27----------
experience


---------53:28----------
is you call to yourself i is this dumb


---------53:31----------
am i dumb you keep on saying that about


---------53:33----------
yourself no


---------53:34----------
blair you're not dumb it's not dumb it's


---------53:37----------
not insignificant


---------53:39----------
it's the very opposite you undervalue so


---------53:42----------
much of your experience and so much of


---------53:44----------
your contribution which is like that's


---------53:45----------
not fair


---------53:46----------
because you're worth more than that


---------53:48----------
which is the whole reason we're having


---------53:49----------
this conversation because i don't think


---------53:50----------
you understand that


---------53:52----------
yeah i don't know i don't i don't know i


---------53:54----------
just like and it's one of those things


---------53:55----------
where it's like i feel like i've always


---------53:57----------
struggled with like figuring out even


---------53:59----------
the right route to go


---------54:00----------
because like for example and this is


---------54:02----------
another big jump in things


---------54:04----------
it's like so in high school


---------54:07----------
i uh i went to like rehab for two weeks


---------54:10----------
for like uh


---------54:11----------
like depression and an eating disorder


---------54:13----------
and


---------54:14----------
then when i came back from rehab


---------54:17----------
everyone in high school called me crazy


---------54:19----------
they called me like


---------54:21----------
oh that girl that went to rehab so it's


---------54:22----------
like even though i went to


---------54:24----------
live and get help for these things it


---------54:26----------
was like well i was harassed for that so


---------54:28----------
it feels like no matter what i do


---------54:30----------
there's a negative outcome


---------54:33----------
so that just sucks like like my you know


---------54:35----------
like


---------54:36----------
if i if i feel like i don't fit in at


---------54:38----------
school because


---------54:39----------
my sister is there and she's very mormon


---------54:41----------
and she would


---------54:43----------
yell at me if i wore a certain thing to


---------54:45----------
school but then my friends wouldn't hang


---------54:46----------
out with me if i was dressed a certain


---------54:48----------
way it was just like


---------54:49----------
it was a never-ending paths of like


---------54:52----------
there's


---------54:52----------
no way to go to please everyone and if i


---------54:56----------
even try to make myself happy it makes


---------54:58----------
my family unhappy or it makes my friends


---------55:00----------
unhappy or it does like


---------55:01----------
you know it's just like it's exhausting


---------55:05----------
sounds like you're


---------55:07----------
yeah there's no right choice ever like


---------55:09----------
ever


---------55:11----------
yeah and i don't know if you remember


---------55:13----------
but at the beginning we talked about


---------55:14----------
conflict


---------55:15----------
yeah right how you're conflicted do you


---------55:18----------
share mental health stuff because it


---------55:20----------
burns you


---------55:22----------
and and like now blair like it sort of


---------55:23----------
makes sense right like you're concerned


---------55:25----------
about your appearance because it sounds


---------55:26----------
like


---------55:27----------
your entire life you've been judged


---------55:29----------
based on your appearance


---------55:31----------
and and in such it's it they didn't just


---------55:33----------
judge you like they didn't


---------55:35----------
judge your appearance there's a


---------55:37----------
difference between judging your


---------55:38----------
appearance


---------55:39----------
and judging you based on your appearance


---------55:43----------
because like you were literally taught


---------55:44----------
there was like 10 year old blair


---------55:46----------
who is taught that your value as a human


---------55:49----------
being depends on whether you dress like


---------55:51----------
a hussy


---------55:53----------
yeah you know like there's certain


---------55:54----------
things and if you wear


---------55:56----------
those things your worth as a person


---------55:59----------
decreases yeah


---------56:03----------
which is kind of crazy


---------56:06----------
yeah right yeah


---------56:09----------
no it is yeah and so here's the


---------56:12----------
the unfortunate thing which is that that


---------56:16----------
stuff like carries with you right like


---------56:18----------
your your brain has been programmed it's


---------56:20----------
not that you're


---------56:21----------
i mean sure i'm sure you can get


---------56:22----------
diagnosed with all kinds of fit but i


---------56:24----------
don't think that you're sick


---------56:25----------
i think what you are is conditioned yeah


---------56:28----------
you're conditioned to feel worse about


---------56:31----------
yourself


---------56:33----------
when it comes to your appearance


---------56:36----------
and somehow you've managed to undo some


---------56:39----------
of that conditioning


---------56:40----------
when it comes to things like baking or


---------56:42----------
humor


---------56:44----------
yeah because i'm not hearing your dad


---------56:45----------
ever say


---------56:47----------
you're not a good human being because


---------56:48----------
you attacked a joke what i'm hearing him


---------56:50----------
say


---------56:50----------
is like you're not a good human being if


---------56:52----------
you wear a tank top


---------56:58----------
what do you think how how let's just


---------57:00----------
pause for a second


---------57:01----------
i'm just seeing you process yeah no i'm


---------57:04----------
just yeah


---------57:05----------
that's all i'm doing is that's yeah


---------57:07----------
that's what i'm doing it's just


---------57:08----------
processing it just


---------57:12----------
just i don't know i don't know how i


---------57:14----------
don't know how to get better at it like


---------57:15----------
i'd love to get better at it i just


---------57:16----------
don't know how


---------57:18----------
yeah great that's an excellent question


---------57:20----------
so i think the first thing


---------57:21----------
so here's how you get better okay so the


---------57:23----------
first thing is that it sounds like


---------57:25----------
you may actually i don't know if you


---------57:26----------
have mental health treatment providers


---------57:28----------
but i think this is


---------57:29----------
absolutely the kind of that you


---------57:31----------
talk about in therapy this may be


---------57:32----------
therapy level stop


---------57:34----------
and what i mean by that is like it


---------57:36----------
sounds like at one point you had an


---------57:37----------
eating disorder


---------57:38----------
there may be some kind of i mean i think


---------57:40----------
i know i think everything gets called


---------57:42----------
anxiety in your case i really think


---------57:44----------
about it more like trauma to be honest


---------57:47----------
and not to say that you have ptsd but


---------57:49----------
like this is the other problem with


---------57:50----------
mental health is that


---------57:51----------
you know trauma can have effects on your


---------57:53----------
psychology that are not ptsd


---------57:56----------
yeah and so i think understanding those


---------57:59----------
like this is the whole problem is that


---------58:00----------
everyone equates in psychiatry they


---------58:02----------
equate


---------58:03----------
trauma with ptsd but ptsd is a specific


---------58:06----------
condition but i i think you've been you


---------58:09----------
know taught


---------58:10----------
lots of things about how your value is


---------58:13----------
as a person


---------58:13----------
i think you've got to explore those that


---------58:15----------
 sounds dramatic


---------58:17----------
i also think it you know unfortunately i


---------58:20----------
don't know


---------58:21----------
if you can do this alone or maybe you


---------58:24----------
can do it alone but


---------58:26----------
i don't think it's worth it to try so i


---------58:29----------
think you should get help from some kind


---------58:31----------
and the therapy may be a good idea but


---------58:34----------
it's not just therapy right because i


---------58:36----------
think the other thing that we're hearing


---------58:37----------
is that like you had a very positive


---------58:39----------
influence in your life that you haven't


---------58:41----------
had for four years


---------58:43----------
and while there's no replacement for


---------58:45----------
your mom there should absolutely be


---------58:48----------
people in your life


---------58:49----------
who treat you the same way that she


---------58:51----------
treated you because you deserve that


---------58:54----------
do you have other people like that


---------58:57----------
yeah but i think uh


---------59:01----------
it's a lot of pressure to put on


---------59:02----------
somebody right like


---------59:05----------
like nobody should have to like i don't


---------59:06----------
know like i don't expect anyone to be


---------59:08----------
nice to me


---------59:10----------
yeah so that thought needs to change


---------59:12----------
when you say it's


---------59:14----------
it's it's a lot of pressure to put on


---------59:16----------
someone what are you putting on them


---------59:21----------
um i don't know them to be


---------59:25----------
like you know like that's a lot like i


---------59:27----------
don't know it's a lot to like


---------59:29----------
sure so you know like and i don't want


---------59:32----------
to ask people to care about me


---------59:33----------
like i don't know why not


---------59:37----------
uh because it's selfish


---------59:57----------
so just because it's selfish doesn't


---------59:58----------
mean that you don't deserve


---------60:00----------
it


---------60:03----------
i don't think and this might be totally


---------60:07----------
off-base but i don't think anybody like


---------60:10----------
deserves


---------60:11----------
anything i don't know like i don't think


---------60:13----------
i deserve anything


---------60:15----------
i think i have to like work hard to earn


---------60:18----------
it


---------60:18----------
like i don't deserve anyone


---------60:22----------
to care about me i don't does that make


---------60:25----------
sense


---------60:26----------
it does make sense i just disagree


---------60:29----------
okay i think that


---------60:32----------
you are worth people caring about you


---------60:37----------
what do you think about that


---------60:41----------
and maybe i don't know maybe


---------60:49----------
i'll i'll take a maybe that's good


---------60:51----------
enough yeah and it's okay for you to say


---------60:53----------
no because i think this is a foreign


---------60:55----------
concept to you


---------60:56----------
yeah so i think you've got to think


---------60:57----------
about it and i agree that you should


---------60:59----------
work for what you get in life and also


---------61:02----------
like let me put it to you this way


---------61:05----------
let's say i show up at the hospital with


---------61:06----------
my dozen cupcakes


---------61:10----------
do those people deserve cupcakes


---------61:16----------
no i guess not


---------61:20----------
they i mean they do in a way of like you


---------61:23----------
can make them happier and


---------61:25----------
yeah so that's the really tricky thing


---------61:26----------
right so like i would actually say even


---------61:28----------
though i know this doesn't make any


---------61:29----------
sense


---------61:30----------
and maybe this is a problem with the


---------61:31----------
language that we're using i'd say yes


---------61:34----------
yeah i'd say they do deserve a cupcake


---------61:37----------
i'd say that if your life is in the



---------61:42----------
it's okay for other for you to feel


---------61:46----------
and for other feel people to feel


---------61:48----------
beholden to making your life better


---------61:52----------
i think it's okay to ask someone to care


---------61:54----------
about you


---------61:55----------
even though in a sense it's not fair you


---------61:57----------
don't owe them anything


---------61:58----------
and that's the problem with i think the


---------62:00----------
word deserve is it's not like they owe


---------62:02----------
you anything but you absolutely deserve


---------62:04----------
it


---------62:05----------
you deserve to have people in your life


---------62:06----------
who care about you as a person


---------62:09----------
because that's something that all human


---------62:10----------
beings deserve yeah


---------62:13----------
and and the simplest way that i think


---------62:14----------
about it is is sure your mom has to care


---------62:17----------
about you but like that's just the start


---------62:19----------
it doesn't mean that other people don't


---------62:21----------
like that's actually the problem


---------62:23----------
is that we live in a society where we


---------62:25----------
generally don't as human beings we don't


---------62:28----------
think that we


---------62:29----------
owe other human beings caring and


---------62:34----------
like also that we don't acknowledge that


---------62:37----------
we


---------62:37----------
ourselves deserve to be cared for


---------62:41----------
you know like i deserve to be loved like


---------62:43----------
absolutely literally


---------62:45----------
so do my kids and so do you so does


---------62:48----------
twitch chat


---------62:49----------
i don't know where along the way we like


---------62:51----------
decided that


---------62:52----------
independent like i don't know what's


---------62:53----------
happening but like it sounds


---------62:54----------
mind-boggling to me that i think they do


---------62:56----------
deserve cupcakes


---------62:58----------
yeah okay i think you have the capacity


---------63:00----------
to make other human beings happy and


---------63:02----------
that that's a responsibility that you


---------63:03----------
have


---------63:04----------
and similarly like that's not a one-way


---------63:05----------
street like you deserve to be on the


---------63:07----------
receiving end of cupcakes you deserve


---------63:09----------
people to be baking for you too why not


---------63:15----------
it's weird yeah no it all makes sense it


---------63:18----------
makes a lot of sense i mean if anything


---------63:20----------
like i am


---------63:21----------
like i feel like i am always that person


---------63:22----------
that's like okay like


---------63:24----------
you know like even though i say like oh


---------63:26----------
they don't deserve cupcakes i'm still


---------63:28----------
the one that's like


---------63:28----------
even if they don't deserve them like i


---------63:30----------
want other people to be happy so here


---------63:32----------
you go like here's this like i feel like


---------63:34----------
i'm


---------63:35----------
i feel like my happiness like i get like


---------63:38----------
making other people happy even if i give


---------63:41----------
them 100


---------63:42----------
happiness at least it gives me like a


---------63:44----------
feeling of one percent because i did


---------63:46----------
that like i helped them be happy so that


---------63:48----------
makes


---------63:48----------
me happier but at the end of the day i


---------63:50----------
feel like


---------63:51----------
sometimes maybe that's not enough like


---------63:53----------
you know what i'm saying yeah it's not


---------63:55----------
enough because you know what what needs


---------63:56----------
to happen is that needs to be a two-way


---------63:58----------
street player


---------64:01----------
right so like you should be doing that


---------64:03----------
for them and they should be doing that


---------64:05----------
for you


---------64:07----------
and i think what's what's happened is i


---------64:09----------
don't know if you have people


---------64:10----------
in your life like your mom because like


---------64:12----------
you know it's kind of your mom's job but


---------64:14----------
she goes out of her way to make your


---------64:15----------
life better on a daily basis


---------64:18----------
yeah there's no one like that ever but


---------64:21----------
you know what i'm saying like i don't


---------64:22----------
think


---------64:22----------
i don't think they're my my mother was


---------64:24----------
insane like in that way


---------64:26----------
like and she juggled it like she every


---------64:28----------
single one of her kids felt that way


---------64:30----------
every single one of her friends felt


---------64:31----------
that way it's like


---------64:32----------
it's insane it's crazy like


---------64:36----------
i don't i don't even know how to be like


---------64:38----------
that and i witnessed it for


---------64:40----------
years you know and so it's just like i


---------64:43----------
was just really lucky


---------64:46----------
uh and so it sucks to lose that


---------64:52----------
it does absolutely


---------64:56----------
and i think you may be closer to your


---------64:58----------
mom than you think you are


---------65:00----------
in terms of being able to do that she


---------65:01----------
had a little bit more practice than you


---------65:03----------
do


---------65:04----------
yeah she uh was insane yeah but yeah


---------65:08----------
i don't know sounds like you miss her a


---------65:11----------
lot


---------65:18----------
i don't really know what to say now it's


---------65:21----------
okay


---------65:26----------
i'm just going to be quiet for a second


---------65:29----------
while my brain tries to figure out what


---------65:32----------
i should do


---------65:33----------
we've done it we've broken


---------65:43----------
i'm confused are we


---------65:45----------
[Music]


---------65:48----------
talking about today who knows


---------65:52----------
i don't know how to be happy i think is


---------65:55----------
that what we're doing


---------65:56----------
sure so what do you think how do you be


---------65:59----------
happy


---------66:01----------
i think good side i think


---------66:06----------
i think it's like the forehead answer


---------66:07----------
where it's like oh just accept yourself


---------66:09----------
or head but


---------66:11----------
that's a journey and how does one go


---------66:14----------
about accepting themselves


---------66:16----------
what are a couple steps along that


---------66:18----------
journey


---------66:25----------
i don't i don't know yet um based on


---------66:28----------
what we talked about i feel like


---------66:30----------
maybe stop like uh using my anxiety as a


---------66:34----------
crutch essentially


---------66:37----------
um and hopefully that'll help


---------66:42----------
boost some confidence no matter how


---------66:43----------
stressful that sounds uh yep


---------66:45----------
oh it's absolutely it's gonna be


---------66:47----------
stressful so and


---------66:48----------
let me just clarify so i don't think


---------66:50----------
it's stop using your anxiety i'd say


---------66:52----------
pick a tiny tiny training wheel you've


---------66:55----------
got big training wheels and you have


---------66:56----------
tiny tiny ones


---------66:57----------
yeah so notice you know when you're


---------67:00----------
doing something to alleviate your


---------67:01----------
anxiety and recognize that like


---------67:04----------
ultimately for your anxiety to be gone


---------67:06----------
you can't be alleviating it all the time


---------67:10----------
yeah i'm curious what your thought is on


---------67:13----------
like


---------67:14----------
so for example like social anxiety right


---------67:17----------
so if i like


---------67:18----------
go into a room and this is just based on


---------67:21----------
something


---------67:22----------
a therapist in the past has told me and


---------67:24----------
i'm curious if it works because at the


---------67:26----------
same time i can see it


---------67:28----------
also hindering like being a crutch in


---------67:30----------
some way


---------67:31----------
or kind of doing the opposite of what


---------67:33----------
you've said like so


---------67:34----------
essentially what she told me to do is


---------67:37----------
like if i go into a room


---------67:38----------
you know and i'm anxious that i'm like


---------67:40----------
oh that person hates me like everybody


---------67:42----------
hates me here everybody hates me here or


---------67:43----------
let's say


---------67:44----------
sam some guy named sam sam hates me sam


---------67:47----------
can't understand me sam thinks i'm dumb


---------67:48----------
sam blah blah blah blah all these


---------67:50----------
negative things


---------67:51----------
what she said to do was then go back and


---------67:54----------
write down the thoughts so


---------67:55----------
sam hates me and then write down the


---------67:57----------
reality


---------67:58----------
which is sam has not said that he hates


---------68:01----------
me and then write down


---------68:02----------
like the like what the act the new


---------68:05----------
thought should be which is


---------68:07----------
sam has not said anything that signifies


---------68:10----------
that he hates me so he does not hate me


---------68:12----------
does that is that still valuable or is


---------68:14----------
that just a


---------68:15----------
crutch in that way what do you think


---------68:24----------
i don't know i i i'm scared it's a


---------68:27----------
crutch


---------68:28----------
i don't think it's a crutch but i think


---------68:31----------
that it doesn't work for everyone that's


---------68:33----------
what i would say okay


---------68:34----------
so let's understand like what that


---------68:36----------
practice actually does


---------68:38----------
so the problem with anxiety is that we


---------68:40----------
assume


---------68:41----------
that thoughts are facts yeah


---------68:44----------
right so what this this is a practice


---------68:47----------
that encourages you to recognize


---------68:49----------
that your thoughts are not truth that


---------68:51----------
are just thoughts


---------68:52----------
yeah and in your case i think this is a


---------68:54----------
very important thing to learn


---------68:56----------
because you have a lot of thoughts that


---------68:58----------
come from your conditioning


---------69:00----------
but just because you are conditioned to


---------69:02----------
believe a certain thing doesn't make


---------69:03----------
that thing true


---------69:06----------
like wearing a tank top does not mean


---------69:08----------
anything about you it just means you're


---------69:10----------
wearing a tank top


---------69:11----------
yeah right but like like people in the


---------69:15----------
mormon church


---------69:16----------
may believe like is is in a factual way


---------69:20----------
that wearing a tank top means that you


---------69:23----------
were a bad person


---------69:25----------
yeah and like they're it it's not


---------69:29----------
it's not that absurd of a belief right


---------69:31----------
so like


---------69:32----------
we can judge we judge people based on


---------69:34----------
what they wear all the time like if i


---------69:35----------
walk around like if i go to like


---------69:37----------
uh like a kindergarten and i'm wearing


---------69:40----------
nothing but a speedo


---------69:42----------
like that's not acceptable right so like


---------69:46----------
it's


---------69:46----------
like human beings all the time judge


---------69:48----------
people for the articles of clothing that


---------69:50----------
they wear and that's not necessarily a


---------69:51----------
bad thing


---------69:53----------
also if i like you know go to the


---------69:55----------
hospital in a speedo like that's not


---------69:59----------
honestly anywhere in a speedo anywhere


---------70:04----------
so so like you know it's not it's not


---------70:07----------
necessarily that they're wrong it's just


---------70:09----------
that


---------70:09----------
you know thoughts are not facts and so


---------70:12----------
what that practice does is it helps you


---------70:14----------
recognize that your thoughts are not


---------70:15----------
facts


---------70:17----------
it's not the only way what i seem to try


---------70:20----------
to do


---------70:20----------
is instead of like doing that practice i


---------70:22----------
like i just like have become very


---------70:24----------
confrontational over the years and so


---------70:26----------
now it's just like i'll just approach


---------70:28----------
the person be like


---------70:29----------
are you mad at me do you not like me as


---------70:31----------
like trying to get a


---------70:33----------
an answer and then it's like great i


---------70:35----------
walk away from that conversation


---------70:36----------
thinking


---------70:37----------
okay they said that they are not mad at


---------70:39----------
me and that they do like me


---------70:41----------
but they lied like it's like


---------70:44----------
yep so so we can see that the root of


---------70:47----------
the thought is not


---------70:48----------
fixed by the reassurance all the


---------70:50----------
reassurance does


---------70:52----------
is alleviates the anxiety in the short


---------70:53----------
term that's a training wheel


---------70:56----------
okay right because like all you're doing


---------70:58----------
it's the equivalent of putting on a


---------70:59----------
baseball hat


---------71:00----------
to manage your anxiety of of you know


---------71:03----------
whatever


---------71:04----------
yeah so it's just it's covering it up


---------71:06----------
and that can be exhausting for other


---------71:07----------
people i'm not trying to scare you but


---------71:09----------
sometimes what happens of it is some


---------71:11----------
people need a lot of reassurance and the


---------71:13----------
problem is that when you reassure


---------71:15----------
someone and relate sort of


---------71:16----------
when you reassure someone in a


---------71:17----------
relationship sometimes it can feed their


---------71:20----------
need for reassurance


---------71:21----------
and it's kind of tricky because like


---------71:23----------
sometimes you just they deserve to be


---------71:25----------
you know you deserve some degree of


---------71:26----------
reassurance like it's healthy yeah


---------71:28----------
so but it also is too much like i know


---------71:30----------
it's too much personally like i know i


---------71:32----------
need reassurance way too much and i


---------71:34----------
don't


---------71:34----------
i want to know how to stop that because


---------71:36----------
it's so obnoxious


---------71:37----------
here's how you stop it where do you get


---------71:39----------
the idea in the first place that they


---------71:41----------
hate you


---------71:43----------
anxiety yeah where does that come from


---------71:47----------
so like when did he not liking myself


---------71:50----------
is that like a canned answer that's


---------71:52----------
actually what you believe no i


---------71:54----------
i think i think it's like it's like oh


---------71:56----------
since i don't like myself why would


---------71:58----------
anybody else like me


---------72:00----------
good so why don't you like yourself


---------72:04----------
i don't know okay so so now this


---------72:08----------
comes back to confidence right


---------72:11----------
right so like you're you're right blair


---------72:13----------
that like in order to


---------72:15----------
rip this anxiety out root and stem


---------72:18----------
and it makes sense like if you don't see


---------72:20----------
any value in yourself how on earth


---------72:23----------
would other people see value in you like


---------72:25----------
it's not illogical it's not dumb in fact


---------72:27----------
it's the exact opposite


---------72:30----------
right it makes perfect sense but then


---------72:32----------
the question becomes it comes


---------72:33----------
back to like why don't you see value in


---------72:35----------
yourself like blair are you a good


---------72:36----------
person


---------72:38----------
yes do you believe that


---------72:42----------
yeah yes i've never done like yeah i'm


---------72:44----------
not a bad person


---------72:45----------
okay i've done lots of good things


---------72:48----------
do you have value as a human being


---------72:57----------
you know like i feel like anything i do


---------72:59----------
anybody else could do


---------73:01----------
okay so see there we go so are you a


---------73:03----------
good person yes


---------73:06----------
are you a valuable person so there you


---------73:08----------
go again devaluing yourself


---------73:11----------
yeah because i don't think anything that


---------73:13----------
anything you could do could be done by


---------73:15----------
anyone else i don't believe that it


---------73:18----------
sounds to me


---------73:18----------
like you're a specific i think you are


---------73:21----------
probably one of the best people in the


---------73:23----------
world


---------73:24----------
to bake a cake


---------73:27----------
and put a joke on top


---------73:31----------
okay right so like i think that some


---------73:33----------
people can't do what you do


---------73:34----------
but there you go devaluing yourself and


---------73:37----------
now we get to the most difficult


---------73:38----------
question


---------73:39----------
are you attractive no


---------73:43----------
right so like that's kind of interesting


---------73:44----------
so like are you a good person sure


---------73:49----------
are you do you have value no and are you


---------73:51----------
i mean maybe


---------73:53----------
and then are you attractive and you say


---------73:56----------
no


---------73:58----------
now somewhere in there


---------74:01----------
you have certain perceptions about who


---------74:03----------
you are as a person


---------74:05----------
and i don't know where those were born


---------74:06----------
but i think you've got to figure those


---------74:08----------
out


---------74:09----------
right so like how long have you been


---------74:13----------
you know what when were you taught


---------74:16----------
that your value yeah so i actually i i


---------74:20----------
mean i can even answer this for you so i


---------74:22----------
think like we know in terms of like your


---------74:23----------
value as another person


---------74:25----------
the only things that you value about


---------74:27----------
yourself or when you have clear


---------74:29----------
overwhelming evidence that you're


---------74:32----------
superior to others


---------74:33----------
and that's why you compare that's why


---------74:36----------
you're perfectionistic


---------74:38----------
right so like the reason you're


---------74:39----------
perfectionistic it's not because you're


---------74:40----------
like messed up in some way it's because


---------74:42----------
the only way that you can convince


---------74:45----------
yourself


---------74:46----------
that you have value is if you're if if


---------74:49----------
you're at the top of your class


---------74:51----------
and so in a weird way that's a training


---------74:53----------
wheel for your lack of self-worth


---------74:55----------
because if you can prove to everyone


---------74:57----------
else and yourself


---------74:59----------
you're like look at this medal i have


---------75:01----------
see how gold it is


---------75:02----------
then i'm a good person yeah so


---------75:05----------
where did you get like when did this


---------75:07----------
this idea that you have to be a gold


---------75:09----------
medalist


---------75:10----------
to have value like where did you learn


---------75:12----------
that like who taught you that


---------75:15----------
i don't it's what's weird because like i


---------75:17----------
said like my my mother was very like


---------75:19----------
supportive no matter what so i don't


---------75:21----------
know where it came from i think it might


---------75:23----------
have


---------75:23----------
come like internally maybe because like


---------75:27----------
like for example like my brother was


---------75:29----------
like varsity basketball played


---------75:31----------
basketball in college my other brother


---------75:33----------
was varsity basketball played basketball


---------75:34----------
college my sister was varsity volleyball


---------75:37----------
played volleyball in college i got cut


---------75:38----------
from the volleyball team


---------75:40----------
there it is i was bad at everything like


---------75:43----------
and what did your dad say when you got


---------75:44----------
cut from the volleyball team


---------75:46----------
he was nice like he you know he like he


---------75:49----------
took me and got ice cream but it's like


---------75:51----------
it


---------75:52----------
i think it was just like a


---------75:53----------
self-comparison thing like always trying


---------75:55----------
to catch up with everyone else


---------75:56----------
cause i was just i'm just i'm just bad


---------75:58----------
at like i'm just not


---------76:00----------
good at those things so it's just like i


---------76:03----------
think


---------76:03----------
i i don't know where it came from


---------76:05----------
exactly because my dad was even


---------76:06----------
supportive if i


---------76:07----------
if i didn't i think it was more just


---------76:09----------
like i put it on myself


---------76:10----------
because i just wanted to fit in with my


---------76:12----------
own family because it's like i didn't


---------76:13----------
fit in


---------76:14----------
like they're all very religious and i


---------76:15----------
didn't fit in that way so it's my way to


---------76:18----------
fit in was trying to be good at sports


---------76:19----------
but i was awful at sports


---------76:21----------
and so maybe it's that like no one put


---------76:23----------
pressure on me besides myself


---------76:26----------
i think in that context


---------76:30----------
so that makes sense and yet i'm gonna


---------76:32----------
disagree because i think


---------76:34----------
i think if you feel like you don't fit


---------76:36----------
in in your family


---------76:37----------
like that's not just something that the


---------76:40----------
default is that kids feel like they fit


---------76:42----------
in


---------76:44----------
oh right okay i think i know why


---------76:48----------
i think i know i it's very it's very


---------76:52----------
heavy chat i don't want you to get like


---------76:55----------
you know


---------76:56----------
i don't want anyone to feel a certain


---------76:57----------
way but


---------76:59----------
i actually think i know why and i've


---------77:00----------
never like tied this together until


---------77:02----------
literally this moment um but


---------77:05----------
and i've said this on my chat before so


---------77:07----------
it's like it's fine as it


---------77:08----------
as a kid i was um


---------77:12----------
sexually molested by a neighbor and


---------77:16----------
um and it made me feel like


---------77:19----------
i would never fit in because as a mormon


---------77:21----------
you have to be perfect and you have to


---------77:22----------
be pure and i was taken advantage of and


---------77:24----------
what was i supposed to do


---------77:26----------
so maybe it's that like because that i


---------77:28----------
remember just never


---------77:29----------
like you know like oh now i have this


---------77:33----------
big secret that i can't tell anyone my


---------77:34----------
family because i don't want anyone to


---------77:36----------
get in trouble because he told me that i


---------77:37----------
couldn't tell anybody or i'd get in


---------77:39----------
trouble


---------77:40----------
and so it could just be that maybe um


---------77:46----------
and so yeah so i was imperfect from like


---------77:49----------
age


---------77:50----------
seven and so like how am i supposed to


---------77:52----------
fit in with everyone else


---------77:54----------
right so like let me ask you something


---------77:57----------
blaire


---------77:58----------
are you imperfect yeah but i think


---------78:01----------
everyone is


---------78:03----------
are you more imperfect than other people


---------78:07----------
no you sure


---------78:11----------
yes so that's confusing to me


---------78:14----------
because this whole time what you've been


---------78:17----------
telling us is the opposite


---------78:19----------
yeah well no because i think i think


---------78:22----------
perfection and value are different is


---------78:25----------
that weird


---------78:26----------
sure yeah so so so no no it's not weird


---------78:30----------
so i think this is good


---------78:31----------
so like so now let's let me just tell


---------78:34----------
you a couple of other things okay so


---------78:36----------
first of all


---------78:37----------
in a sense not surprising so like just


---------78:40----------
statistically right so if you look at


---------78:42----------
women or just people who tend to have a


---------78:45----------
low sense of self-worth


---------78:47----------
have eating disorders and anxiety


---------78:51----------
and we kind of talked about trauma right


---------78:53----------
a little while ago


---------78:56----------
oftentimes there is something like


---------78:58----------
sexual physical or emotional abuse at a


---------79:01----------
very young age


---------79:02----------
yeah and that happens so like eating


---------79:05----------
disorders as well or about


---------79:06----------
controlling things that are out of your


---------79:08----------
control


---------79:10----------
yeah and and what i'm hearing from you


---------79:12----------
like is like basically the threat of


---------79:14----------
this entire conversation


---------79:16----------
is that you on the inside are not good


---------79:18----------
enough


---------79:20----------
yeah but i also i feel like it's a it's


---------79:23----------
a consistent problem and so that's why


---------79:24----------
it's like i feel like it just requires


---------79:26----------
like


---------79:26----------
it requires a lot of self-reflection


---------79:28----------
slash i feel like that's why i've


---------79:29----------
accepted it


---------79:31----------
because like no matter what i do it's


---------79:33----------
like a reoccurring theme


---------79:35----------
in my life like i i dated someone who


---------79:38----------
was


---------79:38----------
physically violent with me and i


---------79:41----------
i did another person that constantly


---------79:43----------
told me i wasn't good enough for them so


---------79:44----------
it's just like it's just like this


---------79:46----------
this never-ending cycle it seems and i


---------79:48----------
don't i don't


---------79:49----------
know if i like put myself in those


---------79:51----------
situations or how


---------79:52----------
like why it always seems to happen


---------79:56----------
yeah so we can talk about that too so


---------79:59----------
here's the crazy thing


---------80:00----------
i think that i know this is i'm not


---------80:02----------
blaming you for this but i've seen this


---------80:03----------
pattern over and over again it's


---------80:05----------
something that's actually well described


---------80:06----------
as something called the repetition


---------80:08----------
compulsion


---------80:09----------
so something about so i think we should


---------80:12----------
look at how you


---------80:13----------
select people that you


---------80:16----------
go out with and my guess


---------80:20----------
maybe this is a conversation for a


---------80:21----------
different day because there's a whole


---------80:22----------
other can of worms


---------80:24----------
there are some people who treat you with


---------80:27----------
more value than you believe you deserve


---------80:29----------
and that you actually pull away from


---------80:31----------
them


---------80:34----------
and you gravitate towards people that


---------80:37----------
make you feel the way that you feel


---------80:40----------
about yourself


---------80:42----------
because that makes sense


---------80:45----------
right and like when you walk in and


---------80:47----------
everyone's like oh hey


---------80:48----------
like blair's here awesome blair and


---------80:51----------
and then you're like i'm confused i


---------80:53----------
forgot my cupcakes and they're like


---------80:54----------
that's no problem


---------80:55----------
and that's confusing for you


---------80:58----------
yeah and then like what makes more sense


---------81:01----------
to you is like the group of people and


---------81:03----------
that makes you uncomfortable


---------81:04----------
and then the next day you go to a party


---------81:06----------
and then they're like oh hey blair's


---------81:08----------
here and you're like i forgot my


---------81:09----------
cupcakes and they're like well


---------81:10----------
 go get it go back home and get them


---------81:13----------
and then you're like oh


---------81:14----------
okay fine and oddly enough you're more


---------81:16----------
comfortable with the second group than


---------81:18----------
the with the first group


---------81:20----------
because they treat you the way that you


---------81:23----------
believe


---------81:24----------
you deserve to be treated yeah i don't


---------81:28----------
i don't know it's it's it's so strange


---------81:30----------
because i feel like every single person


---------81:32----------
that i've ever dated has been so


---------81:33----------
drastically different like the first guy


---------81:36----------
it was kind of like


---------81:38----------
he was he was crazy he was very insane


---------81:40----------
and that one makes sense but then like


---------81:42----------
and that was the that was like the


---------81:44----------
physically abusive guy and then the next


---------81:45----------
guy


---------81:46----------
was very very sweet but would constantly


---------81:49----------
like when i would say like you know like


---------81:52----------
what are your thoughts on me they'd be


---------81:54----------
like oh well you don't check all my


---------81:55----------
boxes


---------81:56----------
like you're like uh you know you're


---------81:58----------
you're yeah


---------81:59----------
they don't sound that different to me


---------82:02----------
that's so weird because they're like


---------82:03----------
very different people but like


---------82:05----------
but it is true i get confused when


---------82:07----------
people are nice to me like


---------82:08----------
i'll be like well why did you do this


---------82:10----------
yeah so here's here's the here's the


---------82:12----------
tricky thing


---------82:13----------
so when there is someone who you could


---------82:15----------
prospectively date


---------82:16----------
and they're nice to you do you pull away


---------82:19----------
from them


---------82:20----------
or yes i guess i guess for like many


---------82:23----------
months but now i'm in a situation where


---------82:25----------
i feel like


---------82:26----------
well like i'm with someone that is very


---------82:27----------
nice to me good


---------82:29----------
now be careful because do they so like


---------82:32----------
like that's the weird thing right it's


---------82:33----------
like


---------82:33----------
like it's strange but you do pull away


---------82:35----------
from them because that's what you were


---------82:36----------
taught it's kind of like you know if i


---------82:40----------
i can't come up with a good analogy but


---------82:42----------
like you know i'm i'm gonna


---------82:43----------
gravitate towards people who share my


---------82:46----------
view because it can be really confusing


---------82:48----------
you know if i walk down the street and


---------82:50----------
everyone thinks that like i'm a dog


---------82:52----------
like i'm not it's hard for me to relate


---------82:54----------
to those people because i don't think


---------82:56----------
i'm a dog


---------82:57----------
but i'm going to relate to the people


---------82:59----------
it's easy it's more comfortable for me


---------83:01----------
to be with what i know


---------83:03----------
yeah i guess it does make me more


---------83:04----------
anxious because it's like well then what


---------83:06----------
why would you be with me if you're so


---------83:08----------
nice like exactly right


---------83:10----------
and so then that those kinds of thoughts


---------83:12----------
when they get out of hand can actually


---------83:14----------
torpedo the relationship


---------83:16----------
yes very much so because and there we


---------83:19----------
have it


---------83:20----------
so we can dig into this in more detail


---------83:22----------
if you want but


---------83:25----------
i think maybe enough for today what do


---------83:27----------
you think


---------83:27----------
[Laughter]


---------83:32----------
how are you feeling uh i feel fine


---------83:36----------
i feel like


---------83:40----------
you know there's there's no abrupt


---------83:42----------
answer


---------83:43----------
um but i feel like so i mean my biggest


---------83:46----------
thing


---------83:46----------
my biggest question i guess is what


---------83:49----------
what do i do instead of looking for that


---------83:51----------
reassurance like what do i do instead of


---------83:53----------
saying oh do you like me


---------83:54----------
are you do you hate me are you sure you


---------83:56----------
don't hate me like what do i do to


---------83:58----------
stop that so the first thing you've got


---------84:00----------
to do is stop feeding it


---------84:02----------
okay so like this is where like you're


---------84:04----------
gonna have an impulse


---------84:06----------
right and and like there are times where


---------84:08----------
you're gonna give in to the impulse


---------84:10----------
and they're gonna be times where you


---------84:11----------
resist the impulse just do so with


---------84:14----------
awareness


---------84:15----------
just say like oh hey i'm feeling like


---------84:17----------
this person really dislikes me right now


---------84:20----------
and it would really make me feel better


---------84:23----------
if i asked them and got some reassurance


---------84:26----------
and then decide


---------84:27----------
can i tolerate this feeling of anxiety


---------84:29----------
right now


---------84:30----------
or is it too much if i it can i if it's


---------84:33----------
almost like


---------84:34----------
like i call it urge surfing so urges


---------84:38----------
can be like surfed they don't last


---------84:40----------
forever


---------84:41----------
and over time like it'll like so here's


---------84:43----------
like the anxiety like


---------84:45----------
goes up and then it peaks and then even


---------84:47----------
if you do nothing about it it's gonna go


---------84:49----------
down


---------84:50----------
you're not gonna be anxious for the rest


---------84:51----------
of your life which is not how yes


---------84:53----------
they come and they go so you figure out


---------84:55----------
what you can serve


---------84:56----------
like what can you manage what can you


---------84:58----------
wait until like the tide rolls out again


---------85:00----------
and then you're like in a good space and


---------85:03----------
then the other thing that you do is you


---------85:04----------
watch


---------85:06----------
as as you go and you reassure yourself i


---------85:10----------
want you to hold on to a small


---------85:12----------
part of blair who's watching and saying


---------85:14----------
okay here's my anxiety


---------85:15----------
my anxiety is an 80 out of 100. i'm


---------85:17----------
going to walk up to him i'm going to ask


---------85:19----------
him a question


---------85:20----------
and i'm going to listen to the words and


---------85:21----------
i'm going to watch don't even pay


---------85:22----------
attention to the words


---------85:23----------
watch what happens in your anxiety and


---------85:25----------
he says yeah


---------85:26----------
no you're you're awesome i like you a


---------85:28----------
lot and then you're like that's


---------85:29----------
weird it went from an 80 to a 90.


---------85:31----------
because it doesn't go down right you


---------85:33----------
have to ask again you have to ask again


---------85:35----------
and then the fourth time you asked are


---------85:36----------
you sure and then after four or five


---------85:39----------
times then it's like oh it went from a


---------85:40----------
95 like back down to 70 and you're like


---------85:42----------
hold on


---------85:44----------
i'm still feeling kind of anxious and


---------85:45----------
not even that much better than before


---------85:47----------
and as you start to like reflect and


---------85:49----------
understand like how to play this game


---------85:51----------
that is blair's life you'll start to get


---------85:53----------
control over it


---------85:56----------
okay and like literally like here's


---------86:00----------
another just very simple example


---------86:02----------
so you want to meditate


---------86:06----------
yeah we can meditate do you meditate you


---------86:08----------
know how to meditate i used to a lot


---------86:10----------
i do a lot okay so i don't much anymore


---------86:13----------
i'm gonna be can i be a little bit


---------86:16----------
can i challenge you yes okay


---------86:19----------
so sit up straight back straight


---------86:23----------
next straight okay


---------86:26----------
all right eyes closed okay


---------86:30----------
so it's gonna be hard okay you gotta let


---------86:32----------
me know if it's too much okay i'm gonna


---------86:34----------
troll you just a tiny amount


---------86:36----------
okay so think about taking off your hat


---------86:41----------
okay how do you feel right there it is


---------86:45----------
good i'm not actually gonna ask you to


---------86:47----------
take off your hats and okay cool


---------86:50----------
but i i want you to feel that feeling


---------86:52----------
right so like all it takes is a thought


---------86:54----------
and then what do you feel


---------86:56----------
uh uncomfortable okay what does that


---------86:58----------
feel like


---------87:02----------
um


---------87:05----------
uh it feels like like


---------87:09----------
you know like it's hard to describe it


---------87:12----------
feels like uh


---------87:14----------
i instantly like i can't my like i can't


---------87:16----------
think straight


---------87:18----------
um like my chest is tight good so like


---------87:20----------
watch that so


---------87:21----------
hold on to a tiny piece of blair and


---------87:24----------
recognize that like


---------87:26----------
you're in danger mode right because like


---------87:28----------
until i told you i'm not gonna ask you


---------87:30----------
to take it off


---------87:31----------
i can imagine you're like oh is he


---------87:32----------
gonna ask me to take it off yeah


---------87:34----------
right so like there's all of that


---------87:35----------
anxiety so sit with that for a second


---------87:37----------
that chest tightness


---------87:38----------
and now breathe into it so tilt your


---------87:40----------
head up a little bit


---------87:42----------
good there we go now breathe in


---------87:46----------
feel that expansion in your chest and


---------87:49----------
then


---------87:50----------
let the tightness pull your chest back


---------87:53----------
in now just breathe out


---------87:54----------
let your chest recoil


---------87:59----------
now notice what's happening to the


---------88:01----------
anxiety it's probably there


---------88:03----------
you still feel it is your mind stopping


---------88:05----------
to function


---------88:07----------
it's more in my mind that makes sense


---------88:10----------
more in your mind as opposed to that's


---------88:13----------
like my like my obsessive thinking like


---------88:15----------
it just


---------88:16----------
goes and goes and goes okay good so i


---------88:18----------
want you to notice that it's going


---------88:21----------
and now return to your breath so breathe


---------88:23----------
in


---------88:25----------
and then exhale very slowly


---------88:35----------
so continue to breathe keep one eye on


---------88:39----------
the mind


---------88:42----------
and with the other eye the analogy is


---------88:45----------
going to fall apart


---------88:46----------
i want you to listen to the sound of


---------88:49----------
your exhalation


---------88:54----------
okay i got it


---------89:05----------
are you able to hear it


---------89:08----------
okay deep breath in


---------89:12----------
and now what i want you to do


---------89:18----------
try to increase the sound of the


---------89:21----------
exhalation by contracting your throat i


---------89:25----------
know it sounds weird


---------89:26----------
so just do whatever you can to make the


---------89:29----------
sound of exhalation larger


---------89:37----------
are you able to adjust it at all


---------89:41----------
like an ujjayi breath is that it oh


---------89:44----------
next level


---------89:46----------
yeah that's where we're going how the


---------89:49----------
 do you know that


---------89:53----------
therapy and yoga for years yes


---------89:56----------
we're moving towards so do you know how


---------89:57----------
to do ujjayi pranayam


---------89:59----------
yeah okay so do with jay pranayama


---------90:06----------
is that ujjayi wrath


---------90:12----------
slow playing your yoga expertise


---------90:17----------
so what's happening in your mind as you


---------90:20----------
do ujjayi breath


---------90:22----------
it's more focused on the breath than it


---------90:24----------
is the thoughts


---------90:26----------
so what's happening to the thoughts is


---------90:28----------
the result they're quieting


---------90:30----------
okay what happened to that anxiety about


---------90:33----------
you taking your hat off


---------90:36----------
it went quiet


---------90:40----------
yeah i know it's still in my brain but


---------90:41----------
it was


---------90:43----------
it's went back in its box for right now


---------90:45----------
right so


---------90:46----------
close your eyes and now we're going to


---------90:50----------
bring it out


---------90:52----------
no absolutely nope


---------90:55----------
sorry you you screwed yourself okay


---------90:58----------
blair when you mentioned ujjayi that's


---------91:00----------
when i decided to push you even


---------91:02----------
further okay okay so think about taking


---------91:05----------
off your hat again


---------91:09----------
tell it open up the box and say come on


---------91:12----------
out buddy


---------91:13----------
it's it's there yeah good there it is


---------91:16----------
the second like that's the thing is no


---------91:17----------
matter how much i


---------91:18----------
seem to quiet it or comment it takes


---------91:21----------
like a snap of a second or a snap of a


---------91:23----------
comment or a snap of a thing to


---------91:24----------
bring it all back out there there you go


---------91:27----------
okay


---------91:28----------
so now yeah see the discomfort is there


---------91:30----------
now return to a j


---------91:33----------
right so for those of you who don't know


---------91:35----------
so like oj breath is


---------91:37----------
contracting your throat so constricting


---------91:41----------
your throat so that


---------91:42----------
the sound of the breath increases and


---------91:44----------
almost sounds like a whistling


---------91:47----------
you can also raise your soft mallet if


---------91:49----------
you know what that sounds like or what


---------91:56----------
that


---------92:08----------
is it dwindling at all


---------92:13----------
yeah okay so now we're gonna do the


---------92:16----------
third version okay


---------92:18----------
so now we're gonna let it out again and


---------92:22----------
this time we're gonna do something


---------92:23----------
really tricky


---------92:25----------
we're gonna let it be there and just


---------92:28----------
watch it


---------92:29----------
now we know that we can put it back in


---------92:31----------
the box


---------92:33----------
so once we learn how to put it back in


---------92:35----------
the box i know i can see it's hard for


---------92:37----------
you


---------92:37----------
good yeah so we're not going to put it


---------92:41----------
back in the box


---------92:42----------
okay because now have faith in yourself


---------92:46----------
that you can make it go away


---------92:47----------
you can control it but let it out now


---------92:50----------
let it go


---------92:55----------
all of those thoughts are going to come


---------92:56----------
roaring back


---------93:01----------
right all of these ideas of you being


---------93:03----------
ugly and pure


---------93:04----------
and all of this like see it it's so


---------93:07----------
huge


---------93:08----------
it's a tornado of negativity


---------93:13----------
and it's there and it's awful


---------93:17----------
and blair is there too


---------93:21----------
you're still there the funny person who


---------93:24----------
makes cupcakes


---------93:30----------
and can both of them exist at the same


---------93:32----------
time


---------93:38----------
what's that like


---------93:42----------
feels like normal i guess okay


---------93:47----------
it is so if it feels normal does that


---------93:50----------
mean that this is what you're usually


---------93:51----------
like


---------93:52----------
this is your default state which is that


---------93:54----------
your anxieties are present okay


---------93:56----------
good yeah it always feels like have like


---------93:58----------
half of me is perpetually stressed about


---------94:00----------
something always


---------94:02----------
good so so so just notice that and and


---------94:05----------
recognize that you can coexist there


---------94:07----------
in a sense it sounds like it's normal


---------94:09----------
for you which sounds awful


---------94:10----------
but at the same time i know this sounds


---------94:12----------
bizarre


---------94:13----------
blair but i think that you started the


---------94:15----------
process of rewiring your neurons


---------94:18----------
and have changed some of the


---------94:19----------
automaticity of your thoughts


---------94:22----------
even over the last five minutes


---------94:27----------
because it's weird like you can do this


---------94:31----------
right so the first thing is that you


---------94:33----------
learn how to put it back in the box


---------94:34----------
and secondly you don't even need to put


---------94:36----------
it back in the box


---------94:40----------
yeah but how do i get rid of it you


---------94:44----------
don't


---------94:46----------
i mean you can but the way that you get


---------94:49----------
rid of it is by not trying to get rid of


---------94:51----------
it


---------94:55----------
so all you have to do is stop feeding it


---------94:58----------
and it'll wither away


---------95:00----------
oh it's like the wolf the the wolf thing


---------95:03----------
yeah


---------95:05----------
exactly okay right so at some point you


---------95:08----------
know i don't know when you put on your


---------95:09----------
hat


---------95:10----------
but i would say in private


---------95:14----------
you know consider taking off your hat


---------95:18----------
consider not wearing a hat with


---------95:19----------
particular people and notices those


---------95:21----------
thoughts come up


---------95:23----------
and recognize that that's the wolf


---------95:25----------
scratching at the door wanting to be fed


---------95:27----------
yeah


---------95:28----------
and the more you feed it the bigger it


---------95:30----------
grows in the hungrier it gets


---------95:32----------
so you can reverse that cycle in tiny


---------95:35----------
tiny tiny ways


---------95:40----------
right also work with a therapist right


---------95:44----------
right and there's a lot of stuff about


---------95:46----------
purity and relationships and stuff and


---------95:48----------
we're just getting started but


---------95:49----------
yeah okay how do you feel


---------95:54----------
good it feels like a good refresher


---------95:58----------
like a good reminder a good um


---------96:04----------
a good like reminder of like which


---------96:08----------
path i should be taking versus how i


---------96:11----------
have been dealing with it even though i


---------96:12----------
know better like i know i know better


---------96:14----------
i know i know these things that you just


---------96:16----------
told me


---------96:18----------
yes but i have gotten lazy


---------96:21----------
i think yeah so that too you've got to


---------96:23----------
be a little bit forgiving towards


---------96:25----------
yourself


---------96:26----------
yeah right so knowing what to do is not


---------96:28----------
the hard part


---------96:30----------
like the other thing is you're smart so


---------96:32----------
you're gonna know what to do pretty


---------96:33----------
easily


---------96:34----------
it's the actually like you know like i i


---------96:36----------
mean so my wife


---------96:38----------
has a joke that i can i collect exercise


---------96:40----------
equipment


---------96:42----------
uh-huh and and what is a collection it's


---------96:44----------
a bunch of that you never use right


---------96:46----------
like a stamp collection like you never


---------96:47----------
use the stamps


---------96:48----------
so i collect exercise like i know that i


---------96:50----------
should exercise actually exercising is


---------96:51----------
the hard part


---------96:52----------
yeah so cut yourself some slack and and


---------96:55----------
do what you can


---------96:56----------
and i i think i think you can be free of


---------96:58----------
this splitter i really do it'll take


---------96:59----------
some time


---------97:00----------
and we'll probably talk in years okay to


---------97:03----------
be honest


---------97:04----------
yeah in your case but you can be free of


---------97:06----------
it absolutely


---------97:08----------
and good luck with the full-time


---------97:10----------
streaming yeah


---------97:13----------
yeah yeah that's it we'll see what


---------97:16----------
happens


---------97:17----------
