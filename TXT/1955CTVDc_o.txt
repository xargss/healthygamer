---------09:48----------
I'm having trouble keeping up with


---------09:51----------
what's happening okay okay let me just


---------10:08----------
try to recap okay so let's talk about


---------10:10----------
meditation for a second sorry about the


---------10:12----------
porn addiction comment someone was like


---------10:13----------
I've been getting a lot of questions


---------10:15----------
recently about porn addiction so let's


---------10:18----------
talk about this so number one just feel


---------10:22----------
what you're feeling crap I can't I'm


---------10:25----------
watching some of my students the


---------10:27----------
dreadful last time you good thinking you


---------10:30----------
think okay yeah so derpy det David was


---------10:33----------
saying that he's been watching the


---------10:34----------
stream and reckful and it's close to


---------10:36----------
home it's been helpful fantastic that's


---------10:38----------
what we're here for


---------10:39----------
we're here to help let's talk about


---------10:41----------
meditation for a second


---------10:43----------
blurry stopping blur okay so remember


---------10:48----------
the goal of when you meditate don't I


---------10:50----------
offer certain directions that you can go


---------10:53----------
in but you don't have to necessarily go


---------10:57----------
in those directions so for some people


---------11:00----------
I'm trying to like accelerate things by


---------11:03----------
suggesting things and if you feel


---------11:05----------
something great if you don't feel


---------11:08----------
something that's okay too


---------11:09----------
we're gonna find a technique for you at


---------11:11----------
some point we're gonna find techniques


---------11:13----------
for everyone that's the goal the next


---------11:16----------
thing is I have homework for y'all so if


---------11:18----------
you guys like this technique which is


---------11:19----------
essentially noticing where within your


---------11:21----------
body that the temperature of the breath


---------11:23----------
goes that's the summation of the


---------11:25----------
technique feel the temperature feel


---------11:27----------
where it goes I know it's out of focus I


---------11:28----------
don't know what to do about this thing


---------11:29----------
there we go


---------11:30----------
it's that better okay nope it's like


---------11:32----------
it's only in focus over here for some


---------11:34----------
reason all right so now what I want you


---------11:38----------
guys to do in terms of homework is do


---------11:40----------
this practice and see where within your


---------11:44----------
body do this practice for a week see


---------11:48----------
where within your body that you can feel


---------11:51----------
the temperature change okay and then I'm


---------11:54----------
gonna ask you guys some questions about


---------11:56----------
it


---------11:57----------
because some of its could be weird do it


---------12:01----------
every day every day for one week do it


---------12:05----------
for like five minutes see where the


---------12:08----------
temperature goes so the way that you do


---------12:11----------
that is you pick a spot like you may


---------12:14----------
have felt it initially just at the tip


---------12:15----------
of your nose so you feel where do you


---------12:17----------
feel it and then you move a little bit


---------12:18----------
further and move a little bit further


---------12:19----------
move a little bit lower move a little


---------12:21----------
bit lower move a little bit lower move a


---------12:22----------
little bit lower and then you sense


---------12:29----------
right so you you put the attention of


---------12:31----------
your mind on a particular spot and you


---------12:33----------
see what you can feel there and then


---------12:38----------
don't let your mind get in the way if


---------12:41----------
Alice is watching Alice should really do


---------12:43----------
this technique and not let his mind get


---------12:45----------
in the way because we're gonna teach LS


---------12:47----------
how to step outside of his mind and if


---------12:50----------
his mind gets in the way he'll fail if


---------12:52----------
he doesn't his if he doesn't let his


---------12:54----------
mind get in the way he will succeed and


---------12:57----------
if he succeeds we will know based on his


---------13:00----------
answer if he fails we will see based on


---------13:06----------
his answer oh my I was feeling the


---------13:08----------
coldness near my eyebrow but I stopped


---------13:10----------
and wanted to do it and my focus way


---------13:12----------
back crap I can't read all that okay all


---------13:16----------
right back and forth during the middle


---------13:20----------
of it and the coldness went down the


---------13:22----------
back to the middle of my nose instead


---------13:25----------
yeah so that's great whatever happened


---------13:27----------
is fine just keep doing it okay just


---------13:31----------
keep doing it yeah and so also you guys


---------13:34----------
I don't know you all should check out


---------13:36----------
Alice a stream


---------13:36----------
apparently he's really good at soloqueue


---------13:38----------
and coaches people and yeah so closing


---------13:43----------
thoughts questions let me just check our


---------13:45----------
question log real quick and see if


---------13:46----------
there's anything that


---------13:49----------
okay so here's a question is it possible


---------13:52----------
to grow up without a Dharma the answer


---------13:54----------
is absolutely yes most people grow up


---------13:55----------
without a Parma so you have a Dharma


---------13:59----------
growing up to like usually be a student


---------14:01----------
or be a child or something like that so


---------14:03----------
I think the first stage of your life the


---------14:05----------
first 25 years of your life should be


---------14:07----------
spent primarily on learning that doesn't


---------14:10----------
mean that you're like a formal student


---------14:11----------
doesn't mean that you don't have a job


---------14:13----------
it means that you should be learning


---------14:14----------
about yourself so I think in a weird way


---------14:16----------
if you are coming and watching the


---------14:18----------
stream that is actually fulfilling your


---------14:20----------
autonomy because you're learning about


---------14:21----------
yourself that's why it feels good a lot


---------14:24----------
of you guys think about this for a


---------14:25----------
second people stay up till like 5:00


---------14:26----------
a.m. to watch the stream why is that


---------14:28----------
that sucks it's because you're doing it


---------14:31----------
for your Dharma right so like you're


---------14:35----------
doing it to better yourself you're doing


---------14:37----------
it to become the person that you need to


---------14:38----------
be which is like great because that's


---------14:41----------
your tournament right now


---------14:44----------
so that's awesome okay where do you


---------14:51----------
start if you're depressed but you have


---------14:52----------
no reason for it nothing went wrong in


---------14:54----------
your life how do you address that


---------14:54----------
beautiful that's internal mine okay so


---------14:59----------
from a clinical perspective sometimes


---------15:01----------
people have a biological depression


---------15:03----------
which means what I mean by that is that


---------15:04----------
they don't have any triggering event


---------15:06----------
they just have some neuro chemistry


---------15:08----------
thing where they're like their life is


---------15:09----------
fantastic and they start to get


---------15:13----------
depressed for no reason whatsoever so


---------15:14----------
that happens that's true major


---------15:16----------
depressive disorder has to do with the


---------15:18----------
chemical imbalance maybe has to do with


---------15:20----------
low thyroid hormone as someone mentioned


---------15:21----------
you should go see a doctor if that


---------15:23----------
happened to you


---------15:24----------
but there is a difference between


---------15:27----------
clinical depression and unhappiness and


---------15:29----------
if everything is going well in your life


---------15:32----------
and you still feel sad and it's not


---------15:34----------
episodic and you're just unhappy because


---------15:36----------
you feel even though you're checking all


---------15:38----------
the boxes you feel empty on the inside


---------15:41----------
that is a lack of Dharma


---------15:43----------
doesn't mean that you can't be diagnosed


---------15:46----------
with depression doesn't mean that you


---------15:47----------
shouldn't you should probably just get


---------15:48----------
evaluated for depression by a clinician


---------15:51----------
but it also means that there's a


---------15:53----------
difference between depression and


---------15:54----------
unhappiness and if you're unhappy if


---------15:56----------
you're feeling unfulfilled finding your


---------15:58----------
tarma is gonna do it for you


---------16:01----------
so it doesn't always mean that


---------16:03----------
depression comes from something


---------16:04----------
traumatic or something like that that's


---------16:06----------
not always the case okay


---------16:14----------
ah this is great I feel like my Dharma


---------16:17----------
is to create something but I don't know


---------16:19----------
what it is yet what do I do to start


---------16:21----------
looking for something specific beautiful


---------16:22----------
great question so you guys are know like


---------16:27----------
in like heroes stories and like RPGs and


---------16:30----------
stuff like people train really hard and


---------16:32----------
then the final boss like then the cat


---------16:34----------
catastrophe sort of happens like like


---------16:36----------
you can think about Harry Potter or


---------16:37----------
something right there like learning how


---------16:39----------
to be Wizards and then


---------16:43----------
like that Voldemort shows up there's the


---------16:46----------
training arc yeah so what you guys need


---------16:49----------
to understand is somebody all maybe in


---------16:50----------
your training arc and that's what you


---------16:52----------
should do so I'll give you guys a very


---------16:53----------
like simple example from my own life so


---------16:57----------
one day when I decided I was going to


---------16:58----------
become a psychiatrist


---------17:00----------
the first thing that actually happened


---------17:02----------
was panic because I realized that like


---------17:05----------
his medical school was ending like I


---------17:07----------
wouldn't get trained anymore in like


---------17:10----------
real medicine I was gonna be like


---------17:12----------
talking to people about their feelings I


---------17:14----------
wasn't gonna know how to fix heart


---------17:15----------
attacks like I was like you know you


---------17:17----------
know you deal with heart attacks and


---------17:18----------
stuff strokes pneumonias things like


---------17:21----------
that like rashes like how do you know if


---------17:22----------
something is skin cancer or just rash


---------17:24----------
like all this kind of stuff so I started


---------17:26----------
to get really really scared because


---------17:28----------
after six months of intern year like I


---------17:31----------
wasn't gonna be dealing with anything


---------17:32----------
physical anymore that was it like I was


---------17:34----------
gonna get six months of training in


---------17:35----------
internal medicine in dealing with


---------17:38----------
diabetes and more em eyes and all that


---------17:41----------
kind of stuff and then I was done like


---------17:43----------
that was it and then I had this thought


---------17:47----------
and this actually happened to me and I


---------17:49----------
told the story that you know one day I'm


---------17:52----------
gonna be on an airplane and they're


---------17:55----------
gonna they're gonna like the the air


---------17:57----------
hostess or whatever is gonna say is


---------17:59----------
there a doctor on board we have a


---------18:00----------
medical emergency and then in that


---------18:04----------
moment


---------18:06----------
I was gonna have to decide like am I


---------18:08----------
gonna hit the call button and like be


---------18:10----------
the doctor and then I got scared because


---------18:11----------
I was like what if like a decade from


---------18:13----------
now I haven't like the last time I saw


---------18:16----------
someone who was physically ill was like


---------18:17----------
a decade ago and they're like is there a


---------18:19----------
doctor on the plane like do I even count


---------18:22----------
like does that do I hit the call button


---------18:24----------
or do I not hit the call button so then


---------18:27----------
I realized that I have six months to


---------18:29----------
learn as much as I he manely can about


---------18:32----------
physical medicine because after that


---------18:33----------
it's like 40 years of like not knowing


---------18:36----------
[ __ ] about anything physical so I


---------18:40----------
studied my ass off and I spent a lot of


---------18:44----------
time at the hospital and I tried to like


---------18:45----------
really learn as much as I could because


---------18:47----------
that's my training arc and then the


---------18:49----------
final boss is gonna show up and then


---------18:50----------
it's like game time so if you don't know


---------18:53----------
what your dharma is and if you feel like


---------18:54----------
you should create something I work with


---------18:56----------
a lot of people individually who have


---------18:58----------
that exact same feeling these are people


---------19:00----------
who are in private equity firms are like


---------19:02----------
working in companies or like investment


---------19:05----------
bankers or physicians who feel like


---------19:08----------
they're supposed to do something greater


---------19:09----------
than like what they're doing day to day


---------19:12----------
and so what I tell you is that that day


---------19:14----------
will come that should not comfort you


---------19:17----------
that should terrify you and the question


---------19:20----------
is are you gonna be ready you're gonna


---------19:22----------
get your opportunity because if that's


---------19:24----------
your Karma it's gonna happen and then


---------19:30----------
you're either gonna be able to do it or


---------19:32----------
you're not going to be able to do it


---------19:34----------
so I'll give you guys another very


---------19:36----------
simple example I show up on stream here


---------19:40----------
three times a week I've never met the


---------19:44----------
person don't know who this person is


---------19:45----------
don't know what's going on with them


---------19:48----------
right and like I'm supposed to help that


---------19:51----------
person like what on earth can I possibly


---------19:55----------
know that is gonna help some random


---------19:57----------
person from the internet like I have no


---------19:59----------
idea


---------20:01----------
right there are 3,000 people watching


---------20:04----------
right now and like I have to do


---------20:06----------
something that satisfies or helps 3000


---------20:10----------
people plus the person that I'm talking


---------20:11----------
to I have no idea like what that's gonna


---------20:13----------
look like I don't know what I'm getting


---------20:15----------
myself into I have no idea like I have


---------20:17----------
no idea there's a little part of me


---------20:19----------
that's terrified every time I come on


---------20:21----------
stream because how am I gonna help this


---------20:22----------
person I don't know but it works because


---------20:25----------
before that I realized at some points in


---------20:29----------
my life someone is gonna show up and I'm


---------20:31----------
gonna have to help them so whenever I


---------20:32----------
read a book whenever I meditate myself


---------20:34----------
whenever I like study things whenever I


---------20:36----------
read things like today I read like a


---------20:38----------
psychoanalyst doing an AMA on reddit and


---------20:41----------
like paid attention to what he was


---------20:42----------
saying and thought about it so like as


---------20:45----------
you go through life you recognize that


---------20:48----------
you're preparing yourself for that thing


---------20:50----------
when it's going to come you don't know


---------20:52----------
what it is it could be you may have to


---------20:54----------
pull someone out of a car that has been


---------20:56----------
like crashed and you may have you may


---------20:59----------
need the physical strength to like open


---------21:00----------
a piece of metal that has been wedged


---------21:02----------
and whether you do it or not depends on


---------21:05----------
your physical like ability which means


---------21:08----------
you have to get in shape because


---------21:09----------
otherwise that person could die it may


---------21:12----------
be like creating a product or saving the


---------21:14----------
world through like climate change or


---------21:16----------
inventing a new solar panel and maybe


---------21:17----------
helping an individual person it may be


---------21:19----------
creating a video game that keeps someone


---------21:21----------
from killing themselves because they're


---------21:22----------
depressed and at least there's some game


---------21:24----------
that gives people a sense of community


---------21:25----------
like I have no idea what it is


---------21:29----------
but you guys should be terrified


---------21:33----------
you should be terrified and if you don't


---------21:35----------
know what your Dharma is prepare prepare


---------21:37----------
in every way possible it doesn't matter


---------21:39----------
what your term is you're gonna need to


---------21:40----------
be in good physical shape because


---------21:41----------
ultimately your capacity to your Dharma


---------21:43----------
depends on your physical capability so


---------21:47----------
treat your body well and treat your mind


---------21:49----------
well because whether you rise to the


---------21:52----------
challenge it depends on like what you


---------21:54----------
are right study study what you can about


---------21:57----------
yourself if you have a general direction


---------21:59----------
like if you feel like you want to write


---------22:02----------
a book then like learn about writing if


---------22:05----------
you feel like you want to create an app


---------22:06----------
and that's what interests you then like


---------22:08----------
take courses online like check out Khan


---------22:10----------
Academy or like do Google certifications


---------22:13----------
on analytics like I don't care what it


---------22:15----------
is just study and learn and prepare for


---------22:17----------
that day that you are going to need to


---------22:18----------
do the thing if you think you missed


---------22:22----------
your chance you're wrong you missed a


---------22:24----------
chance that's part of your karma the


---------22:26----------
missed chance is the thing that teaches


---------22:28----------
you hey man this is legit so you better


---------22:31----------
get your ass ready for the next one


---------22:36----------
there is no such thing as a missed


---------22:37----------
chance a missed chance doesn't mean that


---------22:39----------
you're not gonna have more chances in


---------22:40----------
the future like I want you guys to


---------22:43----------
understand this very clearly if you


---------22:44----------
think that you've missed the boat you


---------22:45----------
didn't miss the boat like if I'm working


---------22:47----------
in the emergency room and someone comes


---------22:49----------
in and I don't recognize they have a


---------22:50----------
heart attack and they die that doesn't


---------22:53----------
mean that someone else isn't gonna come


---------22:54----------
in an hour from now missing the boat is


---------22:57----------
not like a one time thing


---------22:59----------
donger McCall's again and again and


---------23:01----------
again and again and again


---------23:02----------
and you can fail again and again and


---------23:04----------
again and again and again so time to get


---------23:06----------
your ass into gear prepare prepare


---------23:09----------
prepare miss the fortnight bus hey guys


---------23:16----------
I don't know if you guys realize this


---------23:18----------
but like fortnight is not gonna be the


---------23:19----------
biggest game for the history of humanity
