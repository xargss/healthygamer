---------00:00----------
yeah man thanks for coming on so can you


---------00:01----------
tell me a little bit about you know is


---------00:04----------
there something in particular you want


---------00:06----------
to talk about today or something that


---------00:07----------
would be hey we have the same headset oh


---------00:08----------
really oh the sign Houser yes yeah it's


---------00:14----------
really comfortable I like it a lot yeah


---------00:16----------
it's good um you know I was just gonna


---------00:21----------
say tell me a little bit about you know


---------00:23----------
how can be helpful and and what you want


---------00:25----------
to talk about today um so I guess the


---------00:30----------
topic was supposed to be like gaming


---------00:32----------
burnout okay um so I guess a little bit


---------00:35----------
about my background is that I'm from


---------00:37----------
Hawaii after I graduated high school I


---------00:41----------
worked for my dad as an intern for a


---------00:43----------
year and then I got fired cuz you know I


---------00:46----------
didn't I didn't want to do it I got


---------00:48----------
lucky with the game League of Legends


---------00:50----------
and I got flown out a free trip to


---------00:52----------
Sweden and then I started my league pro


---------00:54----------
career by joining well going to the TSM


---------00:59----------
house and then I played pro for like


---------01:01----------
five years and then I've played league


---------01:04----------
for like ten years and I've had like you


---------01:07----------
know ups and downs and I get into


---------01:12----------
details as we talked about wow so you're


---------01:14----------
a pro league player um I used to be used


---------01:18----------
to be okay yeah so I've I haven't been


---------01:20----------
pro for like four years now three years


---------01:23----------
around that time yeah I worked with a


---------01:26----------
fair number of people who were kind of


---------01:28----------
transitioning out of being pro yeah I'm


---------01:31----------
League overwatch mostly a little bit of


---------01:36----------
csgo a little bit of Rainbow six but


---------01:41----------
yeah so tell me a little bit about yeah


---------01:44----------
so when you said gaming burnout what do


---------01:46----------
you mean by that um it's just one of


---------01:50----------
those things where you play the game


---------01:52----------
same game for a long time and you don't


---------01:56----------
want to play it as much but then your


---------01:58----------
fans want you to play it and it also


---------02:01----------
brings you income so instead of doing it


---------02:05----------
for fun it becomes your job because


---------02:07----------
going from casual to pro


---------02:13----------
yeah I don't I don't see how else to say


---------02:16----------
it I feel like that's common knowledge


---------02:18----------
at this point yeah so you feel like you


---------02:21----------
have to play the game um there was a


---------02:24----------
time yeah that I felt like I had to play


---------02:27----------
the game and I thought about it for


---------02:29----------
years on end that you know would I be


---------02:31----------
okay without it should I not play it for


---------02:35----------
the good of my mental health because


---------02:37----------
playing it was hurting me because uh so


---------02:41----------
when you play the same game


---------02:44----------
that's a controlled by the developers


---------02:46----------
where they control every patch how the


---------02:50----------
game has changed like whatever they want


---------02:52----------
to do sometimes they make changes that


---------02:56----------
are bad and a riot is always accompany


---------03:00----------
about changing and so whether it's good


---------03:03----------
or worse some of the changes they've


---------03:06----------
made have made it the experience much


---------03:09----------
less enjoyable like what at this


---------03:12----------
so in League of Legends there's this


---------03:14----------
thing called funneling and what that is


---------03:18----------
is that instead of having a standard


---------03:21----------
game of you know five people versus five


---------03:23----------
people like there's one person top


---------03:25----------
middle two people bottom and one that


---------03:28----------
goes around the map yeah jungle and so


---------03:32----------
instead of having that standard thing


---------03:37----------
there's a role called support which is


---------03:40----------
they basically you know they have their


---------03:43----------
bottom they support their other laner


---------03:45----------
they wrote their job is to help them get


---------03:47----------
as strong as possible now instead of


---------03:49----------
just having one support in the game the


---------03:52----------
concept of funneling is there's two


---------03:54----------
supports and what will happen is


---------03:58----------
there'll be another support in a and a


---------04:00----------
Lane where they're by themselves and


---------04:03----------
instead of becoming someone strong their


---------04:05----------
goal is to make someone who is roam roam


---------04:07----------
roaming around strong and the cod so the


---------04:12----------
concept is like okay cool that's their


---------04:15----------
that's their strategy but it's a very


---------04:17----------
straightforward and like hard to counter


---------04:21----------
strategy if you make mistakes again it's


---------04:24----------
really unique and it it


---------04:26----------
what it does is it enables that one


---------04:28----------
person to hard carry and it's very


---------04:32----------
unfund to play against because they


---------04:34----------
don't even have to play it perfectly but


---------04:36----------
even if you play it perfectly you can


---------04:39----------
still lose the unsay it's a very common


---------04:42----------
cheese ela boosting strategy and because


---------04:48----------
I've played the game for so long there


---------04:51----------
are some games where I feel like I


---------04:53----------
played it perfectly and I'll still lose


---------04:54----------
which will happen either way but I felt


---------04:57----------
even more so against the strategy and


---------05:00----------
that was just one of the many things


---------05:01----------
that just turned me off from playing the


---------05:04----------
game and just made me like you know


---------05:05----------
please my mind are you kind of saying


---------05:08----------
that it lowered the skill ceiling of the


---------05:10----------
game to sort of have a strategy that


---------05:12----------
just was kind of lopsided and yeah so um


---------05:16----------
it lowered the skill ceiling not because


---------05:19----------
of the person only getting all the farm


---------05:22----------
but because of the person who's giving


---------05:24----------
them all that instead of playing the


---------05:27----------
game normally and you know getting


---------05:29----------
stronger like your skills tested you


---------05:32----------
don't have to you can literally put


---------05:33----------
anyone in that position of giving the


---------05:36----------
farm to that person and all they would


---------05:38----------
have to do is just they wouldn't have to


---------05:41----------
focus on macro at all they just have to


---------05:43----------
help that person and it's it


---------05:45----------
considerably lowers the skill ceiling


---------05:47----------
because usually you'd have a skilled


---------05:50----------
player in this role because they're


---------05:52----------
they're considered a carry but instead


---------05:55----------
they're given the support role which is


---------05:57----------
I'm not trying to say support is easier


---------05:59----------
than caring but when you don't have to


---------06:02----------
focus on blasts hitting which is what


---------06:08----------
gives you money in the game I'm a boom


---------06:09----------
boom and I'm not now much of a blower


---------06:11----------
okay I just so I'm with like ADC and


---------06:15----------
carrying and in the mid and jungle one


---------06:18----------
oh yeah basically they you just turned


---------06:22----------
their brain off and just give all the


---------06:24----------
gold to the jungler yeah so just as a


---------06:28----------
reference for how much of a Boomer and


---------06:30----------
how little of a boomerang I am I've


---------06:32----------
started playing dota probably like let


---------06:35----------
me think about this 14 years ago okay


---------06:40----------
then you know more than enough so back


---------06:46----------
when when you know I was I was there


---------06:48----------
when MOBAs were born boy yeah me too so


---------06:56----------
okay so I see so it seems like some of


---------06:58----------
the changes that the developers make


---------07:00----------
have it really kind of taken some of the


---------07:01----------
joy out of the game for you yeah it's


---------07:05----------
it's kind of like it's not completely


---------07:08----------
their fault because it's the player base


---------07:10----------
that also abuses it so yeah sure but I


---------07:14----------
mean isn't isn't the game developer


---------07:16----------
responsible for creating the setting


---------07:18----------
that then players are gonna abuse or not


---------07:20----------
abuse yeah you know I think players are


---------07:27----------
gonna be pieces of right you're


---------07:30----------
gonna cheese they're gonna cheese


---------07:32----------
whatever they can


---------07:33----------
yeah for sure I mean and I think that's


---------07:37----------
why like good developers are so


---------07:39----------
important because they're gonna create


---------07:40----------
the setting through which you know


---------07:42----------
that's gonna dictate a certain kind of


---------07:44----------
behavior yeah I want to say it's hard


---------07:46----------
for them to balance it because it's such


---------07:48----------
a there's so many champions in the game


---------07:50----------
but I guess what really irritated me as


---------07:54----------
a pro player is that they would hold


---------07:59----------
these riots summit me these these player


---------08:01----------
summit meetings where pro players have


---------08:03----------
come in and pro players that give their


---------08:05----------
advice and and a lot of players that


---------08:09----------
play the game a lot have their concerns


---------08:11----------
but there's also like the lower level of


---------08:14----------
play where people have their concerns


---------08:17----------
because what works and lower skill level


---------08:19----------
games doesn't always work at high and


---------08:21----------
vice versa and so they would hold these


---------08:26----------
we would have these meetings where like


---------08:28----------
we could give them feedback and there's


---------08:31----------
some things that were clearly broken and


---------08:33----------
a lot of the time it wasn't listened to


---------08:37----------
and that's what frustrated me because


---------08:39----------
it's like why why am I going to this


---------08:42----------
it's not even like being considered


---------08:45----------
because it just gets written off by


---------08:47----------
certain people in the balance team sand


---------08:50----------
up okay go ahead yes all right guys


---------08:53----------
oh and uh a lot of people have expressed


---------08:57----------
like similar opinions and I just feel


---------09:02----------
like there's some people in the balance


---------09:04----------
team that are actually just smoking weed


---------09:07----------
or getting in a hot ox and just be like


---------09:10----------
what if we did this and that's how


---------09:13----------
strongly I feel about it


---------09:15----------
yeah so let me just see if I'm hearing


---------09:19----------
you I'm kind of getting the sense that


---------09:21----------
so I just just


---------09:23----------
I've been jotting a couple things down


---------09:25----------
as you've been talking so this is just


---------09:27----------
literally the words that I wrote down


---------09:28----------
and let me know if these kind of feel


---------09:29----------
right so feeling forced to play in a


---------09:33----------
particular way being forced to play a


---------09:36----------
particular game for money for fans kind


---------09:39----------
of struggling with the sense of illusion


---------09:41----------
of choice where in theory you could stop


---------09:44----------
in theory they'll change the game in a


---------09:46----------
different way but that you're kind of


---------09:48----------
forced what I'm getting from you is sort


---------09:51----------
of a sense of being forced into


---------09:53----------
something yeah it's kind of like the


---------09:57----------
feeling of let's say you post on Twitter


---------10:02----------
every day for the idea of getting likes


---------10:04----------
getting it popular and like oh yeah I


---------10:07----------
feel good so many people like my tweet


---------10:09----------
and sometimes you tweet about stuff and


---------10:12----------
people are like who cares shut up but


---------10:15----------
it's like your Twitter account so it's


---------10:18----------
kind of its kind of like that - yeah so


---------10:21----------
can you say you said that sometimes wall


---------10:24----------
hurts you use the Oh a lot can you tell


---------10:31----------
me what you meant by that sorry if I


---------10:33----------
didn't give you enough second um it's


---------10:38----------
it's been a double-edged sword for me


---------10:40----------
because it's obviously created a career


---------10:42----------
for being everything and putting me


---------10:45----------
where I am today but uh so there are


---------10:49----------
many ways of explaining of how it hurts


---------10:51----------
me for


---------10:57----------
when we were talking about the changes


---------10:58----------
while I was a pro there's the concepts


---------11:02----------
of two verse wanting the top planar so


---------11:05----------
they would switch bottom in top and that


---------11:08----------
was a meta that was a meta they were


---------11:10----------
constantly trying to fix for like three


---------11:12----------
years and that's something that hurt me


---------11:16----------
when the jungler gang stuff


---------11:20----------
you're constantly yeah I'm a I'm a top


---------11:23----------
player usually the top player top laners


---------11:27----------
have to deal with most of the harassment


---------11:32----------
throughout the game because for junglers


---------11:36----------
they I just have to you know farm creeps


---------11:38----------
and worry about the enemy jungler the


---------11:40----------
mid laners they have a short lane so


---------11:43----------
they don't get punished as hard top


---------11:45----------
miners have the long Lane so there's


---------11:47----------
more risk to me bottom liners have their


---------11:50----------
support but top laners were left all


---------11:53----------
alone


---------11:53----------
we're basically left all alone and we're


---------11:56----------
forced to pick characters that will


---------11:58----------
allow us to survive drift less resources


---------12:01----------
but at the same time you're also dealing


---------12:04----------
with the enemy top laner where if he


---------12:06----------
abuses that the higher level play it


---------12:09----------
goes the harder it is so sure I just


---------12:11----------
there's just so many factors and things


---------12:14----------
that I don't want to get too far into it


---------12:18----------
and and so if we think about gaming


---------12:21----------
burnout is it sort of this idea of being


---------12:24----------
forced to play in a particular way being


---------12:27----------
forced to play a game that the meta has


---------12:29----------
changed away from what you want it to be


---------12:31----------
being forced to play League of Legends


---------12:33----------
for your financial well-being for the


---------12:36----------
people that have supported you feeling


---------12:38----------
kind of an you bet you owe them or that


---------12:41----------
you know they've supported you so that


---------12:42----------
you should give them what they want is


---------12:45----------
that what you mean by burnout No


---------12:49----------
that's just me expressing my pain I


---------12:51----------
guess what burnout really is is that


---------12:53----------
I've played league of legends for like


---------12:55----------
12 hours a day for four five to six


---------12:58----------
years doing my pro career and um I guess


---------13:06----------
what the burnout is really comes from is


---------13:09----------
not only playing it so much and grinding


---------13:12----------
it so much but I guess what it comes


---------13:14----------
from is not knowing how to take a break


---------13:17----------
I think that's what really creates it


---------13:21----------
for me okay buzz so I pardon me which


---------13:26----------
iris if I'm a bit confused so you said


---------13:28----------
during your pro career so when was was


---------13:33----------
that some time ago or as are we talking


---------13:35----------
about now are we talking about gaming


---------13:37----------
Burma burnout a while ago um it was a


---------13:41----------
while ago and I think I'm still kind of


---------13:44----------
burnt out today as a gamer because I've


---------13:46----------
played games every day of my life


---------13:47----------
basically so what is the burnout that


---------13:50----------
you so like let's just think about that


---------13:52----------
right so that sounds kind of confusing


---------13:54----------
to me and I'm gonna question your


---------13:56----------
formulation of it so it makes absolute


---------13:59----------
sense and I've dealt a lot with pro


---------14:01----------
gamer burnout and streamer burnout and


---------14:03----------
things like that actually my day job I'm


---------14:05----------
a burnout specialist so do a lot of


---------14:07----------
stuff work would burn out with like


---------14:08----------
Investment Banking with entrepreneurs


---------14:10----------
with physicians you know these you know


---------14:14----------
there's like the 40-hour Work Week and


---------14:16----------
the funny thing is that like many


---------14:17----------
physicians just find that to be


---------14:19----------
preposterous so like in residency the


---------14:21----------
expectation is that you work 80 hours a


---------14:23----------
week and the residency is what you do


---------14:26----------
after med school when you actually learn


---------14:28----------
how to be a doctor and so you have the


---------14:31----------
the national medical accreditation


---------14:34----------
institution which is called the ACGME


---------14:36----------
and they basically had to pass a law


---------14:38----------
that said that you can't work your


---------14:41----------
residents more than 80 hours a week on


---------14:43----------
average so what that means is that like


---------14:46----------
what what residency programs do is


---------14:50----------
they'll have some weeks where people


---------14:51----------
will work like a hundred hours a week


---------14:53----------
and then they'll have like a research


---------14:55----------
block where they were supposed to be


---------14:57----------
working like 50 hours a week


---------14:59----------
and and it ends up like people work 80


---------15:01----------
90 100 hour weeks depending on whether


---------15:03----------
you're a surgeon or psychiatrist or you


---------15:06----------
know it just depends on what you do and


---------15:09----------
so the you know it's strange because


---------15:10----------
like in some you know you're kind of


---------15:12----------
saying that 12 hours five to six days a


---------15:15----------
week is between 60 and 72 hours of work


---------15:17----------
a week and oh no I'm talking like seven


---------15:21----------
days a week


---------15:21----------
see yeah it's big I don't have like a


---------15:25----------
specific number but it the lifestyle was


---------15:28----------
wake up play all day sleep right so so


---------15:34----------
that that is like I think often times if


---------15:37----------
it may have been more than 12 hours


---------15:38----------
right so like it may have been eight or


---------15:40----------
sixteen and I think we should talk about


---------15:42----------
that lifestyle because that's a


---------15:43----------
lifestyle that you don't have to be a


---------15:45----------
pro gamer to do it right wake up start


---------15:48----------
with YouTube switch to some gaming watch


---------15:50----------
a little bit of twitch go back to gaming


---------15:52----------
back to a little bit of youtube learn


---------15:55----------
something philosophical on YouTube for a


---------15:57----------
little while you know pull out your


---------15:59----------
switch in bed browse Reddit and then


---------16:02----------
sleep it's like a it's like a full day


---------16:04----------
so we can talk about that lifestyle I'm


---------16:07----------
sorry did you want to say something okay


---------16:09----------
yeah that's the idea of it but it's


---------16:14----------
harder in a way because you're competing


---------16:17----------
at the top level so there's just more


---------16:19----------
stress involved sure instead of instead


---------16:22----------
of it sounding like something were you


---------16:24----------
you know it's just the casual lifestyle


---------16:28----------
it's very much more stressful because um


---------16:31----------
you live with other people on your team


---------16:33----------
and you you deal with each other because


---------16:36----------
of the gaming house such and such and


---------16:39----------
you're just all trying to figure out how


---------16:41----------
to win yeah so if you want to we can


---------16:44----------
talk about that because I have some


---------16:46----------
experience doing consulting for


---------16:48----------
professional organizations for like


---------16:51----------
physical sports and eSports and I don't


---------16:54----------
know where people got the idea that


---------16:55----------
twelve hours a day seven days a week


---------16:57----------
makes you a better player than ten hours


---------17:00----------
a day six days a week right so like


---------17:05----------
there's this huge assumption in the


---------17:06----------
world of eSports that the more you play


---------17:08----------
the better you get and that the harder


---------17:10----------
you grind the more you perform I don't


---------17:12----------
know that that's


---------17:13----------
actually the case what you thinking I


---------17:17----------
think it really depends cuz I I can't


---------17:19----------
say that I've seen players who've played


---------17:22----------
like there's a Korean player we played


---------17:26----------
against and he was late to scrims cuz he


---------17:28----------
would just be playing all night all day


---------17:30----------
he'd sleep for like four hours and just


---------17:32----------
play for the rest of the day I guess the


---------17:35----------
the key word here is being efficient


---------17:38----------
about the time he put in yeah and also


---------17:40----------
also efficiently resting yeah I


---------17:44----------
completely agree and and so some of the


---------17:47----------
consulting work that I've done has been


---------17:48----------
around you know even like having people


---------17:52----------
on the same pro team talk about their


---------17:54----------
feelings with each other because a lot


---------17:56----------
of times people get frustrated and upset


---------17:58----------
with each other and that like ultimately


---------18:00----------
the more frustrated and upset you are


---------18:02----------
with your teammates the harder it is to


---------18:04----------
hit a flow state and the one thing that


---------18:06----------
I've heard time and time again whether


---------18:08----------
it's with working with NFL players or


---------18:10----------
overwatch athletes is like getting into


---------18:15----------
the flow state is what wins you games


---------18:16----------
and the more you can stay in the flow


---------18:19----------
state it's it's being able if you're in


---------18:20----------
a best-of-five like losing one game and


---------18:22----------
being able to forget about that and


---------18:24----------
focus on the second game completely


---------18:26----------
independent of whether your tournament


---------18:28----------
life is on the line or not it's just


---------18:30----------
playing the best game you can play and I


---------18:33----------
think a lot of that has way more to do


---------18:35----------
with not just it's just not the number


---------18:38----------
of hours you put in it's about being the


---------18:40----------
best you it's like you said like kind of


---------18:42----------
using your time efficiently making sure


---------18:43----------
you and your team are harmonious like if


---------18:46----------
you guys lose a game like are you guys


---------18:48----------
blaming or is everyone blaming the top


---------18:50----------
laner because they to view one top and


---------18:53----------
their ADC got fed and then they lost or


---------18:56----------
do they recognize that the reason that


---------18:58----------
the ADC got fat is because you didn't


---------19:00----------
have enough support and and are you guys


---------19:02----------
playing to win are you guys playing to


---------19:04----------
like you no blame each other so I think


---------19:07----------
there's a lot in in the realm of eSports


---------19:08----------
that I think is actually in its infancy


---------19:10----------
and if you look at organizational


---------19:12----------
psychology and in different


---------19:14----------
organizations like I forget what Ray


---------19:17----------
Dalio is there's a hedge fund manager


---------19:20----------
named Ray Dalio and he he wrote an


---------19:22----------
excellent book called principles and he


---------19:25----------
runs one of the most successful


---------19:27----------
runs in the world and just kind of


---------19:29----------
talking a little bit about like how he


---------19:30----------
runs his company and I think there are a


---------19:32----------
lot of ways to run organizations that


---------19:34----------
can improve efficiency and eSports is


---------19:36----------
just really really behind and you get


---------19:39----------
guys that are former pro players that


---------19:41----------
know the game really well but really


---------19:43----------
have no background in organizational


---------19:45----------
behavior or management or anything like


---------19:47----------
that anyway now I'm granting but um but


---------19:51----------
you know dyrus let me let me toss


---------19:53----------
something out so like I so are you burnt


---------19:55----------
out today because you were a pro five to


---------19:58----------
six years ago like why are you burnt out


---------19:59----------
today


---------20:07----------
so a few months ago


---------20:10----------
I took a I decided to completely stop


---------20:13----------
streaming for three months


---------20:15----------
like just completely stop to see if I


---------20:18----------
could feel better or get better and I


---------20:22----------
did feel better about things but I


---------20:24----------
didn't feel like it made too much of a


---------20:26----------
difference basically like I like I said


---------20:30----------
before my life as I wake up I eat I


---------20:33----------
stream and I sleep but I also have a


---------20:35----------
have a girlfriend so their girlfriends


---------20:38----------
in between also and so it started to


---------20:41----------
become where I need to manage my time to


---------20:46----------
the point where I can at least do my


---------20:49----------
everyday adult responsibilities and I


---------20:53----------
think one of the reasons why I feel


---------20:55----------
burnt out is cuz since I've played so


---------20:58----------
much games it's really hard to find a


---------21:00----------
game that's as fun as the time I enjoyed


---------21:04----------
League of Legends like I'll enjoy some


---------21:06----------
games for a few days but a lot of the


---------21:08----------
time and this year and you'll hear a lot


---------21:10----------
of people that play games say this is


---------21:12----------
like oh man what what games do I play


---------21:14----------
there's no good fun games at play man I


---------21:16----------
can't wait for a new game to come out so


---------21:19----------
I can play that and you play it and it


---------21:21----------
only lasts so long and the you just feel


---------21:25----------
a lot of emptiness because you don't


---------21:27----------
have a game to get addicted to now for


---------21:31----------
today specifically the game valor end is


---------21:34----------
out so that's what I'm currently


---------21:36----------
addicted to right now and


---------21:42----------
[Music]


---------21:45----------
how do you like that it's just a cycle I


---------21:47----------
love the game I think the only time I


---------21:51----------
felt discomfort in the game is when they


---------21:53----------
they changed the headshot sound and when


---------21:58----------
you shot them a head is like there's


---------22:00----------
like a mute like a sound like you


---------22:02----------
playing like a music counts ound keep


---------22:04----------
playing and then like I forget whatever


---------22:06----------
sound but they changed it to like this


---------22:08----------
loud plate crunching sound and when you


---------22:12----------
headshot people you'd hear that but they


---------22:14----------
they took it off but for that day was


---------22:16----------
actually like one of the worst days I've


---------22:18----------
had in like the last month just because


---------22:22----------
of that small thing how do you


---------22:25----------
understand why such a small thing could


---------22:27----------
affect you so profoundly because I


---------22:32----------
joy in the sound cues when I you know


---------22:37----------
I'm rewarded for playing well and the


---------22:39----------
addiction sound cues and video games are


---------22:42----------
actually super big to me if if they're


---------22:46----------
like badly done or poorly quality no


---------22:49----------
matter how good the gameplay is or no


---------22:51----------
matter how good everything is the sound


---------22:54----------
is like a huge part of my gaming


---------22:57----------
experience


---------23:00----------
are you tired right now darkness a


---------23:04----------
little bit but I always sound like this


---------23:07----------
and what is like this


---------23:13----------
monotone Low Energy when you say always


---------23:18----------
where you like this as a kid depends on


---------23:27----------
what time as I was when I was a kid


---------23:34----------
I go ahead


---------23:55----------
I'm sorry you were saying thank you by


---------23:58----------
the way so your question is


---------24:02----------
am I always like this as a kid yeah


---------24:04----------
we're you always like this as a kid


---------24:05----------
um there's times where I was super


---------24:08----------
energetic but because I was teased and


---------24:13----------
bullied throughout my school years I


---------24:16----------
became more shy and had anxiety with


---------24:19----------
talking with people I was very awkward


---------24:22----------
what happened when you became monotone


---------24:24----------
with respect to the bullying um I think


---------24:32----------
that's just my natural voice for when I


---------24:35----------
came Molitor I get that I mean so you


---------24:37----------
it's interesting because you said I used


---------24:40----------
to get excited and then and then after


---------24:43----------
that sentence literally you said I would


---------24:45----------
get Boyd oh yeah and so it's strange for


---------24:50----------
those two sentences to come back to back


---------24:51----------
I'm very bad at explaining things and


---------24:56----------
telling stories but basically I'm not so


---------25:01----------
sure I agree with that but go ahead


---------25:03----------
um so throughout my school life I used


---------25:11----------
to be nice to all the kids in class


---------25:13----------
because I wanted to be funny I wanted to


---------25:15----------
make people laugh I want to make people


---------25:17----------
happy and there are some kids in my high


---------25:21----------
school that would take advantage of my


---------25:22----------
kindness even though I was like even


---------25:24----------
though I was like the biggest kid in


---------25:25----------
class I started to get bullied and out


---------25:28----------
of getting bullied I would get angry and


---------25:30----------
they would tell on the teacher and tell


---------25:33----------
me that I needed


---------25:34----------
ingor management because I would get mad


---------25:36----------
at them and yell back at them and so I


---------25:38----------
had I had anger management in elementary


---------25:42----------
school and I basically just used it as


---------25:44----------
an excuse to get out of class and so


---------25:50----------
I'll ask you again


---------25:51----------
okay what happened to the bullies when


---------25:54----------
you became monotone


---------26:03----------
I guess I has nothing to do if if I


---------26:06----------
interesting really so I think that I


---------26:09----------
don't think you're a bad storyteller I


---------26:10----------
just don't think you're consciously


---------26:11----------
aware of what you're saying so when you


---------26:14----------
say I'm a bad storyteller what I hear is


---------26:16----------
that these dots don't feel connected and


---------26:18----------
I shouldn't tell a more complete story


---------26:19----------
right you know yeah but actually I feel


---------26:24----------
like the dots are very connected what


---------26:27----------
we're what we're literally hearing so


---------26:28----------
let me tell you the story that I hear


---------26:29----------
here's a kid who's expressive and what


---------26:32----------
happens when he is expressive um I got


---------26:38----------
bullied and I got sad you got bullied


---------26:41----------
and you got saddened not just bullied


---------26:43----------
right what did when you expressed things


---------26:46----------
you got bullied and how did you respond


---------26:48----------
to that that bullying angry you and


---------26:52----------
that's expression mm-hmm and then when


---------26:56----------
you expressing so you expressed


---------26:58----------
something first the first time you get


---------27:00----------
bullied you express something else and


---------27:02----------
then what happens I got angry and then I


---------27:08----------
would get sad because I was angry and


---------27:11----------
then and then what are the teachers do


---------27:14----------
but he put me in anger management which


---------27:16----------
is a class that teaches you to do what


---------27:19----------
to control my anger and become monotone


---------27:24----------
see that uh yeah yeah like like


---------27:33----------
literally literally just think about


---------27:35----------
this for a second iris literally you


---------27:38----------
were put in a class that taught you how


---------27:42----------
to take what's on the inside and not


---------27:44----------
show it to the people on the outside oh


---------27:47----------
so that kind of like am i is that does


---------27:52----------
that sound like a stretch to you no that


---------27:56----------
makes sense yeah and and it's kind of


---------28:00----------
weird I mean it's like I couldn't get a


---------28:02----------
more perfect answer from you in terms of


---------28:04----------
the poll this guy was actually taught


---------28:06----------
this because it was weird cuz you said


---------28:07----------
so I think dyrus I don't think I mean


---------28:09----------
there are a couple of statements that


---------28:10----------
you made about you know that are a


---------28:13----------
little bit devaluing like I'm not a good


---------28:15----------
storyteller I don't think that


---------28:16----------
not a good storyteller I think that


---------28:18----------
there are things that your mind is


---------28:20----------
piecing together which consciously you


---------28:22----------
don't understand but I think you


---------28:24----------
understood this all along because you


---------28:26----------
you actually it's strange to say I used


---------28:28----------
to be an excited kid and I used to enjoy


---------28:30----------
making people laugh and then I got


---------28:32----------
bullied and I asked you a little bit


---------28:35----------
about like have you always been this way


---------28:37----------
and so your mind is already piecing


---------28:41----------
together


---------28:41----------
monotone monotone miss being excited as


---------28:45----------
a kid and getting bullied like those


---------28:48----------
three those three sentences are linked


---------28:50----------
in your mind in some way and you're just


---------28:51----------
not entirely sure how they fit together


---------28:53----------
and because you're not sure how they fit


---------28:55----------
together you can't tell a clear story


---------28:57----------
about it but if I ask you the stories


---------28:59----------
right there is that am I being too


---------29:03----------
abstract I'm sorry oh no no you're


---------29:05----------
you're completely correct that's that's


---------29:07----------
exactly how I am I'm not able to tell it


---------29:11----------
clearly because I don't think you


---------29:13----------
understand it clearly right so I think


---------29:17----------
that you know it but you don't


---------29:18----------
understand it and and and the answers


---------29:22----------
are there you just have to learn a


---------29:23----------
process of accessing them and now I'm


---------29:26----------
gonna share with you something that's


---------29:27----------
really kind of bizarre so this isn't I


---------29:31----------
could be completely wrong here but like


---------29:32----------
you're telling me that you're burnt out


---------29:34----------
right and you're telling me like when I


---------29:36----------
asked you originally about burnout you


---------29:38----------
said 12 hours a day for like five to


---------29:40----------
seven days a week and when I pressed you


---------29:42----------
a little bit further it's basically


---------29:43----------
gaming all day every day


---------29:44----------
TSM House pro gamer all this kind of


---------29:48----------
stuff but like it's weird because it's


---------29:50----------
like why the are you burnt out now


---------29:52----------
like when I my first answer your first


---------29:55----------
answer to when did you experience


---------29:57----------
burnout as you talked about something


---------29:59----------
that you haven't been a pro now for four


---------30:00----------
years right mm-hmm and and I'm not


---------30:03----------
saying that you aren't burnt out now I'm


---------30:04----------
just saying it's kind of strange that


---------30:06----------
your answer it's like oh yeah why are


---------30:07----------
you sad and someone says yeah you know I


---------30:11----------
had a I had a really a toxic


---------30:14----------
relationship four years ago and it's


---------30:16----------
like sure that probably has something to


---------30:17----------
do with it but it's strange that the


---------30:20----------
burnout has kind of lingered so long


---------30:22----------
does that make sense


---------30:23----------
hey oh good


---------30:27----------
I I guess that my my lifestyle from four


---------30:32----------
years ago the only thing that's change


---------30:34----------
is that instead of it being super high


---------30:37----------
skill and competitive and stressful and


---------30:39----------
being in a team environment and went


---------30:41----------
from that to just putting all my time


---------30:45----------
into streaming and at the same time it


---------30:47----------
took up my time which was good for me


---------30:50----------
but um I went through a lot of pain at


---------30:54----------
the end of the year cuz I I stopped


---------30:56----------
playing and I had a relationship where I


---------31:01----------
broke up end of the ears meaning which


---------31:04----------
year um end of my pro career okay


---------31:07----------
and when I stopped playing pro I broke


---------31:11----------
up so I felt a lot of pain during the


---------31:13----------
time and then I got over it


---------31:17----------
just one just a roller coaster of


---------31:19----------
emotions throughout the next years I


---------31:22----------
moved out of the TSM house i i i lived


---------31:27----------
with uh one of my former teammates i had


---------31:29----------
to learn how to take adult


---------31:31----------
responsibilities because i never i


---------31:33----------
always ignored all of that because the


---------31:37----------
team would take care of it paying rent


---------31:39----------
paying for sounder you sound like a


---------31:43----------
 top laner let me just think


---------31:48----------
about it right the roller coaster being


---------31:52----------
done with the pro team moving out losing


---------31:55----------
your girlfriend you're alone


---------32:00----------
I think a lot of people can relate with


---------32:02----------
that so I think a little people can do


---------32:05----------
yeah but I yeah I am I do have the top


---------32:09----------
planar mentality yeah I know and he


---------32:15----------
would keep going at it and I didn't mean


---------32:16----------
to interrupt


---------32:17----------
oh so two men I'm sorry so I I moved


---------32:24----------
from the TSM house which was in LA to an


---------32:27----------
apartment near them and then I lived


---------32:31----------
there for two years and then I moved to


---------32:32----------
Austin Texas for two years and now I'm I


---------32:36----------
bought a house in Wichita Kansas and so


---------32:40----------
now I live in Wichita


---------32:41----------
which it's okay Kansas hmm do you feel


---------32:46----------
like you're left all alone oh no I


---------32:50----------
I've had a girlfriend for the last three


---------32:51----------
years sure I understand you have a


---------32:53----------
girlfriend do you feel like you've been


---------32:54----------
left all alone as like a player this


---------33:01----------
person or just do those words mean


---------33:03----------
something to you do they resonate with


---------33:06----------
how you feel


---------33:11----------
do I I feel like because I'm not a pro


---------33:16----------
anymore


---------33:17----------
I've learned that there's a lot of


---------33:20----------
people that lose interest in me because


---------33:22----------
I'm not pro which is understandable but


---------33:24----------
the ones that have pretended to be


---------33:28----------
closer than they really are have also


---------33:30----------
shown and I there's like there's like


---------33:35----------
three different phases of it the first


---------33:37----------
one is I'm a pro player lots of fans


---------33:39----------
people talk about me every day when I


---------33:42----------
was a pro confession here when I was a


---------33:47----------
pro I would do things like look up my


---------33:49----------
own name that's a that's something where


---------33:52----------
I enjoyed the intention the attention


---------33:55----------
and so that was the first phase I would


---------34:00----------
stop being pro the second phase was I


---------34:02----------
would I'm just a streamer I would I


---------34:03----------
retired I was still relevant as a


---------34:07----------
streamer and I kept streaming every day


---------34:09----------
and slowly as I played more and more I


---------34:12----------
let I cared less for the for being good


---------34:15----------
at the game and with that people also


---------34:18----------
started to care about me less and it


---------34:20----------
slowly became this thing where I was


---------34:23----------
scared of being irrelevant I was scared


---------34:25----------
of you know losing value of being


---------34:30----------
relevant and so I thought to myself for


---------34:33----------
a long time like what what matters to me


---------34:35----------
most and so it was hurting me and I so I


---------34:40----------
decided to quit League after a certain


---------34:44----------
point and then the last phase was still


---------34:48----------
trying to decide do I care about being


---------34:50----------
relevant or do I care about what's happy


---------34:54----------
like what's good for me but they're all


---------34:57----------
connected in some kind


---------35:00----------
way so it's just like it's like if you


---------35:03----------
behind your PC there's a bunch of cords


---------35:05----------
and it gets all over the place that's


---------35:08----------
how that's how I feel about my different


---------35:10----------
phases of life like it's just the cords


---------35:13----------
are just everywhere and I don't know how


---------35:15----------
to that's burnout buddy I'm gonna


---------35:20----------
tell you something doesn't sound


---------35:21----------
absolutely crazy I don't think it has to


---------35:22----------
do with your pro career I don't think


---------35:25----------
it's any of that I think it's all


---------35:27----------
the cords being untangled I think life


---------35:31----------
is overwhelming like you don't know what


---------35:33----------
to do you don't know what's gonna make


---------35:35----------
you feel good you don't know what you


---------35:36----------
should do you don't know how to make


---------35:38----------
money you don't know how to have fun I


---------35:41----------
ask you do you feel like you're left all


---------35:44----------
alone and then you say I have a


---------35:46----------
girlfriend and then I ask you the same


---------35:47----------
damn question again I'm not trying to


---------35:49----------
beat you up here


---------35:50----------
right myself at any point no no


---------35:54----------
you're completely fine and then you say


---------35:56----------
I have a girlfriend and then I ask you


---------35:58----------
do you feel left alone and you're like


---------36:00----------
I'm not sure what that means then I ask


---------36:01----------
you a third time do those words sit with


---------36:04----------
you and you say yes and there we see


---------36:08----------
your confusion because you're like in


---------36:10----------
some part of your mind you're thinking


---------36:12----------
to yourself I shouldn't feel this way


---------36:14----------
because I have a girlfriend like in what


---------36:16----------
where is feeling alone come from because


---------36:20----------
I've done the things I'm in Wichita I


---------36:22----------
have some real friends I recognize I


---------36:24----------
don't I have some fake friends I figured


---------36:25----------
out who those are because you're solving


---------36:27----------
so many problems like you're doing so


---------36:29----------
good right and that's why it's so


---------36:30----------
 confusing you've moved to


---------36:32----------
Wichita you figured out sort of what


---------36:34----------
you're gonna do for your mental health


---------36:35----------
you've got this girlfriend you're


---------36:36----------
playing Valerie it's it's a lot of fun


---------36:38----------
and like you're you're checking all the


---------36:41----------
boxes but like you feel wrong you feel


---------36:47----------
alone and burnt out and like there's a


---------36:49----------
lot of tangled up behind the


---------36:51----------
computer and you don't know what plugs


---------36:53----------
into what and what goes where in which


---------36:55----------
cord does what you know it's all there


---------36:58----------
in some way but it's just not fit


---------37:01----------
together yeah


---------37:10----------
completely agree what are you feeling


---------37:14----------
right now


---------37:19----------
a bit of relief well maybe a tear in my


---------37:21----------
eye a little happy I guess


---------37:32----------
your daughter that one yeah hmm


---------37:37----------
sensitive to sound huh yeah I am


---------37:43----------
sensitive to sound yeah I see that I


---------37:46----------
think you're a really sensitive guy what


---------37:48----------
do you think I've been told that a lot


---------37:52----------
but I've always tried to put up the


---------37:55----------
front of you know I'm holding it down


---------37:59----------
yeah monotone I hold it in a law huh I


---------38:05----------
don't think this is burnout


---------38:07----------
I think it's bourbon bourbon cuz here's


---------38:11----------
here's what was confusing to me right is


---------38:14----------
that you say okay I ask you the first


---------38:15----------
question and and really I'm not trying


---------38:17----------
to say you're stupid or anything I'm


---------38:19----------
just pointing out what your mind is


---------38:20----------
doing okay so just try to pay attention


---------38:22----------
I asked you like about burnout your


---------38:24----------
first thing is you talk about life is a


---------38:25----------
pro and that was four years ago


---------38:27----------
which is that the source of your burnout


---------38:30----------
and then you say well I sort of


---------38:31----------
continued that lifestyle I wake up every


---------38:33----------
day I still do all this kind of stuff


---------38:34----------
okay so like maybe it's the lifestyle


---------38:36----------
maybe it's streaming and you were like


---------38:37----------
yeah but I've placed programming with


---------38:39----------
streaming that makes sense to streamers


---------38:41----------
get burnt out all the time and then


---------38:44----------
comes the really confusing thing which


---------38:47----------
is that you say I took a break for three


---------38:48----------
months and it helped a little now that's


---------38:53----------
really confusing because if it's the pro


---------38:55----------
gaming and if it's the streaming and you


---------38:57----------
took a break from it then that should


---------38:59----------
help a lot so either you're doing your


---------39:01----------
standard thing where you sort of


---------39:02----------
downplay the impact of things you say a


---------39:05----------
little bit like you say maybe a tear in


---------39:06----------
my eye right you have this tendency to


---------39:09----------
use like small words mm-hmm


---------39:12----------
so maybe it's that but I think I think


---------39:14----------
it just it's a clue that it's not


---------39:16----------
actually those environments and I know


---------39:19----------
this sounds completely crazy but I think


---------39:21----------
you carry the burnout with you and I


---------39:24----------
think that one of the most confusing


---------39:25----------
things about being a human being


---------39:26----------
especially when you've been entrained to


---------39:30----------
not feel what you feel on the inside and


---------39:33----------
if you really want to understand this we


---------39:35----------
have to talk about your internship with


---------39:37----------
your dad's company okay right and I


---------39:40----------
think we've got a lot there but but that


---------39:42----------
you're a guy who has taken what you feel


---------39:45----------
and you


---------39:46----------
shafted aside for the sake of other


---------39:48----------
things for the sake of not getting in


---------39:50----------
trouble in class you've taken your


---------39:52----------
excitement in your joy and you put them


---------39:55----------
aside because of your fear of bullying


---------39:56----------
you've taken your frustration when


---------39:59----------
people bully you and you try to defend


---------40:00----------
yourself and then the teacher like


---------40:01----------
brings down your neck and then you got


---------40:03----------
put in an anger management class and


---------40:05----------
those kids are like you dyrus you


---------40:08----------
suck and then you're not allowed to say


---------40:11----------
anything and you become a pro player


---------40:15----------
we're like no one cares that you're


---------40:17----------
tired no one cares that you're left all


---------40:20----------
alone in the top light in a shitty


---------40:22----------
 meta where it's to be one top


---------40:25----------
like no one cares they're like


---------40:26----------
 liars yeah that is the general


---------40:29----------
idea but I don't want I want to say this


---------40:32----------
because that would be disrespectful


---------40:34----------
towards of people that have cared for me


---------40:36----------
like there are a lot of people have


---------40:38----------
supported me in my community that have


---------40:41----------
watched me for a long time and have


---------40:42----------
supported me for a long time so I don't


---------40:45----------
want to forget about sharing coz it's so


---------40:47----------
easy to focus on the negative yeah so


---------40:50----------
I'm I'm so let me be clear I'm glad you


---------40:53----------
said that I'm not trying to paint


---------40:55----------
everyone with a bad brush although I am


---------40:57----------
doing exactly that the reason that I'm


---------40:59----------
doing that is because I'm amplifying


---------41:01----------
because you're suppressive mm-hm so I'm


---------41:04----------
gonna blow things out of proportion


---------41:06----------
okay and then I think somewhere in the


---------41:08----------
middle between you downplaying things


---------41:10----------
and me like up playing things we're


---------41:13----------
gonna arrive at somewhere near the truth


---------41:14----------
which is not that it's it's not that


---------41:16----------
it's your your kids I mean they're your


---------41:18----------
parents teammates Mike my kid is


---------41:24----------
shouting my name in the background but


---------41:27----------
my it's not your teammates fault that


---------41:29----------
the meta is that way but I think it


---------41:32----------
still speaks to I think they're hunting


---------41:38----------
for her because she's looking for me and


---------41:40----------
she usually wants nothing here but I I


---------41:43----------
think somewhere along this is like it's


---------41:45----------
the feeling of being left all alone


---------41:48----------
right and there's something about a


---------41:50----------
feeling there's something about a burden


---------41:52----------
that you carry with you there's


---------41:53----------
something about what you feel in terms


---------41:56----------
of burnout that actually is not because


---------41:58----------
you're a pro player


---------41:59----------
or because you're a streamer because if


---------42:01----------
you took a three-month break that should


---------42:03----------
have made a big difference if that's the


---------42:05----------
source of it so this is the really crazy


---------42:08----------
thing is that when we think about life


---------42:09----------
and we think about why we feel the way


---------42:11----------
that we do we tend to attribute the way


---------42:14----------
that we feel to external things you say


---------42:17----------
the reason I'm burnt out is because I


---------42:18----------
was a pro is because I'm a streamer you


---------42:22----------
know the reason that I'm unhappy is


---------42:24----------
because my wife doesn't do XYZ or my


---------42:26----------
girlfriend doesn't care about me enough


---------42:28----------
for the reason that I feel alone is


---------42:30----------
because I don't have a girlfriend right


---------42:32----------
I feel so lonely because I have no one


---------42:34----------
to love and no one loves me and all this


---------42:36----------
kind of and then the funny thing is


---------42:38----------
that you've done some of those things


---------42:40----------
that are supposed to make those feelings


---------42:41----------
go away and then it's kind of confusing


---------42:43----------
and then you end up with all the cords


---------42:45----------
behind your PC because this is how


---------42:47----------
you're supposed to feel and I'm sure


---------42:50----------
that you do feel I mean I'm not sure but


---------42:52----------
I imagine you feel loved and appreciated


---------42:53----------
by your girlfriend and all that stuff


---------42:55----------
like you have all the positive things in


---------42:57----------
the relationship that the girlfriend is


---------42:58----------
supposed to give you and yet you still


---------43:00----------
feel left alone and that's exactly my


---------43:02----------
point it's not the girlfriend it's not


---------43:04----------
that you are pro player it's not that


---------43:06----------
you're a streamer this is something that


---------43:08----------
you carry within you it's something you


---------43:11----------
carried for a long time and now this is


---------43:16----------
kind of cool because what this means


---------43:18----------
it's kind of cool and it's kind of


---------43:20----------
crappy because on the one hand you don't


---------43:23----------
have to change anything in the outside


---------43:25----------
world you don't have to be a pro again


---------43:28----------
you know what this means is that you are


---------43:31----------
not you are not forced into playing


---------43:33----------
something for your fans or your money or


---------43:35----------
whatever like you can if you need money


---------43:37----------
and streaming is the way that you're


---------43:39----------
gonna get it that's fine but the


---------43:41----------
feelings that you have inside are not


---------43:43----------
controlled by what happens on the


---------43:45----------
outside so the cool thing is like that


---------43:47----------
should be a little bit liberating and it


---------43:50----------
should also be really really confusing


---------43:51----------
because then like what the are they


---------43:52----------
controlled by really any thoughts so far


---------43:57----------
are we good questions I I feel like


---------44:05----------
the three-month break I I feel like one


---------44:08----------
of the reasons why it didn't really help


---------44:11----------
as much but helped a little bit was


---------44:13----------
because I don't know how to take a break


---------44:16----------
one of the things my girlfriend has


---------44:19----------
mentioned to me is that I should try and


---------44:20----------
find another hobby because my mind is so


---------44:23----------
reliant on playing games and because all


---------44:26----------
other than playing games all only other


---------44:28----------
thing I do is watch anime or read manga


---------44:31----------
or watch TV shows and um I can't I can't


---------44:37----------
really find anything else that holds me


---------44:40----------
up the same way for example when the


---------44:44----------
Valerii change happened I was having a


---------44:46----------
really shitty day and I don't know


---------44:49----------
there's not my favorite TV shows there


---------44:51----------
there's no episodes out I don't know


---------44:54----------
what to watch like what it was yeah so


---------44:58----------
we're gonna talk about dopamine


---------45:00----------
exhaustion and and how your brain may


---------45:02----------
really not be helping you right now but


---------45:04----------
I want to point something else out to


---------45:06----------
you I don't know how to take a break is


---------45:08----------
that something in the outside world or


---------45:10----------
is that something on the inside is that


---------45:15----------
within you were that something in the


---------45:17----------
environment I think that's mostly within


---------45:22----------
me because if I had if I had to choose


---------45:26----------
like my parties and life like gaming is


---------45:32----------
like top three sure pop - what does that


---------45:37----------
have to do with not knowing how to take


---------45:38----------
a break so I don't I don't know


---------45:44----------
do to feel relaxed I guess okay I


---------45:47----------
beautiful sentence okay and therein lies


---------45:50----------
our problem what to do to feel okay


---------45:57----------
we're gonna help you out dyrus I'm gonna


---------46:00----------
try so I'm gonna give you another


---------46:03----------
sentence I should learn a new hobby is


---------46:05----------
that something on the inside or


---------46:07----------
something on the outside it's something


---------46:15----------
told from now


---------46:17----------
and it's something that on the inside


---------46:20----------
it's like yeah I should do that but then


---------46:22----------
I though a hobby is external right


---------46:26----------
like like the point here is that you


---------46:28----------
don't know how to take a break and say


---------46:29----------
your girlfriend says learn a hobby but


---------46:32----------
like and I'm gonna say the last thing so


---------46:35----------
now here's the beautiful sentence I


---------46:36----------
don't know what to do to feel relaxed so


---------46:41----------
that implies that your relaxation comes


---------46:44----------
from something on the outside does that


---------46:48----------
make sense I don't know what to do to


---------46:52----------
feel relaxed yes I think that is


---------46:55----------
accurate right so the the thing the


---------46:59----------
hypothesis that I'm asking you to


---------47:01----------
entertain is that you were looking for


---------47:03----------
far too many solutions on the outside


---------47:05----------
and if we look at it like the more that


---------47:08----------
we look at your problem you say I'm


---------47:09----------
burnt out because I was a pro player I'm


---------47:11----------
burnt out because I'm a streamer but


---------47:13----------
then if we want to be really scientific


---------47:14----------
about it then removing those things


---------47:17----------
should relieve your burnout but when you


---------47:19----------
did that for three months it didn't


---------47:20----------
really relieve your burn out and in fact


---------47:22----------
when you did that so that didn't work


---------47:24----------
and then when we asked you why it's


---------47:25----------
because I don't know how to take a break


---------47:26----------
that's the answer the answer is it that


---------47:30----------
you should find something else to


---------47:31----------
distract you and you kind of say like


---------47:34----------
okay I need an anime or manga or


---------47:35----------
whatever but like the point is that you


---------47:37----------
have things to distract you you have


---------47:38----------
shows you can play valent you know how


---------47:40----------
to engage your mind


---------47:41----------
but despite engaging your mind and


---------47:44----------
watching anime and and and reading manga


---------47:46----------
and playing valent and whatever you


---------47:48----------
still carry this feeling of being left


---------47:51----------
alone of feeling burnt out like that's


---------47:54----------
something you carry within you and no


---------47:56----------
amount of doing any outside is ever


---------47:58----------
gonna fix that like finding a new hobby


---------48:02----------
is not going to fix that it's just gonna


---------48:03----------
teach you to be distracted from it like


---------48:05----------
do you see how your mind moves from


---------48:07----------
distraction - distraction you have to


---------48:09----------
rotate because as the dopamine from


---------48:12----------
valence starts to get like like as you


---------48:14----------
build up tolerance from the dopamine


---------48:17----------
release from Valerie you have to move to


---------48:19----------
anime and then you build up tolerance to


---------48:21----------
that and then you have to move to manga


---------48:23----------
and then you build up tolerance to that


---------48:24----------
and then you you you cross your fingers


---------48:27----------
and you hope that by the time you burn


---------48:29----------
through your three there's something you


---------48:30----------
can watch


---------48:31----------
Netflix and by the time you burn through


---------48:33----------
that by then your dopamine will have


---------48:35----------
like recalibrated with valent you can go


---------48:37----------
back to square one


---------48:38----------
mm-hmm and what we see is a generation


---------48:41----------
of people that move from distraction to


---------48:44----------
the distraction - distraction YouTube


---------48:46----------
reddit twitch gaming YouTube reddit


---------48:49----------
twitch gaming our anime manga D&D I


---------48:53----------
can't tell you how many times that I


---------48:55----------
catch myself just clicking on Twitter


---------48:58----------
over and over Twitter list just our


---------49:01----------
society is like yeah man you want you


---------49:03----------
want another hit like let me show you


---------49:05----------
Twitter let me show you read it like


---------49:07----------
here man like oh yeah that cocaine is


---------49:09----------
really good actually really try a


---------49:11----------
speedball toss some heroin in there a


---------49:13----------
little bit of tic toc I've told a lot of


---------49:18----------
my friends this that so in Hawaii


---------49:21----------
there's a lot of drug trafficking and


---------49:24----------
every person I knew had some kind of


---------49:26----------
connection to drugs and when I was in


---------49:30----------
middle school now sad I got peer


---------49:33----------
pressured into trying some drugs and I


---------49:35----------
had tried a bunch of drugs and I always


---------49:37----------
told my friend I asked my friends do you


---------49:39----------
know what the number one drug of the


---------49:41----------
mall for me is and the reason why I


---------49:43----------
don't do drugs


---------49:44----------
it's just video games video games is my


---------49:47----------
strongest addictions that you don't do


---------49:50----------
drugs


---------49:50----------
you just don't ingest substances big


---------49:53----------
difference yeah what we're addicted to


---------49:56----------
is avoidance right it's like all these


---------50:00----------
things and like I'm with you man like


---------50:02----------
you know my dopamine gets going - it's a


---------50:06----------
beautiful story but I think that dyerson


---------50:09----------
that your answers are not it's like


---------50:11----------
nothing on the outside man it's all on


---------50:13----------
the inside and this is a good person


---------50:16----------
oh yeah go ahead so what do i what do i


---------50:20----------
do yeah like that's the best question to


---------50:23----------
ask it's a great question okay so the


---------50:29----------
answer unfortunately is a little bit


---------50:30----------
complex but the second but the first


---------50:35----------
thing is that you've done a big part


---------50:36----------
today like because just in realizing


---------50:39----------
like you know that the answer is not on


---------50:43----------
the outside is gonna be huge because I


---------50:45----------
think so far for most of your life


---------50:46----------
you've been looking for answers on the


---------50:48----------
outside mmm-hmm and I think I mean in


---------50:52----------
some ways it's gonna feel it's gonna be


---------50:55----------
easier than you think it is but you


---------50:57----------
can't really do it which makes it hard I


---------50:58----------
know it sounds kind of weird and I know


---------51:01----------
I I completely understand that statement


---------51:03----------
so please explain it to us because it's


---------51:08----------
like when you see someone do something


---------51:11----------
it's easier said than done because


---------51:13----------
there's so many complex things that go


---------51:15----------
into it some people just have a knack


---------51:17----------
for it I just understand certain parts


---------51:20----------
of it and for others it's it can be


---------51:24----------
something as simple as like whistling


---------51:27----------
you know you some people just naturally


---------51:29----------
can whistle and when I was little I


---------51:31----------
can't I can't whistle now I can never


---------51:33----------
whistle but for some people seem simple


---------51:36----------
but maybe there's some kind of feeling


---------51:38----------
in my mouth for shape that I'm supposed


---------51:41----------
to make to whistle but I can't do it


---------51:43----------
because I don't I just doesn't click


---------51:45----------
with me it's a beautiful example so


---------51:48----------
here's the thing I think whistling is


---------51:49----------
the perfect example so I think it's like


---------51:51----------
whistling in the sense that you got a


---------51:53----------
try and you got a try and you got a try


---------51:55----------
and then one day you're gonna do it


---------51:57----------
that's really how it works and and


---------52:01----------
that's why you know people talk about


---------52:03----------
enlightenment you've heard of


---------52:05----------
enlightenment it's like you know in the


---------52:07----------
Buddhists and Hindus talk about it a


---------52:09----------
fair amount je n'ai I'm sorry could you


---------52:13----------
repeat that you're familiar with the


---------52:16----------
concept of enlightenment yay or nay you


---------52:20----------
know your problem like Buddhism yes yet


---------52:24----------
missionary Christian like being stuck in


---------52:28----------
a closet for two hours I see who you


---------52:30----------
really are I like that something like


---------52:33----------
that there's this idea that like you


---------52:35----------
know people reach this moment of


---------52:37----------
realization where they discover their


---------52:39----------
true self and then they feel like


---------52:41----------
they're blissful and happy and and


---------52:43----------
they're suffering all goes away and


---------52:45----------
like that and I think that the


---------52:48----------
was like realization comes in moments


---------52:50----------
right I'm sure there have been times in


---------52:52----------
your life or like if you think about


---------52:53----------
your pro league career we're in the


---------52:56----------
process of becoming a pro like one day


---------52:58----------
something clicked for you and then you


---------53:00----------
understood something that you didn't


---------53:01----------
understand for and then you became


---------53:04----------
better because of it does that make


---------53:05----------
sense


---------53:06----------
I understand the concept yeah okay


---------53:11----------
and so the tricky thing about you know


---------53:13----------
how do you learn to take a break which


---------53:16----------
is I think what you need to do you know


---------53:20----------
it's it's hard it's kind of like


---------53:21----------
whistling you just have to keep trying


---------53:22----------
at it for a while and then you'll kind


---------53:24----------
of like you'll hit upon it one day and I


---------53:27----------
can give you some I'll give you some


---------53:28----------
more structured answer than that okay


---------53:30----------
okay


---------53:31----------
I don't know there is one thing that


---------53:33----------
I've been missing this entire time that


---------53:36----------
I wanted to mention that's also caused


---------53:40----------
all this so when he offends there's


---------53:45----------
negative reactions and positive


---------53:47----------
obviously but I think one of the things


---------53:51----------
that causes me to be stressed out and


---------53:53----------
irritated as when I stream or maybe go


---------53:57----------
post something on Twitter there's like


---------54:00----------
twitch Ted you know how twitch attack


---------54:01----------
can get it under everyone's skin maybe


---------54:04----------
someone asks the same question you've


---------54:06----------
been as hearing for four months a good


---------54:10----------
example is when I when I stopped playing


---------54:13----------
League of Legends several years ago I


---------54:16----------
kept that getting asked play League when


---------54:20----------
are you playing league and I put out


---------54:22----------
like two videos I put a command for it


---------54:25----------
I've expressed it so many times and I


---------54:28----------
get told the like I swear to God if


---------54:30----------
there was a command that triggered every


---------54:32----------
time I've been asked the same question


---------54:36----------
of the common question of when are you


---------54:38----------
gonna play league right now the common


---------54:40----------
question is are you and your girlfriend


---------54:42----------
still together that one's the common one


---------54:44----------
now but I swear to god it it's been


---------54:47----------
asked that at least in the five digits


---------54:50----------
amount of times and that that is


---------54:53----------
something that really just gets to me


---------54:55----------
and I've been trying to gnome out what


---------54:58----------
gets to you about that let's talk about


---------54:59----------
that


---------55:00----------
for sharing by the way yeah I wanted I


---------55:03----------
felt like something was missing in all


---------55:05----------
this yo you're absolutely right and I


---------55:09----------
wonder if twitch a can figure out what


---------55:10----------
it is what bothers you about that


---------55:12----------
don't look at twitch chat by the way


---------55:13----------
they're pretty good at this by now i i


---------55:16----------
have twitch chat off I made sure to not


---------55:19----------
have it on this entire time no Matt home


---------55:22----------
yeah of course not um so when I first


---------55:29----------
became quote-unquote a pro famous I


---------55:33----------
didn't see myself as it but people come


---------55:38----------
up for autographs like you know I'm


---------55:40----------
happy to answer all the questions talk


---------55:42----------
to them but after a long time it's like


---------55:46----------
I still do like doing it a little bit as


---------55:49----------
long as people are happy I'm happy but


---------55:53----------
the constant questioning of the same


---------55:58----------
thing over and over just just gets to me


---------56:00----------
and I start to act more negatively


---------56:03----------
negatively and let's say someone asked


---------56:06----------
how are you doing and instead of being


---------56:09----------
like I could easily just be like fine I


---------56:11----------
end up ignoring it or maybe if I'm in a


---------56:15----------
bad mood I act negatively so let's just


---------56:18----------
let's forget about your reaction let's


---------56:21----------
rewind a little bit


---------56:23----------
they risk and ask and ask how does that


---------56:26----------
make you feel dyrus when they asked over


---------56:29----------
and over and over again it's really


---------56:33----------
irritated bitter and I guess being asked


---------56:41----------
the


---------56:41----------
question over and over and having to


---------56:43----------
answer it over and over again what's


---------56:45----------
irritating about that what does that


---------56:47----------
mean what kind of question gets why do


---------56:51----------
you have to answer something over and


---------56:53----------
over and over again because if I'm


---------56:57----------
streaming I feel like I should interact


---------57:03----------
with my chat sure that's why you're


---------57:05----------
streaming but let's just think about


---------57:06----------
this for a second okay like what's let


---------57:10----------
me just think about whether I want to


---------57:12----------
just tell you or trying to walk you to


---------57:13----------
it because I don't know how to ask the


---------57:17----------
questions the right way


---------57:23----------
so I'll ask you this Cyrus has there


---------57:26----------
been a time in your life when people


---------57:28----------
didn't listen all the time I actually


---------57:33----------
I'm actually a very special case for


---------57:35----------
that there's been many instances where


---------57:38----------
I've said things and not not just people


---------57:40----------
asking the same question over and over


---------57:42----------
but just like even people that I know


---------57:44----------
even in a competitive environment when


---------57:47----------
I'll say something and it's just


---------57:48----------
completely ignored in throughout my


---------57:52----------
career I want to go under the age how


---------57:55----------
old are you now tires if you don't mind


---------57:56----------
me asking


---------57:57----------
I am 20th alright so we're gonna go back


---------58:01----------
to 18 or the the latest I'm gonna let


---------58:05----------
you go as to when you quit your


---------58:07----------
internship or you got fired tell me


---------58:09----------
about how you were not listened to


---------58:12----------
before


---------58:24----------
I'm thinking about it though it has


---------58:27----------
happened um I guess the easiest example


---------58:33----------
I can think of is I've had friends who


---------58:35----------
became in relationships and I was always


---------58:38----------
in the middle of it I guess I would


---------58:41----------
because I was good friends with both of


---------58:43----------
them so I'd kind of be like in the


---------58:44----------
twilight zone


---------58:45----------
and I would tell them certain things


---------58:50----------
like if you do this this is gonna happen


---------58:53----------
or you shouldn't do this it's this is


---------58:57----------
gonna happen and they don't listen


---------59:02----------
just like whoa what was the point of


---------59:06----------
saying in the first place


---------59:08----------
you know why I ask me if you're not


---------59:11----------
gonna listen and I've had that situation


---------59:15----------
a lot in many different scenarios is


---------59:19----------
luck is is in the twilight zone does


---------59:22----------
that feel like left all alone


---------59:30----------
not not really that's fine about it add


---------59:33----------
as much I'm just trying to understand


---------59:35----------
what by what what you meant by that term


---------59:36----------
not everything has so connected by the


---------59:38----------
way yeah okay you know yes so let me ask


---------59:44----------
you can I ask you a couple questions


---------59:45----------
yeah can you tell me about how you ended


---------59:48----------
up can you tell me a little bit about


---------59:49----------
growing up in Hawaii um so I grew up and


---------59:59----------
a


---------60:01----------
I had my mom dad grandma auntie and


---------60:05----------
cousin living in the same house we lived


---------60:08----------
right across like a college and a school


---------60:11----------
um growing up my dad gave me the belt


---------60:16----------
cuz I what happened was that I drew


---------60:20----------
you know those videotape cassettes I


---------60:23----------
threw one at my cousin and she was


---------60:26----------
laughing so I was like oh she likes this


---------60:29----------
so I threw another one she started


---------60:31----------
bleeding crying and then I got the belt


---------60:33----------
cuz yeah I was dumb kid but I'm Hillary


---------60:37----------
I was like three years old three four


---------60:42----------
years old and so growing up in that


---------60:47----------
household


---------60:49----------
my grandma would babysit me the video


---------60:52----------
games that my parents bought for me


---------60:54----------
babysit me I guess I kind of bullied my


---------61:01----------
cousin a little bit at the start but


---------61:03----------
then I stopped I was actually kind of a


---------61:06----------
mean kid growing up so that when when it


---------61:10----------
came to some things but I immediately


---------61:12----------
stopped after a certain point like there


---------61:16----------
was a time where I his thing yeah go


---------61:17----------
ahead


---------61:18----------
oh there there was a time where I've now


---------61:22----------
now I think back on it I was kind of


---------61:24----------
mean but I never was like trying to be


---------61:28----------
mean it was just I was just saying or


---------61:31----------
doing whatever I felt like I was more


---------61:35----------
free as a kid uh what did what did you


---------61:38----------
wanna say why do kids why are kids mean


---------61:42----------
I mean aside from the general fact that


---------61:44----------
all all kids are me cuz I didn't


---------61:52----------
know anything I don't know any


---------61:55----------
boundaries


---------61:56----------
the only boundaries i falled were the


---------61:58----------
rules that were set to me mm-hmm


---------62:02----------
let me ask you something do kids do


---------62:05----------
something big so when a kid speaks and


---------62:07----------
this is gonna be sounded kind of a


---------62:09----------
stupid question so it may not even make


---------62:10----------
sense when a kid speaks is a kid able to


---------62:13----------
speak because


---------62:15----------
know something or because they don't


---------62:16----------
know something they just do because I


---------62:21----------
want to sure but the capacity of speech


---------62:24----------
for a child is that because of something


---------62:26----------
that a child knows or because of a child


---------62:28----------
what a child doesn't know because they


---------62:31----------
know how to speak right so like if I


---------62:34----------
have a if I have a kid that goes peepee


---------62:36----------
on the potty versus peepee somewhere


---------62:39----------
else like is it because the kid knows


---------62:43----------
where to go peepee or kind of doesn't


---------62:45----------
know know where to go peepee I'm being


---------62:55----------
your kid here yes it's a dumb question


---------62:57----------
so I'll just be instead of asking you


---------62:59----------
questions I'm just gonna say it so I


---------63:01----------
think kids are taught things right kids


---------63:03----------
do what they're taught to do that's how


---------63:05----------
kids learn


---------63:06----------
so like you know if you're a mean kid I


---------63:10----------
don't think that's because you didn't


---------63:12----------
know better any better I think it's


---------63:13----------
actually exactly the opposite it's


---------63:16----------
because that's what you knew mmm-hmm


---------63:20----------
does that make sense like kids do things


---------63:21----------
so like you know I've worked with kids


---------63:26----------
that will so I one time worked with a


---------63:31----------
kid that would tear holes in stuffed


---------63:34----------
animals and put pieces of candy inside


---------63:38----------
the butthole that it would make for the


---------63:40----------
child I mean so they would make a bottle


---------63:43----------
in a stuffed animal and it would soft


---------63:45----------
candy in there or why do you think that


---------63:47----------
kid does that like a three and a half


---------63:50----------
year old the story may be making a


---------63:57----------
pinata no it's because someone did that


---------64:00----------
to that child oh yeah that was a very


---------64:06----------
that makes sons yeah yeah how do you


---------64:13----------
feel


---------64:13----------
right now diners um just one of those


---------64:19----------
extreme examples it kind of reminds me


---------64:21----------
of uh when destiny makes those extreme


---------64:25----------
examples it's kind of token back I guess


---------64:30----------
you know do you think about you being a


---------64:32----------
mean kid


---------64:39----------
you know I guess I would


---------64:43----------
I didn't know anything but after what we


---------64:45----------
said it doesn't seem like to be the


---------64:48----------
right thing to say


---------64:49----------
yeah absolutely I know it doesn't feel


---------64:51----------
that way to you but remember that like


---------64:52----------
what we're the whole theme of this


---------64:54----------
conversation dyrus is that things don't


---------64:56----------
appear to make sense for you for you


---------64:58----------
even though you understand them mm-hmm


---------65:00----------
right even when we think about like


---------65:02----------
burnout and when we think about you know


---------65:04----------
I think well there are a lot of things


---------65:06----------
here that you understand that I just


---------65:07----------
don't think you know you understand and


---------65:09----------
I'm not surprised at all you were a mean


---------65:11----------
kid and I knew you were gonna be a mean


---------65:13----------
kid the second you said two words give


---------65:16----------
you any any idea what those words are


---------65:18----------
maybe twitch chat knows when I get


---------65:22----------
irritated when people repeat themselves


---------65:24----------
nope the belt okay how do you understand


---------65:31----------
what am I trying to say


---------65:36----------
any idea


---------65:42----------
because I got the belt at a young age


---------65:45----------
that caused me to be afraid and I'm not


---------65:50----------
just afraid buddy no no you're missing


---------65:52----------
this so like you got the belt and what


---------65:58----------
was your dad being to you in that moment


---------66:03----------
mean to me absolutely


---------66:05----------
so kids learn what they're taught okay


---------66:11----------
right rude and I think I think it's


---------66:15----------
weird because you say I used to be a


---------66:17----------
mean kid until one day I woke up and I


---------66:19----------
wasn't anymore


---------66:20----------
and I think that's the day that you


---------66:22----------
started to think for yourself in some


---------66:25----------
way but I think you were just doing like


---------66:28----------
you were throwing objects at someone and


---------66:31----------
you thought it was fun until they


---------66:33----------
started getting hurt and like you didn't


---------66:34----------
understand any better right like you you


---------66:36----------
just it's so interesting that you


---------66:38----------
remember you have such a clear memory as


---------66:39----------
a three-year-old because I don't know if


---------66:41----------
you know this but like three olds don't


---------66:42----------
really have good memory I I have a few


---------66:46----------
plate I remember standing on the scale


---------66:50----------
and I'm being like oh I'm 50 pounds how


---------66:54----------
three years old and birth oh I think


---------67:02----------
three is when I started to be conscious


---------67:05----------
of things and I think well they're


---------67:08----------
written conscious i-i thinkt one of the


---------67:10----------
reasons why i remember a lot is because


---------67:13----------
i played video games and i remember a


---------67:16----------
lot of video games well that's I don't


---------67:19----------
maybe that's not it I I think that I can


---------67:22----------
remember video a lot of video games


---------67:24----------
because I was I played a lot of video


---------67:25----------
games yeah so I think I don't I think


---------67:30----------
it's the other way around I think you're


---------67:31----------
you're demonstrating that you had


---------67:33----------
memories way clear of video games at a


---------67:37----------
very young age right so so


---------67:40----------
anything you just remember videogames


---------67:42----------
because you became conscious at a very


---------67:44----------
young age it's not the other way around


---------67:45----------
video games aren't the causative factor


---------67:47----------
it's just that yeah yeah yeah yes yes I


---------67:51----------
mean and so I I'm hearing that you learn


---------67:55----------
yeah I mean so when you weighed yourself


---------67:58----------
at the age of three and you were 50


---------67:59----------
pounds how did you treat yourself and


---------68:03----------
how did other people treat you they


---------68:06----------
didn't mean anything it's just a memory


---------68:08----------
okay can I just think for a second oh go


---------68:17----------
ahead


---------68:23----------
you


---------68:25----------
darris I'm not getting the sense that


---------68:28----------
we're gonna be able to tie this up with


---------68:30----------
a nice neat and bow program in the next


---------68:33----------
30 minutes I mean there are many


---------68:37----------
questions that I want to ask I think


---------68:38----------
we're getting on the important stuff but


---------68:41----------
like we can just get to the points like


---------68:44----------
the stuff that really matters well I


---------68:47----------
mean I think all of this really matters


---------68:49----------
I'm just I'm just not sure we're gonna


---------68:54----------
you know so in my mind the tying up the


---------68:57----------
bow is in teaching you how to take a


---------69:00----------
break it's about helping you be more in


---------69:03----------
tune with your internal environment it's


---------69:06----------
about not suppressing the things that


---------69:08----------
you feel and making sense of things that


---------69:11----------
you don't understand it's a tall order I


---------69:13----------
just don't think it can be accomplished


---------69:15----------
in the next 30 minutes alright and I


---------69:18----------
think that there's just so much here


---------69:20----------
that is like low-hanging fruit like I


---------69:21----------
don't think you appreciate all right I


---------69:24----------
would love it if you could learn to


---------69:25----------
appreciate or explore I mean I could be


---------69:27----------
wrong here that let me put it this way


---------69:31----------
so I think you feel the way that you do


---------69:35----------
because it's not burn like you carry the


---------69:37----------
burn out with you it's not because of an


---------69:39----------
external thing it's because of an


---------69:40----------
internal thing I think you get


---------69:42----------
frustrated with people because you


---------69:44----------
haven't been listened to and like I can


---------69:47----------
imagine a child in so many situations


---------69:50----------
that you've described being frustrated


---------69:54----------
because they aren't listened to I can


---------69:56----------
imagine when your dad pulls out the belt


---------69:59----------
you try to explain to him I thought she


---------70:01----------
was having fun and him not giving a


---------70:05----------
like I I can see your genuine confusion


---------70:08----------
I could imagine a three-year-olds


---------70:10----------
genuine confusion or not even having the


---------70:12----------
words to be able to say that but just


---------70:14----------
like trying to explain to like your dad


---------70:16----------
as he like pulls off the belt that like


---------70:19----------
you didn't mean to write because you


---------70:22----------
remember that you remember that she was


---------70:24----------
laughing and you remember why you threw


---------70:26----------
it again and you remember that there was


---------70:29----------
no malice in your heart and you got beat


---------70:31----------
for it and that you had a different side


---------70:34----------
of the story and then we can


---------70:37----------
fast-forward a grade-school when


---------70:38----------
my kids make fun of you and they bully


---------70:41----------
you and then you fight back and then the


---------70:43----------
teacher comes over they go red they they


---------70:46----------
provoke you and they bully you and then


---------70:48----------
they go tell on you and the teacher


---------70:49----------
comes over and then what do you try to


---------70:52----------
do you try to explain and you say no


---------70:55----------
they started it


---------70:57----------
and the teacher doesn't listen then we


---------71:00----------
also get this complex that you've been


---------71:02----------
showing us a little bit of about like


---------71:04----------
how you're not good with your words and


---------71:05----------
you don't understand like you know you


---------71:07----------
said that a couple of times like I'm not


---------71:09----------
being clear or something like that


---------71:10----------
mm-hmm


---------71:11----------
and I and I think that somewhere along


---------71:13----------
the way like you started to feel like


---------71:16----------
people don't listen to you and then we


---------71:19----------
know this because I'll ask you these


---------71:20----------
questions I'll be like you know I sort


---------71:22----------
of asked you know a bunch of different


---------71:23----------
ways and then I said dyrus do you feel


---------71:25----------
like you have them and listened to and


---------71:26----------
you're like all the time and if it's all


---------71:29----------
the time do you see how that means that


---------71:31----------
you carry it with you it's been with you


---------71:33----------
all along if it's all the time it's not


---------71:36----------
an external environment it's you does


---------71:38----------
that make sense yes that makes homes and


---------71:42----------
and so the and and then when we think


---------71:46----------
about being burnt out it's like there's


---------71:49----------
a sense of confusion about your life and


---------71:51----------
and there's a sense of being left all


---------71:52----------
alone and I don't know where that comes


---------71:55----------
from but I think that I mean I think it


---------71:57----------
comes back to like this story I mean I


---------71:59----------
think we're gonna find a lot I mean I


---------72:00----------
don't really know but the story that you


---------72:02----------
described to me about your your dad and


---------72:04----------
his company like can you just tell us


---------72:06----------
that like what happened in high school


---------72:07----------
and and and it sounds like you got I


---------72:11----------
mean when you say you got the belt so it


---------72:13----------
sounds like that wasn't a one-time


---------72:14----------
occurrence oh it was only one time it


---------72:18----------
was only one time it's interesting yeah


---------72:21----------
okay um okay


---------72:26----------
so in other ways um I mean sometimes I


---------72:34----------
got yelled at for doing dumb things


---------72:36----------
sounds pretty normal


---------72:39----------
Oh in third in third grade you took me


---------72:48----------
into or he put me in baseball cuz uh you


---------72:54----------
know it'd be good


---------72:55----------
give me a hobby growing up just give me


---------72:58----------
a sports early maybe I could be an X


---------73:00----------
homerun hero you know I'll go MLB but um


---------73:06----------
so we went to baseball practice and all


---------73:11----------
our teammates weren't there like they're


---------73:13----------
there at another basketball game


---------73:15----------
watching like friends or family be in a


---------73:18----------
basketball game and we were there and we


---------73:21----------
forgot they told us and so I showed my


---------73:24----------
dad my math homework and I thought it


---------73:26----------
was right but he said it was wrong and


---------73:27----------
so we got irritated me for half-assing


---------73:30----------
it which I always did I always have


---------73:32----------
asked things a lot but I would always do


---------73:34----------
them and he's like all right boy let's


---------73:39----------
let's play catch you know and so I


---------73:41----------
played catch with him and my form was


---------73:44----------
like a little off I also was scared of


---------73:49----------
the ball because when the baseballs


---------73:51----------
being thrown at you I just you know a


---------73:53----------
flinch I'm not as used to it I'm scared


---------73:55----------
of being hit sure and so he got here at


---------73:58----------
8:00 he got irritated that I was


---------74:02----------
flinching the story's probably clear


---------74:06----------
from him but basically he was irritated


---------74:08----------
at me because I was flinching I wasn't


---------74:10----------
you know thrown the ball right kind of


---------74:14----------
being a and one time he threw it


---------74:17----------
hard and it hit my left eye and I got a


---------74:20----------
bruise on my left eye and I and I I fell


---------74:23----------
over and I remember the lying when he


---------74:26----------
talks about today's like damn boy I


---------74:28----------
thought I killed you I was scared to


---------74:30----------
death and he told me that he learned a


---------74:33----------
life lesson there and he started to be


---------74:36----------
nicer after that but


---------74:39----------
yeah that I really hurt hit getting hit


---------74:43----------
by baseball in the eye so that was that


---------74:47----------
was another time where he was I mean


---------74:50----------
harangue angry to me but he he he


---------74:55----------
actually learned something like a big


---------74:57----------
thing about that dyrus you're laughing


---------74:59----------
what's funny about that because when we


---------75:03----------
talk about it my dad laughs about it and


---------75:06----------
I think about it as a as a vent were I I


---------75:15----------
didn't cry I was just like in pain and


---------75:21----------
dyrus was me about it it's just the


---------75:28----------
thing I can look back on just as an


---------75:30----------
event wow he looks so terrified I say


---------75:36----------
like that because I don't I'm asked a


---------75:39----------
question and you're not giving me an


---------75:41----------
answer and so I'm bludgeoning to you


---------75:43----------
here are my baseball's what's funny


---------75:47----------
about it


---------75:48----------
I'm not sure he's a lot sister it seems


---------75:53----------
funny to me about on now on yeah so let


---------75:57----------
me tell you the story that I heard yeah


---------76:00----------
there's this one time yeah I took my


---------76:03----------
third grade kid out to the out to play


---------76:06----------
baseball and that that dumbass hadn't


---------76:09----------
done is his math homework right and so


---------76:11----------
he was like he's such a he


---------76:13----------
like didn't know how to catch and so I


---------76:15----------
threw the ball at him and I threw harder


---------76:17----------
and harder and harder knees flinch I


---------76:19----------
okay and then and then I I popped him in


---------76:24----------
the head and boy I almost killed him and


---------76:26----------
then I learned my lesson so I think I


---------76:29----------
think what was funny to me is because my


---------76:34----------
dad for the first time in my life I


---------76:37----------
realized that my dad was super scared


---------76:41----------
from it and that's something I that's a


---------76:43----------
side I've never seen him I am super


---------76:47----------
scared of what God


---------76:50----------
thought he really hurt like killed me or


---------76:53----------
something you know you're telling me for


---------76:56----------
that for the first time in your life in


---------76:58----------
the third grade you saw a sign from your


---------77:00----------
dad that he cared about you know he God


---------77:07----------
that just makes me feel so bad thinking


---------77:10----------
about that way I understand remember I'm


---------77:14----------
amplifying because you're doing yeah


---------77:15----------
right right so so dyrus here's what I


---------77:23----------
want you to notice okay okay you can


---------77:26----------
feel like a bad person for thinking or


---------77:30----------
saying those things and I may be


---------77:32----------
amplifying right like I may not be


---------77:33----------
characterizing it like please you


---------77:35----------
haven't told me the thousand stories


---------77:36----------
about your dad when he did demonstrate


---------77:37----------
the scary I don't think your dad was an


---------77:39----------
 mm-hmm okay but like I want you


---------77:43----------
to just notice notice the stories that


---------77:46----------
you're saying is the story that you told


---------77:47----------
me is not funny


---------77:48----------
when your dad tells that story the lack


---------77:50----------
of this the fact that he laughs is also


---------77:52----------
not funny like that's not funny man I


---------77:59----------
understand that we laugh at it and


---------78:01----------
there's a very good reason that we laugh


---------78:02----------
at it we laugh at it because humor is a


---------78:04----------
defense mechanism and because sometimes


---------78:06----------
when things become morbid we laugh


---------78:08----------
because that's the only way that we


---------78:09----------
can't deal with it but the problem is


---------78:12----------
that like you know your dad laughs


---------78:13----------
because it makes him uncomfortable but I


---------78:16----------
really do think that there's something a


---------78:18----------
little bit like there's something a


---------78:19----------
little bit off about this whole picture


---------78:21----------
right there's there's something a little


---------78:23----------
bit off about it you know you laughing


---------78:27----------
because your dad was scared of hurting


---------78:29----------
you like what the it's


---------78:36----------
and and I'm not a few yeah go ahead okay


---------78:40----------
um you can continue so I I'm not saying


---------78:45----------
I'm not saying that I'm painting a


---------78:47----------
picture of reality and I'm not trying to


---------78:50----------
shame you and I understand if you feel


---------78:52----------
guilt or shame or that sounds bad and I


---------78:54----------
understand that like most parents are


---------78:56----------
like not perfect and I'm sure that your


---------78:59----------
dad loved you and I'm sure that in a lot


---------79:01----------
of ways he was a good dad and he tried


---------79:03----------
his best and like all that kind of stuff


---------79:05----------
I'm not trying to turn him into a demon


---------79:07----------
but I am pointing out that I think


---------79:10----------
something in your life left a couple of


---------79:13----------
scars oh yeah my my parents were


---------79:17----------
divorced I forgot to mention that okay


---------79:19----------
sure


---------79:20----------
and and what I see in you today is


---------79:22----------
because I like my whole point here so


---------79:24----------
like I'm gonna try to sort of wrap


---------79:25----------
things together okay not to say that


---------79:28----------
we're done because I don't know how to


---------79:29----------
how you fix this but here's the first


---------79:32----------
thing that I'm noticing that your


---------79:33----------
burnout sure has a lot to do with your


---------79:35----------
lifestyle and stuff like that but that's


---------79:37----------
some of your burnout you carry with you


---------79:38----------
it's like it's on the inside it's not on


---------79:40----------
the outside and that no amount of


---------79:42----------
hobbies anime gaming Netflix or


---------79:45----------
girlfriends because it sounds like you


---------79:47----------
do pretty well for yourself


---------79:48----------
I am very first of all probably kind of


---------79:53----------
thing yeah but no amount of that stuff


---------79:56----------
is gonna make that go away because


---------79:58----------
you've been like that's like a statement


---------80:00----------
of science like it's a statement of


---------80:01----------
empiricism because you've tried it all


---------80:04----------
right you've tried three-month breaks


---------80:06----------
you've tried watching anime you've found


---------80:08----------
a really fun game you have a girlfriend


---------80:10----------
you're doing all of the things that


---------80:11----------
should make the feelings go away but


---------80:13----------
they don't go away so the first thing to


---------80:16----------
understand is that burnout is coming


---------80:18----------
from here not something on the outside


---------80:20----------
okay and what is burnout the two themes


---------80:25----------
that I'm hearing from you are feeling


---------80:28----------
forced to play feeling forced into


---------80:31----------
things and that I think is tied to


---------80:34----------
people not listening I think somewhere


---------80:36----------
along the way like you sort of learned


---------80:38----------
the lesson that people don't listen and


---------80:40----------
it hurts and so you've got to go back


---------80:44----------
and you've got to explore that hurt like


---------80:47----------
when people should have listened and


---------80:48----------
they did


---------80:49----------
when riot listen didn't lists they


---------80:52----------
should have listened and they didn't


---------80:54----------
right when your teammates should have


---------80:57----------
listened and they didn't when


---------80:59----------
twitch chat should have listened because


---------81:00----------
you've answered a thousand times and


---------81:02----------
they didn't and you're gonna see this


---------81:05----------
pop up because I can predict that the


---------81:07----------
conflict that you have with your


---------81:09----------
girlfriend is about her not listening I


---------81:16----------
think I don't want to get


---------81:19----------
deep into the bat because uh yeah but I


---------81:23----------
I I want to say that we feel differently


---------81:29----------
about things sure and I all I I just


---------81:36----------
want to clarify that yes this a lot


---------81:39----------
everything you just said yeah I feel


---------81:41----------
that way but I just want to clarify that


---------81:43----------
I'm also not the perfect human being


---------81:47----------
we're not talking about her being right


---------81:50----------
or wrong and we're not talking about


---------81:51----------
whether she does listen or she doesn't


---------81:53----------
listen what I'm saying is that you were


---------81:56----------
sensitive to people not listening and


---------81:58----------
that you were going to perceive y'all's


---------82:02----------
conflict in early in your relationship


---------82:04----------
is her not listening or anytime that she


---------82:07----------
doesn't listen that's going to hurt you


---------82:10----------
more because you're already wounded


---------82:12----------
there does that make sense it's not even


---------82:15----------
gonna be like like it's reasonable for


---------82:17----------
her to not listen sometimes like


---------82:19----------
partners aren't perfect but what I'm


---------82:21----------
saying is that you've kind of got like a


---------82:22----------
particular vulnerability like that's the


---------82:24----------
 in your armor right that's that's


---------82:26----------
your weak spot that's where you get


---------82:28----------
critically hit okay you're critical hits


---------82:31----------
are around people not listening feeling


---------82:34----------
forced into things that you don't want


---------82:35----------
to do and feeling left all up and those


---------82:39----------
are the things that we've heard you in


---------82:41----------
some way kind of talk about when I ask


---------82:42----------
you you know maybe when have you not


---------82:45----------
been listened to in your like all the


---------82:46----------
 time right so that tells us like


---------82:50----------
that's a weak spot and that's where you


---------82:51----------
get critically hit and so as you go


---------82:53----------
through life but the problem here is


---------82:55----------
that anytime we get critically hit we


---------82:57----------
look on the outside and we say like oh


---------82:59----------
man that weapon hurts a lot but the


---------83:00----------
problem isn't that the weapon is


---------83:02----------
critically hitting you the problem is


---------83:03----------
that you have a weak spot it's not about


---------83:05----------
the weapon it's about you I think I kind


---------83:10----------
of create that weak spot sometimes you


---------83:13----------
absolutely create that weak spot that's


---------83:15----------
my whole point


---------83:17----------
okay excellence is that this stuff you


---------83:20----------
carry with you and comes from within you


---------83:22----------
and that no amount of finding a hobby is


---------83:26----------
gonna keep you from creating that weak


---------83:27----------
spot and this is the really tricky thing


---------83:30----------
because you actually have control over


---------83:32----------
this you


---------83:33----------
absolutely create it and that also gives


---------83:35----------
you power right if you're responsible


---------83:39----------
for something if it's truly your fault


---------83:41----------
and this is a big problem that people do


---------83:43----------
right as we blame things for we blame


---------83:47----------
ourselves for things that were not


---------83:48----------
empowered for like it's like either you


---------83:53----------
have the power we feel powerless and we


---------83:56----------
blame ourselves those two things cannot


---------83:58----------
fit together those two things don't work


---------84:00----------
together if it's your fault then you had


---------84:03----------
the power and if you're powerless it's


---------84:05----------
not your fault but that's not what we


---------84:07----------
tell ourselves we play this a really


---------84:08----------
 up game where we're like we blame


---------84:10----------
ourselves for this but we feel like


---------84:11----------
we're powerful us know and so I do think


---------84:16----------
you can control it I mean control it in


---------84:18----------
the sense of I think you need to heal it


---------84:19----------
it needs healing right it doesn't it's


---------84:22----------
not like and so the question is how so I


---------84:25----------
think the first thing that I would say


---------84:26----------
is notice that look for these three


---------84:29----------
things in your life and notice when they


---------84:30----------
pop up are you feeling left are you


---------84:33----------
feeling like a top laner is this


---------84:36----------
the top lane all over again well


---------84:38----------
you're trying to do stuff and like


---------84:40----------
you're trying to pay bills and no one's


---------84:41----------
helping you pay bills and you're


---------84:43----------
supposed to take care of this and you're


---------84:44----------
supposed to take care of that and you've


---------84:45----------
been left out in the wind that's a


---------84:47----------
feeling you should look for number two


---------84:51----------
feeling is like wonder when do people


---------84:52----------
not listen so look for those things just


---------84:55----------
notice them within yourselves and as you


---------84:56----------
notice them recognize that those may or


---------84:59----------
may not be applicable to the actual


---------85:01----------
situation that some of this is coming


---------85:03----------
from you it's not actually that the you


---------85:05----------
know the dagger is like an a piece of


---------85:06----------
epic gear it's that you have a weak spot


---------85:08----------
like it's not like the problems aren't


---------85:10----------
in the external world they're in here


---------85:11----------
and the first thing you've got to do is


---------85:13----------
train yourself to look within instead of


---------85:15----------
look outside okay


---------85:17----------
second thing is to think back to where


---------85:20----------
that that weakness became exposed


---------85:23----------
because you have to go back to like when


---------85:26----------
this started like so when are the times


---------85:28----------
in your life and you did a good job


---------85:29----------
today like when were you not listened to


---------85:32----------
right and I'll ask you questions like


---------85:34----------
when else was your dad mean to you I


---------85:35----------
would imagine that the belt was used a


---------85:37----------
couple of times you're like no one


---------85:38----------
actually wasn't surprising but fine


---------85:40----------
right sometimes the belt is a one time


---------85:42----------
thing and then you laughed and you're


---------85:44----------
like oh by the way and so


---------85:47----------
your mind is linking that to your dad


---------85:49----------
being mean even though you say it while


---------85:53----------
you're laughing and he laughs about it


---------85:54----------
and you even sort of demonstrate like


---------85:56----------
that he cared about you after that and


---------85:58----------
was nicer to you so even though that


---------85:59----------
story has a positive spin you gave me


---------86:02----------
that answer when I asked about your dad


---------86:04----------
being me so there's some part of your


---------86:07----------
mind that equates your dad being mean


---------86:09----------
there and the more that I push you on


---------86:10----------
that you're like yeah you're making me


---------86:11----------
feel like an and you're making


---------86:13----------
me my dad look like an and then


---------86:15----------
you feel protective and defensive which


---------86:16----------
is fine but my point is the story isn't


---------86:19----------
funny right what jokes are funny


---------86:24----------
like dr. Kaiser boomer hahaha that's


---------86:26----------
funny


---------86:29----------
right like memes like I also Google


---------86:32----------
myself but the reason I googled myself


---------86:34----------
is because people make fun of me and


---------86:36----------
they just do a really good job and I


---------86:37----------
think it's actually where these people


---------86:40----------
are very creative yeah that shit's funny


---------86:47----------
getting hit in the face with a baseball


---------86:49----------
by your dad who's pissed at you for


---------86:50----------
being a that's not funny


---------86:55----------
and so somewhere along the way like you


---------86:58----------
become disconnected from your internal


---------87:00----------
environment that - you've got to like


---------87:03----------
reconnect with like you've got to you


---------87:05----------
know get in touch with your feelings bro


---------87:07----------
you know cuz there's a lot there and


---------87:10----------
then like last thing is like you should


---------87:12----------
think about seeing a therapist if you


---------87:14----------
aren't already


---------87:14----------
yeah I've I've been I'm actually been


---------87:19----------
connected with one that I'm going to


---------87:23----------
start good doing yeah and something that


---------87:26----------
I told him well that him but my


---------87:29----------
girlfriend told me to do also and I


---------87:31----------
don't think that I definitely should do


---------87:34----------
and and so I it's like work on this


---------87:38----------
stuff right like start to talk about


---------87:39----------
those things and start to talk about how


---------87:41----------
you feel because end of the day I don't


---------87:43----------
think you have to live a life where you


---------87:45----------
feel burnt out and the last thing which


---------87:48----------
we don't have kind of too much time to


---------87:50----------
talk about is I think your brain has a


---------87:51----------
lot of signs of dopamine exhaustion


---------87:53----------
which is like when when you sort of get


---------87:56----------
hit with dopamine time and time and time


---------87:58----------
again through extensive years of game


---------88:00----------
and stuff like that stuff can feel blase


---------88:03----------
monotone or less fun and and then I you


---------88:08----------
know I I think that like doing something


---------88:10----------
like a dopamine fast may be a good idea


---------88:12----------
or like a dopamine cleanse


---------88:14----------
what are you kind of like you can really


---------88:17----------
recalibrate your brain and then the last


---------88:19----------
thing that you can do is and I've talked


---------88:23----------
about that before on stream like it's on


---------88:25----------
YouTube and stuff and I'll give people


---------88:26----------
more details about that but the last


---------88:29----------
thing that you can do is meditate and if


---------88:32----------
you want to learn some meditation I can


---------88:34----------
teach you today okay you have it all


---------88:38----------
greens with meditation I've been told to


---------88:41----------
try it before and I feel like I've


---------88:43----------
pretended to do it but I'd never really


---------88:47----------
you know I feel like giving it a shot


---------88:50----------
today or maybe pretending or do you want


---------88:52----------
to bow out oh no


---------88:54----------
I'll try whatever the her hmm actually


---------88:59----------
there are cases reports of meditation


---------89:01----------
induced psychosis so but I don't think


---------89:04----------
that's gonna happen with you I hope no


---------89:06----------
yeah but yeah so let's let me just think


---------89:12----------
I want to


---------89:16----------
technique that I think is gonna be a


---------89:17----------
little bit hard to learn because it


---------89:19----------
feels super awkward but I feel like it's


---------89:21----------
the right technique for you is it okay


---------89:23----------
if I we try that yeah I'm gonna teach


---------89:26----------
you something called bellows breath okay


---------89:29----------
so if you need to blow your nose you can


---------89:30----------
start by blowing your nose I can't but


---------89:33----------
so I want you to sit up straight and I'm


---------89:36----------
gonna demonstrate once okay so what I'm


---------89:40----------
gonna do is take 30 breaths I'm gonna do


---------89:43----------
30 strong exhalations where I push the


---------89:47----------
air out and then I'm gonna kind of have


---------89:48----------
like a super quick and shallow


---------89:50----------
inhalation and then I'm gonna push it


---------89:53----------
out again push it out again push it out


---------89:55----------
out again so I'm gonna like basically


---------89:57----------
forcefully exhale 30 times so I'll just


---------90:01----------
demonstrate and then let me know if you


---------90:02----------
understand it it's gonna feel weird but


---------90:04----------
I'll just start


---------90:36----------
that makes sense forcefully


---------90:41----------
excelling 30 times yeah we're out in it


---------90:45----------
without inhale you have to inhale right


---------90:48----------
okay exhale without inhaling yeah but


---------90:51----------
the emphasis is gonna be on the exhale


---------90:53----------
so what I'm gonna ask you to do is let's


---------90:55----------
try five breaths where you kind of boom


---------90:58----------
boom boom boom boom that's what I want


---------91:03----------
you to do so


---------91:04----------
close your eyes forcefully exhale good


---------91:13----------
right so now we're gonna do it again


---------91:16----------
that's perfect


---------91:17----------
even it'll out a little bit right so you


---------91:20----------
went boom boom boom boom boom


---------91:24----------
so do try to make it even five more in


---------91:29----------
that order or just just making it even


---------91:31----------
just make it even okay okay good


---------91:39----------
so you're noticing that the breath is


---------91:41----------
gonna go a little bit more shallow as


---------91:43----------
you go towards the end so now I want you


---------91:47----------
to space them out just a little bit


---------91:49----------
don't go quite as fast five more a


---------91:51----------
little bit slower okay good any history


---------92:03----------
of asthma


---------92:08----------
No okay so now we're gonna do 15 okay


---------92:14----------
and just focus on one two and go at that


---------92:18----------
pace that you just went oh girl


---------92:41----------
okay I might've lost count that's okay


---------92:45----------
don't worry about it losing counts


---------92:46----------
perfectly fine so how do you feel right


---------92:48----------
now do you feel silly or anything no I


---------92:56----------
just feel fine okay so now what I'm


---------92:59----------
gonna tell you to do now we're gonna


---------93:00----------
really learn the practice okay so now I


---------93:03----------
want you to go for 20 breaths and if you


---------93:06----------
lose count actually you just you just


---------93:08----------
breathe I'm just gonna let you know it's


---------93:10----------
gonna be about 20 breaths and I'll tell


---------93:12----------
you when to stop and what what the real


---------93:14----------
practices is after the 20 breaths you're


---------93:18----------
gonna enter a space in your mind that I


---------93:21----------
want you to just sit in and notice that


---------93:23----------
last breath after you're done with the


---------93:25----------
practice you're naturally gonna take a


---------93:26----------
breath and just be completely in that


---------93:28----------
breath as much as possible okay


---------93:31----------
that's focus so you giving me the cue or


---------93:35----------
I'm gonna give you the cue I'm gonna


---------93:37----------
tell you when to stop and I want you to


---------93:39----------
leave your eyes closed I'm gonna tell


---------93:40----------
you when to open your eyes again and


---------93:43----------
just sit in the space after the practice


---------93:45----------
and whatever comes up let it come up


---------93:48----------
try not to engage with your thoughts so


---------93:51----------
if you have a thought that's fine but


---------93:53----------
then just like let it go and just focus


---------93:56----------
on the way that you feel okay okay it


---------94:00----------
sounds kind of weird until you do it


---------94:02----------
alright so close your eyes deep breath


---------94:05----------
in and begin


---------94:23----------
good


---------94:51----------
and now we're gonna begin again 20 more


---------94:54----------
I'll keep count and I'll count down from


---------94:56----------
5 4 3 2 1 to signal the end and keep


---------94:59----------
your eyes closed and sit with that last


---------95:01----------
breath let's begin again 5 4 3 2 1


---------95:22----------
that's it


---------95:53----------
one last time 20 breaths I'll count down


---------95:58----------
from five go ahead and start five four


---------96:15----------
three two one


---------97:11----------
now I want you to take a deep breath in


---------97:13----------
for three seconds and out for three


---------97:24----------
in four five and not four five


---------97:38----------
and now in four seven and out for seven


---------97:44----------
slow slow slow


---------97:58----------
and you're ready open your eyes come on


---------98:00----------
back to us tears


---------98:04----------
you


---------98:16----------
we feel


---------98:23----------
feel like I took a nap and


---------98:25----------
woke up why did you feel like you were


---------98:29----------
asleep


---------98:32----------
what is that


---------98:40----------
it kind of felt similar to the tingling


---------98:44----------
sensation of dreaming why do we why do


---------98:50----------
we describe meditation like sleep right


---------98:54----------
it's kind of weird what was your mind


---------98:56----------
doing during that practice try not


---------99:02----------
anything and what are you trying to not


---------99:06----------
think about anything or were you not


---------99:07----------
thinking about anything


---------99:15----------
I think that I would


---------99:17----------
imagining like a background and that was


---------99:21----------
a what do you mean by imagining a


---------99:23----------
background space


---------99:34----------
learn to like a view of a sunset just


---------99:38----------
imagining backgrounds and thinking of


---------99:40----------
nothing else okay yes I I think you know


---------99:44----------
it's interesting because people often


---------99:46----------
say like what she said they use sleep or


---------99:49----------
dreaming to kind of describe it it's


---------99:51----------
because this our conscious mind which we


---------99:53----------
operate with most of the time being on


---------99:56----------
actually turns off for a little while


---------99:59----------
and that's why we call it sleep you


---------100:00----------
weren't to sleep but it feels like you


---------100:03----------
took a nap right there's some amount of


---------100:05----------
rejuvenation but the most important


---------100:07----------
thing is that it sounds like you stepped


---------100:09----------
outside of your mind for at least a


---------100:10----------
little while for moments here there and


---------100:13----------
in my experience of this practice that


---------100:16----------
first breath after the 20 exhalation is


---------100:20----------
like very very soothing calming and kind


---------100:23----------
of like outside of mind I kind of get


---------100:26----------
enveloped or wrapped up in that breath


---------100:28----------
does that make any sense or your


---------100:31----------
experience could have been different


---------100:31----------
everyone sort of experiences a different


---------100:33----------
I think it was the birth after you told


---------100:40----------
me to stop is the one where I felt the


---------100:43----------
most cuz I think the last couple of


---------100:47----------
breasts were it was like three seconds


---------100:49----------
five seconds seven seconds I'm thinking


---------100:51----------
about breathing in that amount of time


---------100:54----------
mm-hm rather than just doing it


---------100:56----------
naturally yeah because as I direct your


---------100:59----------
mind it turns on and then when it


---------101:02----------
becomes natural it can turn off and so I


---------101:06----------
don't know that this is the right


---------101:09----------
technique for you but I think that other


---------101:12----------
kinds of techniques could be very


---------101:14----------
difficult because I think your mind is


---------101:15----------
gonna need lots of stimulation and is


---------101:19----------
also going to need to be quite exhausted


---------101:21----------
to be calm so I think if I were to sit


---------101:26----------
there and ask you to observe your


---------101:27----------
thoughts maybe that's gonna be difficult


---------101:28----------
for you


---------101:29----------
so kebab potty or bellows breath is good


---------101:32----------
because it's like something that's kind


---------101:34----------
of active does that make sense you have


---------101:36----------
this period of intense activity which


---------101:38----------
then exhausts you and lets you enter


---------101:40----------
that state whereas if I tell you to go


---------101:43----------
straight to that state your mind is


---------101:44----------
gonna wander through the


---------101:48----------
tired huh yeah unless I'm unless I'm


---------101:51----------
tired


---------101:52----------
you'd be surprised even if you're


---------101:54----------
physically tired or mentally tired


---------101:55----------
sometimes the mind wanders more at those


---------101:57----------
times but you can try it when you're


---------101:59----------
tired okay so kind of focus exhaustion


---------102:02----------
or expending the energy of the the mind


---------102:05----------
or emptying your gas tank so that you


---------102:08----------
can sit in that emptiness is sometimes


---------102:10----------
what works for people like you so give


---------102:13----------
it a shot you can practice it I'd say


---------102:15----------
three to five minutes starting three to


---------102:17----------
five days a week if you want to be a


---------102:18----------
try-hard


---------102:19----------
League of Legends pro then you can you


---------102:22----------
know grind it out five minutes a day for


---------102:25----------
seven days a week


---------102:26----------
I'll do it casually because I think that


---------102:30----------
it's like one of those things where I


---------102:34----------
guess so there's people are caffeine


---------102:36----------
addicts I only drink one cup of coffee


---------102:39----------
at most a day because I feel like I get


---------102:42----------
the most out of it sure sure or people


---------102:46----------
that are drinking alcohol they drink a


---------102:50----------
lot that gring gain tolerance but the


---------102:52----------
less tolerance you have the cheaper it


---------102:54----------
is to get drunk sure you know I don't


---------102:57----------
really think meditation works like that


---------102:59----------
and in fact I mean I think I think the


---------103:04----------
one thing that I really like is that it


---------103:05----------
sounds like you're gonna make your own


---------103:07----------
exploration for it which i think is


---------103:08----------
exactly how you should do it okay any


---------103:12----------
questions for me before we kind of wrap


---------103:14----------
up for the day any last thoughts no I


---------103:19----------
just want to thank you for having me


---------103:21----------
that's been a very big eye-opener and I


---------103:24----------
didn't feel like I could feel this way


---------103:27----------
feel what way play


---------103:33----------
my point of view changed what instead of


---------103:36----------
looking at what's on the outside it


---------103:38----------
really is more on the inside I've been


---------103:41----------
looking for answers in the wrong places


---------103:44----------
yeah and I think that's why so


---------103:47----------
beautifully put


---------103:48----------
dyrus because I think the basic reason


---------103:51----------
that we don't move forward is because


---------103:55----------
it's not because we suck right like and


---------103:57----------
this is the really sad thing is that


---------103:58----------
when we look for answers in the wrong


---------104:00----------
places and we don't find them and we


---------104:02----------
don't get better we start to think less


---------104:04----------
about ourselves right we start to think


---------104:07----------
of ourselves as incompetent and lazy and


---------104:10----------
you know like but it's not it's not that


---------104:13----------
you're lazy it's just that you haven't


---------104:15----------
been taught right you don't know where


---------104:17----------
to look and like it's not your fault


---------104:19----------
that you're looking in the wrong place


---------104:21----------
and it's not that you suck or anything


---------104:25----------
like that it's just you know if I if I


---------104:27----------
go fishing in a bathtub I'm never gonna


---------104:29----------
catch any fish but like that's how we


---------104:33----------
live our life as we go fishing in


---------104:35----------
bathtubs every day and then we think


---------104:36----------
that we're incompetent fishermen it's


---------104:38----------
like it's just not how it works man yes


---------104:41----------
I mean yeah not getting of all kinds of


---------104:44----------
scenarios or you can catch a lot of


---------104:45----------
stuff out of your bathtub but anyway but


---------104:49----------
listen man I'm glad that this has been


---------104:51----------
helpful for you I'm sorry I couldn't


---------104:54----------
guide you a little bit more I mean I


---------104:56----------
think it is a big step to recognize that


---------104:58----------
it's on the inside and I really hope I'm


---------105:01----------
happy to help you you know down the road


---------105:02----------
or I really hope you can find someone to


---------105:05----------
help you in that internal exploration


---------105:08----------
and the crazy thing Dyer says I'm not


---------105:10----------
even so sure that you're gonna need that


---------105:11----------
much help because the last thing that


---------105:14----------
I'd share with you is I think you and I


---------105:15----------
think a surprising number of people on


---------105:17----------
Twitch on I mean I think we're all


---------105:18----------
actually very intelligent and very


---------105:20----------
capable I think the idea that we even


---------105:22----------
need someone's help comes from the fact


---------105:24----------
that we've been fishing in a bathtub our


---------105:26----------
entire life and not catching any fish


---------105:27----------
mm-hmm and and all we need to do is


---------105:30----------
point you in the right direction and


---------105:31----------
your natural intelligence your natural


---------105:34----------
tendency to like learn and grow and


---------105:36----------
reflect and analyze and to put your


---------105:38----------
minds to something and accomplish it all


---------105:41----------
of those strengths are gonna support you


---------105:43----------
in this way you they were just pointed


---------105:44----------
in the wrong direction


---------105:45----------
you know I think it's good that you're


---------105:47----------
seeing a therapist because I think


---------105:48----------
that'll facilitate things yeah I think


---------105:52----------
like all of this stuff I've been


---------105:54----------
thinking about for I guess the last


---------105:57----------
three to four years but it's like oh


---------106:01----------
maybe it's this or that but by you doing


---------106:05----------
this it's really solidifies the fact


---------106:08----------
that yeah I really shouldn't be fishing


---------106:11----------
in a bathtub I really I really shouldn't


---------106:14----------
be it's it really ties a bow on it like


---------106:19----------
you said well I'm happy to hear that


---------106:21----------
because I was afraid but yeah man so


---------106:24----------
listen I wish you all the best of luck


---------106:26----------
and you know keep us posted and if I can


---------106:28----------
help you in some other way let me know


---------106:29----------
and and you know if the meditation


---------106:32----------
doesn't work out for you or something


---------106:34----------
like that and you want a different


---------106:34----------
technique just shoot me in DM or


---------106:36----------
whatever and and good luck man thank you


---------106:41----------
thank you so much I appreciate it alone


---------106:43----------
all right take care of man I have a good


---------106:46----------
one peace


---------106:52----------
all right dyrus pong dyrus is great man


---------106:56----------
oh man I hope I hope I really hope


---------107:00----------
things work out for him Dyer's pod do I


---------107:06----------
need to tell you guys that y'all should


---------107:08----------
meditate along when I teach other people


---------107:10----------
meditation or is that kind of like deal


---------107:11----------
does that understood at this point


---------107:16----------
you


---------107:20----------
okay good understood I don't okay so


---------107:26----------
like yeah I mean so in the future you


---------107:27----------
know I just realized it I didn't tell


---------107:29----------
you guys to go along with it but y'all


---------107:30----------
should y'all should do it too I'll try


---------107:33----------
to remember to say it okay so let's


---------107:38----------
think a little bit about let's kind of


---------107:44----------
try to recap so I think the key


---------107:46----------
takeaways from from listening to dyrus I


---------107:48----------
think is stuff that you know hopefully


---------107:50----------
y'all caught as I was explaining it to


---------107:52----------
him so that so I think we have to be


---------107:53----------
really careful about how we solve


---------107:55----------
problems and we have to be careful about


---------107:58----------
you know the answers that we come up


---------108:00----------
with if they don't really fit and we


---------108:01----------
should be scientific because you know if


---------108:04----------
you think that I think burnout is a


---------108:06----------
great example in it like we asked about


---------108:08----------
burnout and it says okay it was because


---------108:09----------
I was like a pro-gamer fine and then it


---------108:12----------
was a streamer fine and then I took


---------108:13----------
three months off and it helped a little


---------108:15----------
bit it's like wait what you know it it's


---------108:19----------
kind of like if I say like yeah why are


---------108:22----------
you why is your hair wet and it's like


---------108:23----------
yeah because I'm in the shower and then


---------108:25----------
someone else is like okay well why is


---------108:27----------
your hair wet it's like I'm it's because


---------108:29----------
I'm in the bathtub and then even when I


---------108:31----------
go outside and it's a sunny day like I


---------108:33----------
get rained on or something I had the


---------108:36----------
analogy fell apart in my mind but my


---------108:37----------
point is that like you know you should


---------108:39----------
be critical about the notions that you


---------108:41----------
have about where your problems come from


---------108:43----------
and oftentimes we're we're thinking


---------108:47----------
about that and he absolutely meant just


---------108:50----------
that you know that's that's one one hell


---------108:53----------
of an aborted fetus of an analogy let me


---------108:55----------
tell you what it just didn't do it


---------109:02----------
thanks for the donation


---------109:03----------
dyrus and in Skull Kid so yeah sometimes


---------109:10----------
sometimes thoughts come out is stillborn


---------109:13----------
and I don't know how else to put it it's


---------109:15----------
just sometimes dr. gay has brilliant


---------109:19----------
realizations and sometimes he has just


---------109:21----------
really frankenstone me and little


---------109:23----------
homunculus five children and that's what


---------109:27----------
we're here for right


---------109:27----------
it's for the it's for the walls of oh


---------109:31----------
 man


---------109:34----------
lyza age says dr. dr. k I wanted to


---------109:38----------
donate to honor the memory of my friend


---------109:40----------
who took his life four years ago


---------109:41----------
yesterday I can't see the rest of it but


---------109:44----------
you know work is incredible and I I hope


---------109:47----------
well dude I'm sorry that your your


---------109:48----------
friend took his life four years ago can


---------109:51----------
I just talk about that for a second I'm


---------109:52----------
gonna say something that I I've been


---------109:54----------
thinking a lot about suicide recently


---------109:56----------
and I have a patient who killed


---------110:00----------
themselves about a year ago and I have


---------110:02----------
another patient who I'm afraid is gonna


---------110:04----------
kill themselves in the next year or two


---------110:06----------
and it it's kind of rough right like


---------110:09----------
when we think about suicide and we think


---------110:11----------
about it's it's rough when people take


---------110:15----------
their own life and you know the crazy


---------110:21----------
part of me is like there's a there's a


---------110:23----------
part of me and as especially as I think


---------110:25----------
about the people that I work with it and


---------110:27----------
we have this assumption that suicide is


---------110:29----------
wrong and I don't think you guys should


---------110:31----------
kill yourselves but I also feel like the


---------110:34----------
more that I understand people who


---------110:35----------
struggle it makes sense to me right if


---------110:40----------
we if we're being really honest about it


---------110:41----------
like some people suffer and the person


---------110:43----------
that I'm worried about now has been


---------110:45----------
suffering for years and they have tried


---------110:48----------
so so hard to get better and they're


---------110:54----------
they're trying and like every day for


---------110:56----------
them is a struggle and it's not like


---------110:58----------
every day is a struggle like every day


---------110:59----------
is a struggle it's like every day is


---------111:02----------
just torturous it's like they wake up


---------111:04----------
every day and they're like in like they


---------111:06----------
just it's like another day of torture


---------111:08----------
and you know there are bright spots here


---------111:11----------
and there they have some physical


---------111:12----------
illness too which you know really


---------111:14----------
doesn't help they have bright spots here


---------111:16----------
and there we're trying to figure out you


---------111:18----------
know how to help this person and when


---------111:20----------
it's not really working like nothing's


---------111:21----------
really working and and and we have to


---------111:26----------
acknowledge that that feeling is real


---------111:28----------
right like I think sometimes it's a


---------111:31----------
little bit ignorant for us to assume


---------111:33----------
that I mean I think I think it's just


---------111:36----------
uncompassionate to say to everyone yeah


---------111:39----------
you should absolutely live I think you


---------111:41----------
should absolutely live but I think you


---------111:43----------
should be honest with yourself because I


---------111:44----------
do think that there's hope


---------111:47----------
but I think that it's also important to


---------111:49----------
acknowledge that like some people really


---------111:51----------
do suffer and when I've worked with


---------111:52----------
people who are suicidal the crazy thing


---------111:55----------
is like it's not you know it's a game


---------111:58----------
that they've been trying to play for


---------111:59----------
years and years and years and then like


---------112:01----------
eventually they just don't want to play


---------112:03----------
it and that's not crazy


---------112:07----------
right like I think this is one of the


---------112:10----------
craziest things about suicide as we


---------112:11----------
think about these people is mentally ill


---------112:13----------
which sometimes they are but we kind of


---------112:15----------
say it like when we say that that's


---------112:17----------
crazy you're kind of invalidating like


---------112:19----------
what they feel and what they think and


---------112:20----------
one of the things that I've learned as a


---------112:21----------
psychiatrist is that being suicidal is


---------112:24----------
not crazy and and the really bizarre


---------112:27----------
thing is that the more that I think


---------112:29----------
about suicidal people is not crazy but


---------112:32----------
completely sane that's when you can help


---------112:35----------
them and that's where a actually comes


---------112:40----------
from it's really bizarre it's not that


---------112:43----------
hope like hope doesn't come from


---------112:45----------
ignoring your situation and pretending


---------112:48----------
that something else's can exist that's


---------112:50----------
fantasy hope comes from starting where


---------112:53----------
you are fantasy is all about your mind


---------112:56----------
where you want to end up right I can


---------112:58----------
look at the top of Mount Everest and I


---------112:59----------
can fantasize about when I reach the top


---------113:02----------
but it's not about where I am it's aware


---------113:03----------
about I imagine I can go and when you


---------113:06----------
tell a suicidal person took that


---------113:09----------
everything's gonna be okay you know


---------113:12----------
that's that doesn't feel real to them


---------113:15----------
and what I really think that if you guys


---------113:18----------
are struggling with suicidality you


---------113:20----------
should absolutely see a professional and


---------113:23----------
and get help with that because it's not


---------113:25----------
fair for you to have to deal with that


---------113:27----------
alone and I do think you can get to the


---------113:30----------
top of Mount Everest


---------113:31----------
but I think getting to the top of Mount


---------113:32----------
Everest and being free from your


---------113:34----------
suicidality and like being free from


---------113:36----------
depression and loving and enjoying life


---------113:39----------
starts with an acknowledgement that like


---------113:41----------
you were filled with despair and you


---------113:43----------
don't know where to go from here and


---------113:47----------
that's tough but I know it sounds


---------113:49----------
absolutely crazy but like I mean come on


---------113:51----------
like if you want to be a good


---------113:52----------
psychiatrist you have to meet your


---------113:54----------
patients where they're at right you


---------113:55----------
can't just pretend that their reality


---------113:57----------
doesn't exist you have to say hey man


---------113:59----------
like I get that you're suffering and I


---------114:01----------
really do see it like honestly it's not


---------114:03----------
crazy to me that you're thinking about


---------114:05----------
killing yourself because I've been


---------114:06----------
working with you for two years now and


---------114:09----------
we've been trying so hard and I feel


---------114:12----------
despair but I'm your treater


---------114:13----------
like you're the one who's actually


---------114:14----------
living it every day and I get that your


---------114:18----------
despair is absolutely real and I don't


---------114:20----------
know that even I have hope for you but


---------114:22----------
you know what I want to keep trying and


---------114:24----------
I want you to keep trying because I


---------114:26----------
don't want you to give up but I don't


---------114:28----------
blame you if you do because I do think


---------114:32----------
that we're getting somewhere like we're


---------114:33----------
making a little bit of progress and we


---------114:35----------
have these high points and if you can


---------114:37----------
have one good day in two years then you


---------114:39----------
can have two good days in the next two


---------114:41----------
years


---------114:43----------
but let's be honest like if that's the


---------114:46----------
way you feel that's the way that you


---------114:48----------
feel and if we want to fix something


---------114:51----------
that's broken let's start out by


---------114:53----------
admitting how broken it is right


---------114:57----------
that you need a new engine and you need


---------114:59----------
new tires and you need new axles and you


---------115:01----------
need new seatbelts and you need a new


---------115:02----------
steering wheel like fine like I get that


---------115:04----------
that feels impossible to you but if you


---------115:07----------
are willing to give me a chance I'm


---------115:08----------
gonna keep trying and I need your help


---------115:10----------
to keep trying that's how I feel is that


---------115:16----------
it's not it's not crazy right like the


---------115:18----------
to call a suicidal person crazy is just


---------115:20----------
not helpful


---------115:21----------
these people aren't crazy they're


---------115:23----------
suffering this is their reality and and


---------115:27----------
this is what we need to understand like


---------115:29----------
I think this is one of the biggest


---------115:30----------
problems that has happened with our


---------115:31----------
generation is we call people like


---------115:34----------
especially men who kill themselves we


---------115:36----------
say it's a mental health problem it's


---------115:37----------
depression and that's like such a


---------115:40----------
 cop-out answer right like if


---------115:43----------
someone is in so much despair that they


---------115:48----------
don't see a way forward and they feel


---------115:50----------
burdened with like responsibility and


---------115:54----------
you know they feel like they can't do


---------115:56----------
anything in life like that there's no


---------115:59----------
way for it and they've been trying for


---------116:00----------
so long and they've just they just can't


---------116:03----------
they have no answers and they've been


---------116:05----------
trying it for five years six years 10


---------116:08----------
years 12 years and then they kill


---------116:09----------
themselves and like oh yeah that was


---------116:10----------
illness no it's not illness like that


---------116:15----------
person just needed a little bit of help


---------116:17----------
needed a little bit of a bright point


---------116:19----------
needed a little bit more support and we


---------116:22----------
didn't give it to them it's not illness


---------116:25----------
it's like oh yeah it's a chemical


---------116:27----------
imbalance in your brain not my


---------116:29----------
fault that's it's really dangerous what


---------116:32----------
we've done to men especially because


---------116:34----------
they committed suicide more than women


---------116:36----------
and I see this a lot with men is that we


---------116:39----------
said oh that's a neurochemical imbalance


---------116:40----------
like it's not your fault man it's a


---------116:42----------
neurochemical imbalance but you know


---------116:44----------
what it's not my fault either because


---------116:46----------
it's a neurochemical imbalance oh yeah


---------116:50----------
it's a neurochemical imbalance it's no


---------116:52----------
one's fault it's just


---------116:55----------
you know it's like no one's fault and so


---------116:58----------
when when no one's at fault no one needs


---------117:01----------
to take responsibility and that's where


---------117:03----------
I think we we've up basically as


---------117:06----------
a society with this whole generation


---------117:07----------
we've let all you guys down because what


---------117:11----------
we've done is we've labeled you with


---------117:12----------
illness you said oh yeah you're


---------117:13----------
depressed it's a neurochemical


---------117:14----------
imbalance boomers are like go see a


---------117:18----------
psychiatrist and get an SSRI not my


---------117:20----------
 problem it's it's the biggest


---------117:24----------
cop-out and I mean don't get me wrong


---------117:25----------
like I have a psychiatrist and I


---------117:27----------
believe in mental OSA I'm not saying


---------117:28----------
mental Luce isn't real


---------117:30----------
I'm not like I prescribe medications so


---------117:32----------
I think you guys should all definitely


---------117:34----------
go see psychiatrists and therapists and


---------117:35----------
help with those things because we know


---------117:37----------
those tools can help my point is that


---------117:40----------
that's not the answer it's part of the


---------117:43----------
answer and that there's a whole other


---------117:45----------
part of it there's a whole other part


---------117:48----------
about meaning and caring and like we


---------117:51----------
just look at dyrus dyrus isn't burnt out


---------117:53----------
because his coach made him play too much


---------117:56----------
eSports he's not burnt out because of


---------117:58----------
you guys


---------117:59----------
he's burnt out because no one listened


---------118:04----------
when they needed to he's burnt out


---------118:08----------
cuz he's a he's been a


---------118:09----------
top laner in his whole life like he says


---------118:14----------
his parents are divorced what I want to


---------118:15----------
know is like where was his mom when his


---------118:17----------
dad threw a baseball into his face right


---------118:23----------
like what happened like why didn't


---------118:27----------
someone stick up for him when the


---------118:30----------
teachers put him in anger management but


---------118:32----------
just think about that for a second right


---------118:34----------
kids come up to you and bully you and


---------118:37----------
then you fight back and then they stick


---------118:39----------
your ass in anger management where the


---------118:42----------
 is his lawyer abandonment it's not


---------118:50----------
fair and it's not right and then the kid


---------118:54----------
gets labeled with anger management


---------118:55----------
problems it's an illness it's a


---------118:59----------
neurochemical imbalance in your brain


---------119:00----------
you have anger management problems


---------119:02----------
you're just broken in here man


---------119:04----------
it's not your fault but you're just


---------119:06----------
 broken and the normal kids are


---------119:08----------
over here so learn how to manage your


---------119:10----------
feelings we're gonna teach you some


---------119:11----------
useful skills fine there's some useful


---------119:13----------
skills


---------119:14----------
I'm not saying an anger management is


---------119:15----------
bad but I'm saying that like where we're


---------119:17----------
doing something very very dangerous by


---------119:20----------
protocol izing and pathologizing a lot


---------119:23----------
of normal experience we're absolving


---------119:26----------
ourselves a responsibility right I still


---------119:32----------
remember I talked about this with Anita


---------119:34----------
that you know it's kind of bizarre but I


---------119:36----------
was working with a guy who's in jail and


---------119:38----------
the reason he was in jail is because he


---------119:40----------
started selling drugs at the age of 16


---------119:41----------
because his three older sisters said


---------119:43----------
that what a man does is provide and you


---------119:47----------
have to provide for your older sisters


---------119:48----------
otherwise you're not a man so how the


---------119:49----------
 does a 16 year old provide for


---------119:52----------
three adult women since drugs and then


---------119:57----------
he gets suicidal only then I come in and


---------120:00----------
I talked to him and like I talk


---------120:03----------
for a while and I realized man this guy


---------120:04----------
is so a pill is not gonna fix


---------120:07----------
this this is not a neurochemical is


---------120:09----------
there a neuro come chemical balance


---------120:11----------
absolutely will medication help him but


---------120:14----------
is it gonna fix it no this guy needs to


---------120:18----------
understand that like you know he was not


---------120:20----------
taught that adult like 16 year old boys


---------120:23----------
should not be financially responsible


---------120:25----------
for three adults and you think about


---------120:29----------
this you go back to an Eden you just


---------120:30----------
think about what she was taught she


---------120:33----------
loves her mother and her mother sounds


---------120:34----------
like she had very serious challenges and


---------120:36----------
we're not gonna blame her for that and


---------120:38----------
at the same time what was in either time


---------120:39----------
what were we taught


---------120:42----------
why are kids mean because they're taught


---------120:45----------
to be me what were you guys taught how


---------120:48----------
were you taught every time you


---------120:50----------
you go fishing in the bathtub you're


---------120:52----------
taught and then like society looks to


---------120:54----------
your parents like why haven't you


---------120:56----------
graduated yet like why did you fail out


---------120:58----------
of college like why don't you have a job


---------120:59----------
I haven't you moved out


---------121:00----------
 boomers are like these kids


---------121:03----------
nowadays like they're not buying rings


---------121:05----------
and they're not buying houses and they


---------121:07----------
don't know how to work like what what


---------121:09----------
birth man


---------121:10----------
why do you think that is where do you


---------121:13----------
think we learned how to be lazy oh yeah


---------121:15----------
we learned it from the boomer generation


---------121:16----------
because they had everything handed to


---------121:18----------
them


---------121:19----------
this bizarre do you think maybe maybe


---------121:25----------
instead of us being an entire generation


---------121:27----------
it's an entire generation right you


---------121:30----------
think like maybe an entire generation


---------121:31----------
just learned the same lesson


---------121:33----------
which is completely the opposite of what


---------121:35----------
the generation before us learned it's


---------121:37----------
just like we went 180 no generations


---------121:41----------
kids learn what their parents teach them


---------121:43----------
oh it's it's not like we all grow up in


---------121:46----------
America speaking English an entire


---------121:47----------
generation grows up speaking Swahili


---------121:51----------
that's not how it works we speak English


---------121:53----------
because you guys speak English


---------121:56----------
we were taught our values because you


---------121:58----------
guys taught it to us and the world is a


---------122:01----------
different place and that formula doesn't


---------122:03----------
work anymore


---------122:05----------
but no oh it's mental illness Oh mental


---------122:08----------
illness yeah just absolve yourselves of


---------122:10----------
all responsibility mental


---------122:15----------
illness so yeah I mean I don't mean once


---------122:19----------
again don't get me wrong mental and this


---------122:20----------
is real I think we should treat it


---------122:22----------
seriously I think if you guys are


---------122:23----------
feeling suicidal you should get help but


---------122:27----------
also cut yourself a break because you're


---------122:29----------
not broken in here the reason that you


---------122:31----------
feel that way is completely legitimate


---------122:33----------
and if you've been struggling for a


---------122:35----------
while those struggles are real and if


---------122:39----------
you feel like you're in despair that's


---------122:41----------
not your fault it's our fault


---------122:44----------
because life is a multiplayer game boys


---------122:47----------
and girls


---------122:49----------
it's a multiplayer game twitch is a


---------122:51----------
multiplayer platform it's all


---------122:53----------
multiplayer so how can you blame


---------122:55----------
yourself like sure do you should you do


---------122:58----------
more absolutely but it's a


---------123:01----------
multiplayer game


---------123:07----------
so get get the help that you need and


---------123:10----------
more importantly help out the person


---------123:12----------
that needs it right ask the question


---------123:15----------
that like people aren't willing to ask


---------123:17----------
if you ask them when how are you doing


---------123:19----------
today look actually look them in the eye


---------123:21----------
be like how are you actually doing today


---------123:23----------
let that question mean something an AoE


---------123:27----------
healing is not about like me you know


---------123:29----------
spraying AoE on all of you guys I mean


---------123:32----------
it is but like what a Oh a healing is


---------123:34----------
really about I think if you really look


---------123:36----------
at it deeply it's about like you guys


---------123:37----------
becoming hewers to I mean all you have


---------123:40----------
to do become a healer is like fix


---------123:41----------
yourself and then it'll come naturally


---------123:43----------
like just fix yourselves I mean just fix


---------123:46----------
yourself something just fix yourself


---------123:49----------
millennial boomers fix yourself


---------123:52----------
just know well I'm saying like all you


---------123:56----------
have to do is fix yourself focus on


---------123:58----------
yourself let you be your Karma let you


---------124:01----------
be your focus you can come first stop


---------124:04----------
 putting other people first


---------124:07----------
right I'm talking to Anita you can come


---------124:10----------
first sometimes like sometimes like 10%


---------124:13----------
of the time you could come first


---------124:16----------
you can come first and you should you


---------124:18----------
should come first right cuz like you're


---------124:20----------
a entitled millennial Jenn's e


---------124:22----------
tick tock YouTube twitch person you're a


---------124:28----------
special snowflake like it's so weird


---------124:30----------
like we we I mean I'm all for special


---------124:34----------
snowflakes and that people can be


---------124:35----------
narcissistic but at the same time like


---------124:37----------
so just think about this for a second


---------124:38----------
we're essentially like telling a


---------124:40----------
generation of people that they should


---------124:42----------
grow the up


---------124:44----------
no like take yourself seriously like


---------124:46----------
accept responsibility for what you do


---------124:47----------
right and accept responsibility for what


---------124:49----------
you do wrong and don't take


---------124:51----------
responsibility for what other people do


---------124:53----------
wrong


---------124:55----------
just because someone calls you a special


---------124:57----------
snowflake doesn't mean that you're doing


---------124:59----------
something wrong


---------125:02----------
like should you be narcissistic


---------125:03----------
absolutely not should you focus on


---------125:05----------
yourself absolutely should you give


---------125:07----------
yourself that the credit that you're


---------125:09----------
worth absolutely anyway all right so


---------125:21----------
thank you guys very much and yeah so may


---------125:28----------
is mental health awareness month and


---------125:30----------
we're doing a big push


---------125:32----------
I saw low DPM gave us a bunch of gifted


---------125:36----------
subs man low DPM has been supporting our


---------125:38----------
streams since its inception in October


---------125:40----------
and a huge thank you to you know man or


---------125:43----------
woman or anything in between that you


---------125:45----------
are we really appreciate the support so


---------125:48----------
here's the thing we're training coaches


---------125:50----------
because we want to spread this message


---------125:52----------
for each and every one of you who's out


---------125:54----------
there if you need to talk to someone


---------125:56----------
like me we're gonna try to train someone


---------125:58----------
right so they're not like level 60


---------126:00----------
healers they're like level 20 30 40


---------126:04----------
healers depending on which one they're


---------126:06----------
pretty good they can they can raid with


---------126:09----------
you guys you know cuz you guys aren't


---------126:11----------
route level ready for levels and game


---------126:13----------
content anyway y'all are twelve five and


---------126:15----------
ten and twenty so so this is what our


---------126:18----------
coaching program is about and that's why


---------126:20----------
we're raising money is insane


---------126:21----------
that in seven days we were eight to


---------126:22----------
raise $10,000 I didn't know if we were


---------126:24----------
gonna even raise like I didn't know I


---------126:27----------
mean we've never made this much money on


---------126:28----------
screen before like nowhere close to this


---------126:30----------
and it's it's amazing it's amazing and


---------126:33----------
we want to fix this right so like some


---------126:36----------
time ago doctor case showed up on Twitch


---------126:38----------
and he started streaming and then people


---------126:41----------
reached out for help and they were like


---------126:42----------
and then I felt bad because I had to


---------126:45----------
turn not just turn people away I


---------126:46----------
couldn't even answer my emails


---------126:47----------
and so I was talking to a friend of mine


---------126:50----------
and and she was like yeah like there's


---------126:52----------
really she said oh like either you


---------126:54----------
duplicate yourself or there's nothing


---------126:56----------
you can do and she meant like you can't


---------126:58----------
duplicate yourself because that's


---------126:59----------
physically impossible and so you


---------127:00----------
shouldn't feel bad about it because


---------127:01----------
you're just one person she's trying to


---------127:03----------
be supportive and then I was like you


---------127:04----------
know what you're right either I


---------127:07----------
duplicate myself or there's nothing I


---------127:08----------
can do in which case everyone gets let


---------127:10----------
down the world continues people continue


---------127:13----------
to be suicidal and despaired and


---------127:15----------
and then nothing I can do I did the best


---------127:21----------
that I could I did a good job


---------127:23----------
I helped people every day for 40 hours a


---------127:26----------
week 50 hours a week 60 hours a week


---------127:28----------
that's enough and it should be right I


---------127:31----------
should be content with that but I'm not


---------127:32----------
I'm not because I I mean when I was


---------127:37----------
failing out of college and all that


---------127:39----------
and you know full of despair and I


---------127:42----------
realize that's probably sort of an


---------127:43----------
insult like it wasn't a thing back then


---------127:45----------
but I was a nerd that's what we called


---------127:47----------
it and then nerds became cool and Game


---------127:49----------
of Thrones became mainstream in gaming


---------127:51----------
became mainstream and then the thing


---------127:53----------
that I was has become an insult


---------127:56----------
um which is an interesting and you know


---------127:58----------
anthropological kind of analysis but and


---------128:02----------
and so like you know cuz there are


---------128:03----------
people out there like me like you guys


---------128:04----------
are like me like we're the same that's


---------128:06----------
why this works right this works because


---------128:10----------
like I am you and you or me and that's


---------128:12----------
that's why I have hope because we're no


---------128:15----------
different and so I was like you know


---------128:17----------
what you're right I'm gonna I'm gonna


---------128:18----------
duplicate myself and people like oh


---------128:22----------
that's the same like you're so brilliant


---------128:23----------
it's like no guys I don't think you guys


---------128:25----------
understand I'm actually not that


---------128:26----------
brilliant and you guys get if I'm you


---------128:28----------
you or me that means we can duplicate


---------128:30----------
this we can clone this right it's


---------128:33----------
no longer like an MMO


---------128:36----------
it's an RTS and we're gonna build a


---------128:39----------
couple of like barracks and we're gonna


---------128:41----------
start churning out priests because I'm


---------128:43----------
not a hero


---------128:44----------
I'm just a regular unit like we're gonna


---------128:47----------
take an RTS strategy it's not like a


---------128:50----------
single-player game like it's not like


---------128:51----------
Zelda or your link running around and


---------128:54----------
you're like one of a kind


---------128:55----------
it's like Warcraft 3 and we're


---------128:58----------
just gonna churn out


---------128:59----------
you know infantry and we're gonna do it


---------129:02----------
cuz I think that's good enough cuz I


---------129:04----------
think y'all are amazing and I have faith


---------129:05----------
in y'all it's crazy I know oh my god


---------129:08----------
twitch chat is so toxic oh my god like


---------129:10----------
people gamers are so toxic new school


---------129:13----------
shooters this that no I don't I don't


---------129:17----------
buy it


---------129:17----------
thugs ugh absolutely zigzag absolutely


---------129:22----------
so that's what our coaching program is


---------129:24----------
that's why we're raising money because


---------129:26----------
we also understand that a lot of y'all


---------129:27----------
are broke but we also apparently on


---------129:29----------
that a lot of you guys are not and


---------129:31----------
that's pretty awesome that y'all are


---------129:32----------
willing to help and so we're gonna try


---------129:36----------
to make things as affordable as possible


---------129:37----------
and we're gonna make try to make things


---------129:40----------
as fast as possible and as good as


---------129:42----------
possible and so we're doing a bunch of


---------129:44----------
Harvard's Andy stuff behind the scenes


---------129:46----------
in terms of research study design and


---------129:48----------
research and outcome measures and


---------129:51----------
quality assurance and all that kind of


---------129:52----------
 because at the end of the day like


---------129:54----------
how do you determine whether a coach can


---------129:57----------
actually help someone like how do you


---------129:58----------
measure that how do you measure whether


---------130:00----------
someone can actually be helped so a lot


---------130:02----------
of this is gonna fund you know kind of


---------130:05----------
like our quality metrics and research


---------130:07----------
design and stuff like that and we've had


---------130:08----------
I've asked for a couple of people's help


---------130:10----------
and thankfully I just tweeted it out and


---------130:12----------
a couple people from our community of


---------130:13----------
volunteered to help us and that's been


---------130:15----------
actually fantastic and at some point we


---------130:18----------
may get like NIH grants and like


---------130:20----------
that but yeah so that's what we're doing


---------130:23----------
and I'm just grateful for your help


---------130:24----------
because here's the thing I can't do it


---------130:26----------
right like cuz this is the thing you


---------130:27----------
guys got to remember if I'm peon then I


---------130:31----------
can't save you so what I need is a bunch


---------130:37----------
of other peons


---------130:38----------
and we can do it together like when you


---------130:41----------
if you guys have played war 3 or if you


---------130:42----------
guys have played in RTS right you've got


---------130:44----------
a little stuck about Starcraft 2 it's


---------130:46----------
like if you've got like one SCV like one


---------130:48----------
SCV can't do we need a bunch of


---------130:50----------
SCV's and if we've got a bunch of SCV's


---------130:53----------
then we can do a lot of stuff and that's


---------130:55----------
what healthy gamer is about is it if I'm


---------130:58----------
an SCV you're an SUV and you can do it


---------131:00----------
too that's what we're about and so thank


---------131:04----------
you for your help everyone who's been I


---------131:05----------
saw someone else gifted a bunch of subs


---------131:07----------
so thank you for all of the monies and


---------131:12----------
yeah so let's figure out


---------131:20----------
okay so this Friday we have polka mein


---------131:22----------
and I'm still confused about so we're


---------131:30----------
gonna do drunk I guess drinking a ma


---------131:33----------
with dr. kay so I'm just gonna stream


---------131:35----------
for a while and we're gonna shoot the


---------131:37----------
 you guys can post questions on


---------131:38----------
reddit and yeah so here's the link for


---------131:43----------
the reddit if you guys have so a couple


---------131:48----------
of kind of outgoing things okay so if


---------131:50----------
you guys want you can post your


---------131:52----------
questions there and we're just gonna up


---------131:54----------
vote down vote right so that you guys


---------131:57----------
can you know we'll see when we'll answer


---------132:00----------
those questions and then there's gonna


---------132:03----------
be drinking involved because we hit that


---------132:05----------
stretch goal because stupid us we you


---------132:07----------
know I was like oh yeah like we can do


---------132:09----------
like drinking MA like no one's gonna


---------132:11----------
we're not gonna raise $4,000 so some


---------132:14----------
 like that


---------132:14----------
and I think we've also hit the benchmark


---------132:17----------
for learning to play League of Legends


---------132:19----------
and then we're gonna talk to polka mean


---------132:21----------
and I'm still confused about you know I


---------132:22----------
think it depends on what she wants to do


---------132:24----------
about whether I'm inebriated or not


---------132:26----------
because I feel like that's kind of a


---------132:27----------
dick thing to do right to be drinking


---------132:28----------
while I'm talking to someone I feel like


---------132:31----------
it's not fair to them but anyway


---------132:32----------
whatever she wants to do and thank you


---------132:34----------
very much to her for offering to come on


---------132:36----------
and support us and yeah so yeah so


---------132:43----------
that's gonna be Friday and we're excited


---------132:44----------
and I think hopefully we've got some


---------132:46----------
more stuff coming up so Friday will be a


---------132:48----------
long stream it'll be a little bit more

---------132:51----------

---------132:52----------
that too a chat


---------132:55----------
for those of you who have seen the thing


---------132:57----------
that was were there for what has been


---------132:58----------
scrubbed from the internet when like


---------133:01----------
7,000 people swarm into discord and


---------133:04----------
someone realizes that they can be a


---------133:06----------
troll and and I mean I don't I can't


---------133:08----------
really blame you for that because I was


---------133:10----------
laughing on the inside but please don't


---------133:12----------
do it again can we be clear about that


---------133:14----------
like don't do that again and also I can


---------133:17----------

---------133:19----------

---------133:21----------

---------133:24----------

---------133:28----------
yeah that's life so thank you guys very


---------133:31----------
much I'm gonna go ahead and sign off


---------133:32----------
today because I've got an appointment in


---------133:35----------
about 20 minutes and love you guys you


---------133:38----------

---------133:39----------
coming I'm gonna take next week I'm


---------133:41----------
gonna stream and stuff but I'm not


---------133:43----------
having any of my clinical appointments


---------133:45----------
and stuff and I'm gonna focus on


---------133:46----------
building stuff for y'all because people


---------133:49----------
have asked me for things so I'm gonna


---------133:50----------
just take a week off where I'm gonna


---------133:52----------
like write and work on my books and


---------133:54----------
maybe make webinars and all that kind of


---------133:56----------
stuff we've got webinars and stuff


---------133:58----------
planned the other thing is that you guys


---------133:59----------
can pop on our discord if you guys want


---------134:01----------
a goal added to this you guys should let


---------134:06----------
me know what that is so you guys can


---------134:07----------
post suggestions and if we're cool with


---------134:09----------
that


---------134:09----------
you know we'll do it we can add those


---------134:12----------
kinds of stretch goals and I think we


---------134:14----------
hit our 9000 which is a stream on lying


---------134:16----------
which will probably be like a bonus


---------134:17----------
stream well I'll talk to you guys about


---------134:19----------
why people lie why we lie why we lie to


---------134:21----------
ourselves how to detect lying and


---------134:23----------
someone else I can't it's not like a


---------134:24----------
machine that doesn't work like that but


---------134:25----------
to understand what goes on in someone's


---------134:28----------
mind when they lie and why they lie and


---------134:30----------
so that for you to be able to you know


---------134:32----------
see if you can see that going on in


---------134:34----------
their mind then you can sort of deduce


---------134:36----------
that they could be lying or maybe lying


---------134:38----------
or probably our line so we'll we'll


---------134:42----------
we'll talk about that


---------134:44----------
so other thoughts you know a little


---------134:46----------
stuff that's a little bit off script is


---------134:47----------
like I was thinking about doing


---------134:48----------
something about sociopathy because a lot


---------134:50----------
of people asked about that or other


---------134:52----------
topics that you guys want me to just


---------134:54----------
kind of talk about we can do that so


---------134:57----------
thank you guys very much


---------134:58----------
and best of luck and stay safe and if


---------135:01----------
you guys are really struggling with


---------135:02----------
something like suicidal suicidality


---------135:03----------
please get help because you


---------135:06----------
deserve it and give us time that's the


---------135:10----------
other thing so what I ask my patients


---------135:12----------
for is time so if you want to kill


---------135:14----------
yourself I'm not gonna disagree that


---------135:16----------
that seems like a good idea to you but


---------135:18----------
give me time let me try to help you and


---------135:21----------
give yourselves time give yourselves


---------135:24----------
time to heal give yourselves time give


---------135:26----------
yourself like time for someone to walk


---------135:28----------
into the bathroom and say hey man


---------135:30----------
there's no fish in the bathtub maybe you


---------135:31----------
should come out to the lake and give


---------135:34----------
yourself time


---------135:35----------
for like things to change and cut


---------135:38----------
yourself some slack and it's not that


---------135:40----------
it's not that you aren't successful it's


---------135:42----------
not that your feelings aren't real it's


---------135:43----------
just that like that's not you being a


---------135:46----------
failure that's us letting you down so


---------135:49----------
give us a chance to help you


---------135:51----------

---------135:54----------
health treatment and give yourself a


---------135:56----------
chance to get better and so suicide
